rings (ClpP) that unfold, translocate, and subsequently degrade client proteins. ClpXP is an important target for drug development against infectious diseases. Although structures are available for isolated ClpX and ClpP rings, it remains unknown how symmetry mismatched ClpX and ClpP work in tandem for processive substrate translocation into the ClpP proteolytic chamber. Here, we present cryo-EM structures of the substrate-bound ClpXP complex from <italic>Neisseria meningitidis</italic> at 2.3 to 3.3 Å resolution. The structures allow development of a model in which the sequential hydrolysis of ATP is coupled to motions of ClpX loops that lead to directional substrate translocation and ClpX rotation relative to ClpP. Our data add to the growing body of evidence that AAA+ molecular machines generate translocating forces by a common mechanism.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>AAA+</kwd><kwd>protease</kwd><kwd>CryoEM</kwd><kwd>protein degradation</kwd><kwd><italic>N. meningitidis</italic></kwd><kwd>ClpXP</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Other</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000024</institution-id><institution>Canadian Institutes of Health Research</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>FDN-503573</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kay</surname><given-names>Lewis E</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000024</institution-id><institution>Canadian Institutes of Health Research</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>PJT-162186</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Rubinstein</surname><given-names>John L</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000024</institution-id><institution>Canadian Institutes of Health Research</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>PJT-148564</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Houry</surname><given-names>Walid A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000024</institution-id><institution>Canadian Institutes of Health Research</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ripstein</surname><given-names>Zev A</given-names></name><name><surname>Vahidi</surname><given-names>Siavash</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001804</institution-id><institution>Canada Research Chairs</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kay</surname><given-names>Lewis E</given-names></name><name><surname>Rubinstein</surname><given-names>John L</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Understanding of bacterial protein degradation is illuminated by cryo-EM structures of the substrate-bound ClpXP complex from <italic>Neisseria meningitidis</italic> at 2.3 to 3.3 Å resolution.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Protein degradation plays a central role in cellular physiology, regulating the timing of cell division, controlling stress responses, and ensuring the timely removal of damaged or aberrantly folded proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Olivares et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Goldberg, 2003</xref>). The ClpXP system is central to protein degradation in bacteria and in mitochondria, where it has recently emerged as a therapeutic target against malignancies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Ishizawa et al., 2019</xref>), and is a key regulator of cellular homeostasis, pathogenesis, and intracellular parasitism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Frees et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Pickart and Cohen, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bhandari et al., 2018</xref>). It also serves as a model for understanding the structure and function of other ATP-dependant proteolytic systems. The ClpXP holoenzyme is composed of a hexameric AAA+ (ATPases Associated with diverse cellular Activities) unfoldase (ClpX) and a tetradecameric serine protease consisting of two heptameric rings (ClpP). Together, the ClpXP complex acts to unfold and degrade protein substrates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Baker and Sauer, 2012</xref>).

Early negative-stain electron microscopy showed that one or two ClpX particles can bind co-axially to ClpP, creating a continuous central channel for substrates from ClpX to the degradation chamber of ClpP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Ortega et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Ortega et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Kessel et al., 1995</xref>). Biochemical and X-ray crystallographic studies show that the axial entrances to the degradation chamber are gated by flexible N-terminal loops of ClpP that open upon the binding of ClpX or ADEPs, allowing substrates into the degradation chamber (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Lee et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Li et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Effantin et al., 2010</xref>). Binding of ClpX and ClpP is mediated by loops containing an Ile/Leu-Gly-Phe motif (I/LGF loops) on ClpX that dock into hydrophobic pockets on the apical interfaces of ClpP subunit pairs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Kim et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Joshi et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Amor et al., 2019</xref>). N-terminal loops on ClpP also transiently interact with ClpX (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Joshi et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Gribun et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Jennings et al., 2008</xref>). However, the precise nature of these interactions and how they allow coordination of the activities of ClpX and ClpP remains unclear.</p><p>ClpX uses energy released by ATP hydrolysis to create a pulling force that unravels folded protein domains for translocation into the degradation chamber of ClpP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Baker and Sauer, 2012</xref>). This unfolding activity relies on a series of conserved loops in ClpX. These loops include the ‘RKH’ loops that surround the ClpX entrance pore and recognize substrates for proteolysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Martin et al., 2008a</xref>), and a pair of ‘pore loops’ in each protomer, termed pore-1 loop (GYVG in <italic>Neisseria meningitidis</italic> ClpX, NmClpX) and pore-2 loop (RDV in NmClpX) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>) that line the axial channel of the ClpX ring (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Martin et al., 2008b</xref>). Bulky aromatic and aliphatic side chains of the pore loops transmit the pulling force to the substrate, leading to its unfolding. The mechanism by which some AAA+ ATPases convert energy from ATP hydrolysis into a mechanical force that unfolds substrates was established recently (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Monroe et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Yu et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">De la Peña et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Shin et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Ripstein et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Gates et al., 2017</xref>), and structures of ClpP and ClpX in isolation have been determined (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Ishizawa et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Li et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Geiger et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Glynn et al., 2009</xref>). However, the absence of structures showing ClpXP in the process of unfolding substrate has prevented an understanding of the conformational changes that are necessary for substrate engagement, unfolding, and translocation in this system. ClpXP must undergo hundreds of ATP hydrolysis events to unfold and degrade a single protein, likely via a process involving hydrolysis of one nucleotide at a time, but the lack of structural information for a ClpXP holoenzyme has limited understanding of how unfolding and degradation are coupled. For example, it is not clear how the symmetry mismatch (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bewley et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Beuron et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Majumder et al., 2019</xref>) between the pseudo-symmetric hexameric ClpX and the seven-fold symmetric ClpP affects both the binding and interaction of these two components.</p><p>Here, we present cryo-EM structures of the ClpXP holoenzyme from the gram-negative pathogen <italic>Neisseria meningitidis</italic> engaged with a protein substrate. The ClpXP portion of the structure is at 2.3 to 3.3 Å resolution, allowing construction of a nearly complete atomic model of the complex. Our findings show how ClpX grips and translocates substrates into the degradation chamber through a cycle of ATP hydrolysis events involving both concerted motions of pore loops along the substrate, as well as motions of ClpX on the apical surface of ClpP. The data lead to a model for interactions between symmetry-mismatched ClpX and ClpP that enable continuous degradation of substrates as ClpX rotates relative to ClpP.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>ATP-dependent binding and degradation of GFP-SsrA by ClpXP</title><p>ClpX and ClpP from <italic>N. meningitidis</italic> (Nm) were expressed separately in <italic>E. coli</italic> before purification with metal affinity chromatography and size exclusion chromatography (SEC). Degradation assays using green fluorescent protein bearing an eleven-residue SsrA tag (GFP-SsrA) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Ripstein et al., 2017</xref>) were performed to ensure that the heterologously expressed NmClpX and NmClpP proteins, when mixed, have the well-established activity of the ClpXP holoenzyme. The presence of ClpP or ClpX alone led to no loss of GFP-SsrA fluorescence relative to background bleaching in the GFP-alone control assay. ClpX, ClpP, and ATP were all necessary to degrade GFP-SsrA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>), confirming that degradation of GFP-SsrA by ClpXP is ATP-dependent. As shown below and in previous work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Joshi et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Hersch et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Grimaud et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Jones et al., 1998</xref>), the presence of MgATP is required for tight binding between ClpX and ClpP. Therefore, for further structural studies, an E185Q Walker B mutant of NmClpX (ClpX-WB) was used to slow ATP hydrolysis and prolong the lifetime of the ClpXP complex. SEC was performed to probe the oligomeric state of each component and the formation of the holoenzyme, confirming that ClpP behaves as an oligomeric species, consistent with its well-known tetradecameric architecture (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref> – blue trace). ClpX-WB eluted as a hexamer in the presence of 2 mM MgATP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref> – green trace). Incubation of ClpX-WB and ClpP in the presence of MgATP resulted in a pair of higher molecular weight SEC peaks that contain both ClpX and ClpP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref> – red trace and SDS-PAGE gel insert), presumably corresponding to singly and doubly capped ClpXP complexes, showing that the <italic>N. meningitidis</italic> ClpX:ClpP complex can be readily reconstituted in vitro.</p><p>To isolate a substrate-bound holoenzyme, ClpXP was incubated with GFP-SsrA in the presence of MgATP.

Visual inspection of the micrographs, as well as 2D classification of particle images, showed doubly capped complexes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>). However, 2D classification showed multiple classes where the two ClpX rings have lower density than the ClpP region, and other classes with one ClpX ring having strong density and the other having weak density. An <italic>ab initio</italic> 3D map showed ClpP along with strong density for one ClpX ring and only weak and fragmented density for the other (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2C</xref>). Inspection of the map revealed that the ClpX ring is offset and tilted relative to the ClpP symmetry axis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>, <xref ref-type="video" rid="video1">Video 1</xref>). The poor density for the second ClpX hexamer is likely due to a lack of correlation between binding offsets of the two ClpX rings that leads to incoherent averaging of one of the ClpX rings in the map. The map of the intact complex was refined to an overall resolution of 2.8 Å (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2C</xref>); however, the density for the better-resolved ClpX ring remained fragmented. Further local refinement and classification in cryoSPARC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Punjani et al., 2017</xref>) improved the density for ClpX and revealed two distinct conformations, at 3.3 Å and 2.9 Å resolution (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>), hereafter referred to as Conformations A and B, respectively.

Nevertheless, a continuous channel for substrate spans the ClpX and ClpP rings.

Even though the full-length constructs of ClpX included the zinc binding domains (residues 1–62), no density was found for these domains in either conformation, likely due to their flexibility.</p><p>Conformations A and B of ClpX both contained additional density along their axial channels, adjacent to the pore loops, likely from the GFP-SsrA substrate that co-eluted with ClpXP from the SEC column (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E and F</xref> - orange) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref>). As the Walker B mutant has low unfolding activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Martin et al., 2008c</xref>), the density observed likely corresponds to the unstructured region of the degron tag. The substrate enters ClpX at an angle of ~15° relative to the ClpP symmetry axis and is gripped by five of the six ClpX protomers arranged in a right-handed spiral, akin to other AAA+ ATPases in their substrate-bound conformations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Monroe et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Yu et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">De la Peña et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Shin et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Ripstein et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Gates et al., 2017</xref>).

The ClpX residues immediately following where the IGF loops contact ClpP (residues 275–280) show weak or no density, likely indicating flexibility. This property allows the IGF loops to accommodate movement of the ClpX protomers relative to ClpP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D–F</xref>), analogous to a set of springs. For instance, in Conformation A the X1 protomer is closer to the ClpP surface than in Conformation B and its IGF loop is thus compact in this state. In contrast, in Conformation B the loop is fully extended, allowing the X1 protomer to reach upwards toward the top of the spiral to engage the substrate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). In this way, the flexibility of the IGF loops accommodates the spiral arrangement of ClpX necessary to bind and unfold substrate, while maintaining contact with the planar ring of ClpP. Additionally, the IGF loops allow the X2 protomer to move laterally away from the ClpP pore while the X4 and X5 protomers move toward it to form a structure in which the ClpP and ClpX rings are displaced with respect to each other (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>-red arrow; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>ClpP N-terminal gates</title><p>Degradation assays (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Effantin et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Gribun et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Martin et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Ortega et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Singh et al., 2000</xref>) show that ClpX allows substrate access to the degradation chamber of ClpP, suggesting that ClpX binding opens the N-terminal gates of ClpP. Indeed, in both Conformations A and B the gates are in the ‘up’ state, forming ordered β-hairpins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>). These β-hairpins closely resemble the conformation seen in the ADEP-bound structures of NmClpP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Goodreid et al., 2016</xref>) and are notably different from the disordered conformations observed in NmClpP when it is not bound to either ClpX or ADEP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2B</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Mabanglo et al., 2019</xref>). By forming ordered gates, ClpX binding creates a wide entrance pore with a diameter of ~23 Å for substrates to pass through into the ClpP degradation chamber (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G</xref>, left; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>). While it has long been suspected that the activating mechanism of ADEPs involves a disorder-to-order transition of these gates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Li et al., 2010</xref>), this observation provides direct evidence that ClpX binding has the same effect.</p><p>In both Conformations A and B, the rigidification of the ClpP N-terminal gates varies substantially between protomers. At one extreme, the N-terminal residues of the ClpP protomer that is not bound to an IGF loop have the weakest density, appearing to possess the most flexibility at the top of the β-hairpin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G</xref> center; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2E</xref>). In contrast, the N-terminal residues of the ClpP protomer proximal to the X5 ClpX protomer, are held rigidly through contacts with the ATPase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G</xref> right). This interaction is mediated by a pair of α-helices from protomer X5 (residues 254–262 and 291–296) adjacent to the IGF loop, and by another X5 α-helix that precedes the pore-2 loop (residues 186–192). The three α-helices stabilize the β-hairpin structure of the ClpP N-terminal residues by interacting with Arg17 at the top of the hairpin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref> inset). These interactions are unique for the X5 protomer due to the lateral displacement of the ClpX ring relative to the axial pore of ClpP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>), with the X2 protomer shifted furthest from the pore while the X5 protomer is pulled overtop of the pore (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D and F</xref>). Even without interacting directly with ClpX, the remaining five ClpP protomers have nearly rigid N-terminal gates, with reduced density only for residues located in the turn of the β-hairpin that likely reflects increased flexibility in this region (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2F</xref>). Gate rigidification therefore appears to be mediated by an allosteric effect when IGF loops engage their respective ClpP binding pockets, akin to the effect observed upon ADEP binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Gersch et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Li et al., 2010</xref>). In the ClpXP complex with substrate bound, only a single ClpX protomer (X5) interacts directly with a single ClpP gate at any given time. The mechanism of substrate translocation described below involves movement of the ClpX ring on the apical surface of ClpP, with each ClpX protomer forming contacts with a ClpP gate as translocation proceeds.</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>Substrate engagement by ClpX</title><p>ClpX fits neatly into the emerging consensus for how AAA+ unfoldases engage substrate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Monroe et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Yu et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">De la Peña et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Shin et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Ripstein et al., 2017</xref>). In both Conformations A and B, five of the six pore-1 loops of ClpX interact tightly with the substrate backbone, with Tyr153 forming the majority of the interface (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A and B</xref>). These protomers generate a right-handed spiral that wraps around an 8 to 10 residue stretch of the substrate along the central channel of ClpX (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C and D</xref>). In Conformation A, the X1 pore-1 loop in the US orientation is disengaged, with the X2 protomer at the top of the spiral.

The spiral terminates with the X6 pore-1 loop that is engaged with the substrate closest to the ClpP apical surface (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>).

When transitioning between substrate-engaged and disengaged states, the X6 pore-1 loop undergoes a large conformational change (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>). As it disengages the substrate the ‘lasso’ fold (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>, left) that allows Tyr153 and Val154 of pore-1 to point toward the substrate is replaced by a short α-helix immediately following the GYVG motif of the loop.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig3" position="float"><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>Substrate engagement by the ClpX pore loops.</title><p>(<bold>A and B</bold>) Pore-1 loop residues grip the substrate, as observed in this view looking down the axial channel.

Structures of a variety of different AAA+ rings with substrates have emerged in the past several years (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Monroe et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Yu et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">De la Peña et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Shin et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Ripstein et al., 2017</xref>), providing a description of how these ATP-dependent molecular machines unfold substrates. In addition, methyl-TROSY NMR studies of a VAT-substrate complex provided atomic-level insights into structural changes associated with the substrate as it is pulled into the lumen of the unfoldase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Augustyniak and Kay, 2018</xref>). Nevertheless, a detailed understanding of how a pair of symmetry mismatched ClpP/ClpX rings can work in tandem to unfold, translocate, and subsequently degrade substrate in a processive manner has remained elusive. Our structural data suggest a translocation mechanism that can be explained in terms of a pair of conformers, denoted as Conformations A and B here, that represent two steps along the substrate translocation pathway (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>). To aid in the following discussion, we have color-coded the ClpX protomers and refer to them with their X1 - X6 labels. As we will discuss, each of these protomers will cycle between all six protomer positions along the spiral, including, among others, a state primed to hydrolyze ATP (denoted as ATP*) as well as the LS and US positions. This cycling is linked to ATP hydrolysis, to the attachment position of ClpX pore-loops along the substrate, and to the interaction of ClpX IGF loops with ClpP. We begin our discussion of the unfolding/translocation cycle with the X1 protomer in Conformation A in the US position, detached from substrate and bridging the lowest and highest positions of the ClpX spiral. Both X1 and X6 protomers are ADP-bound, while the remaining protomers are in ATP-bound states. In Conformation B, X1 moves to the highest position of the spiral with respect to substrate (compare <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>, top and bottom panels) simultaneously exchanging ADP for ATP in its nucleotide-binding pocket (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>). This transition brings X1 into close proximity with X2 and allows engagement of X1’s pore loops with substrate. The X1 pore-l loop now sits at the top of the spiral, two substrate residues above the X2 pore loop (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A and B</xref>), thereby translocating additional residues of substrate into the unfoldase. This transition also leads to release of substrate by X6, which pivots away from the central pore to adopt the LS position (second ring, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>). ATP hydrolysis and phosphate release by X5, which was in the ATP-hydrolysis primed ATP* state, restores the ClpX spiral back to the Conformation A state, (third ring of the four in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>), with X6 now assuming the US position. The complex is thus reset so that it can take another step along the substrate during the next A to B transition (third ring to fourth ring in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>). The cumulative effect of these transitions is a cycling of ClpX protomers through different positions on the spiral (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A and B</xref>). For example, the protomer initially in the US position (X1 in our discussion) will, with each step, move along the spiral such that it transitions from the US position to the top of the spiral (Conformation B) and then successively moving to lower spiral positions, through the ATP* state and finally the LS position, as substrate is translocated. Each Conformation A→Conformation B→Conformation A step results in the exchange of ADP for ATP and a single ATP hydrolysis event. Continuous repetition of these steps leads to a processive ‘hand-over-hand’ translocation of substrate through the axial pore of ClpX into ClpP (Illustrated in <xref ref-type="video" rid="video2">Video 2</xref>).</p><fig id="fig5" position="float"><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><title>Translocation model for ClpXP.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Schematic of the ClpX-nucleotide-dependent conformational cycle. The transition from Conformation A to Conformation B is mediated through nucleotide exchange in the US position (1st to 2nd ring), with ATP hydrolysis and phosphate release in the ATP* position restoring the A conformation from the B state (2nd to 3rd ring) so that the cycle can repeat. In the new Conformation A (3rd ring), protomer X6 (yellow) adopts the US conformation and the X1 protomer (previous US) moves to the top of the spiral. In this way each protomer of the complex cycles through all positions as ATP is hydrolyzed in successively new ATP* protomer states, requiring the hydrolysis of seven ATPs. (<bold>B</bold>) Hand-over-hand mechanism of pore-loop mediated translocation. In the first A to B transition depicted in (A) X1 (US protomer) reengages at the top of the spiral and the LS pore one loop (X6 in Conformation B) disengages from the bottom of the spiral. As this is repeated the pore loops move ‘up’ the substrate and pull it into the degradation chamber. (<bold>C</bold>) IGF loop movements accompanying the hand-over-hand movements of ClpX. Shown in the small circles are the seven IGF-loop-binding sites in ClpP with a ‘+’ sign indicating engagement with an IGF loop of a given ClpX protomer. The binding sites are color coded according to the color of the protomer that interacts with the corresponding site. In conformation A, the IGF loop of X6 is unbound or only weakly bound, while in Conformation B it is bound. A new Conformation A is generated when the IGF loop from the ATP* protomer unbinds. It subsequently reengages with ClpP in a new Conformation B (third and fourth rings in (<bold>A</bold>)). In this way, the IGF loops ‘step’ around the ClpP ring, with each complete rotation requiring the hydrolysis of seven ATPs. (<bold>D</bold>) Schematic of the ClpX-ClpP interactions during seven ATP hydrolysis steps that lead to a net rotation of ClpX protomers by 60<sup>o</sup>. Because of the six- to seven-fold symmetry mismatch a total of forty-two ATPs must be hydrolyzed to return the protomers back to their original starting positions in the cycle (i.e. ring 1). Each of the seven ring structures corresponds to Conformation A, with the red arrows indicating the subsequent step of the IGF loop of the ATP* protomer along the cycle.

If the spiral position of each ClpX protomer was independent of IGF binding, alignment of the asymmetric ClpX spiral would lead to averaging of the IGF loops into all the pockets of ClpP during cryo-EM map refinement. However, our structures clearly show an empty IGF pocket on ClpP <italic>only</italic> between the ATP* and LS positions of Conformation B (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>), suggesting that this pocket must undergo a ‘cycle’ as well (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>). Thus, following ATP hydrolysis and phosphate release, the IGF loop of the protomer in the ATP* position (X5 initially) must leave its engaged pocket and move to bind the adjacent empty site on ClpP (red arrows in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>), as the complex transitions back to Conformation A (third ring in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>). In this state, the IGF loop appears not to have assumed a structure that allows for tight binding as only weak density is observed for it in EM maps. In contrast, strong binding is observed for this loop in Conformation B (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>). Consistent with this model, the IGF loop of the X5 protomer has an ‘extended/stretched’ structure in the ATP* position of Conformation B (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>), which likely causes strain and facilitates loop release and subsequent binding to the corresponding site on the adjacent ClpP protomer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>). After seven IGF loop release and reengagement events, accompanied by seven ATP hydrolysis steps, the ‘empty’ ClpP binding site makes a complete cycle, returning to its starting position (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>). The accompanying motion of ClpX on the apical surface of ClpP for a given IGF loop transition is complex and subtle, yet seven of these transitions lead to a net 60° rotation of ClpX with respect to ClpP (note the positions of the purple ClpX protomer in the first and seventh panels in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>; <xref ref-type="video" rid="video3">Video 3</xref>). The model described above is the simplest one that is consistent with our data. While our structures suggest that a sequential hydrolysis model exists for ClpXP, more complicated models can be envisioned that require additional states for which we have no experimental data. Indeed biochemical evidence suggests the possibility that when one or more subunits are catalytically deficient a more complex mechanism may be operational, allowing ClpXP to deviate from a strictly sequential hydrolysis scheme (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Martin et al., 2008b</xref>).</p><media id="video3" mime-subtype="mp4" mimetype="video" xlink:href="elife-52158-video3.mp4"><label>Video 3.</label><caption><title>ClpX precession on the ClpP apical surface.</title><p>Repeated interpolation between states reveals a precession of the ClpX ring as its IGF loops are placed successively in different ClpP binding sites.

While density maps and atomic models are not available for direct comparison with the NmClpXP, a few important similarities and differences are notable. In all species, the ClpX ring appears to adopt a similar offset relative to the symmetry axis of ClpP, indicating that the general architecture of the ClpXP machinery is conserved. Notably, however, the N-terminal apical loops of <italic>L. monocytogenes</italic> ClpP are not rigidified upon ClpX binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Gatsogiannis et al., 2019</xref>), in contrast to the observation here that the gates rigidify upon binding to create a pore for substrate entry.

Despite the presence of the zinc-binding domains in our <italic>N. meningitidis</italic> construct, no such dimers were observed. While this difference may be due to differences across species, we note that the glutaraldehyde chemical crosslinker used to stabilize the <italic>L. monocytogenes</italic> ClpXP complex may have induced the formation of artefactual dimers.</p><p>Notably, substrate engagement is different between the ClpXP from <italic>N. meningitidis</italic> described here and from <italic>E. coli</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Fei et al., 2019</xref>). In Conformation A seen with <italic>N. meningitidis</italic>, there is no engagement of substrate by any of the six pore-2 or six RKH loops, while in Conformation B only a single RKH loop and a single pore-2 loop contact substrate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D and F</xref>). This observation is in contrast to the recently reported <italic>E. coli</italic> ClpXP structures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Fei et al., 2019</xref>) in which arginines located in the pore-2 loop from three to five different protomers (depending on the structure), as well as multiple RKH loops, form major contacts with substrate. The differences in these interactions may reflect the fact that while pore-1 loop and RKH loop motifs are critical for forming interactions with substrate, and in the case of pore-1 loops in particular, in providing the force for translocation, additional contacts may differ between species and may be necessary for recognition of degradation signals and for substrate specificity. The RKH loops are essential for the recognition of SsrA-tagged substrates by <italic>E. coli</italic> ClpX, while human ClpX, which substitutes the RKH sequence with an RKL tripeptide and contains pore-1 loops with the same sequence as <italic>E. coli</italic> ClpX, fails to recognize substrates with the SsrA-tag. Notably, however, an engineered human construct bearing the pore-2 and RKH loops of <italic>E. coli</italic> ClpX is able to unfold SsrA-tagged substrates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Farrell et al., 2007</xref>). Reordering of RKH loop residues to KHR and KRH results in significantly impaired substrate degradation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Fei et al., 2019</xref>) and a more disrupting AAA mutant does not support ClpP degradation of a SsrA-tagged substrate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Fei et al., 2019</xref>). Furthermore, the single point mutation RKH to RKA results in loss of activity for both SsrA and λO tagged substrates. The tight contact between H230 and the substrate in our maps provides a structural basis for understanding these mutagenesis results.</p><p>Although in the ClpXP structures from <italic>E. coli</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Fei et al., 2019</xref>) the ClpX ring adopts the same spiral staircase arrangement observed in many AAA+ ATPases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Monroe et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Yu et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">De la Peña et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Shin et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Ripstein et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Enemark and Joshua-Tor, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Huang et al., 2016</xref>), strongly supporting the ‘hand-over-hand’ mechanism of substrate translocation, the authors of this work instead posit a stochastic mechanism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Fei et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Martin et al., 2005</xref>) for the HCLR clade of ATPases based on the observation of only a single bound ADP in their structures. In the stochastic model, only a single protomer pulls the substrate, via a state that has yet to be observed. Such a model, involving stochastic nucleotide hydrolysis, appears inconsistent with the observations here, with those for the related Lon protease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Shin et al., 2019</xref>) where two neighboring protomers are bound with ADP, and with a recent structural model for a substrate-bound <italic>E. coli</italic> ClpAP complex showing that the unbinding and rebinding of flexible IGL loops is coupled to substrate translocation as each protomer makes its way from the bottom to the top of the spiral (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Lopez et al., 2019</xref>). The proposed mechanism in that case is similar to the one suggested here for <italic>N. meningitides</italic> ClpXP. The identification of two conformations in the <italic>N. meningitidis</italic> enzyme and observations of the bound nucleotides in each ClpX protomer leads to a simple model of cyclic hydrolysis that, in turn, results in unidirectional substrate translocation. In this model, the substrate is always gripped by multiple protomers, with only a single protomer disengaged as it traverses from the bottom to the top of the spiral. While unique features will undoubtedly continue to emerge regarding subtle functional aspects of different AAA+ unfoldases it is likely that the translocating forces generated by these molecular machines are based on a common mechanism.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th>Reagent type <break/>(species) or resource</th><th>Designation</th><th>Source or reference</th><th>Identifiers</th><th>Additional <break/>information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Gene (<italic>Neisseria meningitidis</italic>)</td><td>clpX</td><td/><td>UniProtKB - Q9JYY3</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Gene (<italic>Neisseria meningitidis</italic>)</td><td>clpP</td><td/><td>UniProtKB - Q9JZ38</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Strain, strain background (<italic>Escherichia coli</italic>)</td><td valign="top">BL21(DE3)</td><td valign="top">Sigma-Aldrich</td><td valign="top">CMC0016</td><td valign="top">Chemically competent cells</td></tr><tr><td>Recombinant DNA reagent</td><td>pET28-NmClpP</td><td>Synthetic <break/>(GenScript)</td><td>UniProtKB - Q9JYY3</td><td>Plasmid containing ClpP</td></tr><tr><td>Recombinant DNA reagent</td><td>pET28a-NmClpX</td><td>Synthetic <break/>(GenScript)</td><td>UniProtKB - Q9JZ38</td><td>Plasmid containing ClpX</td></tr><tr><td>Recombinant DNA reagent</td><td>pET28a- <break/>GFP-SsrA</td><td>(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Ripstein et al., 2017</xref>)</td><td/><td>Plasmid containing GFP-SsrA</td></tr><tr><td>Chemical compound, drug</td><td>PKM-AMC</td><td>GenScript</td><td/><td>Fluorogenic peptide for protease assays</td></tr><tr><td>Software, algorithm</td><td><italic>EPU</italic></td><td>Thermo Fischer Scientific</td><td/><td>EM imaging software</td></tr><tr><td>Software, algorithm</td><td><italic>cryoSPARC</italic> v2</td><td>(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Punjani et al., 2017</xref>)</td><td>RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/SCR_016501">SCR_016501</ext-link></td><td>EM reconstruction software</td></tr><tr><td>Software, algorithm</td><td>UCSF Chimera</td><td>(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Pettersen et al., 2004</xref>)</td><td>RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/SCR_004097">SCR_004097</ext-link></td><td>Molecular Visualization <break/>Software</td></tr><tr><td>Software, algorithm</td><td>UCSF ChimeraX</td><td>(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Goddard et al., 2018</xref>)</td><td>RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/SCR_015872">SCR_015872</ext-link></td><td>Molecular Visualization <break/>Software</td></tr><tr><td>Software, algorithm</td><td><italic>Coot</italic></td><td>(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Emsley and Cowtan, 2004</xref>)</td><td>RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/SCR_014222">SCR_014222</ext-link></td><td>Protein Model Building Software</td></tr><tr><td>Software, algorithm</td><td>Phyre2</td><td>(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Kelley et al., 2015</xref>)</td><td>RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/SCR_010270">SCR_010270</ext-link></td><td>Protein Model Building Software</td></tr><tr><td>Software, algorithm</td><td>Rosetta</td><td>(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Wang et al., 2015</xref>)</td><td>RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/SCR_015701">SCR_015701</ext-link></td><td>Protein Model Building Software</td></tr><tr><td>Software, algorithm</td><td>Phenix</td><td>(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Adams et al., 2010</xref>)</td><td>RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/SCR_014224">SCR_014224</ext-link></td><td>Protein Model Building Software</td></tr><tr><td>Software, algorithm</td><td>Molprobity</td><td>(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Arendall III et al., 2010</xref>)</td><td>RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/SCR_014226">SCR_014226</ext-link></td><td>Protein Model Evaluation Software</td></tr><tr><td>Software, algorithm</td><td>EMRinger</td><td>(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Barad et al., 2015</xref>)</td><td/><td>Protein Model Evaluation Software</td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap><sec id="s4-1"><title>Plasmids and constructs </title><p>Codon-optimized genes encoding NmClpX (Uniprot entry: Q9JYY3) bearing an N-terminal His<sub>6</sub>-TEV affinity tag and ClpP (Uniprot entry: Q9JZ38) with an N-terminal His<sub>6</sub>-SUMO tag were synthesized by GenScript (Piscataway, NJ) and cloned into the NdeI and BamHI sites of pET28a+ (Novagen, Madison, WI).

Refinement of these particle images with C1 symmetry resulted in a map of the ClpXP complex at a nominal resolution of 2.8 Å, but with poorly defined density for much of ClpX. To improve the interpretability of the map in the ClpX region, local refinement was performed with a mask around the six ClpX subunits without performing signal subtraction for ClpP. This refinement greatly improved the map in the ClpX region, while blurring the density at the distal ClpP ring (indicative of flexibility between ClpX and ClpP). However, density for two of the ClpX subunits remained fragmented and at lower resolution. To help resolve the heterogeneity of this region ‘3D variability analysis’ was performed, which utilizes principle component analysis to separate conformations. Clustering was performed along three eigenvectors. Two clusters were identified along a single eigenvector corresponding to two conformations of ClpX bound to substrate.

responses.</p></boxed-text><p><bold>Acceptance summary:</bold></p><p>Bacterial ClpXP is an ATP-fueled chambered protease, akin to the 26S proteasome in eukaryotic cells. ClpXP consists of a hexameric AAA+ unfoldase (ClpX) that recognizes, unfolds, and threads SsrA-tagged substrates into the tetradecameric ClpP barrel composed of two heptameric rings, where substrates are degraded. Ripstein et al. now reports the cryo-EM structure of the ClpXP protease from <italic>Neisseria meningitidis</italic> engaged with the model substrate, GFP-SsrA. This study reveals two distinct conformations (termed A and B), at relatively high resolution. These structures are consistent with a sequential mechanism of substrate translocation, although the structures do not rule out other possibilities. Moreover, the structures suggest how a symmetry mismatch between ClpX and ClpP may contribute to the overall mechanism.</p><p><bold>Decision letter after peer review:</bold></p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;A processive rotary mechanism couples substrate unfolding and proteolysis in the ClpXP degradation machinery&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and John Kuriyan as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Gabriel C Lander (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) It is mentioned that the E185Q Walker mutant was used for the structural studies to slow hydrolysis (Results paragraph one, but not mentioned in the Materials and methods). Was this mutant used for the functional studies (Figure 1) as well? In any case, how &quot;slow&quot; is this mutant? What fraction of the substrates will be unfolded within 10 mins, i.e., the time before flash freezing the samples?</p><p>2) All residues of substrate for both conformations (A and B) are modelled as alanine, but they do not clearly match the corresponding density maps. Please comment and discuss.</p><p>3) The lack of clear density for the sidechains of the substrate (or density of the substrate outside the ClpXP holoenzyme) for the two makes it difficult to uniquely correlate the two observed conformations of ClpXP with two different &quot;translocation&quot; states of the substrate. Although the model (Figure 5) is reasonable, the two structures presented in this study do not necessarily rule out other possibilities.</p><p>4) For conformation A, the resolution for the two promoters at either side of the seam is substantially lower (Figure 4—figure supplement 2) than the rest of the structure. Can one be sure that it is actually ADP bound to these protomers in conformation A? It could also be a resolution effect. Moreover, density for not only the nucleotide, but the surrounding regions should be included for all binding pockets.</p><p>5) Density for Mg<sup>2+</sup> is mentioned, but the figure that is provided (Figure 4) shows the density at only one contour level, such that the putative Mg<sup>2+</sup> density is merged with the density of the nucleotide. Two different contour levels should be shown. In any case, the &quot;resolution&quot; of the Mg<sup>2+</sup> density does not seem to be as high as some of the sidechain densities shown and certainly not as high as estimated from the FSC. Please comment and discuss. Also, some the Mg<sup>2+</sup> may not be properly modeled since they appear outside of density.</p><p>6) The present work represents the third cryoEM structure of the ClpXP protease and is preceded by the recent publication of <italic>Listeria monocytogenes</italic> ClpXP (Gatsogiannis et al., NSMB 2019). Contrary to the previous work, the structure by Ripstein et al. is of much higher resolution (2.3A vs ~4A), providing more accurate mechanistic insight. Perhaps most surprisingly, Gatsogiannis et al. reported the existence of unusual head-to-head ClpXP dimers that were the prevalent specimen in their cryoEM sample. Whether head-to-head dimers are artifactual or physiological is currently unclear. However, it seems appropriate to compare and comment on the previously published structures and to discern why such head-to-head dimers were not observed in the present study since full-length ClpX was also used here.</p><p>7) In the present structure, five of the six pore loops interact tightly with the substrate backbone supporting a processive substrate handover between neighboring subunits. This is somewhat unexpected as it is widely presumed that ClpX threads substrates stochastically. For instance, using a covalently linked ClpX hexamer, the Sauer and Baker groups showed that only one active ClpX subunit is sufficient for function. How can the present structures be reconciled with the wealth of biochemical and genetic data in the literature supporting a probabilistic mechanism?</p><p>8) To illuminate the structural basis for substrate engagement and threading, the authors used GFP-SsrA, which is more informative than the more commonly used casein that is natively unstructured. However, it is unclear how much of SsrA vs unfolded GFP is seen in the structure. Does GFP remain mostly folded and, if not, what is the structural/mechanical basis for GFP unfolding? The authors ought to comment on this.</p><p>9) The authors propose that the X5 subunit in conformation A contains an ATP molecule that is &quot;primed&quot; for hydrolysis. Lander et al. observed a similar nucleotide binding site environment in the Lon complex, and also proposed this scenario. However, this is incompatible with studies showing that an Arginine finger in trans is required for hydrolysis. The resolution of the reconstruction does not enable the authors to discern between ATP and a post-hydrolysis/long-lived ADP-Pi state that may be induced by the Walker B mutation. Unless the authors are able to posit a reasonable hydrolysis mechanism that explains how hydrolysis could occur in this chemical environment in a manner that satisfies prior observations regarding hydrolysis, this aspect of the mechanism must be reconsidered. This should include a more detailed and quantitative description of the Walker B motif becoming positioned &quot;closer&quot; to the ATP in this subunit.</p><p>10) The nominal resolution of the structure may enable a detailed description of the allostery involved in ClpP gate opening. It is mentioned that the rigidification is similar to that observed upon ADEP binding, but are there any differences observed or previously uncharacterized interactions? A more thorough description with associated figures should be included, as this aspect of the structure is particularly important.</p><p>11) The observed interaction between H230 within the RKH loop and substrate is intriguing and warrants further investigation. Despite all the mutagenesis that's been done on this loop, as far as I know no one has made a single point mutation at this histidine. The strength of the density between the H230 and substrate is indicative of a substantial interaction, the functional significance of which should be probed biochemically.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were suggested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for resubmitting your work entitled &quot;A processive rotary mechanism couples substrate unfolding and proteolysis in the ClpXP degradation machinery&quot; for further consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your revised article has been evaluated favorably by John Kuriyan (Senior Editor) and a Reviewing Editor.</p><p>The manuscript has been improved but there are some remaining issues that need to be addressed before acceptance, as outlined below. Please address these issues in a revised manuscript, using your best judgement. We will make a final decision on the revised manuscript at the editorial level.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic></p><p>I would like to thank the authors for addressing my concerns. I have no further comments and fully support publication in <italic>eLife</italic>.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>The manuscript by Ripstein et al. is substantially improved. The new data shown in Figure 5 addresses concerns regarding the proposed sequential mechanism, and the authors' comment regarding glutaraldehyde crosslinking used by Gatsogiannis et al., 2019 is adequate, although not further substantiated. Few minor issues remain that need clarification.</p><p>1) &quot;The RKH loops are essential for the recognition of SsrA-tagged substrates by <italic>E. coli</italic> ClpX, while human ClpX, which lacks RKH loops loops but contains pore-1 loops with the same sequence as <italic>E. coli</italic> ClpX, fails to recognize substrates with the SsrA-tag.&quot;</p><p>Human ClpX features an RKL tripeptide (residues 401-403) instead of an &quot;RKH motif&quot; at the same position downstream of pore-1 loop. Since human ClpX fails to recognize ssrA-tagged substrates, it would seem that H230 is the main determinant for SsrA substrate binding as pointed out by one reviewer. While there is no reason to doubt the Farrell et al., 2007 findings, the explanation that electrostatic interactions via the charged Lys confer substrate specificity does not seem warranted according to the present structure. This statement needs to be revised.</p><p>2) Abstract: &quot;… cyclical hydrolysis of ATP is coupled to concerted motions of ClpX loops…&quot; This statement can be misleading, especially when the Abstract is read in isolation (e.g. in Pubmed), and should be revised. The authors' concluded that ATP hydrolysis occurs sequentially, but this was not stated in the Abstract. When taken in isolation, concerted motions refer to a third model distinct from the sequential and stochastic model.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic></p><p>I am generally satisfied with the revised manuscript, and the authors have addressed all the points I brought up in my initial review. However, the authors introduce a new experiment (Figure 5), whose results they interpret as evidence of a sequential hydrolysis translocation mechanism. The experiment is nearly identical to one that was published as Figure 1 Martin et al., 2008 (PMID 18223658). The observed curve for GFP degradation has been previously established, and proposed to be unrelated to processivity of translocation due to the fast refolding of destabilized GFP intermediates. Lowering the motor speed enables GFP to refold and escape degradation, and could occur whether ClpX utilizes a probabilistic or sequential ATP hydrolysis mechanism. Further, given that the conformations associated with substrate engagement and commitment are unknown, and that these processing steps could also be perturbed by introducing a single slowly hydrolyzing subunit, one cannot exclude a probabilistic mechanism.</p><p>The manuscript provides many insights into the mechanism of ClpXP substrate processing and that this work will be well-received by the AAA community, but the conclusions regarding sequential hydrolysis are unfounded. I suggest that the experiments and interpretation associated with Figure 5 be removed.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.52158.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) It is mentioned that the E185Q Walker mutant was used for the structural studies to slow hydrolysis (Results paragraph one, but not mentioned in the Materials and methods).

The E185Q Walker B mutant was not used for the functional assays (Figure 1B). We have revised the figure caption to reflect this change:</p><p>“All measurements included GFP-SsrA and were performed in triplicate on WT ClpXP”</p><p>In a new figure, we show that the ATPase rate of the E185Q Walker B mutant of ClpX is ~17 times slower compared to the WT enzyme (Figure 5A). We believe that the substrate density in the maps corresponds to the unstructured region of the SsrA-tag of GFP that has been engaged and slowly translocated. Given the low activity, we believe the fraction of GFP that is unfolded prior to vitrification is negligible. We have clarified the text to reflect this:</p><p>“As the Walker B mutant has low unfolding activity (see below), the observed density likely corresponds to the unstructured region of the degron tag”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) All residues of substrate for both conformations (A and B) are modelled as alanine, but they do not clearly match the corresponding density maps. Please comment and discuss.</p></disp-quote><p>While there is clear density for some bulkier side chains in the map, it was not possible to register the substrate peptide sequence in the density and therefore the substrate has been modeled as polyalanine. The density may correspond to the SsrA tag, although our attempts to fit that sequence into the density were unsuccessful, perhaps because the consensus structure is an average of multiple translocation steps of the SsrA sequence. We have added the following line in the Materials and methods to clarify this situation:</p><p>“While the experimental density for the substrate showed some bulky side chains, attempts to register the SsrA sequence in the density were unsuccessful and the substrate was modeled as polyalanine.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) The lack of clear density for the sidechains of the substrate (or density of the substrate outside the ClpXP holoenzyme) for the two makes it difficult to uniquely correlate the two observed conformations of ClpXP with two different &quot;translocation&quot; states of the substrate. Although the model (Figure 5) is reasonable, the two structures presented in this study do not necessarily rule out other possibilities.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewers that a lack of register for the substrate chain complicates using it as a marker of translocation direction. However, in our proposed model the direction of substrate translocation is <italic>towards</italic> ClpP and is supported by both the nucleotide content of the observed states, and the pore loop positions. We have added new functional assays (Figure 5B – see reviewer comment #7) that further support this model. We do nonetheless accept that there are other possible models and have indicated as such in the text:</p><p>“The model described above is the simplest one that is consistent with our data. More complicated models can be envisioned that require additional states for which we have no experimental data.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) For conformation A, the resolution for the two promoters at either side of the seam is substantially lower (Figure 4—figure supplement 2) than the rest of the structure. Can one be sure that it is actually ADP bound to these protomers in conformation A? It could also be a resolution effect. Moreover, density for not only the nucleotide, but the surrounding regions should be included for all binding pockets.</p></disp-quote><p>While lower resolution near the seam in Conformation A makes the density for nucleotide in the binding pockets at the seam less clear, it is still sufficient to identify the nucleotide state. The ADP state of these pockets is also reinforced by the conformation of the surrounding residues. We have added a figure supplement (Figure 4—figure supplement 3) to show surrounding density as well:</p><p>“Figure 4—figure supplement 3. ATP binding pocket densities. Experimental density maps and models are shown for the ATP binding pockets of all protomers. Two numerical thresholds are shown to highlight differences in density.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) Density for Mg<sup>2+</sup> is mentioned, but the figure that is provided (Figure 4) shows the density at only one contour level, such that the putative Mg<sup>2+</sup> density is merged with the density of the nucleotide. Two different contour levels should be shown. In any case, the &quot;resolution&quot; of the Mg<sup>2+</sup> density does not seem to be as high as some of the sidechain densities shown and certainly not as high as estimated from the FSC. Please comment and discuss. Also, some the Mg<sup>2+</sup> may not be properly modeled since they appear outside of density.</p></disp-quote><p>We have added Figure 4—figure supplement 3 showing the two contour levels for putative Mg<sup>2+</sup> (see reviewer comment #4). We believe that the Mg<sup>2+</sup> density is comparable to other cryo-EM reconstructions at similar estimated resolutions. We have remodelled the Mg<sup>2+</sup> such that it better corresponds to the observed density.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) The present work represents the third cryoEM structure of the ClpXP protease and is preceded by the recent publication of Listeria monocytogenes ClpXP (Gatsogiannis et al., NSMB 2019). Contrary to the previous work, the structure by Ripstein et al. is of much higher resolution (2.3A vs ~4A), providing more accurate mechanistic insight. Perhaps most surprisingly, Gatsogiannis et al. reported the existence of unusual head-to-head ClpXP dimers that were the prevalent specimen in their cryoEM sample. Whether head-to-head dimers are artifactual or physiological is currently unclear. However, it seems appropriate to compare and comment on the previously published structures and to discern why such head-to-head dimers were not observed in the present study since full-length ClpX was also used here.</p></disp-quote><p>We did not observe any head-to-head dimers in any of our preparations. The authors of the <italic>Listeria monocytogenes</italic> ClpXPmanuscript utilized the glutaraldehyde chemical crosslinker in their sample preparation that may have affected the oligomeric state they observed. Our study did not use any crosslinking agent. We have added the following sentence to the Discussion:</p><p>“In the case of <italic>L. monocytogenes</italic> ClpXP, unusual head-to-head dimers were observed that appeared to be mediated by the zinc binding domains. Despite the presence of the zinc binding domains in our <italic>N. meningitidis</italic> construct, no such dimers were observed. While this difference may be due to differences across species, we note that the glutaraldehyde chemical crosslinker used to stabilize the <italic>L. monocytogenes</italic> ClpXP complex may have induced the formation of artefactual dimers.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7) In the present structure, five of the six pore loops interact tightly with the substrate backbone supporting a processive substrate handover between neighboring subunits. This is somewhat unexpected as it is widely presumed that ClpX threads substrates stochastically. For instance, using a covalently linked ClpX hexamer, the Sauer and Baker groups showed that only one active ClpX subunit is sufficient for function. How can the present structures be reconciled with the wealth of biochemical and genetic data in the literature supporting a probabilistic mechanism?</p></disp-quote><p>In an effort to better understand the previously reported linked-hexamer data from the Sauer group in the context of our and many other substrate-bound AAA+ unfoldase structures that support a processive hand-over-hand mechanism, we performed our own mixed hexamer assays (Figure 5B). Here we mix WT and E185Q Walker B protomers of ClpX in different ratios and incubate them overnight so as to generate composite complexes with various protomer types whose exact composition and population can be calculated using combinatorial statistics. GFP-SsrA assays performed on samples described above show that the presence of a single E185Q Walker B protomer in the ClpX hexamer is enough to completely stop the degradation of GFP-SsrA by ClpXP. This further bolsters our processive model and is inconsistent with the previous stochastic model which predicts that unfolding and translocation is possible with just a single active subunit.</p><p>We would also note that in the experiments by the Sauer and Baker groups, the assumption is that the Walker B mutants are “dead”. As we show here (Figure 5A) and as reported by Sauer et. al elsewhere (Martin et al., 2008a), Walker B ClpX exhibits ~17 fold lower ATPase activity compared to the WT enzyme. As such the processivity of these mixed enzymes would be expected to be much lower than a fully WT complex. Furthermore, the substrates used in many of these experiments (e.g. Titin-SsrA, destabilized mutants of Titin-SsrA) have much lower stability compared to the tightly-folded GFP and may only require a few translocation steps to unfold. In the case of unstable or disordered substrates, translocation may take place slower compared to the WT enzyme but would register as “active”. Indeed, in our structures we show that ClpX binds GFP-SsrA (Figure 1—figure supplement 1) and believe that the substrate density in our maps corresponds to the unstructured SsrA tag of GFP which has been slowly translocated by our Walker B ClpX.</p><p>We have added the following text to the manuscript:</p><p>“The arrangement of nucleotides in our map suggests that substrate-bound ClpX hydrolyzes ATP in a sequential manner, contrary to previous reports that ATP hydrolysis by ClpX is a stochastic process (Martin et al., 2005). […] It is inconsistent with the previous stochastic model that predicts that unfolding and translocation are possible with just a single active subunit.”</p><p>And figure caption:</p><p>“Figure 5. A single defective ClpX protomer derails function. (A) ATPase rates for WT ClpX and the E185Q ClpX Walker B mutant. […] This observation contrasts the expected linear decrease (green line) for a stochastic model. (C) Schematic of the molecules produced via mixing.”</p><p>The associated Materials and methods section:</p><p>“…For the mixed protomer ClpX assays, WT ClpX and E185Q ClpX samples were purified separately as described above (i.e. without the addition of any nucleotide) and mixed at the indicated ratios. […] The wells included an ATP-regeneration system that contained 1.5 mM phosphoenolpyruvate, 0.2 mM NADH, 40 μg/mL pyruvate kinase, 40 μg/mL lactate dehydrogenase, and 2 mM MgATP at pH 8.2. Hydrolysis of ATP was monitored by loss of absorption at 340 nm with a Synergy Neo2 96-well microplate reader at 25 °C.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>8) To illuminate the structural basis for substrate engagement and threading, the authors used GFP-SsrA, which is more informative than the more commonly used casein that is natively unstructured. However, it is unclear how much of SsrA vs unfolded GFP is seen in the structure. Does GFP remain mostly folded and, if not, what is the structural/mechanical basis for GFP unfolding? The authors ought to comment on this.</p></disp-quote><p>Based on activity assays done with the E185Q Walker B mutant (see new Figure 5) we believe that GFP remains folded and the portion we observe in the structure corresponds to the C-terminal SsrA tag, which is natively unstructured and has begun to be translocated. We have clarified the text to reflect this.</p><p>“As the Walker B mutant has low unfolding activity, the density observed likely corresponds to the unstructured region of the degron tag.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>9) The authors propose that the X5 subunit in conformation A contains an ATP molecule that is &quot;primed&quot; for hydrolysis. Lander et al. observed a similar nucleotide binding site environment in the Lon complex, and also proposed this scenario. However, this is incompatible with studies showing that an Arginine finger in trans is required for hydrolysis. The resolution of the reconstruction does not enable the authors to discern between ATP and a post-hydrolysis/long-lived ADP-Pi state that may be induced by the Walker B mutation. Unless the authors are able to posit a reasonable hydrolysis mechanism that explains how hydrolysis could occur in this chemical environment in a manner that satisfies prior observations regarding hydrolysis, this aspect of the mechanism must be reconsidered. This should include a more detailed and quantitative description of the Walker B motif becoming positioned &quot;closer&quot; to the ATP in this subunit.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewers on this point. It is entirely possible that the conformation we observed in this study is a stabilized post-hydrolysis state or indeed a mixture of pre- and post-hydrolysis states. While it is interesting that the sensor-2 arginine adopts a conformation similar to that of the canonical arginine finger, our maps are not at a sufficient resolution to adequately interpret a new mechanism and as such we have carefully reworded the text to remove mention of this site as being primed for hydrolysis and simply note that it is different from the other observed sites and may represent a post-hydrolysis/long-lived ADP-Pi state. We have clarified the text to reflect this:</p><p>“In the X5 protomer (at the bottom of the spiral), the adjacent X6 protomer and its arginine finger have pivoted away from the nucleotide into the LS position, allowing the sensor-II arginine to move closer to the γ-phosphate of the bound nucleotide. While there is clear density for the γ-phosphate, the resolution of our experimental map was not sufficient to differentiate between ATP and a long-lived post hydrolysis ADP/P<sub>i</sub> state. Notably, this key sensor II-priming motif in the nucleotide site adjacent to an ADP bound site has also been reported for the Lon protease bound to substrate (Shin et al., 2019), a close relative in the HCLR clade of AAA+ proteins.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>10) The nominal resolution of the structure may enable a detailed description of the allostery involved in ClpP gate opening. It is mentioned that the rigidification is similar to that observed upon ADEP binding, but are there any differences observed or previously uncharacterized interactions? A more thorough description with associated figures should be included, as this aspect of the structure is particularly important.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewers that this aspect of the structure is of particular interest. There are differences to the gate opening observed with ADEP compared with our ClpXP structures. Most notably not all gates assume the “up” conformation equally (Figure 2) and the offset of ClpX relative to ClpP creates new asymmetric interactions with the N-terminal gates. Further insights into the allosteric mechanism, particularly communication between ClpP protomers did not seem to differ from that of the high resolution ADEP structures. We believe Figure 2E and G and Figure 2—figure supplement 2 and the associated text of our original submission addressed this important point.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>11) The observed interaction between H230 within the RKH loop and substrate is intriguing and warrants further investigation. Despite all the mutagenesis that's been done on this loop, as far as I know no one has made a single point mutation at this histidine. The strength of the density between the H230 and substrate is indicative of a substantial interaction, the functional significance of which should be probed biochemically.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewers that the interaction of H230 and the substrate is intriguing, and that our models suggest it plays an important role in substrate processing. However, we do not think further mutagenesis work is warranted because RKH loop mutants have been extensively probed by the Sauer lab in the past (Farrell et al., 2007; Martin et al., 2008b) as well as in a recent preprint (Fei et al., 2019), including the single point mutation of the RKH histidine. These publications clearly show that mutating the RKH loop to AAA abrogates degradation of SsrA-tagged substrates, and furthermore that a simple swapping of the Lys and His positions (RKH to RHK) also results in a severe reduction of degradation of SsrA-tagged substrates. Additionally the single point mutation of the histidine to alanine (RKA) resulted in loss of degradation for both SsrA and λO tagged substrates (Farrell et al., 2007). The specific positioning of a single H230 in our structure may provide an explanation for the sensitivity of activity to changes in this loop. We have added the following text and citations to discuss this point:</p><p>“The differences in these interactions may reflect the fact that while pore-1 loop and RKH loop motifs are critical for forming interactions with substrate, and in the case of pore-1 loops in particular, in providing the force for translocation, additional contacts may differ between species and may be necessary for recognition of degradation signals and for substrate specificity. […] The tight contact between H230 and the substrate in our maps provides a structural basis for understanding these mutagenesis results.”</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were suggested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Reviewer #2:</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The manuscript by Ripstein et al. is substantially improved. The new data shown in Figure 5 addresses concerns regarding the proposed sequential mechanism, and the authors' comment regarding glutaraldehyde crosslinking used by Gatsogiannis et al., 2019 is adequate, although not further substantiated. Few minor issues remain that need clarification.</p><p>1) &quot;The RKH loops are essential for the recognition of SsrA-tagged substrates by <italic>E. coli</italic> ClpX, while human ClpX, which lacks RKH loops loops but contains pore-1 loops with the same sequence as <italic>E. coli</italic> ClpX, fails to recognize substrates with the SsrA-tag.&quot;</p><p>Human ClpX features an RKL tripeptide (residues 401-403) instead of an &quot;RKH motif&quot; at the same position downstream of pore-1 loop.

While there is no reason to doubt the Farrell et al., 2007 findings, the explanation that electrostatic interactions via the charged Lys confer substrate specificity does not seem warranted according to the present structure. This statement needs to be revised.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for brinting this point to our attention.

However, the authors introduce a new experiment (Figure 5), whose results they interpret as evidence of a sequential hydrolysis translocation mechanism. The experiment is nearly identical to one that was published as Figure 1 Martin et al., 2008 (PMID 18223658). The observed curve for GFP degradation has been previously established, and proposed to be unrelated to processivity of translocation due to the fast refolding of destabilized GFP intermediates. Lowering the motor speed enables GFP to refold and escape degradation, and could occur whether ClpX utilizes a probabilistic or sequential ATP hydrolysis mechanism. Further, given that the conformations associated with substrate engagement and commitment are unknown, and that these processing steps could also be perturbed by introducing a single slowly hydrolyzing subunit, one cannot exclude a probabilistic mechanism.</p><p>The manuscript provides many insights into the mechanism of ClpXP substrate processing and that this work will be well-received by the AAA community, but the conclusions regarding sequential hydrolysis are unfounded. I suggest that the experiments and interpretation associated with Figure 5 be removed.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank this reviewer for his/her comments. The sequential vs. stochastic discussion is certainly controversial and merits a more detailed investigation. As per this reviewers’ suggestion, we have removed Figure 5 and all the associated text. We have added the following to the Discussion:</p><p>“The model described above is the simplest one that is consistent with our data. While our structures suggest that a sequential hydrolysis model exists for ClpXP, more complicated models can be envisioned that require additional states for which we have no experimental data. Indeed biochemical evidence suggests the possibility that when one or more subunits are catalytically deficient a more complex mechanism may be operational, allowing ClpXP to deviate from a strictly sequential hydrolysis scheme (Martin et al., 2008b).”</p></body></sub-article></article>
