The current view posits that triggering of asynchronous release during repetitive stimulation involves expansion of the same calcium domains underlying synchronous transmission. In this study, live imaging and paired patch clamp recording at the zebrafish neuromuscular synapse reveal contributions by spatially distinct calcium sources. Synchronous release is tied to calcium entry into synaptic boutons via P/Q type calcium channels, whereas asynchronous release is boosted by a propagating intracellular calcium source initiated at off-synaptic locations in the axon and axonal branch points. This secondary calcium source fully accounts for the persistence following termination of the stimulus and sensitivity to slow calcium buffers reported for asynchronous release. The neuromuscular junction and CNS neurons share these features, raising the possibility that secondary calcium sources are common among synapses with prominent asynchronous release.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.01206.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.01206.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.01206.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Neurons communicate with one another at junctions called synapses. The arrival of an electrical signal known as an action potential at the first (presynaptic) neuron causes calcium ions to flood into the cell. This in turn causes the neuron to release packages of chemicals called neurotransmitters into the synapse. These activate receptors on the second (postsynaptic) neuron, triggering a new action potential that travels down the axon to the next synapse.</p><p>The ions that trigger the release of the neurotransmitters are thought to enter the neuron through special calcium channels on or near the synapse. A sudden discrete influx of calcium ions causes the neuron to release many packages of transmitter simultaneously. This is called synchronous release. By contrast, when successive action potentials occur in the same neuron, the ions entering through the calcium channels accumulate inside the cell. This is thought to account for a sustained release of the neurotransmitter that continues even in the absence of nerve action potentials. This is called asynchronous release.</p><p>Wen et al. have now obtained evidence that these two forms of release might be triggered by calcium from different sources. The work was performed using a synapse between nerve and muscle cells in zebrafish: it has been shown that channels called P/Q calcium channels control the release of neurotransmitters at this synapse in zebrafish.</p><p>Mutant zebrafish with greatly reduced numbers of P/Q channels showed reduced synchronous release, but normal asynchronous release. Blocking the P/Q channels with a specific toxin in normal zebrafish eliminated synchronous release but left asynchronous release intact. Imaging experiments on these toxin-treated zebrafish revealed that a wave of calcium ions that propagated from a distant source coincided with the onset of asynchronous release. This wave of calcium fully accounted for the delayed onset and the persistence of asynchronous release following termination of the action potentials. This study further demonstrates that asynchronous release can be triggered by calcium ions that do not enter through the P/Q calcium channels.</p><p>Waves of calcium have been described in the nervous system before, but their significance has always been unclear. The work of Wen et al. offers the first possible explanation for the role of these waves, and further experiments are now needed to determine whether this process happens at other types of synapses.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.01206.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.01206.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author keywords</title><kwd>synaptopHluorin</kwd><kwd>calcium indicator</kwd><kwd>motor neuron</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Zebrafish</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>NS082573</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Wen</surname><given-names>Hua</given-names></name><name><surname>Hubbard</surname><given-names>Jeffrey M</given-names></name><name><surname>Rakela</surname><given-names>Benjamin</given-names></name><name><surname>Brehm</surname><given-names>Paul</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Muscular Dystrophy Association</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>MDA236717</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Wen</surname><given-names>Hua</given-names></name><name><surname>Brehm</surname><given-names>Paul</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Howard Hughes Medical Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Mandel</surname><given-names>Gail</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Muscular Dystrophy Association</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>MDA255543</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Linhoff</surname><given-names>Michael W</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The delayed-onset of asynchronous transmitter release seen in neurons that fire repeatedly is triggered by a different source of calcium from that which triggers synchronous transmitter release.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Physiological studies have pointed increasingly to a central role played by asynchronous release in mediating synaptic transmission (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Goda and Stevens, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Lu and Trussell, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Hefft and Jonas, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Iremonger and Bains, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Best and Regehr, 2009</xref>). At most synapses, the asynchronous contribution to release is smaller than the synchronous component, but becomes more prominent with repetitive stimulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Atluri and Regehr, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Lu and Trussell, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Hefft and Jonas, 2005</xref>). Little is known about the functional significance, but the most widely held idea is that it provides persistent transmitter release under conditions where phase locking to the action potential is not required (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Atluri and Regehr, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Hefft and Jonas, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Best and Regehr, 2009</xref>). At the zebrafish neuromuscular junction (NMJ), asynchronous release may augment release during bouts of prolonged swimming, where release probability may be severely compromised.</p><p>Synchronous and asynchronous modes of release are thought to arise from different calcium dynamics surrounding the presynaptic release zones. According to this idea, synchronous release is triggered by highly localized calcium transients resulting from the opening of calcium channels near the active zones (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Adler et al., 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Stanley, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Neher, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Meinrenken et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Augustine et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Eggermann et al., 2012</xref>), whereas a more slowly decaying component of intracellular calcium is proposed to account for the asynchronous release (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Rahamimoff and Yaari, 1973</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Goda and Stevens, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cummings et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Atluri and Regehr, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chen and Regehr, 1999</xref>). The slow accumulation of calcium during repeated stimulation can potentially account for both the delayed onset and persistence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Lu and Trussell, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Hefft and Jonas, 2005</xref>). Much of the evidence for this idea rests on the observation that the slow calcium buffer EGTA can block asynchronous release while leaving synchronous release intact (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Adler et al., 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cummings et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Atluri and Regehr, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Lu and Trussell, 2000</xref>). The fact that the faster calcium buffer BAPTA is required to inhibit synchronous release has been interpreted to represent a more restricted calcium domain that is in close vicinity to the calcium sensors underlying exocytosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Neher, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Eggermann et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>There has been little consideration of alternative secondary sources of calcium, despite evidence for their involvement in synaptic transmission (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Collin et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Berridge, 2006</xref>). In one recent case however, an unexpected source of calcium for asynchronous release was reported in the form of an unusual voltage dependent calcium channel type that provides persistent calcium entry (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Few et al., 2012</xref>). Our investigation into possible separate sources of calcium in zebrafish motor neurons was prompted by our observation that a block of calcium entry through the presynaptic P/Q calcium channels fully inhibited synchronous release, leaving asynchronous release intact. Zebrafish NMJ offers a unique opportunity to explore the temporal and spatial relationships between calcium entry and the two release modes through combining paired recording and live calcium imaging. We now present evidence for a source of off-synapse calcium that triggers the initiation of asynchronous release. This novel calcium source for asynchronous release predicts many of the central features for this mode including sensitivity to calcium buffers, persistence following termination of the stimulus, and non-phase locking to the presynaptic action potential.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>Paired patch clamp recordings from the caudal primary motor neuron (CaP) and target fast skeletal muscle showed a stereotypic transition from exclusively synchronous to principally asynchronous transmission when stimulated at frequencies greater than 20 Hz (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A,B</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Wen et al., 2010</xref>). Behaviorally evoked contractures of zebrafish axial muscle correspond to frequencies between 20 Hz and 100 Hz, so we continue to use the latter stimulus frequency as the benchmark for our studies. At 100 Hz, greater than 95% of the synaptic responses were phase locked to the presynaptic action potential during the first second of stimulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A1,B</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Wen et al., 2010</xref>). The onset of asynchronous release occurred after the first second of stimulation, displaying a time-dependent increase in overall contribution during the ensuing stimulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A2,B</xref>). The release was quantitated as charge transfer by integrating the EPCs for each consecutive second of the stimulation, and synchronous and asynchronous events were separated on the basis of their timing to the action potential (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Wen et al., 2010</xref>). The release associated with synchronous vs asynchronous events showed a time-dependent transition, and overall each of the two modes accounted for approximately half of the total synaptic transmission (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Wen et al., 2010</xref>). The amplitudes of the asynchronous events were indistinguishable from the spontaneous synaptic events measured in the absence of stimulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>), consistent with each representing individual quanta. The synchronous release is strictly dependent on P/Q-type calcium channel function (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Wen et al., 2013</xref>). Inhibiting P/Q calcium channels with 1 µM ω-conotoxin GVIA nearly abolished synchronous release (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D1,E</xref>). Unexpectedly, asynchronous release remained intact in the ω-conotoxin GVIA treated fish, but with a greatly delayed onset compared to the control fish (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D2,E</xref>). Quantitatively, over 85% of release seen in ω-conotoxin GVIA fish was associated with the asynchronous mode, and this likely represents an underestimate because of the resolution of our analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). Similar to the control, the amplitude of the asynchronous events was indistinguishable from spontaneous miniature events (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>). The motility mutant line <italic>tb204a</italic> has greatly compromised P/Q calcium channel function but is not a complete null (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Wen et al., 2013</xref>). Accordingly, the synchronous release was reduced but not eliminated completely (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G1</xref>), leaving asynchronous release intact (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G2</xref>). Quantitation of the time-dependent contributions showed both reduced synchronous release and delayed onset of asynchronous release for <italic>tb204a</italic> compared to control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1H</xref>). Once again, the amplitude of the late asynchronous event class was indistinguishable from the spontaneous events measured in the absence of stimulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1I</xref>), as well as those asynchronous events recorded from control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>) and ω-conotoxin GVIA-treated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>) fish.<fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.01206.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Asynchronous synaptic transmission remains intact in the P/Q calcium channel mutant <italic>tb204a</italic> and following treatment of wild-type fish with ω-conotoxin GVIA.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>–<bold>C</bold>) A representative paired recording from untreated wild-type fish.

For this purpose, we recorded stimulus-driven fluorescence changes in a transgenic line of fish expressing synaptopHluorin in the spinal motor neurons. Exocytosis was signaled by an increase in fluorescence that results from exposure of the vesicular synaptopHluorin protein to neutral pH (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Miesenbock et al., 1998</xref>). Fluorescence was monitored in a single image plane that was selected prior to stimulation on the basis of distribution and number of boutons. For this purpose each CaP neuron was filled with the fluorescent Alexa Fluor 647 dye via the patch pipette (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>, fill). Stimulation of CaP motor neurons for 10 s at 100 Hz resulted in a robust fluorescence increase that was largely restricted to the boutons associated with synapses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>, spH). The synaptic location of the regions of interest (ROIs) was determined by means of the postsynaptic receptor label α−bungarotoxin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>, α-btx and overlay). Next, stimulus-driven changes in synaptopHluorin fluorescence were determined. Images were captured at 33 ms intervals in a single plane that contained candidate ROIs. Post stimulus, images were corrected by background subtraction and then each ROI was quantitated as the ratio of delta fluorescence to prestimulus fluorescence (ΔF/F<sub>0</sub>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). This corrects for the expression of the pHluorin on the surface and in subcellular compartments other than vesicles. The fluorescence for control ROIs rose immediately at the start of 100 Hz stimulation and reached a plateau during the subsequent few seconds of stimulation (gray traces, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). However, the fluorescence signal in ω-conotoxin GVIA-treated neurons showed greatly delayed onset of fluorescence for comparable ROIs (color traces, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). Additionally, the synaptopHluorin signal was reduced in the ω-conotoxin GVIA-treated fish (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). Comparisons of the onset of fluorescence increase for overall ROIs were made by measuring the time required to reach 50% maximal intensity from the initiation of stimulation.

However, it was necessary to exclude the possibility that the calcium indicator was competing with the endogenous calcium handling in the cell. To address this possibility, we compared two calcium indicators, 100 μM Fluo-4 (k<sub>d</sub> = 345 nM) to 100 μM Fluo-5F (k<sub>d</sub> = 2.3 µM), which have approximately sevenfold different binding constants for calcium (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). Comparisons were made on the basis of the onset of calcium signal in the boutons in both control and ω-conotoxin GVIA-treated fish. With both Fluo-4 and Fluo-5F the time to 20% rise was significantly longer in ω-conotoxin GVIA treated fish compared to control fish (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). Importantly, there was no significant difference between the dyes in ω-conotoxin GVIA-treated fish (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). The time to 20% rise was marginally different (p=0.01) between the dyes in control experiments, potentially reflecting the increased time required for the lower affinity calcium indicators to measure the calcium rise.<fig id="fig6" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.01206.010</object-id><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><title>The delayed rise of the calcium signal is similar for two different affinity calcium indicators Fluo-4 and Fluo-5F.</title><p>Comparisons of the time to reach 20% peak stimulated fluorescence in ω-conotoxin GVIA-treated (shaded fill) and control CaP (no fill) motor neurons.

For this purpose each motor neuron was reconstructed as a three-dimensional image using Imaris filament software on the basis of the dye fill (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref>). A 63× objective was substituted to obtain greater detail of the synaptic boutons resulting in exclusion of the soma from the field of view. Therefore, a reference point for distance zero was chosen that was approximately 80 μm from the soma where the axon has traversed the notochord (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref>, arrow head). The time-dependent changes in fluorescence were first determined for a series of ROIs corresponding to hot spots at different distances from the reference point (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A,B</xref>). The rise in fluorescence was delayed with greater distance from the soma (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>). When expressed as time to 20% rise vs distance from the reference point, a striking quasi-linear relationship was observed for the boutons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D</xref>). This relationship was determined for all of the recordings performed in ω-conotoxin GVIA-treated neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7E</xref>). The mean velocity of travel obtained in boutons determined for the cumulative data was 74 μm/s in ω-conotoxin GVIA-treated fish. By contrast, the relationships obtained for control neurons showed no dependence on distance in keeping with velocity of the propagating action potential (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7E</xref>). In ω-conotoxin GVIA-treated neurons the distance dependence was not observed for the proximal axon, suggesting that the signaling underlying calcium propagation in these regions may be different from that of the distal terminals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D,E</xref>).<fig id="fig7" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.01206.011</object-id><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><title>Distance-dependent delay in Ca<sup>2+</sup> rise in ω-conotoxin GVIA-treated CaP boutons.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Sample images of Fluo-5F fluorescence taken at 0.5 s intervals during 100 Hz stimulation. 5 ROIs are shown at different distances from the reference point at the ventral edge of the notochord.

For example, the delayed appearance of calcium in the distal boutons might reflect a slower rise in free calcium due to greater calcium handling at the boutons. The calcium signals shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5 fig7">Figures 5 and 7</xref> suggest that such differences may exist. The signal in the axon initiation zone does not decline during maintained stimulation, whereas the distal signal appears to relax slightly during the stimulation. To test whether slow time-dependent calcium accumulation could account for the delayed rise in distal terminals, paired recordings were made using a ‘killswitch’ protocol. The stimulation was terminated either prior to (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8A</xref>) or coincident with (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8B</xref>) the onset of asynchronous release in ω-conotoxin GVIA-treated fish. In seven such recordings with 5 mM intracellular EGTA, the asynchronous release persisted well beyond termination of the stimulus. To test whether the calcium signal also persists after stimulus termination, we used the killswitch protocol during calcium imaging in the presence of 1 µM ω-conotoxin GVIA. The calcium signal, measured using Fluo-4 in the presence of 0.5 mM EGTA, also exhibited distance-dependent onset with the signal in the distal boutons peaking following termination of the stimulus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8C</xref>). Because the stimulus was terminated prematurely in both paired recordings and calcium measurements, continued accumulation would not occur and could not account for the delayed onset of asynchronous release and the calcium signal. Instead, the findings strongly support the involvement of a propagating calcium signal that was triggered by stimulation at the soma.<fig id="fig8" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.01206.012</object-id><label>Figure 8.</label><caption><title>The delayed asynchronous release and Ca<sup>2+</sup> rise in ω-conotoxin GVIA-treated fish is not due to slow local calcium accumulation at the distal boutons.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold> and <bold>B</bold>) Two paired recordings for killswitch experiments are shown with expanded insets (boxed region).

Inclusion of 25 mM EGTA in the electrode eliminated the majority of synaptic transmission in ω-conotoxin GVIA-treated fish in all but the single recording shown, where the onset of asynchronous release is further delayed compared with those recorded in 5 mM EGTA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10C</xref>). Quantitative comparisons of delay were determined on the basis of normalized integrated postsynaptic charge entry vs time from the start of stimulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10D</xref>). The overall data for all of the recordings at 0.5 mM and 5 mM EGTA shows a highly significant difference in the time to peak release (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10E</xref>). In control recordings the time to peak release was slightly higher for 5 mM EGTA (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>, p=0.01).</p><p>The mechanisms underlying calcium entry and propagation were explored using pharmacological blockers of calcium channels and calcium-operated stores in ω-conotoxin GVIA-treated fish. Treatment of these fish with the non-specific calcium channel blocker Cd<sup>2+</sup> produced ambiguous results. The high concentrations (500 μM) required to inhibit the propagating calcium signals also inhibited the sodium channels responsible for action potential propagation, so firm conclusions could not be drawn. The rather non-specific T-type calcium channel inhibitors Mibefradil (5 µM) together with Ni<sup>2+</sup> (100 µM) effectively reduced the calcium signal in the axon and boutons as did the L-type blocker Nimodipine (50 µM). However, other L-type blockers Nitrendipine (25 µM), Nifedipine (50 µM) and Isradipine (50 µM) were without effect. Similarly, the R-type Ca<sup>2+</sup> channel blocker SNX 482 (200 nM) was completely ineffective. The calcium stores inhibitor thapsigargin (1 µM) and the IP3 receptor antagonists 2-APB (50 µM) and Xestospongin-C (5 µM) were also without effect. Both ruthenium red (400 µM) and ryanodine (100 µM), inhibitors of the ryanodine receptors, gave variable results, only in some cases appearing to increase the arrival time for calcium in the boutons.</p><p>Pharmacological treatment with tetrodotoxin (TTX) provided the clearest support for active propagation of the calcium signal. Prolonged depolarization of the CaP motor neuron in the presence of 1 μM TTX resulted in a calcium propagation that was clearly followed from soma to boutons without failure (<xref ref-type="other" rid="media3">Video 3</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11">Figure 11A</xref>). In most recordings, multiple propagating signals were observed in the boutons (<xref ref-type="other" rid="media3">Video 3</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11">Figure 11B</xref>) and occasionally the signal back-propagated to the soma (<xref ref-type="other" rid="media4">Video 4</xref>) rendering difficult the measurements of velocity. However, in the case shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11">Figure 11</xref> (<xref ref-type="other" rid="media3">Video 3</xref>), the forward propagating velocity for the first propagating signal corresponded to 3 μm/s. Overall estimates fall between 3–10 μm/s that is considerably slower than those obtained with ω-conotoxin GVIA-treated neuron (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7 fig10">Figures 7 and 10</xref>). This difference points to a dominant role of the axonal action potential in coordinating the calcium signaling in the axon initiation zone and the axon proper.<media content-type="glencoe play-in-place height-250 width-310" id="media3" mime-subtype="avi" mimetype="video" xlink:href="elife-01206-media3.avi"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.01206.016</object-id><label>Video 3.</label><caption><p>TTX1</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.01206.016">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.01206.016</ext-link></p></caption></media><fig id="fig11" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.01206.017</object-id><label>Figure 11.</label><caption><title>Depolarization-induced regenerative calcium wave in the presence of TTX.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Peak response of the Fluo-4 calcium signal following depolarization from −80 mV to +50 mV for 2 min in the presence of 1 μM TTX.

The studies on CNS neurons generally ascribe asynchronous release to persistent calcium resulting from opening of the highly localized presynaptic calcium channels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Goda and Stevens, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cummings et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Atluri and Regehr, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chen and Regehr, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Lu and Trussell, 2000</xref>). At the zebrafish NMJ, this would be the ω-conotoxin GVIA-sensitive P/Q type calcium channel that is essential for synchronous release (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Wen et al., 2013</xref>). We tested this idea using paired recordings by either eliminating presynaptic calcium entry through blockade with ω-conotoxin GVIA or by means of a mutant line (<italic>tb204a</italic>) with functionally compromised P/Q type calcium channels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Wen et al., 2013</xref>). We found that a greatly delayed asynchronous component was still present under conditions where the synchronous release calcium channel was eliminated. Using calcium indicator dyes we identified a source of calcium for asynchronous release that, under conditions of P/Q type calcium channel inhibition, originated in the axons and branch points and appeared to propagate into the synaptic boutons. The delayed arrival into the distal boutons, sites of synaptic interaction based on α-btx labeling, accounted well for the delayed onset of asynchronous release. Moreover, paired recordings performed along with calcium imaging confirmed the coincidence between the arrival of the calcium signal and the onset of delayed asynchronous synaptic transmission.</p><p>The delay in the onset of asynchronous release was longest in ω-conotoxin GVIA-treated fish, intermediate in mutant <italic>tb204a</italic> fish and shortest in wild-type fish. This rank order was inversely related to the levels of P/Q type channel function, pointing to a likely contribution by these channels to asynchronous release as well. Accordingly, the early onset of asynchronous release in control recordings, compared to ω-conotoxin GVIA-treated fish, would result from the combined action of the local calcium entry and calcium arrival from a distal source. The synergistic action is fully compromised in ω-conotoxin GVIA-treated fish but only partially compromised in mutant fish. A model with separate, but interactive calcium sources, challenges the prevailing view that asynchronous release results exclusively from an expansion of the highly restricted calcium domains surrounding the same calcium channels that govern synchronous release (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Borst and Sakmann, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Meinrenken et al., 2002</xref>). This model would predict that blocking the source of calcium for synchronous release would also inhibit the asynchronous release. Support for an expanding domain comes principally from the differential sensitivity of synchronous vs asynchronous release to slow calcium buffers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Neher, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Eggermann et al., 2012</xref>). The slow calcium buffer EGTA obliterates asynchronous release at concentrations that are ineffective on synchronous release (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Adler et al., 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cummings et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Atluri and Regehr, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Lu and Trussell, 2000</xref>). By contrast, blockade of synchronous release generally requires use of the fast buffer BAPTA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Adler et al., 1991</xref>). Augustine notes that ‘this criteria has been used successfully to probe local calcium signaling with the conclusion that high BAPTA/EGTA efficacy points toward nanodomain and equal efficacy implicates diffuse calcium signals or microdomains’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Augustine et al., 2003</xref>), an approach widely used as a determinant of calcium channel-calcium sensor coupling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Eggermann et al., 2011</xref>). It is the case with zebrafish NMJ that asynchronous release, as well as the calcium propagation, is highly sensitive to the slow buffer EGTA. We interpret these findings to mean that in zebrafish the differential sensitivity reflects, to a large extent, the involvement of bulk cytoplasmic changes stemming from distal calcium as opposed solely to highly restricted calcium domains entering through the P/Q type calcium channels. This provides an alternative interpretation to the BAPTA/EGTA sensitivity metric but does not exclude additional contribution by the expanding zone of calcium formed by local P/Q channel openings.</p><p>The source of the axonal calcium entry underlying the propagation and the mechanism by which calcium propagates in a regenerative fashion are both unknown. The pharmacological results point to no clear source of either intracellular or extracellular calcium as required for the initiation or propagation. Effects seen using the calcium channel blockers, Mibefradil, Ni<sup>2+</sup> and Nimodipine suggest that activation of calcium channels is involved, but the pharmacological profile does not fit any specific isoform. One impression resulting from these experiments is that the propagation is so potent in the branch points and locations near boutons, that there may be a large safety factor that requires near extinction of calcium before propagation is terminated. In this case, the pharmacological block would have to be nearly complete before the calcium propagation was inhibited. Our results from TTX experiments provide some insights into the process of calcium propagation. In the absence of action potentials, Ca<sup>2+</sup> propagation can be elicited with prolonged depolarization, but the apparent velocity is slow. These data are compatible with a model in which Ca<sup>2+</sup> propagation is less dependent on coordination by the action potential in the boutons than in the axons. Accordingly, an action potential traveling down the axon would instantaneously initiate Ca<sup>2+</sup> propagation at the branching point, whereas the spread of depolarization would take much longer in the presence of TTX. The pharmacological conditions under which the calcium propagation is best revealed are non-physiological. Instead, the distance over which calcium needs to propagate under physiological conditions is certainly less due to participation of the action potential. Additionally, as pointed out earlier the P/Q channels do participate in the calcium generation and the secondary sources for calcium are also near the boutons, minimizing the need for long distance propagation. However, all evidence points to a central involvement of this secondary source of calcium in the delayed onset of asynchronous release.</p><p>Our finding of a robust propagating calcium signal in the motor neuron was quite unexpected. Published accounts of propagating calcium signals like those shown in our study have been largely limited to postsynaptic cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Ross, 2012</xref>). However, there is some precedence for ryanodine-sensitive calcium stores involvement in synaptic transmission at guinea pig sympathetic nerve terminals and frog NMJ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Smith and Cunnane, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Narita et al., 1998</xref>). Our findings take on additional significance due to our ability to assign a functional role to this secondary source of calcium. Consequently, we have a clearer understanding of the delayed onset and persistent release properties associated with asynchronous release. In light of the ubiquitous nature of asynchronous release, it will be critical to determine whether similar mechanisms are at work at synapses within the central nervous system.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><p>Zebrafish (<italic>Danio rerio</italic>) were maintained in accordance with the standards set forth in the International Animal Care and Use Committee.

The laser lines used included an Argon 488 nm (DLS2000, Dynamic Laser, Salt Lake City, UT), 561 nm (Sapphire 561-50 CW CDRH, Coherent, Santa Clara, CA) and 640 nm (Chromalase II diode laser, Blue Sky Research, Milpitas, CA). Low power images that included the entire CaP motor neuron utilized the Zeiss Plan-Apochromat 40×/1.0 n.a. dip objective, whereas higher resolution of the bouton field was obtained with the 63x equivalent objective. The CaP motor neuron was also co-loaded with 40 μM Alexa Fluor 647 hydrazide (Invitrogen, Eugene, OR) to identify the boutons and perform morphological reconstructions. For paired recordings with simultaneous calcium imaging, muscle was filled with 40 μM Alexa Fluor 555 hydrazide (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR). For each synaptopHluorin or calcium indicator recording, an acquisition plane was selected to contain 10–15 synaptic boutons in the field. Sequential images were acquired continuously at 33 ms intervals during 100 Hz stimulation. The calcium signals for each bouton were baseline subtracted, and the ratio of stimulus induced increase in calcium signal (green) to fill signal (red) was computed for regions of interest (ROIs). Images were acquired with Piper Control 2.5.04 (Stanford Photonics, Palo Alto, CA) and analyzed with ImageJ (NIH, Bethesda, MD), Microsoft Excel (Redmond, WA) and custom scripts in Igor Pro 6.3 (Lake Oswego, OR).

Your article has been favorably evaluated by a Senior editor and 2 reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors.</p><p>The Reviewing editor and the other reviewer discussed their comments before we reached this decision, and the Reviewing editor has assembled the following comments to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>This provocative manuscript describes an unusual phenomenon that the authors have discovered in zebrafish motor neurons. When P/Q-type Ca channels are blocked with conotoxin, presynaptic activity still results in neurotransmitter release, but after an extremely long delay. A nice set of electrophysiology and imaging experiments make it pretty convincing that this unexpected phenomenon is real, and involves strangely delayed calcium rises in response to activity. It raises the possibility that this phenomenon could exist at other synapses, which makes it interesting. On the down side, the properties of this phenomenon are only sketched in here, with a lot of loose ends, and the exposition is somewhat disordered. Furthermore, the terminology presumes identity of this phenomenon with other established phenomena such as delayed release and calcium waves, even though there is little evidence to support this. These weaknesses detract from what is otherwise an interesting observation, quite worthy of more thorough investigation. Minimally, substantial editorial changes in the text, figures, and data analysis are required. It is possible that some additional experiments will be needed, or addition of further data already in place in the laboratory may suffice.</p><p>Major comments:</p><p>1) There are some unnecessary distractions in terminology that go beyond the data as presented here. First, calling this “delayed” or “asynchronous” release is confusing. Delayed release at conventional central synapses is the desynchronized release of individual quanta following calcium influx at synapses, and is driven to a large extent by residual calcium. This phenomenon studied here may be different in important ways. It is difficult to tell from the figures whether these are individual quanta, since they seem to be very large currents. Perhaps enlarging and analyzing the traces in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> would help. What is the quantal size at this synapse? Are these multiple quanta releasing simultaneously, or are quanta actually 1-2 nA? Secondly, the authors argue that this calcium influx is not through normal synaptic calcium channels, so tying this phenomenon to delayed release seems unnecessary. Second, the release follows an elevation in intracellular calcium that is referred to as a “wave”. This term brings to mind the spontaneous, repetitive activity seen in developing cochlea and retina. However, the phenomenon studied here is not clearly spontaneous or repetitive, so it would be preferable to avoid using the loaded term “wave”. I think this phenomenon is quite interesting enough on its own terms to avoid the confusion associated with those established phenomena, until it can be clearly linked to them. It seems adequate to call it “propagating”, as for example an action potential is.</p><p>2) In contrast to what the authors write, the data appear to show a clear disparity between asynchronous release and the slow calcium wave in the EGTA experiments. While increasing [EGTA] leads to a consistent increase in the onset of the [Ca<sup>2+</sup>] wave, the onset of the asynchronous release first decreases significantly before increasing back to the original size:</p><p>No EGTA: time to peak of normalized release = 10.5 s time to 20% of [Ca<sup>2+</sup>] peak = 2.1 s</p><p>0.5 mM EGTA: time to peak of normalized release = 4.8s time to 20% of [Ca<sup>2+</sup>] peak = ∼2 s</p><p>5.0 mM EGTA: time to peak of normalized release = 10.5 s time to 20% of [Ca<sup>2+</sup>] peak = ∼6 s</p><p>These numbers are hidden in the manuscript, as the authors do not include the relevant control data (P/Q blocked, but no EGTA) in the graphs. It is left to the reader to pick out these data from other figures.</p><p>Moreover, it is not clear how to reconcile the different time courses of calcium rises vs release across the dataset. Calcium appears to rise rapidly (2-3 s, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4 fig6">Figures 4 and 6</xref>) in some experiments, and slowly in others (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7 fig9">Figures 7 and 9</xref>). Likewise, release rises rapidly in some experiments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>), but not others (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1 fig2 fig8 fig9">Figures 1, 2, 8, 9</xref>). What is going on here? <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref> links rise of Ca and release to EGTA concentration. Does this account for the variability in different figures? If so, please give the EGTA concentration in every figure. If it doesn't, then what is going on? <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref> gives us a single example of similarity between rate of rise of Ca and release. Were there any other examples? I appreciate that this experiment may have been difficult, but a single N seems too little. In addition, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref> leaves it to the reader to draw the correlation by eye. Can the authors take a more quantitative approach here?</p><p>3) Related to the above point, there appears to be some data duplication (presumably unintentional): <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>, the data points labelled “+GVIA” are identical with the data points shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7E</xref> as “5 mM EGTA”. This needs to be corrected.</p><p>4) There are a number of features to this phenomenon that are simply not clearly studied here. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7 fig8">Figures 7 and 8</xref> raise the possibility that much of the stimulation has no effect on rises in Ca or release. This is confusing. The calcium signal in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref> clearly decreases while stimulation is ongoing. Is the signal spontaneously ending, or is it depleted? How long does recovery take? There is one tantalizing remark that the signal bounced “occasionally”. This sounds very anecdotal. Could this be replicated? Why is it not shown? Furthermore, the data of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref> do not seem appropriate for linear fits, because there is a large jump in latency close to the soma. This does not seem consistent with the idea of a “wave” of calcium emanating from the soma. In any case, those linear fits, if made, should be shown on the figure. Why is the role of different calcium sources not studied? What happens if other Ca channel blockers are applied (N-type, R-type)? What happens if store blockers are applied?</p><p>5) The “killswitch” experiment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>) is elegant, but it doesn't show what the authors conclude from it (namely that it proves the involvement of a propagating calcium wave). Rather it shows that onset of asynchronous release doesn't require ongoing stimulation. While this result is suggestive, the authors need to actually show that the calcium wave also persists after termination of the stimulation in this protocol to draw their conclusion. This is a doable experiment.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.01206.020</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>1) There are some unnecessary distractions in terminology that go beyond the data as presented here.

What happens if store blockers are applied</italic>?</p><p>- First, the calcium signal does plateau and often declines during prolonged stimulation. As the decline occurs for boutons and not the axon, this could signal differences in calcium handling for boutons and axons. We note this in the results along with our rationale for the killswitch experiment.</p><p>- Second, we did not look at recovery due to the need for holding pairs for such a long period of time.</p><p>- Third, the active propagation, multiple wave phenomenon and bounce back in TTX is now fully documented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11">Figure 11</xref>. Two movies are shown along with an example figure. The example shown in the figure exhibited two waves. This clear example was chosen because it helped resolve the issue of propagation velocity. The second example, shown in movie form, demonstrates forward and back propagation of the calcium signal (<xref ref-type="other" rid="media4">Video 4</xref>: TTX2). In the presence of TTX the velocity of propagation is slowed and the fast propagation seen in the axon of GVIA treated fish is missing. We discuss the importance of this distinction in the Results.</p><p>- Fourth, we added the fit over the linear range to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7 fig10">Figures 7D and 10B</xref>. We also explain our reasoning as to why we excluded the axon points from the conotoxin treated neuron. In fitting the TTX data we included all of the points and we also provided an interpretation for the differences in these data sets in the Results.</p><p>- Fifth, we added a paragraph in the Results summarizing the pharmacological reagents tested and the associated findings.
