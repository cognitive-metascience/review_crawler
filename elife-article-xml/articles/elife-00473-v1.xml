Current models of the <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> circadian network consist of several coupled feedback loops composed almost exclusively of transcriptional repressors. Indeed, a central regulatory mechanism is the repression of evening-phased clock genes via the binding of morning-phased Myb-like repressors to evening element (EE) promoter motifs. We now demonstrate that a related Myb-like protein, REVEILLE8 (RVE8), is a direct transcriptional activator of EE-containing clock and output genes. Loss of RVE8 and its close homologs causes a delay and reduction in levels of evening-phased clock gene transcripts and significant lengthening of clock pace. Our data suggest a substantially revised model of the circadian oscillator, with a clock-regulated activator essential both for clock progression and control of clock outputs. Further, our work suggests that the plant clock consists of a highly interconnected, complex regulatory network rather than of coupled morning and evening feedback loops.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.00473.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.00473.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.00473.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>We live in a world with a 24-hr cycle in which day follows night follows day with complete predictability. Life on earth has evolved to take advantage of this predictability by using circadian clocks to prepare for the coming of night (or day), and plants are no exception. Even in constant darkness, characteristics such as leaf movements show a constant cycle of around 24 hr.</p><p>Most circadian clocks rely on negative feedback loops involving various genes and proteins to keep track of time. In one of these feedback loops, certain genes—called morning-phased genes—are expressed as proteins during the day, and these proteins prevent other genes—called evening-phased genes—from producing proteins. As night approaches, however, a second feedback loop acts to stop the morning-phased genes being expressed, thus allowing the evening-phased genes to produce proteins. And as day approaches, expression of these genes is stopped and the whole cycle starts again.</p><p>Many of the genes and proteins involved in the circadian system of <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic>, a small flowering plant that is widely used as a model organism, have been identified, and its circadian clock was thought to rely almost entirely on proteins called repressors that block the transcription of genes. Now, Hsu et al. have shown that the Arabidopsis clock also involves proteins that increase the expression of certain genes at specific times of the day.</p><p>Hsu et al. focused on the promoter regions of evening-phased genes: these regions are stretches of DNA that proteins called transcription factors bind to and either encourage the expression of a gene (if the protein is a transcriptional activator) or block its expression (as a transcriptional repressor). In particular, they focused on a protein called RVE8 that is most strongly expressed in the afternoon and, based on previous research, is thought to activate the transcription of genes. Using genetically modified plants in which the gene for RVE8 can be turned on and off, they found that this protein led to increases in the expression of some genes, and reductions in the expression of others.</p><p>Further analysis showed that RVE8 was able to activate the expression of evening-phased genes directly, without requiring that new proteins be made first. By contrast, morning-expressed genes were likely to be suppressed by RVE8 via an indirect mechanism that involved other proteins that had previously been activated by RVE8. The expression of RVE8 itself is regulated by other clock genes and also by an undefined post-transcriptional process. Therefore rather than consisting of a morning feedback loop coupled to an evening feedback loop, with both loops being based on repressors, the plant clock is instead better viewed as a highly connected network of activators and repressors. Further research is clearly necessary to understand this unexpected complexity in the circadian clock of Arabidopsis.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.00473.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.00473.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author keywords</title><kwd>circadian rhythm</kwd><kwd>transcription factor</kwd><kwd>evening element</kwd><kwd>phase</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>A. thaliana</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>GM069418</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Harmer</surname><given-names>Stacey</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Taiwan Merit Scholarship</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>NSC-095-SAF-I-564-014-TMS</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Hsu</surname><given-names>Polly Yingshan</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The circadian clock in the model plant organism <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic> is best described as a highly connected network made up of clock-regulated activators and repressors of transcription, rather than two coupled, repressor-based feedback loops.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Circadian clocks are widespread in nature, presumably because they help diverse organisms prepare for predictable day/night cycles. Although specific components are not widely conserved, eukaryotic clocks are composed of interlocking negative transcriptional feedback loops (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Harmer, 2009</xref>). In Arabidopsis, the first-identified clock genes function in a double negative feedback loop, with two morning-phased Myb-like transcription factors, CIRCADIAN CLOCK ASSOCIATED 1 (CCA1) and LATE ELONGATED HYPOCOTYL (LHY), repressing expression of an evening-phased pseudo-response regulator, TIMING OF CAB EXPRESSION 1 (TOC1 or PRR1), which in turn represses expression of <italic>CCA1</italic> and <italic>LHY</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Schaffer et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Wang and Tobin, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Strayer et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Alabadi et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Gendron et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Huang et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Pokhilko et al., 2012</xref>). CCA1 and LHY also promote the expression of <italic>PRR7</italic> and <italic>9</italic>, two day-phased genes, and are in turn repressed by these PRRs and their homolog PRR5, forming another negative feedback circuit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Farre et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Nakamichi et al., 2010</xref>). Finally, TOC1, GIGANTEA (GI), and the evening complex components including LUX ARRHYTHMO (LUX), EARLY FLOWERING 3 (ELF3) and 4 (ELF4), act in double negative feedback loops with CCA1, LHY, and PRR7 and 9 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Fowler et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Park et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Dixon et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Helfer et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Nusinow et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Huang et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Pokhilko et al., 2012</xref>). Thus most characterized clock components repress expression of other clock components.</p><p>A <italic>cis</italic>-regulatory element named the evening element (EE) [(A)AAATATCT] has been found to be central to circadian clock function in plants. Most evening-phased central clock genes (including <italic>TOC1</italic>, <italic>PRR5</italic>, <italic>GI</italic>, <italic>LUX</italic> and <italic>ELF4</italic>) contain the EE in their promoter regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Covington et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Harmer, 2009</xref>) and the two morning-phased components, CCA1 and LHY, bind directly to the EE to repress evening-phased clock gene expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Alabadi et al., 2001</xref>). The EE was first identified by its overrepresentation in the promoters of evening-phased genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Harmer et al., 2000</xref>) and is sufficient to confer evening-phased expression on a reporter gene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Harmer and Kay, 2005</xref>). In addition to these two morning-phased transcriptional repressors that act via the EE, two pieces of evidence suggest that there is also a transcriptional activator(s) present in the afternoon that regulates the EE. First, if only repressors bind to the EE, loss of protein binding to the EE should result in constitutively high expression of EE-regulated genes; however, mutation of the EE causes decreased expression of an EE-regulated reporter gene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Harmer and Kay, 2005</xref>). Second, an afternoon/evening-phased activity that specifically binds the EE is present in plant extracts and persists in <italic>cca1 lhy</italic> mutants, consistent with the existence of a clock-regulated, afternoon-phased activator of the EE (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Harmer and Kay, 2005</xref>). A clock-regulated activator of the EE might help to explain why evening-phased clock genes are expressed with a circadian rhythm in <italic>cca1 lhy</italic> plants rather than being arrhythmic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Mizoguchi et al., 2002</xref>).</p><p>A candidate activator of the EE is REVEILLE 8/ LHY-CCA1-LIKE 5 (RVE8/LCL5) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Farinas and Mas, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Rawat et al., 2011</xref>). RVE8 has been shown to bind to the EE in vitro and in planta, and its protein levels display a circadian rhythm that peaks in the afternoon (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Gong et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Rawat et al., 2011</xref>). Furthermore, <italic>rve8</italic> loss of function mutations cause a long circadian period (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Farinas and Mas, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Rawat et al., 2011</xref>) which is opposite to the phenotypes of <italic>cca1</italic> or <italic>lhy</italic> loss of function mutants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Green and Tobin, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Mizoguchi et al., 2002</xref>). However, despite its ability to bind to the EE in the <italic>TOC1</italic> and <italic>PRR5</italic> promoters in planta, loss of RVE8 function does not significantly affect the transcript levels of these evening genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Farinas and Mas, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Rawat et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Hsu and Harmer, 2012</xref>), perhaps due to genetic redundancy or complex feedback regulation within the clock system. Here, we used an inducible RVE8 line and genome-wide expression profiling to identify hundreds of clock-regulated genes controlled by RVE8. Experiments with an inhibitor of translation revealed that most evening-phased clock genes are directly induced by RVE8. Consistent with RVE8 acting via the EE regulatory motif, we found that genes induced by RVE8 are enriched for the EE in their promoter regions. Furthermore, plants mutant for <italic>RVE8</italic> and its two closest homologs, <italic>RVE4</italic> and <italic>RVE6</italic>, have lost the afternoon-phased EE-binding activity. Finally, <italic>rve4 rve6 rve8</italic> triple mutants display an extremely long circadian period, with delayed and reduced expression of evening-phased clock genes. Together, these data suggest a considerably revised model of the plant clock, with an indispensable role for activators of transcription within the circadian regulatory network. Our work shows that rather than consisting of discrete, interlocked feedback loops, the plant circadian oscillator is more accurately described as a highly interconnected complex network.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>RVE8 activity is stronger in the afternoon</title><p>To identify RVE8 target genes, we generated a line with rapidly inducible RVE8 activity.

Since most RVE8-repressed genes are also morning-phased CCGs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2H</xref>), we compared the frequency of these motifs between RVE8-repressed and all morning-phased CCGs.

The similar frequency of these two motifs in these two groups indicates that RVE8 activity is not preferentially correlated with the morning-phased related <italic>cis</italic>-regulatory elements.

Genes regulated by RVE8 both in the presence or absence of CHX would be considered direct targets while those only regulated by RVE8 in the absence of CHX would be considered indirect targets. CHX treatment increased the accumulation of transcripts regulated by the nonsense mediated mRNA decay (NMD) pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Carter et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Arciga-Reyes et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Kurihara et al., 2009</xref>), suggesting that CHX treatment reduced or blocked translation as expected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1A–C</xref>). Consistent with a role for RVE8 in activation of evening genes via direct binding to the EE, all of the EE-containing, evening-phased central clock and output genes examined are robustly induced by RVE8 even in the presence of CHX (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A–F</xref>). In contrast, the RVE8-mediated repression of expression of all tested morning genes is reduced or abolished in the presence of CHX (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1D–G</xref>), suggesting that RVE8 represses these genes indirectly.

This may be due to partial genetic redundancy, since there are four other close RVE8 homologs (RVE3, 4, 5, and 6) in the Arabidopsis genome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Rawat et al., 2009</xref>) and all of these proteins were found to bind to the EE (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Gong et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Rawat et al., 2011</xref>).

Similarly, at the third subjective morning (around ZT48), <italic>PRR5</italic> and <italic>TOC1</italic> trough levels display an approximately 9-hr phase delay in the triple mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5I,J</xref>) while an approximately 6-hr phase delay is observed in the peak expression levels for <italic>CCA1</italic> and <italic>LHY</italic> at that time (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5G,H</xref>). This greater phase delay for evening compared to morning genes can be seen more clearly when plants grown in constant conditions are sampled at 1-hr intervals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5M,O</xref>). In addition, a significant change in the waveform of the evening gene <italic>TOC1</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5M</xref>) but not the morning gene <italic>LHY</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5O</xref>) is observed in the triple mutant in this high-resolution time course. Notably, the obvious change in the <italic>TOC1</italic> waveform is lost when these same data are plotted at 3-hr resolution (compare <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5N,M</xref>). Our data show that loss of multiple RVEs has an immediate effect on expression of evening genes and a delayed effect on morning genes, further supporting the main role of RVE8 as an activator of evening genes.

Mechanisms governing the precise timing of circadian clock and output gene expression are therefore of great interest. It has previously been reported in both plants and mammals that central clock genes can directly regulate many output genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Gendron et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Menet et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Nakamichi et al., 2012</xref>). Our finding that hundreds of clock-regulated genes are induced or repressed upon induction of RVE8 suggests RVE8 is an important regulator of both the clock itself and output pathways.</p><p>It seems likely that RVE8 is a direct activator of many evening-phased genes. EE sequences are significantly enriched among RVE8-induced targets relative to all evening-phased genes (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1A</xref>). In addition, RVE8 binds to EE sequences in vivo and in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Gong et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Rawat et al., 2011</xref>) and plants mutant for <italic>RVE8</italic> and its close homologs <italic>RVE4</italic> and <italic>RVE6</italic> have lost an afternoon-phased EE binding activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>). Furthermore, for all genes tested, activation of evening-phased genes by RVE8 does not require new protein synthesis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). In contrast, genes repressed upon induction of RVE8 activity are primarily morning-phased and are not enriched for any promoter motif relative to all clock-regulated morning-phased genes (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1B</xref>), suggesting RVE8 regulates these genes indirectly. In support of a largely indirect role for RVE8 in repression of gene expression, inhibition of translation reduced or eliminated decreases in gene expression upon RVE8 induction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1D–G</xref>). Thus RVE8 is unique among Arabidopsis clock genes in that it acts primarily, and perhaps even exclusively, as an activator of gene expression.</p><p>Unlike CCA1 and LHY, which were shown to have similar activity at different time of day in ethanol-inducible lines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Knowles et al., 2008</xref>), we have found that RVE8 activity is gated with maximum activity in the afternoon (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>).

Most RVE8-induced transcripts have a peak circadian phase between CT8 and CT12 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G</xref>), approximately 2–6 hr after the peak phase of RVE8 protein levels. This delay in RVE8 target gene transcript accumulation relative to RVE8 protein might be explained by antagonistic regulation of target genes by RVE8 and the cycling repressors CCA1 and LHY. CCA1 and LHY protein levels peak in the subjective morning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Wang and Tobin, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kim et al., 2003</xref>), well before RVE8. A mathematical model investigating the consequences of oppositely acting transcription factors on regulation of a common target gene predicted that when the phase of a cycling transcriptional repressor precedes that of a cycling transcriptional activator (‘repressor-precedes activator’), the peak phase of expression of the output would occur after that of the activator (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Ueda et al., 2005</xref>).</p><p>The genes both induced by RVE8 and containing EE motifs in their promoter regions are the most likely direct targets of RVE8. Although most clock-controlled genes containing an EE have an evening phase, the EE-containing RVE8-induced genes are more specifically enriched for an early-evening phase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>), suggesting that RVE8 controls a subset of EE-containing genes. How these RVE8 targets are distinct from the rest of the EE-containing CCGs remains unclear. The clock may fine-tune expression of EE-containing genes through the action of multiple clock-controlled promoter motifs, generating the wide range of phases seen across all EE-containing genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). For example, it has been reported that a combination of morning-, day-, and night-phased DNA elements generates the day-phased expression of <italic>Cry1</italic> in mammalian cells. In this case, the strength of night-phased repressors relative to the day-phased activators modulates the extent of phase delay (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Ukai-Tadenuma et al., 2011</xref>).</p><p>The RVE8 homologs RVE4, 5 and 6 have also been found associated with the EE in extracts made from plants harvested in the afternoon, suggesting that they might act in a similar manner to RVE8 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Rawat et al., 2011</xref>).

The loss of afternoon-phased EE binding activity seen in the <italic>rve4 rve6 rve8</italic> triple mutants but not in <italic>rve8</italic> single mutants (data not shown) suggests these RVEs contribute to the activity of the clock-regulated afternoon-phased EE activator.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>The long period in <italic>rve4 rve6 rve8</italic> is likely due to delayed expression of evening genes</title><p>Among the evening-phased central clock genes examined, all show significantly reduced and delayed expression in LD and in LL in <italic>rve4 rve6 rve8</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>). The long period in <italic>rve4 rve6 rve8</italic> mutants might in principle be due either to a decrease in peak levels or a delay in onset of expression of evening genes. However, consideration of the phenotypes of plants mutant for various evening-phased clock genes makes us favor the latter possibility. <italic>toc1</italic> and <italic>prr5</italic> mutants have short-period phenotypes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Strayer et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Eriksson et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Yamamoto et al., 2003</xref>); loss of <italic>GI</italic> causes a short period in most conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Park et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Mizoguchi et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Martin-Tryon et al., 2007</xref>); and <italic>lux</italic> and <italic>elf4</italic> mutants are arrhythmic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Doyle et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Onai and Ishiura, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Hazen et al., 2005b</xref>). Therefore, reduced expression of any of these EE-containing evening genes is unlikely to cause the long period phenotype displayed by <italic>rve4 rve6 rve8</italic>. On the other hand, the delayed phase of expression of clock genes can first be observed in evening-phased genes and only later in morning-phased genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). This suggests that the long period seen in <italic>rve4 rve6 rve8</italic> is mainly caused by delayed expression of evening genes, which then indirectly causes a delayed phase of expression of morning genes. In support of this idea, in <italic>RVE8</italic>-overexpressing plants (which have a short-period phenotype), the peak phase of expression of <italic>TOC1</italic> is clearly advanced soon after plants are released into free-run whereas phase advances are not seen for the morning-phased genes <italic>CCA1</italic> and <italic>LHY</italic> until much later (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Rawat et al., 2011</xref>). Similarly, delays in the phase of post-transcriptional processes have previously been suggested to contribute to long-period phenotypes in animals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Rothenfluh et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Syed et al., 2011</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3-4"><title>The EE is a regulatory nexus crucial for clock function</title><p>Most clock components in Arabidopsis are either regulated by the EE (including most evening-phased genes and one day-phased gene, <italic>PRR9</italic>) or regulate the EE (two morning-phased components, CCA1 and LHY, and the afternoon-phased activator, RVE8) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>). However, plants mutant for <italic>CCA1</italic> and <italic>LHY</italic>, the sole previously defined circadian regulators of EE-containing clock genes, have persistent circadian rhythms, albeit with a short period (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Alabadi et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Mizoguchi et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Locke et al., 2005</xref>). Our discovery that RVE8 and its homologs are activators of the EE may explain the rhythmicity of <italic>cca1 lhy</italic> mutants. As modeled using Ueda et al's ‘repressor-precedes-activator’ formula (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Ueda et al., 2005</xref>), inhibition in the morning by CCA1 and LHY and activation by RVE8 in the afternoon would result in rhythmic expression of EE target genes with peak expression delayed relative to peak RVE8 protein levels. Reduction or loss of activity of the cycling repressor function (<italic>CCA1</italic>/<italic>LHY</italic>) would result in a phase advance, causing earlier expression of EE-containing target genes, but rhythms would persist due to clock-regulated RVE8 activity. Such a phase advance and consequent short-period phenotype is indeed observed in <italic>cca1</italic> and <italic>lhy</italic> single and double mutants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Green and Tobin, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Mizoguchi et al., 2002</xref>).</p><p>Interestingly, CCA1/LHY and RVE8 contain a similar Myb-like DNA binding domain and belong to the same family of transcription factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Rawat et al., 2009</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">2011</xref>). Even though they have distinct biochemical functions, with CCA1 and LHY serving as repressors and RVE8 as an activator of EE-containing genes, both CCA1/LHY and RVE8 are responsible for shaping the circadian pattern of expression of evening-phased genes. This joint regulation of common targets may explain why circadian rhythms persist upon mutation of the repressor Mybs or the activator Mybs alone.</p></sec><sec id="s3-5"><title>The plant circadian clock consists of a highly interconnected, complex network</title><p>Current models of the plant clock suggest that it is composed of transcription factors that are primarily repressors of gene expression which interact to form interlocked morning and evening feedback loops (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Gendron et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Huang et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Pokhilko et al., 2012</xref>).

Only the reads mapped to the reverse strand were used to calculate the read counts using a custom R script, and these counts were then used in analysis of differential expression.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Differential expression analysis of RNA-seq data</title><p>edgeR was used to generate the pseudo-normalized counts for visualization and to carry out differential gene expression analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Robinson et al., 2010</xref>) using R 2.14.1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">R Development Core Team, 2011</xref>). Transcripts that have at least one count per million in at least three samples were considered expressed genes and kept for downstream analysis. Exact tests were performed using tagwise dispersion and the prior n was set to 6.25. FDR 0.01 was used as a cut-off for differentially expressed genes. Genes significantly differentially expressed between the mock- and DEX-treated transgenic line (<italic>rve8 RVE8::RVE8:GR</italic>), or between the DEX-treated <italic>rve8 RVE8::RVE8:GR</italic> and <italic>rve8</italic> plants, were grouped into RVE8-induced or RVE8-repressed genes. Genes that are responsive to DEX treatment in <italic>rve8</italic> mutant (i.e., the genes significantly differentially expressed between ‘<italic>rve8</italic> + DEX’ and ‘<italic>rve8</italic> + mock’) were removed from the RVE8-induced and RVE8-repressed gene lists. Only the genes uniquely induced or repressed by RVE8 (i.e., not showing the same trend in <italic>rve8</italic>) were used for further analysis.

The 376 RVE8-induced cycling genes (64% of the induced genes) and 525 RVE8-repressed cycling genes (62% of the repressed genes) were subjected to phase and motif analysis. Distributions of the phases of the RVE8-induced and -repressed clock-regulated genes were plotted using the density function in R (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">R Development Core Team, 2011</xref>). Overrepresented motifs in the promoters of RVE8-regulated genes were identified using the <italic>SCOPE</italic> motif finder (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Carlson et al., 2007</xref>). Fixed regions of 1500 bp upstream of the translational start site (corresponding to both strands) of RVE8-regulated genes were used for computation of significance compared to all the genes in the genome. Significance is the negative logarithm of expectation. Significance greater than zero is statistically meaningful; the larger the significance value, the higher its statistical significance. Coverage indicates the percentage of genes that have at least one occurrence of the motif in question. The fractions of genes containing the top-scoring motifs among the evening-phased (CT 8 to CT 14) and morning-phased (CT 20 to CT 2) RVE8 targets were compared to the fractions found in all of the clock-regulated genes in the corresponding phase group. Fisher's exact test was performed in R to examine if the presence of these motifs in RVE8 targets is enriched compared to their presence in the evening- and morning-phased genes.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Analysis of gene expression (qRT-PCR)</title><p>For gene expression in diurnal cycles, around 30 seedlings per sample were grown under 12 hr white light (50–60 µmol/m<sup>2</sup>/s, generated using cool white fluorescent bulbs):12 hr dark at 22°C for 7 days and harvested at the times indicated.

An edited version of the letter sent to the authors after peer review is shown, indicating the substantive concerns or comments; minor concerns are not usually shown. Reviewers have the opportunity to discuss the decision before the letter is sent (see <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.elifesciences.org/the-journal/review-process">review process</ext-link>). Similarly, the author response typically shows only responses to the major concerns raised by the reviewers.</p></boxed-text><p>Thank you for choosing to send your work entitled “Accurate timekeeping is controlled by a cycling activator in Arabidopsis” for consideration at <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been evaluated by a Senior editor, Detlef Weigel, and 2 reviewers, one of whom, Joanne Chory, is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors. The reviewers were enthusiastic about your studies and found them to be very timely. We are thus is pleased to provisionally accept your paper for publication in <italic>eLife,</italic> subject to you performing one additional experiment.</p><p>After consultation, the reviewers agreed that the major unresolved issue is that the triple <italic>rve</italic> mutant is not arrhythmic, precluding you from concluding whether these proteins are integral members of the clock, or more accurately, should be considered an input of clock activity. The final test would require having a sextuple mutant (<italic>cca1 lhy rve8 rve6 rve5 rve4</italic>) and then there would be two predictions. 1) The mutant is arrhythmic, making a convincing case that all the members of this set of single Myb domain proteins are key clock components, essential for generating circadian rhythms. 2) Alternatively, the shortening and lengthening period effects of the CCA1 and RVE8 subsets are compensated and you might conclude that these Mybs simply modulate the clock, presumably linking it to the light input. The reviewers felt it would be extremely important to be able to test the above possibilities with the sextuple knock out, but this is perhaps outside the range of the present manuscript. Rather, the following solution is offered: to strengthen your case for desynchronization of morning/evening genes, the reviewers are asking you to sample additional time points of the triple KO vs wt for a single representative each of the morning and evening genes (e.g., CCA1 and TOC1).</p><p>A second, minor point was mentioned by one of the reviewers. To quote:</p><p>“The current view in the field is that CCA1 and LHY are both repressors of evening genes such as PRR1, and activators of morning genes such as PRR9 and PRR7. So, the current model still has one set of activators, which in addition are positively regulated by light. The authors indicate in the text that the actual model is ‘mostly’ based on repressors, so I understand that you are acknowledging that at least one set of activators are present. The information added is substantial anyway. So far, only the morning loop had activators (CCA1 and LHY activating PRR9 and PRR7), the evening loop had only repressors, and both loops were connected through repressors. The results of the genomic analysis of RVE8 targets, combined with knowledge that RVE8 binds to the EE, and the bioinformatic evaluation of the distribution of the EE among targets, shows that RVE8 is mainly a direct activator of evening genes and an indirect repressor of morning genes. This makes RVE8 and its close homologs RVE4 and RVE6 the only components of the clock that positively connect morning and evening loops. The authors should state the novelty of their finding a bit more explicitly, so they avoid leading the readers to the erroneous conclusion that the current clock is ‘exclusively’ based on repressors.”</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.00473.018</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>After consultation, the reviewers agreed that the major unresolved issue is that the triple rve mutant is not arrhythmic, precluding you from concluding whether these proteins are integral members of the clock, or more accurately, should be considered an input of clock activity.

This is certainly one of our long-term goals.</p><p>We also thank the reviewers for suggesting sampling additional time points.

We feel this substantiates our conclusion that evening clock genes are direct targets of RVE activity, whereas morning genes are indirect targets.</p><p><italic>“The current view in the field is that CCA1 and LHY are both repressors of evening genes such as PRR1, and activators of morning genes such as PRR9 and PRR7.

We have revised the Abstract and included a new paragraph in the Discussion (“The plant circadian clock consists of a highly interconnected, complex network”) to emphasize our findings more explicitly. Specifically, we demonstrated that these RVEs are primarily (and perhaps exclusively) activators of gene expression. Further, our findings suggest that it is better to view the plant clock as a highly interconnected complex network rather than consisting of coupled morning and evening transcriptional feedback loops.</p></body></sub-article></article>
