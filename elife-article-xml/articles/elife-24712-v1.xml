This process is made possible by adult stem cells, which can divide to produce more stem cells (via a process called self-renewal) or specialize into other types of cells. This means that stem cells can maintain their own population by self-renewal while continually being able to generate specialized cells that replenish tissues and organs.</p><p>Mouse incisor teeth are useful models to understand how adult organs are regenerated because, unlike human teeth, the incisor teeth of mice and other rodents grow continuously throughout the life of the animal. The tip of the mouse incisor is eroded as the animal eats, resulting in the loss of cells. A group of adult stem cells at the base of the tooth produce new cells that then move to the tip to replace the lost cells.</p><p>Although virtually all cells in the body have the same set of genes, only small subsets are active in each cell type. It is possible to distinguish cells of different types by their patterns of gene activity. However, little is known about the gene expression patterns that distinguish stem cells and specialized cells in mouse incisors.</p><p>Using a technique called gene co-expression analysis, Seidel et al. set out to identify all the genes that are active in stem cells and their descendants at the base of the mouse incisor. The experiments reveal the patterns of activity of thousands of genes, providing a clearer picture of the different cell types present and the biological processes at play. Seidel et al. then used other techniques to identify two genes that can be used as markers to identify distinct types of stem cells in the incisor.</p><p>The next steps following on from this work will be to understand in more detail how stem cells behave in renewing the incisor.

An emerging model for studying adult mammalian tissue renewal is the rodent incisor, which grows continuously throughout the animal’s life. As with many renewing organs, the differentiated cell types of the rodent incisor have a limited life span and are lost over time. A number of cell types, including the ameloblasts and odontoblasts that secrete the mineralized enamel and dentin, respectively, are constantly generated by progenitors located at the proximal end of the tooth (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A,B</xref>). These cells replenish the tissues that are lost from the distal end of the tooth due to abrasion during gnawing. In the epithelial compartment, stem cell progeny leave the niche, known as the labial cervical loop (laCL), as they begin the process of differentiation, and they then enter a transit-amplifying (T-A) zone and proliferate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Hu et al., 2014</xref>). These cells then differentiate, secrete matrix, and finally undergo apoptosis, all the while gradually advancing towards the distal tip of the organ. This linearity, akin to a conveyor belt, makes the incisor a useful model system to study adult epithelial tissue homeostasis, as tissue renewal occurs in an easily-observed proximo-distal fashion, whereby cells at increasingly advanced stages of maturation are found at progressively more distal locations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A,B</xref>). The organization of the mesenchyme has been less well-studied than the epithelium, but this tissue also has distinct compartments comprised of progenitors that give rise to various differentiated cell types, including the dentin-producing odontoblasts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Feng et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Kaukua et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Zhao et al., 2014</xref>). A tissue complex of mesenchymal origin known as the periodontium wraps the incisor growth region and anchors the tooth in the jaw (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Nanci and Bosshardt, 2006</xref>).<fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.24712.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Analysis of transcriptional co-variation in adult mouse incisor reveals gene co-expression modules.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Diagram depicting sagittal view of right lower jaw of a mouse. (<bold>B</bold>) Schematic of the stem cell-containing region in the proximal (Pr) mouse incisor. Stem cell pools that give rise to epithelial cell types (purple) are located in the proximal portion of the lingual and labial cervical loops (liCL, laCL). Mesenchymal cell types of the incisor (yellow), such as the dentin (De)-secreting odontoblasts (Od), are constantly replenished by progenitors located in the mesenchyme between the CLs. Blood vessels (BV) are highly abundant in this region. In the laCL, stem cells located in the outer enamel epithelium (OEE), adjacent proximal stellate reticulum (SR), and stratum intermedium (SI), give rise to highly proliferative transit-amplifying (T–A) cells which, after undergoing mitosis, differentiate along several epithelial lineages as the progeny advance to the distal (Di) tip of the incisor and differentiate into enamel (En)-secreting ameloblasts (Am).

(<bold>D</bold>) Workflow for incisor gene co-expression network construction. RNA samples were used to generate genome-wide microarray expression profiles for 94 intact incisor specimens, which were used as input for unsupervised gene co-expression analysis. Gene co-expression modules consist of transcripts that co-vary and therefore have highly similar expression signatures across all samples (x-axis). Examples of three co-expression modules are shown. The characteristic expression pattern of each module is summarized by its first principal component, or module eigengene (module summaries; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Horvath and Dong, 2008</xref>)). (<bold>E</bold>) Structure of the incisor co-expression network. Twenty-four gene co-expression modules were identified and hierarchically clustered based on eigengene dissimilarity (1 – cor) using average linkage. The correlation matrix of the module eigengenes is depicted below. Blue and red denote positive and negative correlations, respectively, with stronger correlations denoted by thinner ellipses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Murdoch and Chow, 1996</xref>).

The high turnover and short lifespan of differentiated cell types in the incisor indicate that there are active pools of progenitor cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Smith and Warshawsky, 1976</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">1975</xref>). In vivo lineage tracing assays have identified <italic>Gli1</italic> and <italic>Bmi1</italic>-expressing populations of stem cells in both the incisor epithelium and mesenchyme (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Biehs et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Seidel et al., 2010</xref>). Both <italic>Gli1</italic> and <italic>Bmi1</italic> also mark label-retaining cells (LRCs) that divide infrequently and therefore retain BrdU or genetic labels. Within the incisor, LRCs are restricted to the proximal incisor mesenchyme and the proximal part of the laCL and lingual cervical loop (liCL). Additional lineage-tracing studies identified <italic>Sox2</italic> as a stem cell marker in the incisor epithelium but not the mesenchyme (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Juuri et al., 2012</xref>). The properties displayed by <italic>Gli1</italic>-, <italic>Bmi1</italic>- and <italic>Sox2</italic>-expressing cells – slow division kinetics, residence in a discrete niche, and contribution to the differentiation of various lineages – are classically considered to be typical of stem cell populations. To date, only these three markers have been found to label incisor stem cells, and thus a major limitation of the incisor model has been a paucity of markers that clearly distinguish its cell types, including progenitor cells. Indeed, this limitation is not unique to the incisor, as the precise cellular composition of most mammalian organs is still unclear. The ability to clearly distinguish cell types and distinct stages of maturation is an essential prerequisite to understanding renewal and regeneration.</p><p>Gene co-expression analysis is a powerful approach for elucidating transcriptional signatures of distinct cell types in heterogeneous tissue samples (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Oldham et al., 2008</xref>). This approach is based on two straightforward ideas: (i) different cell types express different genes, and (ii) the relative abundance of a given cell type will vary among heterogeneous tissue samples. Therefore, transcript levels of genes that are specifically and consistently expressed by a cell type will appear highly correlated when measured over a large number of biological replicates. We set out to apply this strategy to the proximal adult mouse incisor region, with the goal of identifying transcriptional signatures of progenitor cells and their descendants. We identified modules of co-expressed genes representing differentiated cells, transit-amplifying cells, and residents of stem cell niches. We further demonstrated the power of this approach by using in vivo lineage tracing to define populations of incisor stem cells, and we discovered that two adjacent mesenchymal tissues, the periodontium and dental pulp, are maintained by distinct pools of stem cells. More generally, our data indicate that this strategy provides a useful analytical framework for deconstructing biological systems by identifying recurrent patterns of transcriptional variation driven by large numbers of cells.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Transcriptome analysis of the mouse incisor reveals modules of co-expressed genes</title><p>We micro-dissected proximal incisor samples from 94 six-week-old female CD1 wild-type mice; each tissue sample was heterogeneous and consisted of the entire range of cell types present in the proximal incisor region (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). We profiled transcriptomes using Illumina Mouse Ref 8 v2.0 gene expression BeadChip microarrays, which contain 25,697 probes. Following data pre-processing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Oldham et al., 2012</xref>), we performed genome-wide gene co-expression analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Lui et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Zhang and Horvath, 2005</xref>) and identified 24 modules of co-expressed genes (termed A-X, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). The characteristic expression pattern of each module was summarized by its first principal component, or module eigengene (ME) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Horvath and Dong, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Oldham et al., 2008</xref>), and verified by selecting several markers among the highest ranked genes and conducting in situ hybridization (ISH) analysis. Hierarchical clustering of modules based on eigengene dissimilarity revealed distinct subgroups of modules within the dendrogram (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>), suggesting broad themes of transcriptional co-variation in the incisor.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>A subset of gene co-expression modules corresponds to distinct cell lineages</title><p>We quantified the similarity between the expression patterns of individual genes and the eigengenes of co-expression modules by calculating the Weighted Gene Co-expression Network Analysis (WGCNA) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Zhang and Horvath, 2005</xref>) measure of intramodular connectivity, <italic>k</italic><sub>ME</sub>, for all genes with respect to all modules (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Supplementary file 1</xref>). <italic>k</italic><sub>ME</sub> is defined as the Pearson correlation between the expression pattern of a gene and a ME (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Horvath and Dong, 2008</xref>). Intuitively, the ME summarizes the characteristic expression pattern of genes comprising a module, and <italic>k</italic><sub>ME</sub> quantifies the extent to which individual genes track this pattern. <italic>k</italic><sub>ME</sub> can therefore be used to identify individual genes that best represent a module and mark particular cell types or biological processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Oldham et al., 2008</xref>). To determine how these modules mapped to cell types of the incisor, we initially examined the top 15 genes ranked by <italic>k</italic><sub>ME</sub> and conducted an extensive ontology search using literature available in PubMed. We also examined genes reported to be expressed during late development and postnatal life in the ‘Gene Expression in Tooth’ database (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://bite-it.helsinki.fi/">http://bite-it.helsinki.fi/</ext-link>).</p><p>This analysis immediately suggested that Module A (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>) represents a transcriptional signature of ameloblasts, which are enamel-producing differentiated cells derived from epithelial stem cells in the laCL (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). For example, both <italic>Lamb3</italic> (<italic>k</italic><sub>ME.A</sub>rank = 4) and <italic>Lamc2</italic> (<italic>k</italic><sub>ME.A</sub>rank = 10) encode subunits of Laminin 5 that are expressed by ameloblasts in developing mouse incisors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Yoshiba et al., 2000</xref>).

These data demonstrate that Module A consists of genes that are predominantly expressed in the ameloblast lineage of the adult mouse incisor.</p><p>Next, we investigated expression patterns of genes that were strongly associated with Module C, to determine if the module organization was an effective tool to predict novel markers of odontoblast identity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). As expected, expression of <italic>Phex</italic> (<italic>k</italic><sub>ME.C</sub> rank = 1) was restricted to odontoblasts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Ruchon et al., 1998</xref>). Expression of <italic>Bglap1</italic>, <italic>Blgap2</italic>, and <italic>Bglap-rs1</italic> (<italic>k</italic><sub>ME.C</sub> ranks = 6, 9, 10, 14) was detected with a probe for an mRNA sequence shared by all three genes, confirming specificity to the odontoblast lineage. Expression of <italic>Sag</italic> (<italic>k</italic><sub>ME.C</sub> rank = 7) was also restricted to odontoblasts, while expression of <italic>Lox</italic> (<italic>k</italic><sub>ME.C</sub> rank = 8) showed a more complex pattern, with robust expression in odontoblasts but additional expression in regions where T-A cells are located in epithelium and mesenchyme (arrow and asterisk in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). This discrepancy may reflect biological or technical sources of variability such as additional <italic>Lox</italic> isoforms and/or non-specific targeting by microarray or ISH probes. Overall, these results indicate that Module C consists of genes that are predominantly expressed in the odontoblast lineage.</p><p>To compare the distributions of predicted expression specificity for ameloblasts (<italic>Z</italic>.ameloblast) and odontoblasts (<italic>Z</italic>.odontoblast), we generated standardized, genome-wide histograms of <italic>k</italic><sub>ME</sub> values for each module (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Lui et al., 2014</xref>). We observed that known markers of ameloblasts possessed <italic>Z</italic>.ameloblast &gt;&gt; <italic>Z.</italic>odontoblast, and vice versa. These results indicate that the expression signatures captured by Modules A and C are both sensitive and specific: canonical markers of each cell type have high <italic>k</italic><sub>ME</sub> values for the appropriate module and lower <italic>k</italic><sub>ME</sub> values for the inappropriate module. Importantly, the vast majority of genes with the highest <italic>k</italic><sub>ME</sub> values for these two modules, which are likely to play central roles in the establishment and maintenance of the functional identities of these cell types (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Lui et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Oldham et al., 2008</xref>) have not been characterized in the ameloblast or odontoblast lineages.</p><p>Taken together, these findings establish that gene co-expression analysis of heterogeneous tissue samples can discern and predict transcriptional signatures of the two principal secretory cell types of the adult mouse incisor. We also identified gene co-expression modules corresponding to other differentiated cell types that are present in this biological system (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). For example, over-representation analysis with cell type-specific gene sets revealed that Module J was significantly enriched with experimentally validated markers of oligodendrocytes (p&lt;10<sup>−8</sup>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1B–E</xref>), suggesting that this module corresponds to a transcriptional signature of Schwann cells. Similarly, Module S was significantly enriched with experimentally validated markers of skeletal muscle cells (p&lt;10<sup>−12</sup>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1B</xref>). It appears that this highly specific module resulted from contamination of a small number of tissue samples by cells from the muscle tissue surrounding the jawbones. These modules corroborate the ability of gene co-expression analysis to isolate distinct transcriptional signatures of differentiated cell types from heterogeneous tissue samples in silico while simultaneously providing a broad perspective on the cellular composition of biological systems.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>A subset of gene co-expression modules corresponds to cellular differentiation states</title><p>Although some gene co-expression modules clearly corresponded to specific cell lineages, others were less obvious. To determine which cells in the incisor were responsible for producing the transcriptional patterns captured by these modules, we analyzed expression patterns for at least three of the top 15-ranked members of each module. As a starting point, we chose modules that were strongly positively correlated with Modules A and C and therefore clustered in the left branch of the incisor network dendrogram (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). Interestingly, expression of <italic>Cdkn1a</italic> (<italic>k</italic><sub>ME.B</sub> ranks = 2, 3, 7), <italic>Smox</italic> (<italic>k</italic><sub>ME.B</sub>ranks = 4, 5, 9, 31, 68), and <italic>Atp2b</italic> (<italic>k</italic><sub>ME.B</sub> rank = 8), which were among the highest-ranked members of Module B (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Supplementary file 1</xref>), was detected in epithelium-forming cell types of the ameloblast, stratum intermedium, and odontoblast lineages located distal to the laCL (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1G–I</xref>). Given that a number of genes are expressed in all three lineages during the differentiation and secretory stages of tooth development (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://bite-it.helsinki.fi/">http://bite-it.helsinki.fi/</ext-link>), this finding was not surprising. The expression patterns of these genes, which included factors involved in cell cycle exit, are consistent with the location of Module B in the dendrogram and suggest a close relationship between genes in this module with those that are expressed in the ameloblast and odontoblast lineages. Expression patterns of genes in Modules D and E were similar to those of genes contributing to Module C (data not shown), and genes contributing to Module F, including <italic>Tgfbi</italic> (<italic>k</italic><sub>ME.F</sub> ranks = 1, 2), <italic>Fgfr3</italic> (<italic>k</italic><sub>ME.F</sub> ranks = 11, 99), and <italic>Nes1</italic> (<italic>k</italic><sub>ME.F</sub> ranks = 28, 49), were expressed in the distal dental pulp mesenchyme, but not in the proximal-most pulp cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1J–L</xref>). Thus, expression of genes contributing to Modules A-F was predominantly detected in regions distal to the stem cell niches in the epithelial cervical loops and in the mesenchyme located between these epithelial regions. The clustering of Modules A-F may reflect correlated cellular abundance among these regions, as dissections that include a greater representation of the epithelial niches are more likely to include a greater representation of the mesenchyme between them.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>Transit-amplifying cells are represented by multiple modules</title><p>Functional enrichment analysis indicated that Module U, the second largest co-expression module, was enriched for genes expressed during the mitotic phase of the cell cycle (p=3.1×10<sup>−24</sup>).

We also identified a T-A cell signature in co-expression Modules V, W, and X, which were the modules most strongly positively correlated with Module U (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E–G</xref>, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1I–L</xref>). Similar to the genes contributing to Module U, expression of genes in Modules V, W, and X labeled proliferating cells in both the epithelium or the mesenchyme in all cases. When we extended our follow-up analyses to modules that clustered within the same branch of the dendrogram, but that were less strongly correlated to Module U, we discovered that Modules N-R also represented T-A cell-specific expression signatures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3H–J</xref>, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1A–D</xref>). The surprising finding that T-A cells were represented by multiple closely related modules of co-expressed genes reflects the importance of these actively dividing cells as central executors of incisor renewal as well as the ability of the methodology to unravel detailed gene expression profiles within both epithelial and mesenchymal T-A cell regions. To better understand what the T-A cell-specific modules represent, we analyzed enrichment patterns in these modules for Gene Ontology annotations related to cell proliferation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>). Whereas Modules T-X were enriched in genes involved in processes characteristic of the M-phase of the cell cycle, Modules N-R were enriched in genes involved in biosynthetic and metabolic processes, suggesting roles during interphase, during which cell growth and DNA replication occur. Together, these data indicate that T-A-specific gene co-expression modules may represent distinct biological processes that are integrated to induce or maintain proliferation. They also suggest that these processes may be temporally segregated in subpopulations of T-A cells. The T-A cell-specific modules provide a platform for elucidating the molecular mechanisms that regulate stem cell progeny during this poorly understood stage of maturation.</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>Identification of modules enriched with markers expressed by epithelial progenitors</title><p>We next asked if the handful of stem cell markers that have been identified in the adult mouse incisor through in vivo lineage tracing were associated with particular co-expression modules. <italic>Gli1</italic> and <italic>Bmi1</italic> mark stem cell pools in both the incisor epithelium and mesenchyme, whereas <italic>Sox2</italic> exclusively marks epithelial stem cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Biehs et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Juuri et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Seidel et al., 2010</xref>).

Other genes strongly associated with this putative epithelial progenitor module included <italic>Epha1</italic> and <italic>Prom2</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1A</xref>); like <italic>Sox2</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Juuri et al., 2012</xref>) and <italic>Tbx1</italic>, expression of these genes was restricted to the incisor epithelium and included the proximal regions of the laCL, where we previously detected LRCs. Expression of <italic>Epha1</italic> was found predominantly in stellate reticulum (SR) cells in the laCL and in more distal cells subtending the SR cells adjacent to this region (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1A</xref>). In contrast, expression of <italic>Prom2</italic> appeared to overlap that of <italic>Tbx1</italic> in the T-A cell and pre-ameloblast region as well as in the outer enamel epithelium (OEE) of the laCL (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). In addition to being a highly-ranked gene for Module H, <italic>Prom2</italic> also showed a strong association to the neighboring Module I. Further investigation of Modules G and I, which were strongly positively correlated with Module H and each other (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>), revealed that multiple genes, including <italic>Epha1</italic> and <italic>Prom2</italic>, associated strongly with two or all three modules (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Supplementary file 1</xref>). Therefore, we extended our expression analysis to include the two neighboring modules and treated the G-H-I group of modules as a clustered unit.</p><p>Of the genes primarily contributing to Module G, we analyzed the expression patterns of <italic>Scnn1b</italic> (<italic>k</italic><sub>ME.G</sub> rank = 3), <italic>p63</italic> (k<sub>ME.G</sub> rank = 5), and <italic>Nkx2-3</italic> (<italic>k</italic><sub>ME.G</sub> rank = 11), the last of which was previously shown to be required for molar development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Biben et al., 2002</xref>). All three were expressed predominantly in the T-A and OEE regions of the laCL with no or low levels of expression in the SR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1B</xref>). Expression was not limited to the CL on the labial side but rather extended distally into both the OEE and differentiated ameloblasts and was also found in the liCL. <italic>Isl1</italic> (<italic>k</italic><sub>ME.G</sub> rank = 33), which was previously shown to be expressed exclusively in the incisor epithelium during tooth development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Mitsiadis et al., 2003</xref>), was expressed in the same pattern in the laCL as p63, <italic>Nkx2-3,</italic> and <italic>Scnn1b</italic>, with distally extending expression maintained in the OEE and ameloblasts but decreased levels in the pre-ameloblasts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1C</xref>). The distally extended expression appears characteristic of Module G genes and is reflected in the strong positive correlation of Module G’s eigengene signature with that of the ameloblast-specific Module A (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>), whereas the correlations between Modules H and A as well as I and A were weaker (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>).</p><p>Expression of <italic>Pitx2</italic> (k<sub>ME.I</sub>rank = 2) in the T-A cell and OEE regions of the laCL widely overlapped with the expression domains of <italic>Prom2</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>). <italic>Pitx2</italic> expression appeared to be highest in the apical aspect of the laCL, where <italic>Sox2</italic> is expressed at high levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Juuri et al., 2012</xref>), and was also present in the SR.

However, similar to <italic>Tbx1</italic>, <italic>Epha1</italic> and <italic>Prom2</italic>, expression of <italic>Pitx2</italic> was not detected in the liCL epithelium. <italic>Shh</italic>, which is expressed in epithelial T-A cells, pre-ameloblasts and ameloblasts in the labial incisor epithelium (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Seidel et al., 2010</xref>), was also among the genes contributing to Modules G, H, and I (<italic>k</italic><sub>ME.G</sub>rank = 14, <italic>k</italic><sub>ME.H</sub>rank = 53, and <italic>k</italic><sub>ME.I</sub>rank = 7), which was surprising given the absence of <italic>Shh</italic> expression in the proximal laCL.

Double-labeling experiments using (i) antibody staining against BrdU in wild-type animals that were treated with BrdU followed by a long chase period to generate LRCs and (ii) an antibody against PECAM1 or ISH to detect <italic>Igfbp5</italic> demonstrated that both genes are expressed in LRCs in the incisor mesenchyme and laCL epithelium (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4J–J”</xref>, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1G</xref>); the identity of the PECAM1-positive cells in the epithelium is not clear, but as the epithelium is not vascularized, this marker must label a non-vascular cell type in the epithelium.</p><p>We also noted that expression of genes contributing to Modules K-M was predominantly observed in cells of the periodontium (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E–G</xref>, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1E–G’</xref>), which is the tissue responsible for anchoring the tooth to the alveolar bone. While little is known about the periodontal tissue in the incisor, previous studies that mostly focused on molar teeth identified a small number of genes expressed in periodontal cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2-data">Supplementary file 2</xref>). Comparison with the data obtained from our co-expression analysis showed that most of these factors were associated with Modules K, L, and M, suggesting that this group of modules is driven primarily by gene expression in periodontal cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2-data">Supplementary file 2</xref>). The expression of these markers in the proximal part of the tooth suggested that these modules may be enriched for candidate stem cell markers and genes required for periodontal tissue maintenance. The relative expression patterns of the modules are presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4O</xref>.</p><p>To test whether our analysis could enable functional identification of a stem cell population, we next focused on <italic>Igfbp5</italic>, which was the highest ranked gene contributing to Module K and was previously found to be increased in LRCs in the hair follicle bulge (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Tumbar et al., 2004</xref>). To establish whether <italic>Igfbp5</italic> marks stem cells in the incisor, we generated a tamoxifen-inducible <italic>Igfbp5<sup>iCre-ERT2</sup></italic> allele that drives expression of <italic>Cre</italic> recombinase without reducing <italic>Igfbp5</italic> expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2</xref>), and we bred mice carrying both this allele and the <italic>Ai14</italic> (<italic>R26<sup>RFP</sup></italic>) reporter allele (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Madisen et al., 2010</xref>) to perform in vivo lineage tracing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4K</xref>). 24 hr after tamoxifen treatment of the double-heterozygous animals, RFP expression was detected in cells of the periodontium, the liCL and in the proximal portion and OEE of the laCL, as well as in a number of cells in the alveolar nerve that innervates the incisor. Thus, reporter expression was found in regions of the proximal incisor where we detected <italic>Igfbp5</italic> mRNA expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4J–J”</xref>), and we proceeded to perform lineage analyses using the <italic>Igfbp5<sup>iCre-ERT2</sup></italic> driver. 14 days after treatment with tamoxifen, the number of RFP-positive cells in the incisor mesenchyme surrounding the cervical loops and within the laCL and distally adjacent epithelium was strongly increased when compared to 24 hr post-induction, suggesting that the originally labeled <italic>Igfbp5</italic>-expressing cells supply new cells in these regions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4M</xref>). A similar distribution of RFP-labeled cells was present 1 month after tamoxifen treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4N</xref>). Interestingly, except for a small number of RFP-labeled cells whose morphology and locations were consistent with a neurobiological identity, RFP-positive cells were absent from the inner dental pulp mesenchyme and remained restricted to the periodontal portion of the incisor mesenchyme. These findings suggest that <italic>Igfbp5</italic>-expressing cells contribute to epithelial and periodontium homeostasis without contributing to maintenance of the pulp compartment.</p><p>Notably, <italic>Lrig1</italic>, a marker of stem cells in the intestine and the skin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Jensen and Watt, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Powell et al., 2012</xref>) not previously identified in incisor stem cells, was represented in Module L. Consistent with this observation, <italic>Lrig1</italic> was expressed in the proximal incisor mesenchyme and laCL epithelium but not in pulp cells, odontoblasts or differentiated epithelial cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4G</xref>). ISH yielded a relatively low signal for <italic>Lrig1</italic> when compared to most other genes analyzed for this group of modules, which may suggest transcription at low levels or expression in a subset of cells within the domain. To determine if <italic>Lrig1</italic> is expressed by LRCs, we crossed a tamoxifen-inducible <italic>Lrig1<sup>Cre-ERT2</sup></italic> mouse line (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Powell et al., 2012</xref>) with the <italic>R26<sup>RFP</sup></italic> reporter allele. To generate LRCs, <italic>Lrig1<sup>Cre-ERT/+</sup>;R26<sup>RFP/+</sup></italic> newborn mice were injected with BrdU and aged for 8 weeks (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>). Double immunofluorescence assays against BrdU and RFP were performed in specimens from mice chased for 24 hr after tamoxifen administration; the short chase period was used to mark <italic>Lrig1</italic>-positive cells. This experiment confirmed the presence of <italic>Lrig1</italic>-expressing LRCs in the proximal laCL epithelium and the most proximal incisor mesenchyme (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B–B”</xref>), indicating that some <italic>Lrig1</italic>-expressing cells are quiescent. Interestingly, in the mesenchyme-derived portion of the incisor, the BrdU-LRC population was comprised of two neighboring subdomains that appear as stripes in the two-dimensional sections: an <italic>Lrig1</italic>-negative inner, or distal, region and an <italic>Lrig1</italic>-positive proximal region (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>). RFP also marked cells in the alveolar nerve, and occasionally single RFP-positive cells were observed within the liCL and in blood vessels. However, RFP was not detected in differentiated cells of the epithelium or within the pulp mesenchyme. Thus, expression of the <italic>Lrig1<sup>Cre-ERT2</sup></italic> allele was restricted to regions in the incisor where <italic>Lrig1</italic> mRNA is expressed and included some, but not all, BrdU-LRCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4G</xref>).<fig-group><fig id="fig5" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.24712.013</object-id><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><title><italic>Lrig1</italic> marks stem cell pools in the epithelium and mesenchyme of the mouse incisor.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Experimental design for testing <italic>Lrig1</italic> expression by label-retaining cells (LRCs).

As before, 24 hr after treatment with tamoxifen, we detected RFP-positive cells in the LRC-containing regions of the incisor, including the laCL and the mesenchymal tissue surrounding both CLs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E–E”</xref>); no RFP was detected in the dental pulp mesenchyme between the CLs or in tissues of uninduced <italic>Lrig1<sup>Cre-ERT2/+</sup>;R26<sup>RFP/+</sup></italic> control animals (data not shown). 14 days after the initial labeling, <italic>Lrig1</italic>-positive cells remained restricted to the proximal laCL epithelium, and RFP-positive cells were absent from the T-A and differentiated cell regions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F–F&quot;</xref>). Short BrdU chases performed on the lineage tracing specimens revealed that the only proliferative populations were the epithelial and flanking mesenchymal T-A cells, with the periodontium remaining BrdU-negative (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>).</p><p>Next, we wished to determine the relationship between expression of <italic>Lrig1</italic> and <italic>Gli1</italic>, an established marker of both epithelial and mesenchymal stem cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Seidel et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Zhao et al., 2014</xref>). We found that <italic>Lrig1</italic> expression, as reflected by CreER-mediated RFP expression 24 hr after tamoxifen administration, largely overlaps with <italic>Gli1</italic> in <italic>Lrig1<sup>Cre-ERT2/+</sup>;R26<sup>RFP/+</sup>;Gli1<sup>lacZ/+</sup></italic>mice; however, <italic>Lrig1</italic> is more restricted in the SR and absent from the most apical portion of the <italic>Gli1<sup>lacZ</sup></italic>-positive domain of the laCL (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>). In the mesenchyme, RFP-positive cells were relatively sparse compared to cells expressing <italic>Gli1<sup>lacZ</sup>,</italic> and these populations do not co-localize in the dental pulp. In the mesenchyme surrounding the CLs, both double-positive or RFP-positive cells that did not express <italic>Gli1<sup>lacZ</sup></italic> were detected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C’</xref>). Thus, <italic>Lrig1</italic>-positive cells constitute a subdomain of the <italic>Gli1</italic>-expressing cells in the laCL epithelium, but not in the incisor mesenchyme.</p><p>Given the apparent overlap of <italic>Gli1</italic> and <italic>Lrig1</italic> expression, we found it surprising that <italic>Lrig1<sup>Cre-ERT2/+</sup>;R26<sup>RFP/+</sup></italic> did not exhibit labeled progeny in differentiated or T-A cells, especially because progeny formation from cells marked by <italic>Gli1</italic>, <italic>Sox2</italic>, or <italic>Bmi1</italic> were detected within days after tamoxifen administration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Biehs et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Juuri et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Seidel et al., 2010</xref>). However, one month post-induction, a small number of labeled cells was present amongst the T-A cells, as well as in the SR, SI and ameloblasts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5G–G”</xref>). After 6 months, the number of RFP-positive cells in the T-A region and SR had increased, and the majority of ameloblasts, SI cells and OEE cells were labeled (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5H–H”</xref>). The extent of RFP labeling in specimens that were analyzed 3 months or 12 months after tamoxifen administration was comparable to the 6 month time point (data not shown). Thus, <italic>Lrig1</italic> is expressed by long-lived stem cells located in the OEE and/or SR of the laCL that give rise to cells of all epithelial lineages over long periods of time. The delay in appearance of labeled progeny in the T-A cell region when compared to lineage tracing performed for <italic>Gli1</italic> and other markers previously tested (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Biehs et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Juuri et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Seidel et al., 2010</xref>), together with the absence of <italic>Lrig1</italic>-positive cells from the <italic>Gli1</italic>-expressing population adjacent to the T-A cell region, suggests that <italic>Lrig1</italic> marks a relatively quiescent progenitor pool.</p><p>In the proximal incisor mesenchyme, the number of RFP-positive cells strongly increased 14 days after induction with tamoxifen (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F</xref>), suggesting that <italic>Lrig1</italic>-positive cells in this region turn over more rapidly when compared to epithelial cells that express <italic>Lrig1</italic>. Similar numbers of RFP-positive cells were observed in the mesenchyme surrounding the CLs in specimens that were analyzed one, 3, 6 or 12 months post-tamoxifen (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5G</xref> and data not shown). Interestingly, RFP-positive cells were absent from the mesenchyme of the dental pulp, the compartment surrounded by the dental epithelium, but rather were restricted to the periodontal tissue surrounding the epithelial cervical loops on the outer surface of the incisor. Together, these data demonstrate that <italic>Lrig1</italic> marks two distinct pools of stem cells, one in the incisor epithelium that enables renewal of epithelial cell types, such as ameloblasts, and one in the proximal mesenchyme that produces cells contributing to the periodontium. These fate mapping experiments further revealed that the periodontal mesenchyme in the incisor is maintained by a mesenchymal stem cell pool that is separate from the progenitors that maintain the mesenchymal cells of the dental pulp, pointing to the existence of distinct subpopulations of mesenchymal stem cells in the incisor.</p></sec><sec id="s2-7"><title>Periodontal stem cell populations marked by Lrig1 and Acta2 partially overlap and mediate renewal of distinct regions of the periodontium</title><p>We further interrogated renewal of the periodontium by examining <italic>Acta2</italic>, a gene that had high rankings for Module L (which contained <italic>Lrig1</italic>) based on data from three different microarray probes (<italic>k</italic><sub>ME.L</sub>ranks = 120, 150, 200; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Supplementary file 1</xref>).

Similar to what we observed when investigating the fate of <italic>Lrig1</italic>-positive cells, the number of RFP-positive cells in the periodontal mesenchyme increased between the 24 hr and 7 day time points (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4—figure supplement 3D</xref>). In contrast, the number of labeled cells detected after longer chase periods appeared to remain constant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4—figure supplement 3F</xref>) and RFP-positive cells were still present 6 months after tamoxifen treatment (data not shown).

Interestingly, the progeny of <italic>Lrig1</italic>-positive cells that were labeled three months prior to analysis did not contribute to all regions of the periodontal mesenchyme marked by ACTA2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4—figure supplement 3H</xref>). Whereas expression overlapped in a domain surrounding the ACTA2-negative inner portion of the periodontium, RFP-positive cells were absent from the outermost layer of periodontal tissue, close to the bone. We also assessed co-localization of <italic>Lrig1</italic> descendants with cells expressing N-CAM, a gene that is broadly expressed in the periodontal tissue of the incisor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Obara and Takeda, 1997</xref>) and that showed strong membership for Module L (<italic>k</italic><sub>ME.L</sub>ranks = 39, 206; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Supplementary file 1</xref>). This analysis confirmed that descendants of <italic>Lrig1</italic>-expressing cells contributed to the inner but not outer periodontal mesenchyme (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4—figure supplement 3I</xref>). In contrast, progeny of cells marked by <italic>Acta2</italic> expression were found in the outer portion of the periodontium but absent from the periodontal tissue directly surrounding the incisor epithelium (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4—figure supplement 3D–G</xref>). Thus, the inner (near the tooth) region of the periodontal mesenchyme is preferentially renewed by <italic>Lrig1</italic>-expressing progenitors, whereas the outer (near the bone) region is renewed by <italic>Acta2</italic>-expressing progenitors. Together, these data identify subpopulations of periodontal progenitors, marked by <italic>Lrig1</italic> and <italic>Acta2</italic> expression, that promote renewal of distinct regions of periodontal tissues during incisor homeostasis.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><sec id="s3-1"><title>Gene co-expression analysis elucidates the cellular composition and interplay of biological processes required during renewal of the adult mouse incisor</title><p>Here we set out to characterize the cellular composition of the adult mouse incisor and identify cell type-specific markers by analyzing patterns of transcriptional co-variation in a large number of biological replicates. The results from this study provide strong evidence that correlated gene expression patterns are driven by variation in the abundance of distinct cell types and cell states. We identified transcriptional signatures driven primarily by ameloblasts, odontoblasts, Schwann cells, and skeletal muscle cells. The ability to detect a transcriptional signature of a cell type through gene co-expression analysis of intact tissue specimens depends on many factors, including the abundance of the cell type, the distinctiveness of its transcriptome, its anatomical distribution with respect to other cell types, the technology platform, the sampling strategy, and the algorithmic approach (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Oldham, 2014</xref>). Therefore, different cell types will have different signal to noise ratios. For example, ameloblasts and odontoblasts are abundant, differentiated cell types with distinctive transcriptomes that were easily detected with our strategy. In contrast, Schwann cells are much less abundant but co-express a unique set of genes that allowed them to clearly stand out in the incisor co-expression network. Optimization of some of the factors listed above (e.g. RNA-seq analysis of a larger number of samples) should improve the sensitivity of our approach.</p><p>We also identified transcriptional signatures related to distinct states of cellular differentiation, including the progenitor state, transit-amplifying state, and cell cycle exit at the onset of differentiation. Among the patterns corresponding to differentiation states, we identified modules representing stem cell progeny far along in their maturation process within distinct compartments as well as compartment-specific modules enriched for genes expressed by progenitors. For example, one newly identified progenitor marker, <italic>Lrig1</italic>, discriminates subpopulations of <italic>Gli1</italic>-positive epithelial progenitors that appear to have different capacities to provide daughter cells for replenishing the organ. By providing an unbiased view of the major transcriptional themes in the adult mouse incisor, our study lays the groundwork for future investigations into molecular interactions that are required to establish or maintain the functional identities of distinct cell types and cell states in this model system. Unbiased gene co-expression analysis of intact biological systems also provides a data-driven framework for studying the effects of perturbations, such as blocking a specific molecular pathway or causing injury. By comparing transcriptional co-variation in perturbed and naive states through differential co-expression analysis, identification of relevant phenotypes that affect specific cell types or cell states can be accelerated.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Gene co-expression analysis vs. single-cell approaches</title><p>Single-cell methods have come of age and hold great promise for gene expression applications. However, technical noise and limited coverage of cells and transcriptomes can constrain the use of this strategy for unbiased characterization of intact biological systems. In contrast, gene co-expression analysis of bulk tissue specimens is a comparatively simple and efficient approach that can reveal the major building blocks of a biological system’s transcriptome by analyzing expression patterns that are derived simultaneously from millions of cells. Thus, these two types of analyses can be seen as complementary with regard to resolution and tissue volume analyzed. From a practical perspective, the presence of genes encoding cell-surface proteins in the co-expression modules we have identified will simplify the isolation, purification, and detailed characterization of individual cell populations using single-cell methods, which will be an important next step.</p><p>It is also important to note that the microarrays used in this study have limited dynamic range and sample almost exclusively from the protein-coding transcriptome. Therefore, the full picture of gene expression in the adult mouse incisor is likely to be more complex than the initial description presented here. Future surveys that combine deep sequencing of coding and non-coding transcripts from large numbers of intact tissue specimens and single cells will provide a powerful approach for deconstructing the transcriptional architecture of the incisor and other biological systems. In addition, because our studies here exclusively used two-dimensional section analysis, it will be important in the future to analyze proximal incisor gene expression patterns in three dimensions as well.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Lineage potential of adult stem cells marked by Igfbp5 or Lrig1</title><p>In this study, we discovered several co-expression modules enriched with genes that are predominantly expressed in the LRC-containing regions of the proximal incisor mesenchyme. Amongst the genes with expression profiles most similar to Modules K and L were <italic>Igfbp5</italic> and <italic>Lrig1. Lrig1</italic> is expressed in stem cells in the intestine and skin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Jensen et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Jensen and Watt, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Powell et al., 2012</xref>), and <italic>Igfbp5</italic> is transcribed by LRCs in the hair follicle bulge (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Tumbar et al., 2004</xref>). Interestingly, co-labeling with BrdU-LRCs revealed that expression of both <italic>Igfbp5</italic> and <italic>Lrig1</italic> divides the mesenchymal LRC population into an inner subpopulation that does not express either gene and an outer region where <italic>Igfbp5</italic> and <italic>Lrig1</italic> expression are found. Lineage tracing for <italic>Igfbp5</italic> and <italic>Lrig1</italic> revealed that the outer LRC-containing region of the mesenchyme contains progenitors that contribute specifically to periodontal cell lineages but not mesenchymal cells of the dental pulp. This finding demonstrates for the first time that the inner mesenchyme and the periodontal tissue in this continuously growing tooth are maintained by separate pools of progenitors. The extent to which the <italic>Igfbp5</italic>-positive and <italic>Lrig1-</italic>positive populations overlap will need to be addressed in the future.</p><p>Of note, <italic>Lrig1</italic>-expressing cells were shown to contribute specifically to the upper but not the lower portion of the mesenchymally derived dermis of the skin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Driskell et al., 2013</xref>). This result is intriguing as it parallels our finding that <italic>Lrig1</italic>-expressing mesenchymal cells only contribute to the periodontal tissue but not the dental pulp mesenchyme. Moreover, our analysis of cell proliferation in the <italic>Lrig1</italic> lineage tracing experiments did not identify a specific periodontal T-A cell population, indicating a relatively slow turnover rate of this tissue.</p><p>Multiple progenitor pools are known to facilitate coordinated renewal in other organs. For example, in the skin, several stem cell pools exist that contribute, with varying overlap, to the renewal of the interfolliclular epidermis, hair follicles and sebaceous glands (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Jensen et al., 2009</xref>). Although during normal homeostasis the stem cells contribute to their respective compartments, they can be mobilized to regenerate nearby compartments after injury. Whether the <italic>Igfbp5</italic>- or <italic>Lrig1</italic>-expressing periodontal progenitors are able to contribute to the dental pulp lineages following injury remains to be determined. Of note, in a small number of <italic>Lrig1<sup>Cre-ERT/+</sup>;R26<sup>RFP/+</sup></italic> animals chased for one year after tamoxifen treatment, we observed low-level contribution to the odontoblast lineage (data not shown); it is possible that this lineage contribution arose as the result of injury. Alternatively, this increase in plasticity could reflect changes in stem cell number or regeneration capacity that occur in the incisor as animals age.</p></sec><sec id="s3-4"><title>Coordination of progeny formation in the mesenchymal and epithelial compartment of the incisor is achieved at the T-A cell level</title><p>To achieve proper homeostatic renewal of an organ composed of several tissues, progeny production by stem cell niches in all tissue compartments must be highly coordinated. Indeed, cell-labeling experiments performed in rodent incisors several decades ago showed that ameloblasts, odontoblasts and periodontal fibroblasts move distally at the same rate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Beertsen and Hoeben, 1987</xref>). The notion that the T-A cell stage serves as an important checkpoint for coordination between tissues is strongly supported by our finding that all factors that contributed to T-A cell specific modules were always expressed in proliferating cells in both the epithelium and mesenchyme and never in only one tissue. Our previous results highlight SHH as a likely signal through which coordination between the different stem cell pools in the incisor is achieved (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Seidel et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Zhao et al., 2014</xref>). These studies showed that stem cells maintaining the epithelial tissues on the labial and lingual aspect of the tooth, the mesenchymal cell types of the dental pulp including the dentin-forming odontoblasts, and the periodontium are all marked by <italic>Gli1</italic> expression, a hallmark of responsiveness to HH signaling. Similarly, <italic>Bmi1</italic> appears to be expressed by stem cells in all niches of the incisor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Biehs et al., 2013</xref>), whereas <italic>Sox2</italic> and <italic>Lrig1</italic> mark stem cells only in a restricted set of compartments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>, (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Juuri et al., 2012</xref>). An interesting open question is whether other members of the SRY-related HMG-box (SOX) family of transcription factors are expressed in the liCL, mesenchymal and periodontal stem cell niches and substitute for the function of SOX2 in these regions, or whether SRY-mediated transcriptional regulation is uniquely required for control of progeny formation from epithelial stem cells housed in the laCL.</p><p>Another intriguing discovery is that distinct sets of stem cells, as defined by a constellation of markers uncovered by module analysis, have different properties in the laCL and give rise to unique cell fates in the mesenchyme. <italic>Lrig1</italic>, which encodes a type I transmembrane protein, is specifically expressed by a subset of <italic>Gli1</italic>-expressing cells in the laCL and by stem cells that give rise to periodontal tissues (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). Our lineage tracing analysis further showed that the cells that maintain the lingual incisor epithelium and pulp mesenchyme do not express <italic>Lrig1</italic>. An exciting extension to the finding that <italic>Lrig1</italic> marks a pool of stem cells in the periodontium would be a comparison with the periodontium around molar roots. In both cases, these tissues develop from the dental follicle, wrap the teeth and anchor them to the jaw. Because molars have a finite growth period, in contrast to the continuous growth of the incisor, it would be of interest to determine how the periodontium is maintained in the molar. Additionally, an important future direction will be establishing the molecular function of LRIG1 in the tooth as well as the source and function of the ligand whose signaling it regulates in this system.</p><p>In conclusion, the wealth of information gained by our analysis of gene co-expression in the incisor will advance the use of this organ as a model for stem cell-based tissue renewal. More generally, results gained from deconstructing an organ using this transcriptome-focused approach can enable a deeper understanding of the biology of the system. In addition, by comparing gene co-expression networks between different species, important species-specific characteristics of organs can readily be identified. To this end, comparisons of gene co-expression relationships in the developing brains of humans and mice have yielded invaluable insights into transcriptional differences in neural stem cells that have contributed to changes in brain architecture during evolution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Lui et al., 2014</xref>). Going forward, comparisons of gene co-expression in different organs will help elucidate conserved pathways and general mechanisms that govern tissue renewal from stem cells. Such information can also enhance bioengineering approaches that use stem cells as a starting material for generating tissues for therapeutic purposes.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Material and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Animal husbandry</title><p>Mice carrying the <italic>Acta2<sup>Cre-ERT2</sup></italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Wendling et al., 2009</xref>), <italic>Ai14</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Madisen et al., 2010</xref>), <italic>Gli1-lacZ</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Bai et al., 2002</xref>), and <italic>Lrig1<sup>CreERT2</sup></italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Powell et al., 2012</xref>) were maintained and genotyped as previously described. 6-week-old female CD1 mice were purchased from Charles River Laboratories and used for generation of tissue samples for microarray analysis. 6–8 week old animals were used for expression analysis and lineage tracing experiments.

Total RNA was isolated from individual tissue samples using Qiagen’s RNeasy kit according to the manufacturer’s instructions. To improve the total yield in the final step of the protocol, the eluate was run over the microspin column a second time. Only tissues obtained from left lower incisors were used for RNA extraction.

A lightly edited version of the letter sent to the authors after peer review is shown, indicating the most substantive concerns; minor comments are not usually included.</p></boxed-text><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Resolving stem and progenitor cells in the adult mouse incisor through gene co-expression analysis&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by two peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Marianne Bronner as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal his identity: Igor Adameyko (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>The reviewers agreed that your paper is a very clear analysis of a stem cell population in the continuously growing incisor and that it provides an impressive dataset to classify different cells within a tooth, which could be utilised by a number of researchers. The reviewers also noted that the authors make a good attempt to highlight problems with their data and the methods used and to compare their work to the use of other strategies, which is refreshing.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) There were several suggestions regarding the microarray data:</p><p>A) The microarray that was used does not include all key genes. The authors highlight problems in sensitivity given that genes which should have been identified were not. The full picture is therefore likely to be more complex than shown. The authors should indicate this in the manuscript.</p><p>B) The hierarchical clustering shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref> is very interesting. Still, it would nice to know how the individual clusters (with assigned letters) correspond to the cell types: fully or not fully (at least this might be discussed). Of course, it is always safer to talk about the tissue regions with highly co-expressed genes. Still, such co-expression means that these genes are likely expressed in the same or in very similar cells. Some technical discussion on the noise/signal ratios and cell type related interpretation of clusters would be beneficial.</p><p>2) In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref> authors show and claim that <italic>Lrig1</italic> marks polls of epithelial and also mesenchymal stem cells in the incisor. However, pulp cells and odontoblasts do not form from <italic>Lrig1<sup>+</sup></italic> population of mesenchymal cells. It is better to write this part and the figure legend title more clearly to point out that <italic>Lrig1<sup>+</sup></italic> cells produce/self-renew only dental follicle/periodontal tissues.</p><p>3) It would be good to show the in-depth analysis of proliferation in traced dental follicle/periodontal populations. Do these cells divide only at the CL regions? Or they divide only at the opening in the center between CLs? Is there a TA population resulting from <italic>Lrig1<sup>+</sup></italic> cells in case they are classical stem cells, and is there a niche? Do traced cells undergo apoptosis closer to the tooth apex similar to ameloblasts? Basically, it will good to answer if <italic>Lrig1<sup>+</sup></italic> cells satisfy the classical concept of stem cells positioned in a niche environment.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.24712.020</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>Essential revisions:</italic> </p><p><italic>1) There were several suggestions regarding the microarray data:</italic> </p><p><italic>A) The microarray that was used does not include all key genes.

The authors should indicate this in the manuscript.</italic> </p><p>We appreciate this suggestion and have provided more discussion about this issue in the revised manuscript. We discuss more thoroughly the limitations imposed by the dynamic range of the microarray platform that we used and propose next steps such as broader transcriptomic studies of coding and non-coding transcripts from intact tissue along with single-cell approaches. We agree that the full extent of gene expression in the adult mouse incisor is likely to be more complex than our current understanding, but anticipate that our study will provide a strong foundation to build upon moving forward.</p><p><italic>B) The hierarchical clustering shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref> is very interesting.

In addition, we have added technical discussion about the signal/noise ratio and cell type related interpretation of clusters, as suggested.</p><p><italic>2) In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref> authors show and claim that Lrig1 marks polls of epithelial and also mesenchymal stem cells in the incisor. However, pulp cells and odontoblasts do not form from Lrig1+ population of mesenchymal cells. It is better to write this part and the figure legend title more clearly to point out that Lrig1+ cells produce/self-renew only dental follicle/periodontal tissues.</italic> </p><p>We agree with this suggestion and have modified the relevant part of the text as proposed by the reviewers, explicitly stating that <italic>Lrig1<sup>+</sup></italic> cells contribute to follicle and periodontium but not pulp.</p><p><italic>3) It would be good to show the in-depth analysis of proliferation in traced dental follicle/periodontal populations. Do these cells divide only at the CL regions? Or they divide only at the opening in the center between CLs? Is there a TA population resulting from Lrig1+ cells in case they are classical stem cells, and is there a niche? Do traced cells undergo apoptosis closer to the tooth apex similar to ameloblasts? Basically, it will good to answer if Lrig1+ cells satisfy the classical concept of stem cells positioned in a niche environment.</italic> </p><p>To address these questions, we have performed BrdU injections 1.5 h before sacrifice of animals in which <italic>Lrig1</italic> lineage tracing had been induced. It appears that the only proliferative cell populations found in the incisor in those conditions are the epithelial and mesenchymal T-A cell populations that have already been described. The periodontium remains BrdU negative, which indicates that this population is quiescent, consistent with the slow turnover of this tissue. These data have been added to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>, and the Results (“Modules K-M are enriched for candidate stem cell markers and markers specific to periodontal tissues”) and Discussion (“Lineage potential of adult stem cells marked by <italic>Igfbp5</italic> or <italic>Lrig1</italic>”) have been updated to reflect our answer to the reviewers’ questions.</p></body></sub-article></article>
