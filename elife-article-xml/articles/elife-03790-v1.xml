In yeast, partitioning of such circles to the mother cell at mitosis ensures their loss from the population but promotes replicative ageing. Nevertheless, the mechanisms of partitioning are debated. In this study, we show that the SAGA complex mediates the interaction of non-chromosomal DNA circles with nuclear pore complexes (NPCs) and thereby promotes their confinement in the mother cell. Reciprocally, this causes retention and accumulation of NPCs, which affects the organization of ageing nuclei. Thus, SAGA prevents the spreading of DNA circles by linking them to NPCs, but unavoidably causes accumulation of circles and NPCs in the mother cell, and thereby promotes ageing. Together, our data provide a unifying model for the asymmetric segregation of DNA circles and how age affects nuclear organization.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.03790.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.03790.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.03790.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Budding yeast is a microorganism that has been widely studied to understand how it and many other organisms, including animals, age over time. This yeast is so named because it proliferates by ‘budding’ daughter cells out of the surface of a mother cell. For each daughter cell that buds, the mother cell loses some fitness and eventually dies after a certain number of budding events. This process is called ‘replicative ageing’, and it also resembles the way that stem cells age. In contrast, the newly formed daughters essentially have their age ‘reset to zero’ and grow until they turn into mother cells themselves.</p><p>Several molecules or factors have been linked to replicative ageing. These are retained in the mother cell during budding, rather than being passed on to the daughters. Non-chromosomal DNA circles, for example, are rings of DNA that detach from chromosomes during DNA repair and that accumulate inside the ageing mother cell over time. How the mother cells retain these circles of DNA is an on-going topic of debate.</p><p>Similar to plants and animals, chromosomes in yeast cells are confined in a membrane-bound structure known as the cell nucleus. The nuclear membrane is perforated by channels called nuclear pore complexes that ensure the transport of molecules into, and out of, the nucleus. Now, Denoth-Lippuner et al. establish that for the non-chromosomal DNA circles to be efficiently confined in the mother cell, the DNA circles must be anchored to the nuclear pore complexes.</p><p>Denoth-Lippuner et al. next asked how the DNA circles were anchored to these complexes; and found that another complex of proteins known as SAGA is involved. When components of the SAGA complex were deleted in budding yeast cells, non-chromosomal DNA circles spread into the daughters as well. On the other hand, artificially anchoring these DNA circles to the nuclear pore complex alleviated the need for the SAGA complex, in order to retain these molecules in the mother cell.</p><p>Denoth-Lippuner et al. also show that SAGA-dependent attachment of the DNA circles to the nuclear pore complexes causes these complexes to remain in the mother cell. As a consequence, these nuclear pore complexes accumulate in the mother cells as they age. The number of nuclear pore complexes in the daughter cells, however, remained fairly constant. Together these data raise the question of whether the effects of DNA circles on the number and activity of the nuclear pores might account for their contribution to ageing, perhaps by affecting the workings of the nucleus.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.03790.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.03790.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author keywords</title><kwd>ageing</kwd><kwd>SAGA</kwd><kwd>nuclear pore</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>S. cerevisiae</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000781</institution-id><institution>European Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Denoth-Lippuner</surname><given-names>Annina</given-names></name><name><surname>Krzyzanowski</surname><given-names>Marek Konrad</given-names></name><name><surname>Stober</surname><given-names>Catherine</given-names></name><name><surname>Barral</surname><given-names>Yves</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funder had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The SAGA complex binds non-chromosomal DNA circles and prevents their spreading by attaching them to nuclear pores, thereby leading to the concomitant accumulation of DNA circles and pores in ageing yeast mother cells.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Homologous recombination plays an important role in DNA repair in all organisms and acts through the formation of a Holliday junction between the damaged molecule and its repair template. When recombination involves two homologous chromosomes, the resolution of the Holliday junction leads to a cross-over, the exchange of arms between two chromosomes, in 50% of the cases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Heyer, 2004</xref>). However, when recombination occurs between two loci on the same chromosome, i.e. if the break affects a repeated region of the genome, recombination is intra-chromosomal. In 50% of these events, the resolution of the Holliday junction leads to the excision of a DNA circle containing one or several of the involved repeats (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Gaubatz, 1990</xref>). Accordingly, due to the highly repeated nature of the ribosomal DNA (rDNA) locus, rDNA circles have been found in all eukaryotes tested so far (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cohen et al., 2010</xref>). Similarly, double-minute, satellite- and t-circles, as well as a multitude of micro DNAs have been identified in animal cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Cohen and Segal, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Shibata et al., 2012</xref>). However, how cells react to these molecules is not understood. Particularly, it is unclear whether these cells recognize, sort, and eliminate these molecules or let them passively disappear by dilution.</p><p>In <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic>, extrachromosomal rDNA circles (ERCs) form spontaneously but fail to accumulate in the population, owing to their highly asymmetric segregation upon cell division (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Sinclair and Guarente, 1997</xref>). Indeed, the asymmetry of the budding process generates a mother and a daughter cell with distinct sizes and fate. While most daughter cells are born young, i.e. with a full replicative potential, mother cells age with each budding cycle and therefore generate only a limited number of daughter cells ((<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Mortimer and Johnston, 1959</xref>) and reviewed in (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Denoth Lippuner et al., 2014</xref>)). Since rDNA circles contain a replication origin they duplicate in S-phase, and due to the asymmetric segregation they accumulate with time in the mother cell. Several arguments indicate that they contribute to replicative ageing of these mother cells. Artificially introducing an ERC into the bud reduces its life span (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Sinclair and Guarente, 1997</xref>). Likewise, mutations that enhance ERC formation shorten the longevity of mother cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Kaeberlein et al., 1999</xref>). Conversely, mutant cells with reduced rates of ERC formation, such as <italic>fob1∆</italic>, or those defective in ERC retention, such as <italic>bud6∆</italic> mutant cells, live longer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Defossez et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Shcheprova et al., 2008</xref>). Interestingly, any artificial circle that replicates in vivo but lacks a partitioning sequence (e.g. a centromere) segregates similarly and promotes replicative ageing when introduced into yeast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Falcon and Aris, 2003</xref>). Thus, non-chromosomal DNA circles segregate asymmetrically, affect cellular physiology, and promote ageing in a manner that is independent of their DNA sequence. How these DNA circles contribute to ageing is not known.</p><p>One approach to characterize the effects of DNA circles on cellular physiology is to study the mechanism of their segregation. Two models have been proposed to explain the retention of circular DNA molecules in the mother cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Ouellet and Barral, 2012</xref>). The morpho-kinetic model proposes that circles freely diffuse in the nucleus and that their retention results from the morphology of the dividing yeast nucleus and the short duration of anaphase, which together limit the probability that DNA circles diffuse into the bud (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Gehlen et al., 2011</xref>). Using measured parameters for nuclear geometry and division speed, this model predicts a retention frequency of 0.75–0.90 per individual plasmid. However, mathematical modeling indicates that observed ageing curves require retention frequencies above 0.99 per individual ERC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Gillespie et al., 2004</xref>), which is higher than what the morpho-kinetic model can achieve. A second model, the barrier model, is based on the observation that a lateral diffusion barrier in the outer membrane of the nuclear envelope impedes the diffusion of membrane proteins through the bud neck and hence their exchange between mother and bud parts of the nucleus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Shcheprova et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Boettcher et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Clay et al., 2014</xref>). This model proposes that DNA circles attach to a receptor in the nuclear envelope to ensure their subsequent confinement into the mother cell by the lateral diffusion barrier (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Shcheprova et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Clay et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>The main difference between these models is whether confinement of the circle within the mother cell is purely passive or relies on mechanisms that are able to distinguish non-chromosomal DNA circles from bona-fide chromosomes to promote their specific anchorage and asymmetric segregation. However, no such mechanism is known yet. Whether DNA circles passively diffuse or are recognized by the cell would be predicted to have distinct consequences on the localization of the circles and their effects on nuclear organization. A passive model predicts that DNA circles do not interact specifically with any nuclear structure. Therefore, their accumulation should have little impact on nuclear organization. On the other hand, if cells recognize DNA circles, accumulating circles would increasingly interact with the corresponding structure and should progressively affect its size and organization. Thus, in order to better understand whether and how DNA circles are recognized by the cell, and to shed light on how they interfere with cellular physiology, we investigated how accumulating DNA circles localize and whether they affect nuclear organization.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Accumulation of non-centromeric DNA circles leads to the formation of an NPC cap</title><p>To investigate the localization and effects of non-centromeric DNA circles on nuclear organization, we used the plasmid pPCM14 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>), containing a replication origin (ARS1) and 224 repeats of the TetO sequence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Megee and Koshland, 1999</xref>). In cells expressing a TetR-mCherry fusion protein, which binds the TetO sequence, the plasmid is observed as a focus of red fluorescence. Additionally, the plasmid contains an excisable centromere, leading to the formation of a labeled non-centromeric DNA circle upon expression of the R-recombinase. The plasmid also contains two auxotrophic selection markers: <italic>URA3</italic> located between the two recombination-sites to select against accidental centromere excision and <italic>LEU2</italic> on the residual backbone, allowing selection for the plasmid after centromere excision. In budding yeast, all centromeres co-localize with spindle pole bodies (SPBs) throughout the cell cycle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Goshima and Yanagida, 2000</xref>). Accordingly, we observe the centromeric plasmid in close proximity to the SPBs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). 3 hr after addition of estradiol to induce centromere excision, plasmids are localized away from the SPBs in 68% of the cells. Most of those cells displayed one or two small plasmid foci (61% or 33%, respectively; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>) and only 6% of the cells showed more than two foci. These foci were on average 2.5 times more intense than the nucleoplasmic background (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>) and localized to the vicinity of the nuclear rim (see below, and Figure 5).<fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.03790.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Accumulation of DNA circles induces the formation of an NPC cap.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Schematic overview of the plasmid pPCM14 and fluorescent images of pPCM14 before and 3 or 18 hr after excision of the centromere by addition of estradiol (ED) in cells expressing TetR-mCherry, Nup82-3sfGFP, and Spc42-GFP.

A small fraction of the cells (1%) contained few plasmids visualized as small foci as above, whereas the rest of the cells (6%) carried one large and intense signal, 8-fold above background (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). Consistent with the idea that this fluorescent mass corresponded to the accumulated plasmids, these cells were the few initial mother cells that had already proceeded through several division cycles, as determined by the visualization of bud scars with calcofluor white (5.2 ± 1.9 bud scars on cells with fluorescent mass compared to 0.7 ± 0.9 bud scars in cells without plasmids). After five rounds of duplication, cells contain approximately 50–100 plasmids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Hyman et al., 1982</xref>). Remarkably, these accumulated plasmids did not spread throughout the nucleoplasm but rather were collected to a single place at the nuclear periphery.</p><p>In order to characterize this structure in more detail, the accumulated plasmids were visualized in wild-type cells co-expressing TetR-mCherry with different nuclear markers fused to GFP. The nucleoporin Nup82 tagged with three copies of a super-folder GFP (Nup82-3sfGFP) was used to visualize the morphology of the nuclear envelope; Spc42-GFP indicated the position of the SPB and Fob1-GFP labeled the nucleolus. In most cases, the accumulated DNA circles localized adjacent to, but were excluded from, the nucleolus (Fob1-GFP; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). Accordingly, they localized opposite to the SPB. Labeling of the nuclear pore complexes (NPCs) indicated that the nuclei loaded with DNA circles were larger than those with no or few circles (average volume increased 1.7-fold; N = 50 cells). Remarkably, accumulation of DNA circles drastically affected the NPC distribution. The circle-loaded cells contained on an average 2.7-fold more nuclear pores compared to cells without plasmids (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). This increase was independent of the NPC reporter used (Nup82-3sfGFP, 2.7-folds, N = 50 cells; Nup82-GFP, 2.6-fold, N = 25 cells; Nup49-GFP, 3.0-fold, N = 25 cells, p &lt; 0.001; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>) and was exclusively observed in the cells that contained DNA circles. Five generations old wild-type cells lacking plasmids did not show such changes (see Figure 9). Most strikingly, NPC distribution over the nuclear envelope was no-longer uniform; a substantial fraction of the NPCs accumulated in a single cap that covered one side of the nucleus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A,C</xref>). In all cells, this cap covered the DNA circles. Furthermore, all circle-loaded cells exhibited such a cap. As a consequence, the fluorescence intensity of Nup82-3sfGFP was on an average two-fold higher in the vicinity of the circles (Ic = 2.02 ± 0.80 A.U.) compared with the rest of the nucleus (Ir = 1.0 ± 0.35 A.U., N = 50 cells, p &lt; 0.001; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). In time-lapse movies (5 min intervals for 60 min), the cap and the mCherry patch moved together (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>, <xref ref-type="other" rid="media1">Video 1</xref>), suggesting that DNA circles and the NPC cap were linked to each other. Thus, the accumulated circles failed to randomly diffuse in the nucleoplasm. Instead, they appeared to interact with some structure in the nuclear envelope, and thereby affected the morphology of the nucleus.<media content-type="glencoe play-in-place height-250 width-310" id="media1" mime-subtype="avi" mimetype="video" xlink:href="elife-03790-media1.avi"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.03790.005</object-id><label>Video 1.</label><caption><title>The NPC cap and accumulated plasmids are simultaneously retained in the mother cell during mitosis.</title><p>A cell expressing TetR-mCherry (red) and Nup82-3sfGFP (green), containing accumulated plasmids (18 hr ED), followed through nuclear division using time lapse microscopy (one Z-stack every 5 min for 1 hr, maximal projection, scale bar represents 2 μm).</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.03790.005">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.03790.005</ext-link></p></caption></media></p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>The NPC cap segregates together with the DNA circles to the mother cell during mitosis</title><p>Interestingly, these changes in NPC distribution had a clear impact on cell division, as observed in time-lapse movies (<xref ref-type="other" rid="media1">Video 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). While all dividing cells formed two daughter nuclei of different sizes, the mother nucleus being generally larger, this asymmetry was enhanced in cells with accumulated circles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). Furthermore, the density of NPCs was increased in these mother nuclei (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). Together, this results in an increase in the asymmetry of NPC segregation in circle-loaded cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). Mother cells containing accumulated plasmids retained a larger fraction of their NPCs (median = 78%, N = 50), compared to cells containing no circles (63%, N = 50 cells, p &lt; 0.001). Interestingly, in these cells both the TetR-mCherry signal and the GFP cap localized to the vicinity of the nuclear bridge linking mother and bud lobes of the dividing nucleus on its mother side (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1 fig2">Figures 1A and 2A</xref> and <xref ref-type="other" rid="media1">Video 1</xref>). Only in very rare cases a fraction of the plasmid mass passed to the bud (2%, N &gt; 50 cells). Qualitatively, the same effects were observed when using Nup82-3sfGFP, Nup82-GFP or Nup49-GFP as reporters. Irrespective of plasmid accumulation, tagging Nup49 slightly enhanced NPC retention (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>), as previously reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Chadrin et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Makio et al., 2013</xref>). Consistent with resulting from DNA circle accumulation, cells in which the centromere was not excised from the plasmid and untransformed cells of a similar age did not show such NPC distribution and segregation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> and see below). Together, these data indicate that the accumulation of non-chromosomal DNA circles affects the size of the nucleus, the organization of the nuclear envelope, and causes the mitotic retention of NPCs in yeast mother cells. These data argue against DNA circles freely diffusing in the nucleoplasm.<fig id="fig2" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.03790.006</object-id><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Accumulated plasmids retain the NPC cap in the mother cell during mitosis leading to an increased asymmetric segregation of NPCs.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Time lapse images of a dividing nucleus in a cell expressing Nup82-3sfGFP and containing accumulated plasmids.

In cells lacking Bud6, the NPC cap still formed around the plasmid leading to an increase in NPC signal in the circle area (Ic = 2.29 ± 0.67 A.U.) compared to the residual area (Ir = 1.0 ± 0.33 A.U., N = 50 cells, p &lt; 0.001; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>). However, in 11% of the cells, part of the plasmid mass was transmitted to the daughter cell (compared to 2% in wild-type cells, N = 50 cells). The propagated plasmid foci were generally small, but when a bigger part was transmitted, an NPC cap was visible around it (see representative image in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>).

In order to investigate this possibility, we first tested whether individual non-centromeric plasmids co-localize with nuclear pores and whether this required SAGA function. Consistent with this idea, the vast majority of non-centromeric circles localized to the nuclear rim in wild-type cells: only 15% (±2.8%) of plasmid foci were at a resolvable distance from the nuclear envelope (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>).

High LED-based illumination and fast image acquisition minimized blur due to NPC movement.

Thus, we concluded that binding of SAGA to the circle is required for efficient retention of the circle in the mother cell.</p></sec><sec id="s2-9"><title>Acentric DNA circles and nuclear pores influence each other's dynamics in a SAGA-dependent manner</title><p>So far, our data have established that SAGA promotes the attachment of non-chromosomal DNA circles to NPCs and that this attachment is essential for the efficient retention of the circles in the mother cell. This observation is at odds with data by several labs indicating that NPCs are not nearly as well retained in the mother cell than DNA circles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Khmelinskii et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Colombi et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Menendez-Benito et al., 2013</xref>).

FLIP experiments revealed that SAGA-mediated attachment of circles to NPCs strongly affected their diffusion speed. When fluorescence intensity was measured both in the vicinity of the circles (Ic) and at opposite side of the nucleus (Io) in wild-type cells loaded with circles, with both measurement regions equidistant from the bleached spot, the signal decayed slower and to a lesser extent in regions associated with the circles (t<sub>70</sub> = 82 ± 39 s) than in those on the opposite side (t<sub>70</sub> = 25 ± 8 s, N = 20 cells, p &lt; 0.001; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8B</xref>).</p><p>We could not perform the same experiment in SAGA deficient cells because circles did not cluster to one focus and the cells formed no NPC cap. NPC distribution remained uniform over the nuclear surface, and non-centromeric circles were scattered throughout the nucleoplasm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8D</xref>). We concluded that SAGA mediates both circle clustering and the formation of the NPC cap. Accordingly, in FLIP experiments the fluorescence decayed homogenously over the entire nuclear envelope, whether they contained circles or not (t<sub>50</sub> = 46 ± 9.1 s for <italic>gcn5∆</italic> and 41 ± 6.7 s for <italic>sgf73∆</italic> mutant cells; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8C</xref>), as in wild-type cells devoid of circles (t<sub>50</sub> = 35 ± 5.9 s). Thus, SAGA-dependent attachment of non-centromeric DNA circles substantially, and specifically, reduces the mobility of the corresponding NPCs. These data establish two points. First, in circle-free exponentially growing cells only very few NPCs, if any, are stably attached to and slowed down by chromatin. Second, NPCs that are attached to DNA circles show very slow dynamics, possibly explaining their enhanced retention in the mother cell during mitosis.</p><p>Consistent with the attachment of circles to NPCs affecting each other's dynamics, SAGA also slowed down the non-centromeric DNA circles. In time-lapse movies (one stack every 3 s, 20 optical slices per stack, for 3 min), the average speed of the DNA circles was significantly higher in cells lacking Gcn5 (0.09 ± 0.027 μm/s, N ≥ 50 plasmids, p &lt; 0.001) than in wild-type cells (0.05 ± 0.019 μm/s; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8E</xref>).

However, since these results were all obtained with reporter plasmids, we next asked whether SAGA function was also relevant for endogenous circles. We reasoned that, if ERCs rely on an interaction with NPCs for their retention in the mother cell, then the NPCs attached to these ERCs should also be retained and accumulate with age. To test this possibility, we monitored nuclear pores in ageing cells using Nup49-, Nup170-, or Nup82-GFP fusion proteins as a reporter. To allow imaging them throughout their lifespan, the cells were grown in a microfluidic device (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Lee et al., 2012</xref>) that selectively retains the mother cells, due to their larger size, while their daughter cells are removed by the medium flow. Transmission pictures were taken for 64 hr at 20 min intervals, providing information about the age of all cells present (<xref ref-type="other" rid="media2">Video 2</xref>). In addition, 2h fluorescence movies at 15 min intervals were recorded after 48 hr and 64 hr. At both time points, the original cells and some coincidentally trapped cells born in the chip were present, allowing simultaneous monitoring of pores in cells of different ages (ranging from 0 to 38 generations; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9A</xref>). Strikingly, a large majority of the aged cells showed a non-uniform distribution of NPCs on the nuclear surface. A substantial fraction of very old cells formed an even more intense cap (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9B</xref>). These cells divided maximally three more times before dying.

For all three NPC markers, fluorescence intensity increased significantly in the mother nuclei with age (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9C</xref>). This effect was strongest for Nup49-GFP, as above (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). The increasing amount of NPCs in the mother cell did not happen at the cost of the daughter cells. On the contrary, occasionally an increased amount of nuclear pores was also observed in daughter cells of old mother cells (&gt;15 generations; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9C</xref>). Thus, like in young cells loaded with artificial circles, the number of NPCs increases in ageing mother cells whereas the number of pores transmitted to the daughter cells remains fairly constant.</p><p>Accordingly, the fraction of nuclear pores that segregated towards the mother cell during mitosis increased as the cells aged, indicating that these cells partitioned NPCs in an increasingly asymmetric manner (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9D</xref>). Young mother cells expressing Nup170-GFP or Nup82-GFP retained 56 ± 1.9% and 57 ± 2.5% of the signal in the mother cell. The retention of pores in the mother cell increased after 25 generations to 73 ± 5.0% (Nup82-GFP) and 78 ± 3.8% after 35 generations (Nup170-GFP; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9D</xref>).

Analysis of nuclei in G1 cells of increasing age confirmed that old mothers contained more NPCs than young cells (on average 4.7 ± 1.2-fold more than young mothers in cells expressing Nup49-GFP after 25 generations, 4.0 ± 1.1-fold in Nup170-GFP expressing cells after 30 generations, and 4.1 ± 1.4-fold in Nup82-GFP expressing cells after 35 generations; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9E</xref>).

Therefore, we next wondered whether these cells lived longer. Using microdissection, the lifespan of cells lacking Gcn5 and Spt20, a structural component of the SAGA complex, as well as Sgf73, linking SAGA to TREX-2, was determined. Wild-type cells showed a median lifespan of 27 generations, whereas the <italic>sgf73∆</italic> mutant cells lived 60% longer, (44 generations, N = 150 cells, p &lt; 0.001; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11">Figure 11A</xref> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Schleit et al., 2013</xref>)).

Since SAGA is involved in many cellular processes, we wondered whether the observed lifespan was the result of a balance between the advantages and disadvantages of losing Gcn5 and Spt20. We rationalized that if this was the case, the longevity of these mutant cells would be limited by other factors than ERC accumulation, and thus decreasing ERC formation should not increase the longevity of these cells. Accordingly, removal of Fob1 failed to extend the lifespan of the <italic>gcn5∆</italic> mutant cells (median lifespan of <italic>gcn5∆ fob1∆</italic> double mutant cells = 27 generations, N = 150 cells; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11">Figure 11B</xref>) and <italic>spt20∆</italic> mutant cells (<italic>spt20∆ fob1∆</italic> = 16 generations, N = 75 cells; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11">Figure 11C</xref>).

Additionally, the fact that we observed increased ERC formation in cells lacking Gcn5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>) but not a shorter lifespan suggests that indeed the increased ERC formation is compensated by poor circle retention in the mother cells.

Therefore, we conclude that decreased levels of SAGA at pores largely contribute to the extended lifespan observed in <italic>sgf73∆</italic> cells. Based on the data presented here, we further conclude that SAGA promotes ageing, at least in part, through promoting the anchorage of non-chromosomal DNA circles to NPCs and promoting their joint retention and accumulation with age.

This prevents the propagation of these molecules in the population. We discovered that, as a consequence of this retention mechanism, NPCs cluster around DNA circles and are concomitantly retained in the mother cell. Thus, both ERCs and NPCs accumulate in old cells, promoting ageing. These findings allow making the following points.</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>A unifying model for the asymmetric segregation of DNA circles</title><p>Our data provide a unifying model for how non-chromosomal DNA circles are retained (Model <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig12">Figure 12A</xref>). First, we propose that both morpho-kinetic parameters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Gehlen et al., 2011</xref>) as well as tethering to NPCs are required for efficient circle retention in vivo. The morpho-kinetic constraints provide the baseline for circle retention and ensure that unattached plasmids are still fairly well retained, as observed in SAGA defective cells (this study) or for unattached episomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Gehlen et al., 2011</xref>). Above this baseline, the barrier-tether mechanism further tightens circle retention to achieve high fidelity. Indeed, supporting this model mutations that prolong anaphase (<italic>yku70∆</italic>) and mutations that weaken the nuclear diffusion barrier without prolonging anaphase (<italic>bud6∆</italic>) both affect circle retention. Second, we propose that tight confinement of the circles by the diffusion barrier requires the attachment of the circles to NPCs. Indeed, what the barrier efficiently retains in the mother cell is neither NPCs alone nor the unbound circles but rather the circle-bound NPCs. Accordingly, anchorage of the circles to NPCs strongly enhances the retention of both NPCs and circles.<fig id="fig12" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.03790.016</object-id><label>Figure 12.</label><caption><title>Model.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Model of how SAGA prevents DNA circles from segregating into the daughter cell: SAGA attaches DNA circles to NPCs via the TREX-2 complex, which reduces the diffusion of the circle-bound NPCs, preventing them to pass the diffusion barrier at the bud neck.

Although NPC attachment had already been proposed to mediate the retention of DNA circles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Shcheprova et al., 2008</xref>), the observation that NPCs were themselves inefficiently retained in exponentially growing cells strongly argued against this model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Khmelinskii et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Colombi et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Menendez-Benito et al., 2013</xref>). Populations of exponentially growing cells are primarily composed of young cells, with only about 5% of the cells having divided more than three times. Since only very few, if any, young cells contain an ERC or other DNA circle, our model accounts well for why most exponentially growing cells only weakly retain NPCs in the mother cell.</p><p>Two types of mechanisms may underlie the selective retention of circle-bound NPCs. First, it might result from the reduced mobility of the circle-bound NPCs, which necessarily reduces the frequency at which they approach the barrier, and therefore their chance of passing it. This reduced mobility may be due to the drag that attached plasmids might oppose to NPCs. In addition, it might be exacerbated by the propensity of circle-bound NPCs to cluster, by a yet unknown mechanism. Alternatively, post-translational modifications of the NPC, perhaps by SAGA, may affect the interaction of the NPC with myosin and actin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Steinberg et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Colombi et al., 2013</xref>) or with the lipids in the envelope, impeding their dynamics. Second, the barrier might be selective. Previous data have established that the barrier has a much larger impact on large entities than on small ones. Remodeling and clustering of the NPCs might interfere particularly strongly with their ability to pass the barrier.</p><p>Strikingly, the immobilization and segregation effects observed upon circle attachment to NPCs are reminiscent of the phenotypes caused by removing the nucleoporin Nsp1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Colombi et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Makio et al., 2013</xref>) or expressing defective alleles of the nucleoporins Nic96 and Nup133 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Shcheprova et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Chadrin et al., 2010</xref>), Nic96 being a key binding partner for Nsp1 at the pore. Therefore, SAGA may regulate NPC behavior by affecting specific parts of the pore itself.</p><p>Together, our observations explain why the diffusion barrier in the envelope of anaphase nuclei, which has limited effects on bulk NPC distribution, has a crucial impact on ageing. Indeed, ageing cells accumulate circles with increasing speed. When the circles cannot attach or when the diffusion barrier is defective, the morpho-kinetic model still promotes a retention level of about 88–85%. However, our data indicate that the loss of 12–15% of the circles per division cycle has a substantial impact on ERC accumulation and the longevity of the cells, the <italic>bud6∆</italic> and the <italic>sgf73∆</italic> mutant cells being remarkably long-lived. This large impact on longevity for apparently small defects in retention is fully in line with the idea that high-fidelity retention is a crucial parameter, as predicted by in silico simulations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Gillespie et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Shcheprova et al., 2008</xref>).</p><p>Our data indicate that, among its many functions, the role of SAGA in linking chromatin to NPCs is especially crucial for circle retention and ageing. Thus, while the gene-gating hypothesis designed to account for SAGA-dependent transcription at NPCs is debated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Cabal et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Green et al., 2012</xref>), our findings may provide an alternative model for SAGA's function at the pore.</p><p>How SAGA promotes circle attachment to NPCs is not fully understood at this point. SAGA might modify chromatin or some chromatin-binding component of the NPC and thereby regulate the interaction of specific DNA pieces with the pore. Alternatively, it may function itself as a physical tether. Although our data do not allow any definitive conclusion, it is remarkable that SAGA needs to be both on the NPC and on the chromatin to mediate its function in circle attachment to pores. Thus, we favor the idea that SAGA is an integral part of the tether. The fact that its acetyl transferase activity is also needed for its function might reflect a dual role of SAGA, both as a tether and as a regulator of tethering. Identifying the acetylation targets of SAGA and the role of these modifications in circle retention are now required in order to address how SAGA facilitates chromatin anchorage to NPCs.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>SAGA helps to discriminate self from non-self DNA</title><p>One intriguing aspect of DNA circle retention is that it affects a very large spectrum of molecules. Together with the current knowledge, the identification of SAGA as a player in this process suggests an explanation for this observation. The SAGA complex, which associates broadly with chromatin and interacts with every expressed sequence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Ohtsuki et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bonnet et al., 2014</xref>), promotes DNA anchorage to NPCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Luthra et al., 2007</xref>). Current data suggest that this association occurs on both chromosomal and non-chromosomal DNA. Nevertheless, we observed an enrichment of SAGA on non-centromeric DNA circles both by using microscopy and ChIP experiments. Therefore, we propose that either SAGA is more efficiently recruited to or more stably associated with acentric DNA molecules or, alternatively, that during mitosis SAGA interaction or function is specifically repressed on chromosomal DNA.</p><p>Strikingly, such a mechanism has the potential of discriminating self from foreign DNA. Since circles containing transcribed sequences are expected to recruit more SAGA, they may be more efficiently marked and retained than non-transcribed circles. In addition, our ChIP data are consistent with previous data indicating that ARSs are also SAGA targets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Espinosa et al., 2010</xref>). In fitting, DNA circles with strong replication origins are better retained in mother cells than those with weak origins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Futcher and Cox, 1984</xref>). Thus, replicating circles may also be better retained than non-replicating circles. Therefore, a SAGA-based mechanism to discriminate between chromosomal and non-chromosomal DNA would primarily target non-chromosomal DNA molecules of internal or foreign origin based on their expression and replication potential, i.e. on their potential toxicity. Hence, we suggest that this pathway fulfills the functions of a genomic immunity system capable of preventing the spread of extra-chromosomal DNA molecules of both foreign and endogenous origin in a population. Since DNA circles form in all organisms tested so far (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Gaubatz, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Cohen et al., 2003</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">2010</xref>), there must exist some mechanism to restrict their propagation in higher eukaryotes as well.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>DNA circles and ageing</title><p>Together, our data suggest a mechanism for the effect of non-chromosomal DNA circles on cellular longevity. This mechanism relies not on the presence of the circles themselves but on their SAGA-dependent association with NPCs (Model <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig12">Figure 12B</xref>). Therefore, replicative ageing in yeast might be at least in part the secondary consequence of a mechanism involved in restricting the propagation of non-chromosomal DNA, but inevitably altering nuclear organization and NPC number.</p><p>Human diseases leading to premature ageing phenotypes, such as Bloom and Werner syndromes, originate from dysfunctions in two RecQ helicases involved in DNA recombination, BLM, and WRN (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Burtner and Kennedy, 2010</xref>). RecQ helicases inhibit the formation of Holliday junctions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Sharma et al., 2006</xref>) and therefore of circles. Thus, an increased rate of circle formation might underlie at least some aspects of the Werner and Bloom syndromes. Interestingly, the Hutchinson–Gilford progeria syndrome (HGPS), which is caused by the defects of the nuclear lamina and causes alterations of the nuclear structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Scaffidi and Misteli, 2006</xref>), leads to very similar ageing phenotypes as Werner and Bloom syndromes. These different observations indicate a link between genomic instability, DNA circle formation, and changes in nuclear organization during ageing and suggest that NPCs might be at the center of these relationships. Together, our data indicate that yeast is a powerful system to dissect how NPC number and modifications affect nuclear homeostasis and cellular viability.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Strains and plasmids</title><p>Yeast strains used in this study are listed in <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>.

Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO) to induce excision of the centromere (<italic>rec-CEN4-URA3-rec</italic>) and to select for the presence of the plasmid. After 16–18 hr, a Deltavision microscope (Applied Precision) equipped with a CCD HQ2 camera (Roper), 250W Xenon laps, Softworx software (Applied Precision), and a temperature chamber set to 30°C was used to visualize the plasmids and the depicted proteins tagged with GFP. Time lapse movies of 5 min, intervals for 1h taking 20 Z-stacks of 0.4-μm spacing, were recorded with a 100×/1.4 NA objective and 2x2 binning. To determine the total NPC fluorescence, integrated density was measured of the nucleus and background in sum projections using Image J (National Institutes of Health). After subtraction of the background, the fluorescence was normalized by the median fluorescence of cells without plasmids. To determine fluorescence intensity, the mean gray value of the NPC area adjacent to the accumulated circles (Ic) and the residual NPC area (Ir) was measured and normalized by the median intensity of Ir. For the percentage fluorescence segregated to the mother cell, the integrated density of the nucleus in the mother and the bud was measured after nuclear division, and after subtraction of the background the fluorescence in the mother was divided by the total fluorescence. The nuclear area depicts the 2D area of the nucleus in a sum projection in the mother and daughter of telophase cells. The mean intensity is the total intensity divided by the nuclear area. Box plots represent the distribution of the measurements in single cells whereas whiskers reach from min to max, the box covers 50% of the data and the line depicts the median.</p><p>To investigate plasmid propagation, the cells were kept on SD–URA medium and diluted in YPD medium containing estradiol only 3 hr before imaging. The cells were washed once using 1× PBS buffer and then resuspended in non-fluorescent medium. Images were obtained using an Olympus BX50 microscope, equipped with a piezo motor, a monochromator light source, a CCD camera (Andor), and the TillVision software (TillPhotonics). Images were acquired with a 100x / 1.4 NA objective, 2 × 2 binning, and stacks of 20 focal slices. Maximal intensity projections were used to determine plasmid propagation (described below ‘plasmid retention assay’).</p><p>To determine individual plasmid localization, accumulated plasmid co-localization with Gcn5 and Sgf73, nuclear geometry, and anaphase duration; a Deltavision microscope was used (described above). Prior to analysis, the images were deconvolved. For plasmid localization, images were taken with an Olympus 100×/1.4 NA objective and 1 × 1 binning. 15 focal sections with 0.3-µm spacing were acquired. The focal plane in which the plasmid was the brightest was used to determine whether the plasmid was at the nuclear rim or at a clearly resolvable distance from the nuclear periphery. Nuclear geometry was analyzed using an Olympus 100×/1.4 NA objective, 1 × 1 binning, and a 1.6× auxiliary magnification. Stacks of 15 sections and 0.2-µm spacing were obtained. Nuclear length and width was measured as illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref> using ImageJ, and average nuclear width was calculated for different categories of nuclear length. Anaphase duration was determined using an Olympus 60×/1.42 NA objective and 1 × 1 binning. 30 min movies were taken with 1 min between each stack of 8 sections and 0.6-µm spacing. Early anaphase was measured form the first time point the nucleus crossed the bud neck until the nucleus contracts as shown in the cartoon and representative pictures in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>.</p><p>To investigate the enrichment of NPCs close to non-centromeric plasmids, a Core Deltavision containing a CCD HQ camera (Roper) and solid state LEDs was used. An Olympus 100×/1.4 NA objective, 1 × 1 binning was used to create stacks of 15 focal sections and 0.2-µm spacing. Using ImageJ fluorescence intensity was measured along the nuclear rim. Nup82-3sfGFP intensity was normalized by its average intensity and TetR-mCherry intensity was normalized by its highest intensity in each cell. Afterwards, all obtained traces were aligned by the peak of TetR-mCherry (plasmid) intensity.</p><p>To determine the speed of the non-centromeric plasmids, cells were imaged 3h after centromere excision using the same Deltavision with LEDs. First a Z-stack of 16 sections and 0.3-μm spacing was recorded in CFP and YFP to visualize both the plasmid and the SPBs in order to select for the non-centromeric plasmids. Then the plasmid was followed in a time lapse movie, taking the same stacks but only in GFP every 3 s for 3 min. The plasmids were tracked using Imaris (Bitplane) to determine their three dimensional coordinates. The coordinates were then used to determine the distance covered by the plasmid for each time point, which was deviated by three to determine the distance per second. All speed values were averaged for every plasmid, then averaged over all non-centromeric plasmids recorded and plotted in the graph.</p></sec><sec id="s4-3"><title>FLIP and FRAP experiments</title><p>Both FLIP and FRAP experiments were essentially done as described in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Boettcher et al. 2012</xref>. Briefly, to measure the dynamics of NPCs in cells with and without accumulated plasmids, cells were grown in SD -URA, restreaked on SD–LEU containing β-estradiol (1 µM final concentration; Sigma) 16–18 hr prior to imaging, and then immobilized on a 2% agar pad containing non-fluorescent medium. A Zeiss LSM 780 laser confocal microscope (Zeiss Microimaging) with a 63×/1.4 NA objective and a multiarray 32PMT GaAsP detector controlled by the ZEN 2011 software (Carl Zeiss) was used for imaging. Bleaching was performed using a 488 nm argon laser at 2.6% laser intensity and 45% output. Repeated photobleaching was performed in the depicted area with 9 s intervals for 30 time points. Afterwards the fluorescence intensity of Nup170-GFP was measured in the vicinity of the circles (Ic) and an area of the same size equidistant from the bleaching region (Io) using ImageJ. Both intensities were set to 100% prior to the first bleaching. Fluorescence decay was plotted for each cell using Prism (GraphPad Software) and t<sub>70</sub> was defined as the time after which 70% of the initial intensity was still recorded. Finally, the average t<sub>70</sub> of several cells was calculated for both Ic and Io and shown in the graph. The same settings were used to investigate the fluorescence decay in the whole nucleus, whereas the whole nuclear area was measured and set to 100% prior to bleaching. The mean and standard deviation of individual cells was plotted in the graph.</p><p>To determine the strength of the nuclear diffusion barrier, a Zeiss LSM 510 microscope was used. Early anaphase cells were selected and photobleaching was applied on the depicted areas. To analyze the FLIP experiments, the total integrated fluorescent density in both the mother and daughter part of the nucleus was measured. After subtracting the average fluorescent loss determined by 5 neighboring cells, the fluorescent signal of the mother and daughter part was set to 100% at the beginning of the experiment. All experiments were pooled and analyzed using Prism to fit a one-phase decay curve. The barrier index was defined as the ratio of the times needed to lose 40% of the initial fluorescent signal in the bud over the mother compartment.</p><p>For the FRAP experiments, the whole bud compartment of early anaphase nuclei was bleached and fluorescent recovery was measured in a constant area located in the bud. After subtracting the average fluorescent loss by imaging based on three neighboring cells, the fluorescence after photobleaching was set to 0%. The fluorescence recovery was fitted to a one-phase association curve for each cell using Prism. T<sub>15</sub> was defined as the time to recover 15% fluorescence. The average of t<sub>15</sub> of all measured cells was calculated and is shown in the graph.</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>Plasmid retention assay</title><p>Late anaphase or telophase cells containing one, two, or four plasmids that did not co-localize with the spindle pole body were analyzed. Propagation frequency (pf) was calculated as; 100-(xa+2y√b+4z<sup>4</sup>√c)/(x+2y+4z), where a, b, and c being the percentages of cells retaining all plasmids in the mother cell and x, y, and z being the number of cells counted for one, two, or four plasmids, respectively.</p><p>Retention of pDS316 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Sinclair and Guarente, 1997</xref>) was analyzed using freshly transformed wt and mutant cells.

Using microdissection techniques, mother cells were separated from their daughter cells. After 3–5 days, both the mother and the daughter cells formed a colony, whereas the appearance of white sectors depicted whether the original cell contained pDS316.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Southern blot analysis of aged cells</title><p>Old cells were purified following the protocol of the mother enrichment program (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Lindstrom and Gottschling, 2009</xref>). Briefly, 2.5 × 10<sup>8</sup> cells were labeled with Sulfo-NHS-LC-Biotin (Pierce) and recovered for 2hr at 30°C prior to the addition of β-Estradiol (1 µM final concentration). After either 26 hr and 27.5 hr or 34 hr and 35.5 hr (for wt and mutant cells) cells were washed, diluted in PBS, and incubated with 25 µl streptavidin-coated magnetic beads (MicroMACS, Miltenyi Biotec) for 30 min at 4°C before purification using LS MACS columns (Miltenyi Biotec). Cells were eluted using 1× PBS containing 2 mM EDTA, pelleted, and split into two fractions: 1) cells were incubated in 20 µg/ml calcofluor white and bud scars were counted using fluorescence microscopy; 2) cells were lysed and DNA was purified using standard methods. DNA content was measured performing qPCR amplifying <italic>ACT1</italic> as follows: genomic DNA from wt non-aged cells was used to generate a dilution curve. Simultaneously, three qPCRs for two different dilutions were run for each genomic DNA sample derived from the aged wt, <italic>gcn5∆</italic> and <italic>sgf73∆</italic> mutant cells. The average of the six qPCR values obtained for each strain was used to calculate the volume loaded on a 0.6% agarose gel containing ethidium bromide. The gel was run in TBE containing ethidium bromide for 24 hr at 50 V at 4°C. The gel was blotted to transfer membrane (magnacharge nylon, GE Water&amp;Process Tech.) using standard protocols. Membranes were hybridized with a <sup>32</sup>P-labeled probe specific to the rDNA as described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Lindstrom et al., 2011</xref>) and visualized using a Typhoon phosphoimager (GE healthcare).</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>ERC formation assay</title><p>Cells containing one copy of the <italic>ADE2</italic> gene inserted in the rDNA array were grown over night in SD -ADE medium to prevent premature loss of the marker.

Images were acquired with a Plan Apo lambda 60×/1.4 NA objective and a Orca R2 CCD camera (Hamamatsu). Cell growth and budding events were monitored by capturing images using transmitted light every 20 min. Fluorescent images were taken after 24 hr and 36 hr for short-lived strains (e.g. <italic>sir2Δ</italic> cells) and after 48 hr and 64 hr for normal or long-lived strains using a mercury lamp as a light source (Intensilight, Nikon Instruments). Stacks of 14 slices covering a range of 7 μm were captured every 15 min for 2 hr, to follow the nuclear division. Nuclei of cells of different ages were analyzed using sum projections of the fluorescence images from both time points (48 hr and 64 hr). Total fluorescence (integrated density) was measured in the mother and daughter cell after nuclear division using ImageJ. After background subtraction, the values were grouped by the indicated age categories of the mother cells, normalized by the median of the daughter cells in the youngest age category, and plotted using Prism. Alternatively, nuclear fluorescence in the mother cells was divided by the total fluorescence (mother plus daughter nuclei) for each cell and plotted against the age of the mother cell to visualize the increase in asymmetry with age. This data were used to fit a one-phase association curve, which is shown in the graph. Additionally, 10 values were grouped age dependently and plotted showing the average age and percentage of fluorescence segregated to the mother cell as well as the standard deviations. For G1 cells, the total amount of NPCs (integrated density) was measured, plotted against their age, and an exponential curve was fitted using Prism. The values were then normalized by intersection of the curve with the Y-axis and set to 1. The dots on the graph were created from 10 values as described for the dividing cells. Similarly, the mean fluorescence intensity (integrated density divided by area) was plotted as well as the radius of the G1 nuclei, measured drawing a line through the nucleus at its broadest area using ImageJ, dividing it by two and plotting it against the age of the cell.</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>Lifespan analysis</title><p>Pedigree analysis was done as described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Shcheprova et al., 2008</xref>): freshly streaked cells were restreaked on YPD plates and 2 hr later virgin daughter cells were placed to analyze their lifespan.

Your article has been favorably evaluated by Randy Schekman (Senior editor), a guest Reviewing editor, and 2 reviewers.</p><p>The Reviewing editor and the reviewers discussed their comments before we reached this decision, and the Reviewing editor has assembled the following comments to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>The paper is interesting and worthy of publication. The reviewers agree with the conclusions that, as yeast cells age, ERCs interact with the NPC through a mechanism that requires SAGA and that this alters the behavior (and potentially the function) of NPCs. However the reviewers also agree that the authors have overstated the mechanistic contribution of SAGA in the linkage of circular DNAs to the NPC. This latter conclusion is unsubstantiated without quite a bit more experimental evidence. To conclude that SAGA is really mediating the interaction with the NPC, the authors need to better define this mechanism. Does SAGA bind equally throughout the plasmid after eviction of the CEN? How does the E173A mutation impact this binding? How different is the acetylation of the histones associated with centromeric vs the non-centromeric plasmid? Therefore, it is recommended that the authors may proceed if they remove these claims. Nevertheless, even to make the case for the SAGA linkage at all, there are couple of things that must be addressed, some with simple straightforward experiments: 1) In the plasmid retention assay, perform the double mutant <italic>gcn5∆ sac3∆</italic> (or <italic>ada5∆sac3∆</italic> <italic>–</italic> better) measurements to properly test that there is no additive effect in eliminating TREX and SAGA.</p><p>2) The quantitative data for NPC cap formation in a <italic>bud6∆</italic> mutant should be shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>.</p><p>3) In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11">Figure 11C</xref>, another interpretation of the data is that <italic>GCN5</italic> and <italic>SPT20</italic> are required for the RLS extension caused by deleting <italic>FOB1</italic>, possibly because the <italic>gcn5∆</italic> mutant already has reduced ERC accumulation (as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>).</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.03790.019</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>The paper is interesting and worthy of publication.

However the reviewers also agree that the authors have overstated the mechanistic contribution of SAGA in the linkage of circular DNAs to the NPC</italic>.</p><p>We agree with the reviewers’ comment that we don’t know precisely how SAGA promotes the interaction of DNA circles with NPCs. SAGA might be part of a physical linker or might act by modifying chromatin or pore components to promote interaction between the circles and the NPCs. We have edited the manuscript to make sure that there is no confusion about this point and added a paragraph in the Discussion section to address the different possibilities of how SAGA would promote attachment of DNA circles to NPCs.</p><p><italic>1) In the plasmid retention assay, perform the double mutant gcn5∆ sac3∆ (or ada5∆sac3∆ – better) measurements to properly test that there is no additive effect in eliminating TREX and SAGA</italic>.</p><p>To address the reviewers’ suggestion we created both double mutant strains. Unfortunately, in our hands the <italic>ada5Δ sac3Δ</italic> double mutant cells were very sick. Therefore, we analyzed the <italic>gcn5Δ sac3Δ</italic> double mutant cells. Simultaneously deleting <italic>GCN5</italic> and <italic>SAC3</italic> does not lead to additive effects compared to the single mutants, supporting the hypothesis that SAGA and TREX-2 function together in the same pathway for what concerns DNA circle retention in the mother cell. These data were added to the manuscript in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>.</p><p><italic>2) The quantitative data for NPC cap formation in a bud6∆ mutant should be shown in</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2"><italic>Figure 2</italic></xref>.</p><p>As requested by the reviewers, we added these results to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>. Similar to wt cells, the NPC signal is twice as strong around the plasmids compared to the residual nuclear area.</p><p><italic>3) In</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11"><italic>Figure 11C</italic></xref><italic>, another interpretation of the data is that GCN5 and SPT20 are required for the RLS extension caused by deleting FOB1, possibly because the gcn5∆ mutant already has reduced ERC accumulation (as shown in</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3"><italic>Figure 3C</italic></xref><italic>)</italic>.</p><p>We agree with the reviewers that this is a possibility; however this is unlikely to be due to a reduced rate of ERC formation. Indeed, we are now adding data on the effect of SAGA inactivation on recombination in the rDNA. As we show now, the <italic>gcn5∆</italic> mutant cells do not show a reduced frequency of rDNA excision; if anything it is rather slightly increased. Thus, the only thing that we can conclude from these data is that in both the <italic>gcn5Δ</italic> single and <italic>gcn5Δ fob1Δ</italic> double mutant cells ERC accumulation is no longer the factor limiting longevity.</p><p>Our new data also permit to extend the discussion opened by a recent study by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">McCormick et al. (2014)</xref>, who suggest that the effect of Sgf73 on ageing is partially due to a decrease in ERC formation. Using the same test as for the <italic>gcn5∆</italic>, we confirmed that indeed, cells lacking Sgf73 show a reduction (2 folds) in ERC formation, similar to the cells lacking Fob1. However, the <italic>sgf73∆</italic> mutant cells show a much more prolonged lifespan compared to the <italic>fob1∆</italic> mutant cells. Thus, the effect of the <italic>sgf73∆</italic> mutation on longevity probably involved a combination of effects, such as a reduction of ERC formation and the lack of retention of the residual ERCs. This interpretation is still fully supported by the fact that restoring SAGA linkage to NPCs in these cells restores ageing.</p></body></sub-article></article>
