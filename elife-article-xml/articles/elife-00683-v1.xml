Nodal-related signaling factors are required for axis formation and germ layer specification from sea urchins to mammals. Maternal transcripts of the zebrafish Nodal factor, Squint (Sqt), are localized to future embryonic dorsal. The mechanisms by which maternal sqt/nodal RNA is localized and regulated have been unclear. Here, we show that maternal control of Nodal signaling via the conserved Y box-binding protein 1 (Ybx1) is essential. We identified Ybx1 via a proteomic screen. Ybx1 recognizes the 3’ untranslated region (UTR) of sqt RNA and prevents premature translation and Sqt/Nodal signaling. Maternal-effect mutations in zebrafish <italic>ybx1</italic> lead to deregulated Nodal signaling, gastrulation failure, and embryonic lethality. Implanted Nodal-coated beads phenocopy <italic>ybx1</italic> mutant defects. Thus, Ybx1 prevents ectopic Nodal activity, revealing a new paradigm in the regulation of Nodal signaling, which is likely to be conserved.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.00683.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.00683.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.00683.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>In many organisms, embryonic development is controlled in part by RNAs that are deposited into the egg as it forms inside the mother. These ‘maternal RNAs’ may localize to particular regions of the egg or embryo, where they are then exclusively translated into protein and carry out their specific function. This helps to establish asymmetry in the developing organism—that is, to produce tissues that will eventually become the top or bottom, front or back, and left or right of the organism.</p><p>One such maternal RNA encodes Nodal, a key signaling molecule that is conserved across vertebrate and some invertebrate organisms. In zebrafish, the equivalent RNA is called squint, and plays an important role in embryonic development. The squint RNA deposited by the mother localizes to the dorsal region—the embryo’s back—and signals that region to make dorsal tissues, but how squint is regulated is not well understood. Now, Kumari et al. identify a protein that controls the positioning of squint RNA, and find that it can also prevent this RNA from being translated into protein.</p><p>The squint RNA contains a ‘dorsal localization element’ that recruits it to the dorsal cells of the embryo by the 4-cell stage (i.e., within two cell divisions after the egg is fertilized). Kumari et al. identified a protein called Ybx1 that could bind to this element: this protein may help to correctly position RNAs in many other organisms, including fruit flies and mammals. Strikingly, embryos formed abnormally when their maternally derived Ybx1 protein was mutant, and these mutations also prevented the squint RNA from localizing properly. This suggests that maternally derived Ybx1 protein directly regulates the squint RNA.</p><p>As well as positioning the squint RNA correctly, the embryo must translate this RNA into protein at the right time. In embryos with mutant maternal Ybx1 protein, the Squint protein could be detected at the 16-cell stage, whereas in wild-type embryos this protein is not translated until the 256-cell stage; this indicates that Ybx1 protein might normally repress the translation of the squint RNA. Indeed, Kumari et al. found that Ybx1 binds to another protein—eIF4E—that recruits mRNAs to the ribosome (the cell’s translational machinery). Ybx1 might therefore prevent eIF4E from associating with other components of the ribosomal complex, and initiating the translation of the squint RNA, until additional signals have been received. It will be interesting to determine how widespread this regulatory mechanism is in other organisms.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.00683.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.00683.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author keywords</title><kwd>Nodal signaling</kwd><kwd>squint RNA</kwd><kwd>dorsal localization</kwd><kwd>RNA localization</kwd><kwd>translational control</kwd><kwd>RNA-binding</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Zebrafish</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Temasek Life Sciences Laboratory</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kumari</surname><given-names>Pooja</given-names></name><name><surname>Gilligan</surname><given-names>Patrick C</given-names></name><name><surname>Lim</surname><given-names>Shimin</given-names></name><name><surname>Sampath</surname><given-names>Karuna</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Singapore Millenium Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Gilligan</surname><given-names>Patrick C</given-names></name><name><surname>Lim</surname><given-names>Shimin</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Nanyang Technological University</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Lim</surname><given-names>Shimin</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Mechanobiology Institute, National University of Singapore</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Tran</surname><given-names>Long Duc</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Agency for Science, Technology, and Research</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Philp</surname><given-names>Robin</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Max Planck Society</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Winkler</surname><given-names>Sylke</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Regulation of conserved Nodal factors by a maternal protein ensures that Nodal signaling is repressed until the appropriate time in embryonic development.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Nodal factors are secreted signaling proteins of the transforming growth factor-β family, with essential functions in axis formation and germ layer specification during embryonic development in sea urchins, snails, ascidians, frogs, fish, and mammals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Jones et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Collignon et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Erter et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Feldman et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Rebagliati et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Sampath et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Hudson and Yasuo, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Shen, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Constam, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Grande and Patel, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Duboc et al., 2010</xref>). Nodal signaling has also been shown to be important for maintaining human ES cell pluripotency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">James et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Vallier et al., 2005</xref>). Misregulated Nodal signaling has been found associated with tumor metastases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Topczewska et al., 2006</xref>). Therefore, understanding the mechanisms that regulate Nodal signaling is crucial.</p><p>Nodal signaling is regulated by transcription factors such as DRAP1, FoxH1 and Oct4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Sirotkin et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Cao et al., 2008</xref>). Signal transduction occurs by binding of Nodal ligands to the receptor complex, and activation of downstream Smad effectors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Shen, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Schier, 2009</xref>). Feedback regulation of Nodal signaling is mediated by the Lefty antagonists (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Cheng et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Meno et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Branford and Yost, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Feldman et al., 2002</xref>). Work in <italic>Xenopus</italic>, zebrafish, and humans showed that Nodal signaling is regulated by miRNAs, but the precise mechanism is unknown (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Schier, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Luo et al., 2012</xref>). Nodal signaling is also influenced by secretion, endocytosis, lysosomal degradation, post-translational modifications, and processing of the ligands (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Zhang et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Shen, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Tian et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Constam, 2009</xref>). Spatially restricted translation of exogenous xCR1 reporters in frogs has been suggested (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Zhang et al., 2009</xref>). But so far, a direct role for translational control in regulation of Nodal signaling has not been uncovered.</p><p>We showed previously that maternal RNA encoding the zebrafish Nodal factor, Squint (Sqt), is localized to two cells by the 4-cell stage, and predicts embryonic dorsal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Gore et al., 2005</xref>). RNA localization is an important mechanism that generates asymmetry in cells and organisms. For example, bicoid RNA localization in <italic>Drosophila</italic> oocytes and embryos is required for specification of anterior cell fates, and localization of maternal pem-1 and macho-1 RNAs determines the posterior end of ascidian embryos (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Nishida and Sawada, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Sardet et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">St Johnston and Nüsslein-Volhard, 1992</xref>). Mechanisms to ensure correct transport of the RNA and inhibition of translation until the RNA reaches its destination are essential for this process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Johnstone and Lasko, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Martin and Ephrussi, 2009</xref>). In addition, translational control is an important step for regulation of some RNAs. For instance, a proportion of maternal nanos RNA is uniformly distributed in the cytoplasm of <italic>Drosophila</italic> embryos but is not translated, and Nanos protein is only synthesized from localized nanos RNA at the posterior pole (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Gavis and Lehmann, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Smibert et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bergsten and Gavis, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Crucs et al., 2000</xref>). In zebrafish embryos, transport of maternal sqt/nodal RNA to future dorsal is dependent on the microtubule cytoskeleton (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Gore et al., 2005</xref>). However, how maternal sqt RNA is regulated until it reaches future dorsal was not known.</p><p>To understand global regulation of sqt/nodal we carried out a screen for sqt 3′UTR-binding proteins, and show here, that the conserved Y box-binding protein 1 (Ybx1) binds the 3′ untranslated region (UTR) in sqt RNA. Genetic analysis of <italic>ybx1</italic> mutants shows that maternal Ybx1 function is essential for embryonic development. Loss of Ybx1 function causes mis-localization of sqt RNA and precocious Sqt protein translation, leading to premature and uncontrolled Nodal signaling, and embryonic lethality. Thus, maternal Ybx1 is required for translational control of Nodal signaling. Since the 3′UTR of mammalian nodal RNAs can localize in fish embryos, it is likely that this control mechanism of translational repression is conserved. Our results identify a new mode of regulation of Nodal signaling, and highlight the role of maternal factors in regulation of growth factor signaling and cell-type specification in vertebrates.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Identification of a dorsal localization element (DLE)-binding factor in zebrafish embryos</title><p>The dorsal localization element (DLE) of sqt RNA resides in the first 50 nucleotides of the sqt 3′UTR, and encompasses sequence and structural elements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Gilligan et al., 2011</xref>). To identify the proteins that specifically recognize the DLE, 100-nucleotide long radioactive probes spanning the sqt 3′UTR were used for RNA gel-shift assays with zebrafish whole embryo extracts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A,B</xref>). We observed a number of binding activities in gel-shift assays with sqt probes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). The DLE-containing sqt1 probe was bound by an activity, which we named <underline>s</underline>qt-<underline>R</underline>NA <underline>B</underline>inding <underline>F</underline>actor <underline>1</underline> (SRBF1; arrow in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). Competition gel-shift assays with control gfp, vg1 and cyclops RNA show that SRBF1 preferentially binds the sqt DLE (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C,D</xref>). RNA-cross-linking assays show that SRBF1 is approximately 48–50 kDa (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). To precisely map the SRBF1 binding site, a 10-nucleotide sqt1 deletion series was tested for binding. Whereas deletions in the coding sequence did not affect SRBF1 binding, deletions 1–4 (Δ1–Δ4, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C,E</xref>) abolish, or significantly reduce binding to the sqt1 probe. The SRBF1 binding site overlaps with sequences required for dorsal localization of sqt RNA (i.e., Δ1 and Δ2; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Gilligan et al., 2011</xref>], and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C,E</xref>).

Embryonic SRBF1 and rYbx1 bind to sense sqt1 RNA, but not to control gapdh, or to antisense sqt1 probes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>).

To determine if Ybx1 forms protein–RNA complexes in vivo with sqt RNA, we performed RNA-immunoprecipitation (RNA-IP) with embryo lysates, and RT-PCR to detect sqt. RNA-IP with anti-Ybx1 antibodies shows a sqt product, whereas control (RT-) and RNA-IP using IgG antibodies do not show any product (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>).

Extracts from wild-type embryos were immunoprecipitated with antibodies to Ybx1, eIF4G or eIF4E, followed by western blot, and RT-PCR to detect sqt RNA. Co-immunoprecipitation assays show that Ybx1 interacts with eIF4E but not with eIF4G, and RNA-IP experiments show that sqt RNA is detected in pull-downs with antibodies towards Ybx1, eIF4G and eIF4E. In contrast, gapdh and wnt8a RNA can be detected in RNA-IP with the eIF4G and eIF4E proteins, but not with Ybx1. Hence, Ybx1 binds sqt RNA and the 5′ 7-methyl-guanosine cap binding protein eIF4E, but is not found in translation initiation complexes with gapdh and wnt8a RNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C,D</xref>).

To directly determine the effects of excess Nodal protein from the yolk, we implanted Affi-gel beads that were pre-soaked in either control BSA protein or purified mouse Nodal protein, into the yolk of wild-type embryos, and examined YSN (schematic in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>).

Our use of a temperature-sensitive <italic>ybx1</italic> allele, that allows selective and conditional disruption of maternal Ybx1 function at early stages, shows that Nodal signaling is the only pathway affected at these stages in the mutants. This allele can potentially be a used as a tool to identify other genes and processes regulated by Ybx1.</p><p>Ybx1 is an abundant molecule and neither the RNA nor protein is spatially restricted. How, then, is Ybx1 binding specificity achieved? It is possible that other regions of Ybx1 than the CSD, and other factors in the Ybx1–RNP complex confer specificity to the interactions. Such context-dependent specificity has been observed for many transcription factor complexes and other RNA-binding proteins as well. For example, a bipartite RNA recognition module in Lin28 (which contains a CSD) binds to two distinct regions of let-7 RNA to regulate its biogenesis, and two distinct RNA-binding domains in fragile X mental retardation protein (FMRP), recognize distinct RNA elements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Tong et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Nam et al., 2011</xref>). In support of this possibility, we find that in addition to the residues in the CSD, the DD, RNP and ssDBD domains of Ybx1 are also required for binding to sqt RNA, and likely confer specificity to the interactions. By contrast, the CSD-containing Lin28 protein does not bind to the sqt DLE. Furthermore, the <italic>ybx1</italic><sup><italic>sg8</italic></sup> mutation, which deletes the Ybx1 C-terminus, which is thought to be a protein interaction domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Wolffe, 1994</xref>), results in more severe phenotypes and earlier lethality than <italic>ybx1</italic><sup><italic>sa42</italic></sup>. It is likely that the residues lacking in the truncated Ybx1<sup>sg8</sup> peptide are also important for its functions.</p><p>Our findings show that a major function of maternal Ybx1 is to regulate Nodal signaling via its effects on sqt RNA localization, processing, and translation. Maternal sqt RNA is largely non-polyadenylated at early cleavage stages, and polyA-containing sqt RNA is normally detected from the 16-cell stage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Lim et al., 2012</xref>). In M<italic>ybx1</italic> embryos, polyA-sqt RNA is detected even at the 1-cell stage, indicating premature polyadenylation. Regulating the length of the polyA tail is known to mediate translational control of the RNA; for example, cyclin A RNA is stored in <italic>Drosophila</italic> oocytes with short polyA tails (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Morris et al., 2005</xref>). Ybx1 interacts with the translation initiation factor eIF4E and the sqt 3′UTR. Interactions of 3′UTR binding proteins with translation initiation factors, such as the CPEB-Maskin-eIF4E complex, has been shown in translational control of maternal RNAs in <italic>Xenopus</italic> oocytes. Maskin binds the cap-binding factor eIF4E, and prevents interactions between eIF4G and eIF4E, which is required for recruitment of the 40S ribosome subunit to the 5′end of mRNAs, and thereby represses translation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Cao and Richter, 2002</xref>). Similarly, in <italic>Drosophila</italic> oocytes, cup binds eIF4E and Bruno to regulate oskar RNA translation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Nakamura et al., 2004</xref>). Mammalian YB1 prevents eIF4G from binding to eIF4E, and blocks initiation of translation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Nekrasov et al., 2003</xref>). Binding of Ybx1 to the sqt 3′UTR and eIF4E likely prevents eIF4G and eIF4E complex formation, and in M<italic>ybx1</italic> mutants, in the absence of Ybx1 function, Sqt translation occurs precociously. Thus, Ybx1 binding to the translation initiation factors and the sqt 3′UTR can lead to translational repression of sqt RNA.</p><p>Consistent with Ybx1 being a DLE-binder, sqt RNA localization is disrupted in M<italic>ybx1</italic>, and many Sqt/Nodal target genes (including sqt) show precocious and elevated expression. Surprisingly, the Nodal target <italic>lefty2</italic> is not detected in mutant embryos. Therefore, <italic>lefty2</italic> expression requires factors or inputs that are missing in M<italic>ybx1</italic>. The lack of feedback inhibition in the absence of Lefty2 together with elevated Sqt/Nodal levels likely exacerbates deregulated Nodal signaling in M<italic>ybx1</italic>. The YSL expansion and gastrulation defects in M<italic>ybx1</italic> mutants can be rescued by blocking Nodal signaling via lefty overexpression or by using the <italic>sqt</italic><sup><italic>cz35</italic></sup> genetic background that lacks the signaling functions of Sqt, indicating that these phenotypes arise from excess Nodal signaling. Interestingly, M<italic>ybx1;</italic>Z<italic>sqt</italic> compound mutant embryos are similar to <italic>cyc;sqt</italic> double mutants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Feldman et al., 1998</xref>), suggesting that maternal Ybx1 may have additional functions in regulation of Nodal signaling. We also found that Wnt signaling targets are not induced in M<italic>ybx1</italic> mutants, where wnt8a RNA localization and Wnt8a-GFP protein expression are normal, but maternal sqt RNA is mis-localized. Therefore, the response to the maternal Wnt signal requires dorsal localization of maternal sqt RNA. This supports our previous findings, where over-expression of localized non-coding sqt RNA increased dorsal β-Catenin nuclei numbers and elevated Wnt target gene expression, and mis-localization of sqt RNA by morpholinos that also block Sqt translation resulted in loss of dorsal β-Catenin accumulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Lim et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>We had previously shown that human NODAL 3′UTR fused with lacZ localizes dorsally in zebrafish (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Gore et al., 2005</xref>). This was surprising since mammalian embryos are thought to undergo regulative development. Moreover, Nodal RNA is not localized in early mouse embryos (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Robertson et al., 2003</xref>; Cheong and Sampath, unpublished observations). Ybx1 binds the DLE, and regulates localization and translation of sqt. The sqt DLE, therefore, encompasses a localization and translational control element. This suggests that the mammalian NODAL 3′UTR may also harbor a translational control module. Our finding that maternal sqt/nodal must be translationally repressed, and that deregulated maternal Nodal signaling is catastrophic, shows that this is an essential control mechanism. Translational control is a new paradigm in regulation of this pathway. It will be interesting to see if this mechanism regulates Nodal signaling in other organisms or biological processes. Since human NODAL and ALK7 receptors are expressed in the ovary and placenta, and elevated NODAL is associated with pre-eclamptic placentas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Nadeem et al., 2011</xref>), precise regulation of maternal Nodal signaling is likely to be important for human placentation. Moreover, uncontrolled and deregulated Nodal signaling has been associated with metastasizing tumors, underscoring the importance of precise and timely regulation of Nodal signaling. Finally, Nodal signaling is essential for maintaining stem cell pluripotency, and current methods to generate and maintain embryonic stem cell (ESC) and induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSC) rely upon transcription factors. Our finding that Nodal signaling is maternally regulated by translational repression could allow modulation of these important therapeutic cells by this new mechanism.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>RNA gel-shifts and UV cross-linking assays</title><p>Embryos were homogenized in 1/10 vol lysis buffer (20 mM Tris pH 8.0, 100 mM NaCl, 0.1 mM EDTA, 1 mM 6-aminohexanoic acid, 1 mM PMSF, 25% glycerol) to make extracts.

Your article has now been peer reviewed and we regret to inform you that your work will not be considered further for publication at this time. Your submission has been evaluated by 3 reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and a Senior editor, and the decision was reached after discussions between the reviewers. Although the work is of interest, we regret to inform you that the consensus of the reviewers is that the findings at this stage are too preliminary for publication by <italic>eLife</italic>.</p><p>The following individual responsible for the peer review of your submission has agreed to reveal her identity: Ruth Lehmann, Reviewing editor.</p><p>While this is an extensive analysis starting with an RNA binding sequence, identifying a transacting factor and finally connecting this transacting factor to the regulation of the target RNA, the results have to be considered in view of what we learn new about Ybx1 protein and the developmental process that is addressed. For example, it is important to note that Ybx1 has had several different names over the years including p54 and Frgy and since it's discovery in the early ’80s (if not before) has been characterized as a fairly ubiquitous sequence-nonspecific RNA binding protein of relatively unclear function. Some authors liken it to be an “RNA histone” whereas others think that it stabilizes mRNA by binding RNA in a cap-dependent manner. It is also a transcription factor and binds a “Y box.” Thus the protein has a long and checkered history and, like TAR RNA binding protein, often is identified in screens because of its abundance and its apparent ability to bind nucleic acids with little specificity. Thus all reviewers feel that additional experimental evidence would need to be provided to make the paper suitable for <italic>eLife</italic>.</p><p>The major points that would need to be addressed are:</p><p>1) More direct evidence for a specific molecular role of Ybx1 in squint regulation. Otherwise this study will not go beyond the many other papers on Ybx1 and will just be another description of Ybx1 binding to RNA. Here are some suggestions: A) provide quantitative binding assays that demonstrate specificity. B) Provide evidence regarding the mechanism for how Ybx1 inhibits translation. Indeed, there is no convincing direct evidence in this manuscript that Ybx1 really does regulate squint mRNA translation, this is important given this protein's long checkered history. Also see for example evidence for Ybx1 promoting rather than repressing translation in cancer cells during EMT (Evdokimova, et al., (2009). Or C) provide evidence supporting the mechanisms by which Ybx1 suppresses splicing of sqt RNA in the cytoplasm. This is an intriguing observation, but evidence for “cytoplasmic splicing” is at best debatable (see König et al., (2007) versus Steitz et al. (2008)). Data provided in the manuscript are also compatible with a role of Ybx1 in transcription.</p><p>You would need to specifically address any of these points and provide novel insight into the function of Ybx1 for any further consideration.</p><p>2) You conclude that <italic>sqt</italic> is the major target of Ybx1. The maternal-effect phenotype of Ybx1 is interpreted as an expansion of the YSL. A functional correlate via Nodal/Sqt signaling is provided by the finding that Nodal beads implanted into wild-type embryos affect YSL but not when transplanted into oep mutants. However, the phenotype can also be interpreted as a defect in late cytokinesis during early embryogenesis, leading to an aberrant ectopic syncytium. Mybx1<sup>sg8</sup> mutants exhibit rounded cells as well as loose cells in the chorionic space (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>), which are very characteristic of defects in late cytokinesis (sometimes embryos with these defects also become overtly abnormal at about the third cell cycle). The later defect in Mybx1<sup>sa42</sup> is also characteristic of weaker versions of these phenotypes. Although the manuscript concludes that the early cleavage stage defects in M<italic>ybx</italic> mutants is caused by an enlarged YSL, the possibility that these defects are simply a cause of an aberrant syncytium due to defects in early cytokinesis is not well substantiated. Similarly, while it is plausible that excess nodal signaling is behind the overt “syncytial” phenotypes of the M<italic>ybx1</italic> mutants, an alternative possibility is that targets other than nodal are also misregulated, resulting in defects in cell division. The transplanted bead experiments do not preclude this possibility. A crucial and absolutely critical experiment to test this would be a M<italic>ybx1</italic>, MZ<italic>oep</italic> double mutant.</p><p>3) The most apparent early defect observed in M<italic>ybx1</italic> mutants is that of mRNA transport along what appear to be axial streamers, from the ooplasm in the yolk to the blastodisc where the mRNA becomes localized.

Is the effect truly specific to transport of maternal nodal mRNA? <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4–figure supplement 1</xref> A states that Wnt8a transport can also be affected. It may be that the defect mostly affects ooplasmic transcripts that need to be transported to the forming blastodisc.

Towards this end, we have performed new experiments to examine how Ybx1 regulates sqt translation, to address point 1B.</p><p>Specifically, we determined if Ybx1 forms a complex with the translation initiation machinery and sqt RNA.</p><p>As shown in revised <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5 C,D</xref> and revised <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5–figure supplement 1C</xref>, <italic>Ybx1 interacts with eIF4E in the translation initiation complex</italic>. eIF4E is known to bind the 5 methyl guanosine cap at the 5’UTR of mRNAs. Furthermore, RNA-IP with Ybx1, eIF4G and eIF4E antibodies pulls down sqt RNA (see revised <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5 C,D</xref>) whereas control RNAs (gapdh and wnt8a) interact with the eIF4G and eIF4E proteins, but not with Ybx1. Thus, Ybx1 interacts with the translation initiation machinery and with the DLE in the sqt 3’UTR.</p><p>Response to point 1A: to demonstrate specificity of Ybx1 interactions with sqt RNA, we show that:</p><p>1) Deletions in the DLE that disrupt sqt dorsal localization also abolish Ybx1 binding.</p><p>2) Ybx1 does not bind the DLE antisense probe.</p><p>3) Other localized RNAs do not compete for binding in semi-quantitative competition gel-shift assays with 5 to 80-fold excess of cold competitor RNAs (see revised <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>, where we show that sqt RNA with the sqt 3’UTR binds preferentially to SRBF1/Ybx1).</p><p>4) With antibodies to Ybx1 we get RNA-IP on sqt, and not other RNAs.</p><p>5) In contrast to Ybx1, cold shock domain containing proteins such as Lin28A do not bind sqt (see revised <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2–figure supplement 2A</xref>).</p><p>Therefore, although it is surprising, taken together, the evidence we have provided in our manuscript supports specific binding of Ybx1 to the sqt DLE.</p><p>Response to point 1C: The interesting link between splicing of sqt RNA and ybx1 will require additional work, particularly in light of the cytoplasmic splicing literature, and therefore we feel this issue is beyond the scope of the present Kumari et al. manuscript.</p><p><italic>2) You conclude that</italic> sqt <italic>is the major target of Ybx1.
