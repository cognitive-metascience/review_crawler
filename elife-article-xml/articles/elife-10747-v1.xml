carrier state. Two major serovars of <italic>Salmonella enterica</italic>, Typhi and Typhimurium, have evolved a two-component regulatory system to exist inside <italic>Salmonella</italic>-containing vacuoles in the macrophage, as well as to persist as asymptomatic biofilms in the gallbladder. Here we present evidence that SsrB, a transcriptional regulator encoded on the SPI-2 pathogenicity-island, determines the switch between these two lifestyles by controlling ancestral and horizontally-acquired genes. In the acidic macrophage vacuole, the kinase SsrA phosphorylates SsrB, and SsrB~P relieves silencing of virulence genes and activates their transcription. In the absence of SsrA, unphosphorylated SsrB directs transcription of factors required for biofilm formation specifically by activating <italic>csgD</italic> (<italic>agfD</italic>), the master biofilm regulator by disrupting the silenced, H-NS-bound promoter. Anti-silencing mechanisms thus control the switch between opposing lifestyles.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.10747.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.10747.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.10747.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p><italic>Salmonella</italic> bacteria can infect a range of hosts, including humans and poultry, and cause sickness and diseases such as typhoid fever. Disease-causing <italic>Salmonella</italic> evolved from harmless bacteria in part by acquiring new genes from other organisms through a process called horizontal gene transfer. However, some strains of disease-causing <italic>Salmonella</italic> can also survive inside hosts as communities called biofilms without causing any illness to their hosts, who act as carriers of the disease and are able to pass their infection on to others.</p><p>So how do <italic>Salmonella</italic> bacteria ‘decide’ between these two lifestyles? Previous studies have uncovered a regulatory system that controls the decision in <italic>Salmonella</italic>, which is made up of two proteins called SsrA and SsrB. To trigger the disease-causing lifestyle, SsrA is activated and adds a phosphate group onto SsrB. This in turn causes SsrB to bind to and switch on disease-associated genes in the bacterium. However, it was less clear how the biofilm lifestyle was triggered.</p><p>Desai et al. now reveal that the phosphate-free form of SsrB – which was considered to be the inactive form of this protein – plays an important role in the formation of biofilms. Experiments involving an approach called atomic force microscopy showed that the unmodified SsrB acts to stop a major gene that controls biofilm formation from being switched off by a so-called repressor protein.</p><p><italic>Salmonella</italic> acquired SsrB through horizontal gene transfer, and these findings show how this protein now acts as a molecular switch between disease-causing and biofilm-based lifestyles. SsrB protein is also involved in the decision to switch between these states, but how it does so remains a question for future work.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.10747.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.10747.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>biofilm</kwd><kwd>salmonella typhimurium</kwd><kwd>two-component regulatory system</kwd><kwd>ssrA/B</kwd><kwd>csgD/agfD</kwd><kwd>H-NS</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd>Other</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>VA</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>5IOBX-000372</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kenney</surname><given-names>Linda J</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Research Centre of Excellence in Mechanobiology, NUS, Ministry of Education, Singapore</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kenney</surname><given-names>Linda J</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Singapore Ministry of Education Research Fund, Tier 2</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>MOE 2013-T2-1-154</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Jie</surname><given-names>Yan</given-names></name><name><surname>Kenney</surname><given-names>Linda J</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>A response regulator acquired via lateral gene transfer has rewired an ancestral genetic circuitry and regulates alternative pathogenic lifestyles.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p><italic>Salmonella enterica</italic> serovar Typhimurium is a rod-shaped enteric bacterium which easily infects diverse hosts such as humans, cattle, poultry and reptiles through contaminated food or water, causing gastroenteritis. A human-restricted serovar of <italic>Salmonella enterica</italic>, serovar Typhi, causes typhoid fever and continues to be a dangerous pathogen throughout the world. <italic>Salmonella</italic> lives as a facultative pathogen in various natural and artificial environments as independent planktonic cells, cooperative swarms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Harshey and Matsuyama, 1994</xref>) or as multi-cellular communities called biofilms (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Steenackers et al., 2012</xref> for a review). Upon successful invasion of host cells, <italic>Salmonella</italic> is phagocytosed by macrophages, where it resides in a modified vacuole in a self-nourishing niche called a Salmonella-Containing Vacuole (SCV). This intracellular lifestyle eventually adversely affects the host. <italic>Salmonella</italic> also resides as multi-cellular communities on intestinal epithelial cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Boddicker et al., 2002</xref>), gallstones (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Prouty et al., 2002</xref>) and tumors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Crull et al., 2011</xref>). It is believed that biofilms in the gall bladder are important for maintaining the carrier state, allowing <italic>Salmonella</italic> to persist (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Crawford et al., 2010</xref>).</p><p>Each of these lifestyles of <italic>Salmonella</italic> are regulated by two-component regulatory systems (TCRS). TCRSs are comprised of a membrane-bound sensor histidine kinase and a cytoplasmic response regulator. The virulence genes of <italic>Salmonella</italic> are encoded on horizontally acquired AT-rich segments of the genome called Salmonella Pathogenecity Islands (SPIs), and are also tightly regulated by TCRSs. For example, the SsrA/B TCRS is essential for the activation of the SPI-2 regulon genes encoding a type-three secretory needle and effectors that are involved in formation of the SCV (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Cirillo et al., 1998</xref>). Interestingly, the SsrA/B system itself is regulated by upstream two-component systems such as EnvZ/OmpR and PhoP/Q, which regulate gene expression in response to changes in osmolality, pH and the presence of anti-microbial peptides (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Fields et al., 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Miller et al., 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Lee et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Feng et al., 2003</xref>). The <italic>ssrA</italic> and <italic>ssrB</italic> genes are present on the SPI-2 pathogenecity island adjacent to each other and are regulated by a set of divergent promoters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Feng et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Ochman et al., 1996</xref>). Under acidic pH and low osmolality, the <italic>ssrA</italic> and <italic>ssrB</italic> genes are transcriptionally activated by the binding of OmpR~P and PhoP~P to their promoters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Feng et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bijlsma and Groisman, 2005</xref>; Walthers and Kenney unpublished) whose levels are in turn regulated by the respective sensor kinases, EnvZ and PhoQ. SsrA is a tripartite membrane-bound histidine sensor kinase that undergoes a series of intra-molecular phosphorylation reactions before it transfers the phosphoryl group to the N-terminal aspartate residue of the response regulator, SsrB.</p><p>SsrB belongs to the NarL/FixJ family of transcriptional regulators that require phosphorylation-dependent dimerization to bind DNA. The X-ray crystal structure of NarL revealed that the C-terminal DNA binding domain was occluded by the N-terminus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Baikalov et al., 1996</xref>), and phosphorylation was predicted to relieve this inhibition. Full-length SsrB is unstable in solution, but an isolated C-terminal domain of SsrB, SsrBc, is capable of binding to the regulatory regions of nine genes belonging to the SPI-2 regulon, including <italic>ssrA</italic> and <italic>ssrB</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Feng et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Walthers et al., 2007</xref>) and activating transcription. A role for SsrB~P was identified by its dual function as a direct transcriptional activator and as an anti-silencer of H-NS-mediated repression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Walthers et al., 2007</xref>). The Histone like Nucleoid Structuring protein H-NS is involved in silencing many of the SPI-2 regulon genes in accordance with its role in binding to xenogenic AT-rich sequences and repressing their expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Walthers et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Navarre et al., 2006</xref>). H-NS binding to DNA leads to the formation of a stiff nucleoprotein filament which is essential in gene silencing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Lim et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Liu et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Amit et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Winardhi et al., 2015</xref>). Moreover, relief of repression occurs due to the binding of SsrBc to this rigid H-NS-DNA complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Walthers et al., 2011</xref>).</p><p><italic>Salmonella</italic> reservoirs in host and non-host environments produce a three-dimensional extracellular matrix which consists of curli fimbriae, cellulose, proteins and extracellular DNA, to encase clusters of bacteria and form a mature biofilm. CsgD (AgfD) is the master regulator of biofilm formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Gerstel et al., 2003</xref>); it is a LuxR family transcriptional activator that activates the expression of curli fimbriae encoded by <italic>csgDEFG/csgBAC</italic> operons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Collinson et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Romling et al., 1998</xref>). CsgD also activates expression of <italic>adrA</italic>, increasing intracellular c-di-GMP levels, and activating the cellulose biosynthetic operon <italic>bcsABZC</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Zogaj et al., 2001</xref>). Two other biofilm matrix components are also positively regulated by CsgD: BapA and the O-antigen capsule (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Latasa et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Gibson et al., 2006</xref>).</p><p>Transcriptional profiling of biofilms formed by <italic>S</italic>. Typhimurium SL1344 showed that many SPI-2 genes were down-regulated, yet SsrA was required for biofilms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hamilton et al., 2009</xref>). This apparent paradox drove us to explore the underlying mechanism of biofilm formation. The role of SsrA/B in this process was of particular interest, since our previous comparison of SsrA and SsrB levels at neutral and acidic pH had shown that the expression of <italic>ssrA</italic> and <italic>ssrB</italic> was uncoupled (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Feng et al., 2004</xref>).</p><p>We examined the ability of the wild type <italic>S</italic>. Typhimurium strain 14028s to form biofilms in the absence of <italic>ssrA</italic> and <italic>ssrB</italic> and found it to be dependent only on the expression of <italic>ssrB</italic>. We further showed that H-NS was a negative regulator of <italic>csgD.</italic> Surprisingly, the SsrB response regulator positively regulated the formation of biofilms by activating <italic>csgD</italic> expression in the absence of any phospho-donors. Moreover, AFM imaging revealed that unphosphorylated SsrB was able to bind to the <italic>csgD</italic> regulatory region and binding was sufficient to relieve H-NS-mediated repression and favor formation of <italic>S</italic>. Typhimurium biofilms.</p><p>As a result of these studies, we propose that SsrB, a pathogenicity island-2-encoded response regulator, sits at a pivotal position in governing <italic>Salmonella</italic> lifestyle fate: to either exist inside the host (in the SCV) as a promoter of virulence; or as a surface-attached multicellular biofilm, maintaining the carrier state. This switch is achieved merely by the ability of unphosphorylated SsrB to function as an anti-repressor of H-NS and the additional role of SsrB~P in activating SPI-2 transcription (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Walthers et al., 2011</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>SsrB supports biofilm formation in the absence of its kinase SsrA</title><p>The SsrA/B TCRS is activated by environmental stimuli such as pH and osmolality, stimulating the expression of virulence genes essential for intra-cellular growth and survival of <italic>Salmonella</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Feng et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">2004</xref>). Thus, it was surprising that SsrA/B and SPI-2 were implicated in the multi-cellular lifestyle of <italic>Salmonella</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hamilton et al., 2009</xref>). Furthermore, the SsrA kinase was required, but SPI-2 genes were down-regulated. At SPI-2, SsrB~P de-represses H-NS and also activates transcription (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Walthers et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">2011</xref>). We therefore wanted to explore this seeming paradox during biofilm regulation.</p><p>In order to quantify the defect in biofilm-forming ability resulting from the absence of <italic>ssrB</italic>, the wild type strain 14028s, an <italic>ssrA</italic> null strain and an <italic>ssrB</italic> null strain were grown in 96-well polystyrene microtiter plates for 2 days. The surface-attached cells in 14028s, <italic>ssrA</italic> and <italic>ssrB</italic> strains were stained by crystal-violet and quantified. As shown in the figure, biofilm levels in the <italic>ssrB</italic> mutant strain decreased by around 60% compared to the wild type or an <italic>ssrA</italic> null strain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>), and it could be complemented by over-expressing SsrBc <italic>in trans.</italic> Thus, we establish a new role for SsrB, but not the SsrA kinase in positively regulating biofilm formation. The <italic>ssrB</italic> strain was not compromised for planktonic growth, as measured by total viable counts of the wild type, <italic>ssrA</italic> and <italic>ssrB</italic> cultures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref> and Supplementary methods).<fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.10747.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Loss of <italic>ssrB</italic> but not <italic>ssrA</italic> decreases <italic>Salmonella</italic> Typhimuirum biofilms.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) The defect in formation of biofilms in the <italic>ssrB</italic> null was complemented by the overexpression of SsrBc from plasmid pKF104 <italic>in trans</italic> as measured by crystal violet staining.

After seven days, each of the 14028s and <italic>ssrA</italic> mutant plates showed the appearance of rough, dry and red macrocolonies. However, the <italic>ssrB</italic> null strain exhibited a smooth, wet and pale brown morphotype which showed a poor ability to exhibit a multicellular phenotype (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). The absence of Congo Red staining in the <italic>ssrB</italic> strain also indicated that there were greatly reduced levels of extracellular curli fibers in the macrocolony. These fibers form one of the key components of the extra-cellular matrix of a <italic>Salmonella</italic> biofilm. To examine the levels of cellulose, the other main component of the extra-cellular matrix, the three strains were grown on Calcofluor plates. The macrocolonies formed by 14028s and <italic>ssrA</italic> appeared white under UV, as cellulose binds the Calcofluor fluorescent dye (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). The dull and non-white macrocolony produced by the <italic>ssrB</italic> null strain was starkly different, indicating again a poor extracellular matrix.</p><p>We visualized the nature of biofilms formed by the wild type and <italic>ssrB</italic> strains by Confocal Fluorescence Imaging of solid-surface biofilms formed under a continuous flow system in a micro-fluidic chamber. Wild type and the <italic>ssrB</italic> null strain were grown in minimal M9 medium and inoculated in their respective flow cells. After allowing the cells to attach for 1h, flow commenced and the growing biofilms were monitored daily for six days. Each day, the flow cell was removed, and the glass-attached cells were stained with SYTO-9 green, a fluorescent dye that stains nucleic acids. The cells were then imaged using fluorescence microscopy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). The figure clearly shows that for the wild type strain, the attached biomass not only increased progressively in size, but also in its complexity of design. This correlated with the appearance of typical mushroom-like constituent microcolonies by around 2 days. Such type of mature biofilms were never observed in the <italic>ssrB</italic> null strain and even after 6 days it failed to form biofilms, as evident by fewer and thinly attached clusters of SYTO-9 green-labeled cells.</p><p>To compare the differences in the structural properties of biofilms formed by the <italic>ssrB</italic> strain with the wild type and the <italic>ssrA</italic> mutant, cells were grown on APTES-coated cover slips in 16-well polystyrene microtiter plates for two days. The surface-attached communities were fixed, dehydrated and dried for Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM). As expected, the wild type and <italic>ssrA</italic> mutant showed the presence of tightly knit communities of cells containing an extensive network of curli fibres surrounding large groups of cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). In contrast, the <italic>ssrB</italic> null strain formed sparsely spaced groups of few cells with a large reduction in the surrounding matrix and poor network properties.</p><p>It was possible that the <italic>ssrB</italic> strain was just slower in biofilm formation and needed more time to exhibit its biofilm capability or that it caused a growth defect. We ruled out this possibility by measuring growth curves (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>) and by monitoring the wild type and <italic>ssrB</italic> strains by crystal-violet staining every 12 hr for around 4 days. This determined that the <italic>ssrB</italic> mutant was not deficient for growth and remained incapable of forming biofilms up to 84 h, while the wild type formed large biofilms by 2 days (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>).</p><p>We next investigated the ability of <italic>Salmonella</italic> to form biofilms, on cholesterol-coated eppendorf tubes. The cholesterol-attached biofilms were estimated by crystal violet staining for the strains 14028s, <italic>ssrA</italic> null and <italic>ssrB</italic> null. There was a drastic reduction in the amount of biofilms formed by the <italic>ssrB</italic> strain on cholesterol-coated eppendorf tubes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>). If cholesterol biofilms are indeed an indicator of an ability to form biofilms on gallstones (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Crawford et al., 2008</xref>), then SsrB may be crucial for establishment of the carrier state in <italic>Salmonella.</italic></p><p>Taken together, our results modify the initial hypothesis that SsrA was involved in the formation of biofilms.

SsrA is a tripartite sensor kinase that is presumably autophosphorylated by ATP at His405, followed by intra-molecular phosphorylation reactions at Asp739 and His867, based on homology to other tripartite kinases. His867 would then participate in the transfer reaction of the phosphoryl group to Asp56 in the N-terminus of SsrB. To confirm that SsrA-dependent phosphorylation was not required for SsrB-mediated regulation of biofilms (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A–G</xref>), we examined biofilm formation of <italic>Salmonella</italic> strains possessing H405Q, D739A and H867Q mutations in <italic>ssrA</italic> (Walthers and Kenney unpublished) and compared them to the wild type, <italic>ssrA</italic> and <italic>ssrB</italic> null mutants.

Therefore, we substituted the conserved Asp56 residue with Ala (D56A), and determined its ability to form biofilms (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). The D56A strain was as competent as the wild type, <italic>ssrA</italic> null and <italic>ssrA</italic> kinase mutants in biofilm formation.

Interestingly, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A(ii)</xref> also indicates that H-NS continued to form straight nucleoprotein complexes in regions devoid of SsrB (yellow line), i.e. H-NS was still bound to some regions of DNA when SsrB was also bound.

Thus, unphosphorylated SsrB can bind to the <italic>csgD</italic> regulatory region when it has been coated with the repressor H-NS.

Understanding how H-NS silences genes and how this silencing is relieved is an active area of research (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Will et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Winardhi et al., 2015</xref>). Because the anti-silencing style of gene regulation is indirect and does not rely on specific DNA interactions, searching for SsrB binding sites has not been informative in uncovering this type of regulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Tomljenovic-Berube et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Worley et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Shea et al., 1996</xref>). Even a recent report in which the proteomes of wild type, <italic>hilA</italic> null (a transcriptional regulator of SPI-1 genes) and <italic>ssrB</italic> null were analyzed by SILAC and compared with an existing CHIP dataset failed to identify <italic>csgD</italic> as an SsrB-regulated locus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Brown et al., 2014</xref>), as sequence gazing alone does not help in identifying mechanisms of transcriptional regulation.</p><p>SsrB is well suited to this style of regulation, because it does not recognize a well-defined binding site (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Feng et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Walthers et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Tomljenovic-Berube et al., 2010</xref>), it has a high non-specific binding component (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Carroll et al., 2009</xref>) and it bends DNA upon binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Carroll et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>, this work). Furthermore, previous microarray studies disrupted both <italic>ssrA</italic> and <italic>ssrB</italic>, which would not uncover a distinct role for SsrB in gene regulation under non SPI-2-inducing conditions in the absence of the SsrA kinase. It is worth mentioning here that in our AFM images, it was apparent that H-NS was still bound to some regions of the <italic>csgD</italic> promoter when SsrB condensed the DNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A(ii)</xref>). Thus, H-NS does not have to be completely stripped off the DNA for de-repression to occur, a finding that was also evident in our previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Liu et al., 2010</xref>) and others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Will et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>SsrB binds and bends DNA, resulting in highly curved DNA conformations. This DNA binding property of SsrB is distinct from H-NS, which forms rigid nucleoprotein filaments and thus straight DNA conformations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A(i)</xref>). Bent DNA is therefore an energetically unfavorable substrate for H-NS binding, and a likely mechanism of SsrB-mediated anti-silencing of H-NS repressed genes. SsrB-dependent displacement of H-NS is more energetically favored to occur predominantly at the ends of H-NS-bound filaments, which requires disruption of fewer H-NS protein-protein interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Winardhi et al., 2015</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>). In an equal mixture of H-NS and SsrB (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A(ii)</xref>), we do not see evidence of sharply bent filaments. This is expected because H-NS dissociation is likely restricted to the filament ends. Such events occur due to the cooperative nature of H-NS binding that results in a chain of linked H-NS proteins. Hence, H-NS displacement by SsrB likely occurs progressively from the filament end. This behavior has been observed in our single-molecule stretching experiments with H-NS filaments in the presence of SsrB. This ability of H-NS to re-orient on the DNA without being released would also promote its re-binding and silencing when SsrB or other anti-silencers are released (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Structural homology does not indicate functional homology</title><p>Response regulators are grouped into subfamilies on the basis of the structures of their DNA binding domains. SsrB is in the NarL/FixJ subfamily, which possess a helix-turn-helix (HTH) motif in the C-terminus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Baikalov et al., 1996</xref>). NarL was the first full-length structure of a response regulator and it showed that the N-terminal phosphorylation domain physically blocked the recognition helix in the HTH motif (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Maris et al., 2002</xref>). Thus, phosphorylation is required to relieve the inhibition of the N-terminus. In the results presented herein, it is apparent that SsrB has adapted to relieving H-NS-silencing and that phosphorylation is not required for this behavior, nor is it required for DNA binding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>).</p><p>In summary, we showed that the response regulator SsrB is required for biofilm formation because it can de-repress H-NS at the <italic>csgD</italic> promoter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>). This leads to the production of CsgD, the master regulator of biofilms. It is noteworthy that a laterally acquired gene product, SsrB, has evolved the job of regulating the levels of <italic>csgD,</italic> a transcriptional regulator encoded by the core genome. For this activity, phosphorylation of SsrB was not required, which is rare amongst response regulators. Furthermore, we identify H-NS as a repressor of <italic>csgD</italic> in <italic>Salmonella</italic>, instead of an activator (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Gerstel et al., 2003</xref>). This unifies the regulation of CsgD by H-NS in <italic>E. coli</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Ogasawara et al., 2010</xref>) and <italic>Salmonella</italic>.

A 5’-biotinylated <italic>csgD</italic> DNA fragment was prepared by amplifying the upstream regulatory region of <italic>csgD</italic> (122bp) using respective primers from the wild type strain 14028s. 5 fmol of this probe was then incubated with 1.08 μM SsrB/K179A SsrB or 15 μM H-NS in a binding buffer containing 10 mM Tris, pH 7.5; 50 mM KCl, 2.5% glycerol; 0.05% Nonidet P-40 and 1 μg poly (dI-dC), for 20 min at RT. In case where competitor DNA was added, a 200-fold excess of an unlablelled <italic>csgD<sub>122</sub></italic> was first incubated with 1.08 μM SsrB for 20 min, followed by the addition of 5 fmol labelled probe to the reaction buffer and subsequent incubation for 20 min. For detecting a supershift, 1.08 μM SsrB and 15 μM H-NS were incubated with 0.5 μl anti-SsrBc serum in the binding buffer for 1 hr at RT. 5 fmol of the probe was then added and incubated for additional 20 min at RT. The reactions were subsequently subjected to electrophoresis, electro-blotting, cross-linking and detection as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Carroll et al., 2009</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-15-4"><title>Measurement of the bending angle (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>).</title><fig id="fig7" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.10747.031</object-id><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><title>DNA tracing and bending angle measurement.</title><p>(<bold><bold>A</bold></bold>) The original AFM image as processed with the Gwyddion software.

Linear interpolation of points scattered along the green and red asterisk was used to plot a straight line between these points (yellow line). The angle between the yellow lines (α) is determined as the bending angle of SsrB; 81 such measurements were made.

This mixture was then deposited on glutaraldehyde-modified mica for 15 min.

A lightly edited version of the letter sent to the authors after peer review is shown, indicating the most substantive concerns; minor comments are not usually included.</p></boxed-text><p>Thank you for submitting your work entitled &quot;To P or not to P a role for unphosphorylated SsrB in activating <italic>csgD (agfD</italic>) to regulate <italic>Salmonella</italic> Typhimurium biofilms&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the evaluation has been overseen by Richard Losick as the Senior Editor.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>This is an interesting paper that describes an unexpected role for a <italic>Salmonella</italic> response regulator in a two-component regulatory system. The authors conclude that the response regulator SsrB has a gene regulatory function in addition to its established role in accepting phosphate from SsrA to activate so-called SPI-2 genes important for virulence. In an SsrA-independent manner SsrB derepresses transcription of <italic>csgD</italic>, which itself serves as a transcription activator of genes required for biofilm formation. In this way SsrB can serve as a decision point between the planktonic and biofilm lifestyles this bacterium has in colonized hosts. The manuscript shows that <italic>csgD</italic> activation involves unphosphorylated SsrB. Evidence is consistent with the idea that HNS binds the <italic>csgD</italic> promoter region and this silences or represses <italic>csgD</italic> expression. Unphosphorylated SsrB derepresses <italic>csgD</italic> not by binding HNS but by binding to the <italic>csgD</italic> promoter itself and occluding some of the HNS binding.</p><p>The reviewers believe that several modifications to the manuscript are needed prior to acceptance:</p><p>The title needs to be changed. The manuscript needs to be condensed. Some specific suggestions are provided in the detailed reviewer comments. There is thought that <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> is not relevant. Reviewer 2 has some specific concerns about <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">4</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">6</xref> that require some attention and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref> requires additional controls. There is some concern about whether the artificial in vitro systems reflect the native situation. Some caution about interpretation is advised.</p><p>Reviewer 3 would like to see additional biofilm data, &quot;It is therefore necessary to somehow quantify the entire population of Salmonellae in the tube and assess what fraction of it adheres. A true biofilm-defective mutant should show a shift from a fraction that adhere to the non-adhering planktonic population.&quot; Finally, Reviewer 3 points out that, &quot;The elegant experiments using AFM need to be supported with certain controls, primarily aimed at demonstrating specificity of binding of SsrB to the <italic>csgD</italic> regulatory region (and lack of binding to other H-NS silenced regions) in both AFM and electrophoretic mobility shift assays.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic> </p><p>This is an interesting paper that describes an unexpected role for a <italic>Salmonella</italic> response regulator in a two-component regulatory system. The paper shows that the response regulator SsrB has a gene regulatory function in addition to its established role in accepting phosphate from SsrA to activate so-called SPI-2 genes important for virulence. In an SsrA-independent manner SsrB derepresses transcription of <italic>csgD</italic>, which itself serves as a transcription activator of genes required for biofilm formation. In this way SsrB serves as the decision point between the planktonic and biofilm lifestyles this bacterium has in colonized hosts. The manuscript shows that <italic>csgD</italic> activation involves unphosphorylated SsrB. It shows that HNS binds the <italic>csgD</italic> promoter region and this silences or represses <italic>csgD</italic> expression. Unphosphorylated SsrB derepresses <italic>csgD</italic> not by binding HNS but by binding to the <italic>csgD</italic> promoter itself and occluding some of the HNS binding. This was shown by AFM of single molecule binding to DNA. The microscopy is well suited for <italic>eLife</italic> publication.</p><p>The work is interesting in a number of aspects. It points to novel ways in which response regulator components of two-component regulatory systems can function. It explains for the case of one of the still rare examples where an unphosphorylated response regulator can function how it does so. It addresses the issue of the important lifestyle &quot;decision&quot; that <italic>Salmonella</italic> makes. It also provides insight about HNS silencing and how anti-silencing can occur. This is a current area of interest with respect to evolution of bacterial pathogens.</p><p>There are several issues with the manuscript that the authors need to address. I present them here in the order in which they arise in the manuscript.</p><p>1) Title. &quot;To P or not to P&quot; conveys little information and might be appropriate for the Insight published along with the article. The rest of the title will make sense only to those working in the field. I would suggest something along the lines of &quot;An unphosphorylated two-component response regulator induces <italic>Salmonella</italic> Typhimurium biofilm genes by antisilencing a biofilm master-regulator gene.&quot;</p><p>2) Key words. I think key words are meant to exclude words already appearing in a title.</p><p>3) Abstract. Delete &quot;Remarkably.&quot; There is an overuse of emphasis words in general in the manuscript. I find this quite distracting. &quot;Highly upregulated&quot;, unequivocally rule out, &quot;Sharp contrast&quot;, etc. These all seem like overstatements to me.</p><p>4) The Introduction is very long. It reads like the introduction to a thesis. I am not sure what might be condensed but it would be helpful to condense if possible.</p><p>5) Introduction, fourth paragraph. Delete &quot;Walthers and Kenny unpublished.&quot; It is not something the reader can refer to as are the publications referenced.</p><p>6) Last two paragraphs of the Introduction. As written it is confusing as to what the authors showed previously and what they are showing in this manuscript.</p><p>7) Subsection “Unphosphorylated SsrB activates biofilm formation”. I think the interpretations should be recast. First we learn that SsrA is not required for the biofilm phenotype. So it could be unphosphorylated B or B could be phosphorylated by an alternate donor. Then we learn that general donors like acetyl-P are not involved. So it could be unphosphorylated or there could be some sort of unknown cross talk with another sensor kinase. Finally we learn that Asp56, the residue phosphorylated by SsrA, can be mutated to an alanine and the protein still functions with respect to biofilm formation (but not SPI2 gene activation). This is good genetic evidence that the protein induces biofilm formation in an unphosphorylated form.</p><p>8) Subsection “Unphosphorylated SsrB activates biofilm formation”. This is an example of a sentence that needs rewriting. &quot;To confirm our hypothesis we examined…&quot;. This is not the scientific method. Experiments are meant to be designed to disprove one’s hypothesis. A simple wording change would provide a fix, for example: &quot;To test our hypothesis…&quot;. This wording problem comes up in a few other places as well.</p><p>9) Subsection “Unphosphorylated SsrB activates biofilm formation”. Change &quot;This is the first evidence&quot; to &quot;This provides evidence that&quot;.</p><p>10) Subsection “SsrB and H-NS differentially regulate <italic>csgD</italic> expression”, third paragraph. I am missing something here. I don't understand why the hypothesis explains why phosphorylation was not required.</p><p>11) Subsection “SsrB binds an H-NS stiffened nucleoprotein filament at <italic>csgD</italic>”. The last sentences seem to describe a model based on the evidence presented rather than a proven mechanism and should be presented in this way. Particularly for the last sentence on RNAP I see no evidence in the manuscript.</p><p>12) Subsection “SsrB sits at a pivotal decision point that determines <italic>Salmonella</italic> lifestyles”, first paragraph and elsewhere. &quot;It can de-repress HN-S at <italic>csgD</italic>&quot; seems like confusing jargon to me. Do the authors mean &quot;it can counter HN-S repression of <italic>csgD</italic>&quot; or &quot;counter HN-S silencing of”?</p><p>13) Subsection “SsrB sits at a pivotal decision point that determines <italic>Salmonella</italic> lifestyles”. Again I did not see any experiments about enabling access of RNAP. This seems logical but it should be presented as a model.</p><p>14) The model is presented as a counterpoint to the idea that periplasmic histidines can play a role (&quot;we think this is unlikely&quot;). I got a little confused here about whether maybe both things could be true. Are they mutually exclusive?</p><p>15)”It is worth mentioning here that in our AFM images, it was apparent that H-NS was still bound to some regions of the <italic>csgD</italic> promoter when SsrB is condensing the DNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>(ii))”. There is a mixture of tenses. I would change &quot;when SsrB is condensing&quot; to &quot;was condensing.&quot;</p><p>16) It seems like the whole first paragraph of the subsection “Structural homology does not indicate functional homology “could be deleted. I am not engaged by the fact that &quot;we were lulled into thinking that SsrB would behave like NarL.&quot; There are examples of transcriptional regulator families where some members require ligand binding to bind DNA and activate genes. They do this in the same way that NarL interacts with P to expose the DNA binding motif. Other members of the same family bind DNA and repress genes in the absence of ligand. The ligand blocks DNA binding.</p><p>The last half of the last paragraph of the Discussion is maybe the fourth or fifth time the authors bring up the fact that their conclusion that HNS represses or silences <italic>csgD</italic> conflicts with the conclusion of Gerstal. Although this may be true, the way it is presented is not constructive. First, I believe this point should not be raised in the Results (as it is now). It is a point of discussion. Second, I don't think, as it stands, it corrects the scientific record. If the authors want to discuss this they should make some attempt to resolve the conflict. Why do they think they arrived at a conclusion opposing that of Gerstel et al.? Are there strain differences? Did Gesrtel misinterpret or over-interpret a result? If the authors want to put any focus on the different conclusions then they should try to help us understand what might be a possibility. It is ok to say something about how at least with our strains and experimental protocols we find HNS silencing of <italic>csgD</italic> whereas Gerstel using a different whatever found HNS activation or whatever it is. It takes a level of brio to just claim ones results are more believable than others.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic> </p><p>In this manuscript the authors build on previous work demonstrating that the SsrAB regulators are important to <italic>Salmonella</italic> typhimurium biofilm formation. They determine that the SsrA histidine kinase is not required, but that the SsrB response regulator is required for biofilm formation as measured using methylene blue staining, Congo Red, and Calcofluor plates. They then analyzed the colonies formed in a microfluidic chamber in M9 medium in a flow cell and in cholesterol coated eppendorf tubes to further substantiate the biofilm phenotype. The authors provide support for the lack of phosphorylation of SsrB being what is necessary for SPI2 regulation of curli genes responsible for biofilms by using SsrB phosphorylation deficient bacteria, with mutations in SsrA and the ability to produce acetyl phosphate. The requirement of SsrB to form biofilms was repressed by deletion of H-NS providing in vivo evidence that SsrB could act by competing or silencing H-NS based repression. The authors then provide evidence that SsrB/HNS bind to the Csg promoter responsible for the synthesis of curli. The results add to our knowledge of <italic>Salmonellae</italic> gene regulation of biofilm formation, but do not really define where and how this may occur in vivo and/or what specific environmental conditions would lead to activation but not phosphorylation of SsrB.</p><p>Specific comments:</p><p>A great deal of data was not shown and this should be corrected prior to publication.</p><p>Throughout the manuscript the authors claim that they showed different results than that shown in Hamilton et al. However in this work the effect of an ssrA mutant on biofilm formation was complemented with a plasmid encoding both ssrA and ssrB. Therefore the results are likely a result of mutation of both genes or polarity. Therefore the results are really similar and the authors have provided molecular detail as to the mechanism.</p><p>Since most of the paper is about mechanisms of transcription that lead to biofilm formation I am not sure what <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> adds to the manuscript.</p><p>In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref> the staining seems the same at 6 days. This is a surprising result, has the biofilm been formed that rapidly by another sensing mechanism?</p><p>In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref> why does the increase at later time points occur and why is it greater at 36 hours than at 47 and 69 hours? How many replicated experiments are represented by the figure and are the statistical analyses significant? This is not commented on in the figure legend.</p><p>The phenotype of the <italic>ssrA</italic> mutant should be shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B-D</xref>.</p><p>The higher migrating signal in the western blot in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref> is said to be non-specific in the figure legend. However, It is not present to a very great degree in the wild type and is greater in the <italic>SseA</italic> and D56A mutant and absent in <italic>ssrB</italic> mutants. What is this band and does it indicate another larger form of CsgD or has a different promoter been utilized when non-phosphorylated SsrB is present? This band should be isolated and protein sequenced to define its nature.</p><p>What is the evidence that the binding angle observed in vitro with an artificial substrate by ATM reflects its ability to promote anti-silencing (subsection “Unphosphorylated SsrB binds to the <italic>csgD</italic> regulatory region”, first paragraph)?</p><p>Again condensation on a silica binding substrate of a regulatory region on an increase of concentration of the protein that binds may or may not be biologically relevant in vivo (subsection “Unphosphorylated SsrB binds to the <italic>csgD</italic> regulatory region”, last paragraph). The authors should reduce this speculation and consider performing the AFM in solution and under helium rather than nitrogen and see if similar results are obtained.</p><p>The fact that HNS alters structure of DNA on a solid support does not reaffirm more than the biological data the mechanism by which HNS represses transcription, it just indicates under these conditions in binds to the DNA (subsection “SsrB binds an H-NS stiffened nucleoprotein filament at <italic>csgD</italic>”, first paragraph).</p><p>I think the data support a model in which SsrB alters the bending of DNA, though it seems this may not be a direct effect in vivo and the authors should soften the statement that they have identified the mechanism by which unphosphorylated SsrB regulates <italic>csgD</italic>.</p><p>I am not sure the authors are correct in their ideas about SsrB function controlling extracellular lifestyle of <italic>Salmonellae</italic> since there are many growth conditions in which ssrAB are not expressed and the bacteria can form biofilms. Hence this may be most important for the expression of a biofilm under certain conditions of SPI2 expression but not SsrA activation as a kinase. This may actually occur inside host cells and recent evidence of cellulose expression in host cells and past work showing curli biosynthesis genes can be regulated by RpoS may suggest that they are expressed inside of host cells and hence the authors results may be most relevant to how curli may be expressed inside of host cells rather than SsrAB being another host switch more like PhoPQ.</p><p>The title contains this “to P or not to P”, which I found confusing and relatively unscientific since it does not represent PO4. This should probably be changed prior to publication.</p><p>In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2</xref>, why is so little shifting seen with SsrB in the absence of HNS? Is the affinity very low? Additional controls should include SsrB without the anti-ssrB antibody that causes the super shift. Is no binding seen without HNS? If the AFM is significant, binding should be seen without HNS present.</p><p>The data would be strengthened by footprinting and defining the specific promotor sequences bound by SsrB and H-NS prior to publication.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic></p><p>The authors present a series of experiments demonstrating a novel role for a two component regulatory system, implicated in the virulence and persistence of <italic>Salmonella enterica</italic>. The main novel aspects of the findings described in the manuscript are: 1) Demonstration that the SsrB response regulator is a molecular switch, reciprocally controlling two sets of traits associated with virulence (the expression of a type III secretion system) and biofilm formation; 2) Defining an active function for an un-phosphorylated response regulator; 3) Elucidation of a novel regulatory mechanism for a response regulator activity (anti-silencing) by DNA bending and 4) Evolutionary implications for acquisition of a regulatory system by horizontal gene transfer, controlling the expression of core, chromosomal genes.</p><p>Overall, this paper contains substantial amount of new results (in quality and in quantity) and represents information with broad interest to those readers who are interested in new molecular mechanisms of gene regulation, strategies of pathogenic organism capable of causing acute and chronic infections and their evolution. This is important work, established a new paradigm for two-component signaling. The only concern is with a few technical points related to certain experiments and a need for a few additional controls.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3 (Minor comments):</italic> </p><p>There are a few minor issue that the authors should address, mainly to make the manuscript more readable and highlighting its strongest points.</p><p>1) There is excessive amount of data on attempts to demonstrate that the absence of SsrB has an effect on biofilm formation. That could be simply reduced to a single figure comparing <italic>ssrB</italic> deletion with point mutants in SsrA and SsrB.</p><p>2) The major biofilm assay used in this work is based on adherence of bacteria to the sides of polystyrene tubes. This method actually measures only adhesion of the bacteria to their biofilm phenotype. A simple growth defect of the <italic>ssrB</italic> mutant would be also reflected as a decrease in adherence and erroneously concluded as a defect in biofilm formation. It is therefore necessary to somehow quantify the entire population of <italic>Salmonellae</italic> in the tube and assess what fraction of it adheres. A true biofilm-defective mutants should show a shift from a fraction that adhere to the non-adhering planktonic population.</p><p>3) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref> is rather un-convincing; the lane containing the D56A mutant indicates some problems with transfer of CsgD from gels to the membrane and it does not correlate with the qRT-PCR data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>). The Western Blot should be either redone or left out.</p><p>4) The main issues with this work relates to the discovery of an anti-silencing mechanism by SsrB induced DNA bending. The elegant experiments using AFM need to be supported with certain controls, primarily aimed at demonstrating specificity of binding of SsrB to the csgD regulatory region (and lack of binding to other H-NS silenced regions) in both AFM and electrophoretic mobility shift assays.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.10747.033</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>[…] The title needs to be changed.

This band should be isolated and protein sequenced to define its nature.</italic> </p><p>We obtained a monoclonal antibody and now the western blot is completely clean and it is clear that csgD is absent in the ssrB null strain (new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>).</p><p><italic>What is the evidence that the binding angle observed in vitro with an artificial substrate by ATM reflects its ability to promote anti-silencing (subsection “Unphosphorylated SsrB binds to the csgD regulatory region”, first paragraph)?</italic> </p><p>In our in vitro experiments, we found that SsrB bends DNA, resulting in highly curved DNA conformations. This DNA binding property is distinct from H-NS, which forms rigid nucleoprotein filaments and thus straight DNA conformations. Bent DNA is therefore an energetically unfavorable substrate for H-NS binding, and a likely mechanism of SsrB-mediated anti-silencing of H-NS repressed genes. In a mixture of 600 nM H-NS and 600 nM SsrB (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>), we do not see evidence of sharply bent filaments. This is expected because H-NS dissociation is likely restricted to the filament ends. Such events occur due to the cooperative nature of H-NS binding that results in a chain of linked H-NS proteins. Hence, H-NS displacement by SsrB likely occurs progressively from the filament end. Indeed, we observed slow progressive H-NS filament dissociation in the presence of SsrB in single-molecule stretching experiments. We refer to Winardhi, Yan and Kenney (2015) for a more detailed discussion on H-NS anti-silencing by SsrB. Sentences to this effect have been added to the Discussion (subsection “The importance of anti-silencing in gene regulation”, last paragraph).</p><p><italic>Again condensation on a silica binding substrate of a regulatory region on an increase of concentration of the protein that binds may or may not be biologically relevant in vivo (subsection “Unphosphorylated SsrB binds to the csgD regulatory region”, last paragraph).

We now cite more of that work in the Discussion (subsection “The importance of anti-silencing in gene regulation”).</p><p><italic>I am not sure the authors are correct in their ideas about SsrB function controlling extracellular lifestyle of Salmonellae since there are many growth conditions in which ssrAB are not expressed and the bacteria can form biofilms. Hence this may be most important for the expression of a biofilm under certain conditions of SPI2 expression but not SsrA activation as a kinase. This may actually occur inside host cells and recent evidence of cellulose expression in host cells and past work showing curli biosynthesis genes can be regulated by RpoS may suggest that they are expressed inside of host cells and hence the authors results may be most relevant to how curli may be expressed inside of host cells rather than SsrAB being another host switch more like PhoPQ.</italic> </p><p>I am not sure what the reviewer is getting at here. Our previous work (Feng et al. 2004) and our current laboratory has examined SsrB and found it to be constitutive under all the conditions we tested (most recently using super-resolution imaging). So, we disagree with the reviewer on this point. We also do not know of any examples of SPI-2 expression without SsrA activation, since every SPI-2 gene that we have tested required SsrB~P for in vitro transcription (Walthers et al., 2007; Walthers et al., 2011).</p><p><italic>The title contains this “to P or not to P”, which I found confusing and relatively unscientific since it does not represent PO4. This should probably be changed prior to publication.</italic> </p><p>Done.</p><p><italic>In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 2</xref>, why is so little shifting seen with SsrB in the absence of HNS? Is the affinity very low? Additional controls should include SsrB without the anti-ssrB antibody that causes the super shift. Is no binding seen without HNS? If the AFM is significant, binding should be seen without HNS present.</italic> </p><p>We now include additional controls in the revised EMSA (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s3">Figure 5—figure supplement 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s3">Figure 6—figure supplement 3</xref>). In the AFM, SsrB binding and bending occurs at 120 nM, which is pretty high affinity for an unphosphorylated protein (e.g. OmpR binds to ompF and ompC with a Kd of 150 nM (Head et al., 1998). We also included a DNA binding mutant K179A (Carroll et al., 2009) and it clearly does not bind, so we demonstrate specificity as well.

The main novel aspects of the findings described in the manuscript are: 1. Demonstration that the SsrB response regulator is a molecular switch, reciprocally controlling two sets of traits associated with virulence (the expression of a type III secretion system) and biofilm formation; (2) Defining an active function for an un-phosphorylated response regulator; (3) Elucidation of a novel regulatory mechanism for a response regulator activity (anti-silencing) by DNA bending and (4) evolutionary implications for acquisition of a regulatory system by horizontal gene transfer, controlling the expression of core, chromosomal genes. Overall, this paper contains substantial amount of new results (in quality and in quantity) and represents information with broad interest to those readers who are interested in new molecular mechanisms of gene regulation, strategies of pathogenic organism capable of causing acute and chronic infections and their evolution. This is important work, established a new paradigm for two-component signaling. The only concern is with a few technical points related to certain experiments and a need for a few additional controls.</italic> </p><p>We are thrilled to read that the reviewer understands the importance of our findings.</p><p>Reviewer #3 (Minor comments):</p><p><italic>There are a few minor issue that the authors should address, mainly to make the manuscript more readable and highlighting its strongest points. 1) There is excessive amount of data on attempts to demonstrate that the absence of SsrB has an effect on biofilm formation. That could be simply reduced to a single figure comparing ssrB deletion with point mutants in SsrA and SsrB.</italic></p><p><italic>2) The major biofilm assay used in this work is based on adherence of bacteria to the sides of polystyrene tubes. This method actually measures only adhesion of the bacteria to their biofilm phenotype. A simple growth defect of the ssrB mutant would be also reflected as a decrease in adherence and erroneously concluded as a defect in biofilm formation. It is therefore necessary to somehow quantify the entire population of Salmonellae in the tube and assess what fraction of it adheres. A true biofilm-defective mutants should show a shift from a fraction that adhere to the non-adhering planktonic population.</italic></p><p>Firstly, we present growth curves that indicate there is no growth defect (presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). Secondly, we assessed the adhering vs. non-adhering cells in each population (Mackenzie et al., 2015) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">3</xref>) and found that the adherent fraction was lower in the <italic>ssrB</italic> strain compared to the wild type, <italic>ssrA</italic> and D56A strains but, there were greater number of cells in the non-adherent sub-population for the <italic>ssrB</italic> mutant.</p><p><italic>3) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref> is rather un-convincing; the lane containing the D56A mutant indicates some problems with transfer of CsgD from gels to the membrane and it does not correlate with the qRT-PCR data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>). The Western Blot should be either redone or left out.</italic> </p><p>As mentioned above, we re-did the western blot with a monoclonal antibody and we now present it (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>).</p><p><italic>4) The main issues with this work relates to the discovery of an anti-silencing mechanism by SsrB induced DNA bending. The elegant experiments using AFM need to be supported with certain controls, primarily aimed at demonstrating specificity of binding of SsrB to the csgD regulatory region (and lack of binding to other H-NS silenced regions) in both AFM and electrophoretic mobility shift assays.</italic> </p><p>As mentioned above in response to Reviewer #2, these controls are now included for both AFM and EMSA. The K179A mutant clearly does not bind to DNA, demonstrating specificity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s3">Figure 5—figure supplement 3</xref>).</p><p>References cited:</p><p>1) Russo, F.
