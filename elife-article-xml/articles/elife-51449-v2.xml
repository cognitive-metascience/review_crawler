abundant nuclear protein highly enriched in neurons. Here we report live-cell single-molecule imaging studies of the kinetic features of mouse MeCP2 at high spatial-temporal resolution. MeCP2 displays dynamic features that are distinct from both highly mobile transcription factors and immobile histones. Stable binding of MeCP2 in living neurons requires its methyl-binding domain and is sensitive to DNA modification levels. Diffusion of unbound MeCP2 is strongly constrained by weak, transient interactions mediated primarily by its AT-hook domains, and varies with the level of chromatin compaction and cell type. These findings extend previous studies of the role of the MeCP2 MBD in high affinity DNA binding to living neurons, and identify a new role for its AT-hooks domains as critical determinants of its kinetic behavior. They suggest that limited nuclear diffusion of MeCP2 in live neurons contributes to its local impact on chromatin structure and gene expression.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>single molecule tracking</kwd><kwd>MeCP2</kwd><kwd>nuclear diffusion</kwd><kwd>live imaging of neurons</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000011</institution-id><institution>Howard Hughes Medical Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Liu</surname><given-names>Zhe</given-names></name><name><surname>Heintz</surname><given-names>Nathaniel</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000054</institution-id><institution>National Cancer Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R35 CA210043</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Rao</surname><given-names>Anjana</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100003043</institution-id><institution>EMBO</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Long-term Fellowship</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Piccolo</surname><given-names>Francesco M</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Single molecular imaging of MeCP2 at high spatial/temporal resolution identifies distinct structural domains contributing to its dynamic behaviors and chromatin interactions in live neurons.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Methyl-CpG-binding-protein 2 (MeCP2) is an abundant nuclear protein that was initially identified as the founding member of the methyl-DNA binding proteins family (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Lewis et al., 1992</xref>). Mutations in the X-linked <italic>Mecp2</italic> gene cause Rett syndrome, a severe neurological disorder characterized by developmental regression during the first few years of life (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Amir et al., 1999</xref>). Although MeCP2 is expressed by all cell types, it is present at very high levels in neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Skene et al., 2010</xref>). Loss of MeCP2 is not lethal to these cells but results in alterations in gene expression and reduced cellular growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Armstrong et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chahrour et al., 2008</xref>). Although the consequences of MeCP2 loss are well documented, the mechanisms by which MeCP2 functions may include both the recruitment of specific epigenetic regulatory factors to select sites in the genome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chahrour et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Jones et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Kokura et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Kruusvee et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Lyst et al., 2013</xref>) and a more general role as an organizer of chromatin topology in broad nuclear regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Baker et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Della Ragione et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Linhoff et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Lyst and Bird, 2015</xref>). Given the abundance of MeCP2 and its important role in the regulation of chromatin structure and gene expression, further investigation of its chromatin interactions in neurons is of interest.</p><p>Genome-wide mapping studies of MeCP2 have shown that it is enriched in highly methylated regions, although it can be found also in regions where levels of DNA methylation are low (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Baubec et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">MellÃ©n et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Skene et al., 2010</xref>). Oddly, despite its high expression in neurons, MeCP2 is not sufficiently abundant to bind simultaneously to all methylated sites in the neuronal genome. Hence, the mouse genome containsÂ ~2Ã10<sup>9</sup> cytosines in the mouse genome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">NHGRI, 2002</xref>) and 5â6% of cytokines are methylated in most cells of the adult body (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Globisch et al., 2010</xref>) including granule cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6âfigure supplement 2B</xref>), which means that there areÂ ~10<sup>8</sup> 5 mC in each nucleus, while there are not more than 2 Ã 10<sup>7</sup> MeCP2 molecules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Skene et al., 2010</xref>). This suggests that the global distribution of MeCP2 observed in ChIP studies might result from summation of MeCP2-chromatin interactions that are rather sparse with respect to DNA methylation and quite dynamic. This is consistent with previous imaging studies that have employed fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP) to document the mobility of MeCP2 in the nucleus of culture cell lines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Agarwal et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Ghosh et al., 2010a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kumar et al., 2008</xref>). While these indirect measurements of average MeCP2 behavior over large regions of the nucleus indicate that MeCP2 is mobile, they provide little insight into the mechanisms governing MeCP2 target site selection.</p><p>Recent single molecule imaging studies of transcription factors in living cells have yielded surprising insights into their dynamic behavior in the nucleus and revealed unanticipated features of their target search strategies that ought to be considered in models of eukaryotic gene regulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chen et al., 2014b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Chong et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Liu and Tjian, 2018</xref>). To gain additional insights into the dynamic behavior of MeCP2 and its interactions with neuronal chromatin, we have applied this approach to the analysis of MeCP2 in the nucleus of living neurons. Measurements of the behavior of single MeCP2 molecules in the nucleus of cerebellar granule cells relative to other well-studied nuclear proteins revealed that the binding and diffusion of MeCP2 in neurons is similar to H1 linker histones, and distinct from both core histones and site-specific transcription factors. Specifically, extensive mutagenesis experiments demonstrate that MeCP2 behavior in the nucleus can be functionally attributed to a stably bound state with short life times (~7 s) and an unbound state with MeCP2 diffusing much slower than site-specific TFs. Interestingly, we found that the fraction of stably bound state is exquisitely sensitive to the level of DNA modification, and is altered by Rett Syndrome mutations that impact the methyl-CpG binding domain (MBD). In contrast, independent interactions governed by the three AT hook domains at the C-terminus of MeCP2 played a dominant role in regulating the diffusion of unbound MeCP2 with relatively minor contributions from MBD. Furthermore, MeCP2 mobility in the nucleus is sensitive to the local chromatin environment in granule cells, and is dramatically accelerated in the large, euchromatic nuclei of Purkinje cells. Together, our results provide a physical model to explain how distinct types of molecular interactions regulate dynamic MeCP2 binding and diffusion in the nucleus that likely impact its function.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>MeCP2 nuclear dynamics at single molecule resolution in cerebellar neurons reveals its unique slow diffusive behavior</title><p>To study MeCP2 at single molecule resolution in live neurons, we transfected mouse cerebellar granule cells with a construct expressing MeCP2-HaloTag fusion protein and cultured them for 12â14 days to generate a monolayer of neuronal cells that is ideal for image acquisition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>).

To determine the residence time of the stably bound proteins, we acquired images from sparsely labeled nuclei at low excitation power and high acquisition time (500 ms/frame). As a result, while mobile particles are blurred into the background, immobile single molecules are selectively recorded as individual bright spots that can be followed for several frames until they dissociate from their binding sites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1</xref>). In agreement with previous studies of nuclear factors interacting with chromatin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chen et al., 2014b</xref>), the dissociation kinetics of MeCP2 is best described by a double exponential decay that accounts for short-lived and long-lived populations of bound molecules (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1B</xref>). This dwelling time analysis demonstrates that approximatelyÂ ~25% of immobile MeCP2 molecules are long-lived, with residence times ofÂ ~7 s. This is shorter than the residence times of Sox2 or TBP (~10 and~14 s, respectively) or the linker histone H1.0 (~10 s). The majority of MeCP2 binding interactions are shorter lived (~2 s), as is the case with the other factors analyzed. These data demonstrate that MeCP2 engages in two different stable binding interactions with its cognate DNA sites.</p><p>To analyze the dynamic behavior of transiently bound or rapidy diffusing MeCP2 molecules, images from sparsely labeled living granule cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>) were acquired at very high speed (100 Hz) to generate 2D single molecule tracks of the movements of single tagged proteins in the nucleus. It is evident from these single molecule trajectories (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>) that the dynamics of MeCP2 in granule cell nuclei is quite distinct from stably bound histones (H2b) or sequence specific transcription factors (Sox2 and TBP). Rather, even at this superficial level of inspection, the behavior of MeCP2 and the linker histone H1.0 appear similar. This impression is confirmed by calculation of the distribution of diffusion coefficients calculated for each of these nuclear proteins, revealing their similarity to one another relative to Sox2, TBP, histone H2B, or the NLS control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>).</p><p>To better evaluate the distinctive diffusive properties of MeCP2 molecules, we used the algorithm package Spot-On (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hansen et al., 2018</xref>). At this high rate of image acquisition, the long and short-lived stably bound proteins revealed in the residence time measurements cannot be distinguished from one another, and both are included in the bound fraction because their diffusion constants are very slow.</p><p>Spot-On derives the fraction of stably bound molecules, those that diffuseÂ &lt;0.08 Î¼m<sup>2</sup>/s, and also calculates the diffusion coefficient of those that are unbound and rapidly moving (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>). As expected given their stable incorporation into nucleosomes, the vast majority of H2b molecules (&gt;80%) are immobile, while most of the NLS molecules (80â90%) are very rapidly diffusing (~4 Î¼m<sup>2</sup>/s). As previously shown, a minority of Sox2 and TBP molecules are stably bound. Diffusion of unbound Sox2 and TBP proteins is relatively rapid and similar to that previously reported in ES cells, averagingÂ ~2 and 1.5 Î¼m<sup>2</sup>/s per cell respectively, (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chen et al., 2014b</xref>). These data confirm the general rule for sequence-specific transcription factors that less than half of the population is stably bound to DNA, and the rest moves rapidly âsearchingâ chromatin to find cognate binding sites. Two features distinguish the dynamic behavior of MeCP2 from transcription factors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>). First, the fraction of MeCP2 molecules bound in a stable mode is significantly higher than that of Sox2 or TBP. Thus, approximately half of the MeCP2 population is stably bound in granule cell nuclei at any given time. Second, when not bound stably, MeCP2 diffuses significantly more slowly (averagingÂ ~1 Î¼m<sup>2</sup>/s per cell) than Sox2, TBP or the NLS proteins. Interestingly, the dynamic behavior of MeCP2 is strikingly similar to the linker histone H1.0, whereÂ ~Â 50% of molecules are immobile and unbound molecules diffuse slowly inside the nucleus (~1 Î¼m<sup>2</sup>/s per cell) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>MeCP2 nuclear dynamics doÂ notÂ depend on its expression level</title><p>MeCP2 gene dosage is critical for normal neuronal function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Collins et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Ramocki et al., 2009</xref>).

This confirms that the MBD is sufficient for stable DNA binding in vivo, and indicates that additional IDDs are involved in weak interactions that limit MeCP2 nuclear diffusion but do not contribute significantly to stable binding. Introduction of the inactivating R106W mutation into the MBD of this minimal construct reduces stable binding to background levels, and increases further the diffusion of unbound molecules (~2 Î¼m2/s). When taken together with the effects of the R106W and R133C MBD mutations on full length MeCP2, these data demonstrate that the MBD is necessary and sufficient for stable DNA binding in granule cells, that it partially constrains diffusion of unbound MeCP2, and that additional domains of the protein must also contribute to the diffusive properties of MeCP2.</p><p>To identify additional domains of MeCP2 that determine its slow diffusion in living granule cell nuclei, we progressively added individual IDDs back to the minimal R106W protein and measured their effects on MeCP2 nuclear diffusion. The addition of the N-terminal domain (+N-term) does not change the dynamic behavior of the protein. Inclusion of the ID domain (+ID), which contains an AT-hook domain, significantly reduces diffusion of unbound molecules. The incorporation of a five amino acid sequence (RGRKP) at residue 268 reconstitutes a second AT-hook domain (+AT-Hook2) but does not affect MeCP2 diffusion rate. However, if AT-hook2 is assayed independently by in-frame fusion to the rapidly diffusing NLS-HaloTag molecules, it is capable of slowing diffusion in granule cell nuclei. (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4âfigure supplement 1A,B and C</xref>). The inclusion of the NID domain further constrains MeCP2 nuclear mobility to a diffusion rate comparable to full length R106W proteins (~1.4 Î¼m<sup>2</sup>/s). Restoration of the full-length protein with the addition C-terminal domain, including a third AT-hook, does not affect MeCP2 diffusion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>). Finally, since there is a great deal of evidence that MeCP2 AT-hook domains play a significant role in its function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Baker et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Sheikh et al., 2018</xref>), we tested whether these alone were sufficient to determine the slow diffusion rate of unbound MeCP2. Surprisingly, the full length R106W protein lacking all three AT-hooks displays identical dynamic behavior to the minimal R106W protein that solely contains a non-functional MBD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C and D</xref>).Â Taken together, these results demonstrate that the IDDs of MeCP2 are not required for stable DNA binding in the nucleus of granule cell neurons. Rather, we find that they engage in weak, transient interactions with genomic DNA or chromatin. In particular, our data highlight the MeCP2 AT-hook domains as important players in the constraint of MeCP2 diffusion in the nucleus.</p></sec><sec id="s2-6"><title>MeCP2 nuclear dynamics are sensitive to the level of chromatin compaction</title><p>The structure function studies we have presented demonstrate that the dynamic behavior of MeCP2 in the nuclei of living granule cells resembles the linker histone H1.0, that it is sensitive to DNA modifications, and that it depends on both its MBD and the IDDs. The MBD is sufficient for stable binding of MeCP2 in the nucleus, and independently contributes to its slow diffusion when unbound. By contrast, the AT-hook domains of MeCP2 provide major constraints to the mobility of unbound MeCP2 in granule cells, without generating significant stable binding. Since these domains are known to mediate non-specific interactions that occur in the minor groove of AT-rich DNA independently from DNA methylation, and MBD engages in specific binding to methylated cytosines, the behavior of MeCP2 is most likely the result of a combination of specific and non-specific interactions. Given the increased DNA concentration and the enrichment of methylated DNA in highly compact heterochromatin, we next tested the diffusive properties of MeCP2 in euchromatic and heterochromatic domains of the granule cell nucleus.</p><p>To identify compact chromatin domains in living nuclei, we transfected a fusion of heterochromatin protein one alphaÂ (HP1Î±) in frame with the Blue Fluorescent Protein (HP1Î±-BFP) in MeCP2-HaloTag granule cells.

Although the fraction of stably bound MeCP2 is slightly higher in the acute slices prepared from adult mice compared to cultured granule cells, the slow diffusion of unbound MeCP2 is indistinguishable in the two conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6âfigure supplement 1</xref>). The dynamic behavior of MeCP2 in the large, euchromatic nuclei of Purkinje cells is very different. As is evident from the distinct appearance of single molecule tracks in Purkinje cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>), the cumulative distribution of the diffusion coefficients for individual molecules in Purkinje cells demonstrates that MeCP2 is significantly more mobile in the large, euchromatic Purkinje cell nuclei (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>). Furthermore, while the fraction of stably bound MeCP2 molecules is similar between these cell types (70 vs. 60%), unbound MeCP2 diffuses considerably faster (~2X) in PC than it does in GC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>). Finally, the dwell time analysis shows a higher fraction of long-lived immobile molecules in GC compared to PC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6âfigure supplement 1B</xref>). These data demonstrate that nuclear architecture and chromatin compaction play major roles in the dynamic behavior of MeCP2, and suggestÂ that differences in these properties between cell types may influence MeCP2 function in asÂ yet unexplored ways.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Recent single molecule imaging studies have provided important insights into transcription factor activity that complement those obtained from biochemical, genomic and ensemble imaging studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chen et al., 2014b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Liu and Tjian, 2018</xref>). Here we have adopted this approach to measure the dynamic behavior of the fundamentally important neuronal methyl-CpG binding protein (MeCP2) in live neurons. The data we have collected both confirm previous studies of the structure and function of MeCP2, and reveal interesting new features that are important to consider in models of its roles in neuronal nuclei.</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>The dynamic behavior of MeCP2 in granule cells resembles histone H1.0 but is highly sensitive to the level of DNA methylation</title><p>Previous studies using FRAP have reported that in cultured cell lines the overall mobility of MeCP2 and histone H1.0 are similar (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Ghosh et al., 2010a</xref>). Our measurements from single molecule imaging experiments of both endogenous and exogenously expressed MeCP2 in primary cultures of cerebellar granule neurons, as well as in acute slice preparations from adult mouse cerebellum, confirm and extend these observations. The analysis of individual nuclear trajectories demonstrates that both H1.0 and MeCP2 are less stable than the core histone H2b, but are not as mobile as sequence specific transcription factors Sox2 and TBP. Although similarly to Sox2 and TBP only a fraction of MeCP2 and H1.0 is immobile in neuronal nuclei, the rates of diffusion of the unbound molecules are much slower than these transcription factors, indicating that MeCP2 and H1.0 are somehow more productively and continuously engaging in interactions with chromatin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). Despite the similar, constrained diffusion of MeCP2 and histone H1.0, a larger fraction of MeCP2 is engaged in long-term stable binding events than H1.0, although itsÂ residence time when stably bound is significantly shorter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6âfigure supplement 1</xref>).</p><p>In contrast to linker histones, MeCP2 binding is strongly regulated by DNA methylation. While it can interact non-specifically with DNA with low affinity, MeCP2 high affinity interactions depend on the presence of 5mC sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Baubec et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Meehan et al., 1992</xref>), which are masked by conversion to 5hmC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">MellÃ©n et al., 2017</xref>). ChIP assays from fixed neuronal tissue and native genome wide mapping studies have shown that MeCP2 genome occupancy in neurons is cell type specific and correlated with the status of cytosine modification (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">MellÃ©n et al., 2017</xref>). The live cell imaging data we present here confirm these results, and reveal that the behavior of single MeCP2 molecules in neuronal nuclei respond quantitatively to alterations in DNA modification. Thus, without affecting the diffusion of unbound molecules, the balance of Dnmt3a and Tet activities tightly modulates the amount of available high affinity binding sites and dictates the magnitude of stably bound MeCP2 molecules in each cell (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>).</p><p>The fact that the fraction of MeCP2 bound stably in live neurons is very sensitive to alterations in high affinity 5mC binding sites, despite their large excess (~10X) in the genome relative to the number of MeCP2 molecules, indicates that MeCP2 dynamic behavior is determined by the probability of encountering these targets relative to low affinity sites rather than by the absolute levels of DNA methylation. This suggests that epigenetic modifications accumulating on the DNA of postmitotic neurons determine the local enrichment, and presumably function, of MeCP2 in neuronal nuclei.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Different aspects of MeCP2 dynamic behavior are governed by distinct protein domains</title><p>Several functional domains have been identified previously in MeCP2 and shown to play important roles in vivo and in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Baker et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Ghosh et al., 2010b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Heckman et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Tillotson et al., 2017</xref>). Here we have examined the contributions of these domains to the dynamic behavior of single MeCP2 molecules in live granule cell nuclei, revealing several interesting features of MeCP2 that have not been reported previously.</p><sec id="s3-2-1"><title>The MeCP2 Methyl-CpG Binding Domain</title><p>Several mutations that cause Rett Syndrome disrupt high affinity binding of MeCP2 to DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Ballestar et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Yusufzai and Wolffe, 2000</xref>). The R106W mutation, which has been reported previously to eliminate high affinity binding of MBD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Ballestar et al., 2000</xref>) and to result in a very severe clinical outcome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Cuddapah et al., 2014</xref>), dramatically decreases the binding of MeCP2 in live neurons whether in the context of the intact protein or a minimal MBD isoform (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figures 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">4</xref>). Interestingly, this single point mutation also increases the diffusion of unbound MeCP2, indicating that the MBD also constrains movement of MeCP2 in the nucleoplasm. Mutation R133C causes a mild form of Rett Syndrome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Cuddapah et al., 2014</xref>), and has a rather attenuated phenotype when knocked in to the mouse genome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Brown et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">MellÃ©n et al., 2012</xref>). In our single molecule studies in live neurons, this mutation has no discernable effect on the fraction of MeCP2 bound stably to DNA. Rather, R133C alters the rate of diffusion of MeCP2 when not stably bound in vivo. This agrees with prior studies indicating that R133C does not disrupt high affinity binding to methylated DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">MellÃ©n et al., 2012</xref>;Â <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Brown et al., 2016</xref>), and provides additional support for a role of the MBD in constraining the movement of unbound MeCP2 suggesting that alterations in the dynamic behavior of MeCP2 when not stably bound to DNA may also have important functional consequences in its mode of diffusion.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2-2"><title>The MeCP2 Intrinsically Disordered Domains</title><p>Numerous studies have shown that MeCP2 requires both an intact MBD and its C-terminal intrinsically disordered domains (IDDs) to execute its function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Lyst and Bird, 2015</xref>). Here we show that MeCP2 lacking IDDs maintains its DNA binding properties, but diffuses faster, indicating that the MBD is sufficient to bind high affinity target sites while IDDs likely engage in low affinity interactions, possibly with DNA as well as other proteins in the nucleus. To assess which of these additional domains of MeCP2 are important for determining its dynamic properties in granule cell nuclei, we have assayed their independent contributions in the context of the R106W MBD mutation that eliminates stable DNA binding. The inclusions of the Intervening Domain (ID) and the NCoR/SMRT Interaction (NID) are sufficient to restore the slow rate of diffusion of the full-length protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>), corroborating previous studies showing that ID binds non-specifically to DNA at low affinity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Claveria-Gimeno et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Ghosh et al., 2010b</xref>) and that the NID domain is an important hub for the recruitment of epigenetic factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Lyst et al., 2013</xref>) or directly interacts with AT-rich DNA trough its basic cluster (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Heckman et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Mushtaq et al., 2018</xref>). This is also in agreement with previous reports showing by FRAP that ID and NID (TRD) contribute to MeCP2 slow dynamic behavior in culture cell lines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kumar et al., 2008</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3-2-3"><title>The MeCP2 AT-Hook Domains</title><p>In the C-terminal portion of its amino acid sequence, MeCP2 contains three small AT-hook DNA binding domains within and surrounding the ID and NID (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). Earlier investigations of these domains have demonstrated that they are involved with MeCP2 function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Baker et al., 2013</xref>) and, similar to other AT-hook domains, interact preferentially with AT rich DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Reeves and Nissen, 1990</xref>). Here we have shown that these low affinity interactions alone can determine the slow diffusion of MeCP2 in granule cells. Thus, lack of AT-hooks eliminates ID and NID contributions to MeCP2 dynamic behavior, indicating that ID requires AT-hook one to bind DNA and that NID requires at least two AT-hook domains to assemble protein complexes independently from MBD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). This demonstrates that the AT-hook domains are critically important determinants influencing the dynamic behavior of MeCP2 in living neurons, and they strongly support the hypothesis that they play an important role in MeCP2 function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Baker et al., 2013</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>MeCP2 dynamic behavior is sensitive to local chromatin structure</title><p>The dynamic behavior of MeCP2 in granule cell nuclei results from both high affinity specific interactions with methylated DNA and non-specific low affinity interactions with chromatin. The probability of encountering these targets in the nucleoplasm determines MeCP2 behavior, and maximizes transient local interactions as MeCP2 samples DNA for its high affinity binding sites. Granule cell nuclei are among the most compact in the nervous system. Active regions of the granule cell genome are euchromatic, and they are interspersed with large regions of highly compact, inactive heterochromatin. Surprisingly, MeCP2 binding and mobility in euchromatin and heterochromatin is very similar. Although the average diffusion coefficient of MeCP2 molecules is lower in heterochromatin than in euchromatin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C and D</xref>), there is little apparent impact on the fraction of stably bound MeCP2 or residence times in these different chromatin domains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E and F</xref>).</p><p>In light of the very subtle differences we have observed in MeCP2 dynamics in granule cell heterochromatin and euchromatin, we were surprised at the dramatic differences in MeCP2 dynamic behavior we observed in the large, euchromatic nuclei of Purkinje cells. While the decrease in the fraction of bound MeCP2 in Purkinje cells can be explained by the decrease in methylation and increase in hydroxymethylation of Purkinje cell DNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6âfigure supplement 1</xref>), the rapid diffusion of unbound MeCP2 in live Purkinje cell nuclei resembles that of conventional sequence specific transcription factors shown here and in other studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chen et al., 2014b</xref>) rather than the H1.0-like slow diffusion evident in granule cells.</p><p>Although the functional consequences of these differences in the dynamic behavior of MeCP2 in neurons with different nuclear architectures remain to be investigated, our data suggest that the consequences of specific MeCP2 mutations may vary substantially between cell types (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kron et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Sugino et al., 2014</xref>). For example, in the compact small nuclei typical of granule cells, interneurons and glia, the functions of the IDD may be dominated by its three AT-hook domains. These impart its linker histone like diffusive properties, and they may reflect dynamic roles in chromatin organization that are quite distinct from those conveyed by its stable binding to high affinity sites. In the large nuclei typical of Purkinje cells, long-range projection neurons and motor neurons, MeCP2 diffusion resembles conventional transcription factors. One might speculate that the dominant role of the IDD in these environs is to assemble protein complexes through its NID domain when stably bound to DNA. In this scenario, the relative contributions of the IDD subdomains can vary dependent on cell type, local chromatin structure, and the epigenetic microenvironment, and the phenotypic consequences of specific mutations to MeCP2 would reflect the interplay between these factors and gene expression in each specialized cell type.</p></sec><sec id="s3-4"><title>Concluding remarks</title><p>Single molecule imaging studies of transcription factors in living nuclei have uncovered critical new features of their function that could not have been predicted based on biochemical or genomic approaches (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chen et al., 2014b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Chong et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hansen et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Liu and Tjian, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Loffreda et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Teves et al., 2016</xref>). Here we have presented a series of experiments that investigate in detail the molecular mechanisms that govern the dynamic behavior of MeCP2 in live neurons. Our results illustrate the complexity of MeCP2-chromatin interactions, which are sensitive to the level and state of cytosine methylation, depend on multiple protein domains, and differ depending on cell specific nuclear architecture. Although the dynamic behavior of MeCP2 resembles the linker histone H1.0, the specific features we have documented here allow MeCP2 function to be modulated locally as a result of changes in DNA methylation status and nuclear architecture. Given the variations evident in these determinants between cell type and in response to specific cues in a given neuronal lineage, our data support a dynamic role for MeCP2 in regulation of local chromatin structure.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Primary granule cell culture</title><p>Cerebella of P6-P8 mice were dissected in cold CMF-PBS buffer (0.13M NaCl, 4 mM KCl, 11 mM Glucose, 3.6 mM NaH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>â¢H<sub>2</sub>O, 1.8 mM KH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>, 2.00 ml of 2% solution of NaHCO<sub>3</sub>, 0.5 ml of 0.5% solution of phenol red, pH 7.35, 1L of H<sub>2</sub>O), incubated in 37Â°C Trypsin-DNase (1 g/L DNase -Worthington Biochemical-, 10 g/L Trypsin -Worthington Biochemical-, 6 mM NaOH in CMF-PBS) for 5 min and triturated 10x in 1 ml RT DNase buffer (0.5 g/L DNase, 0.35% Glucose, in BME âGIBCO-) to obtain single cell suspension.

In each condition, genomic DNA was extracted from granule cell nuclei isolated from adult male mice cerebella. At least 1 Î¼g of DNA per sample was sonicated using Covaris-S2 system, DNA fragments ofÂ ~200 bp were end-repaired using TruSeq DNA Sample kit as per manufacturerâs instructions. 4 ng of TrueMethyl sequencing spike-in controls were added to the DNA sample prior to adapter ligation. After TruSeq DNA adapters ligation, libraries were re-purified to eliminate potential contaminating compounds using 80% Acetonitrile and TrueMethyl-Seq magnetic beads. Following bisulfite conversion, desulfonation and purification, library amplifications were performed by PCR using TruSeq DNA primers and TrueMethyl-Seq reagents. Quality of libraries was assessed using High Sensitivity D1000 ScreenTape for the 2200 TapeStation system. Libraries were sequenced through HiSeq 2000.

After repeated wash, the brain slices were adhered to the surface of 5 mm coverslips (Warner Instruments) and placed into the imaging chamber. The sample stage was moved to find representative Granule and Purkinje cells within the slice. Single-molecule imaging was then performed by exciting a single plane with a 560 nm laser atÂ ~1333 W/cm<sup>2</sup> at the rear aperture of the excitation objective, using Bessel beams arranged in a square lattice configuration in dithered mode. The fluorescence generated within the specimen was collected by a detection objective (CFI Apo LWD 25XW, 1.1 NA, Nikon), filtered through a 440/521/607/700 nm BrightLine quad-band bandpass filter (Semrock), and eventually recorded by an ORCA-Flash 4.0 sCMOS camera (Hamamatsu).

responses.</p></boxed-text><p><bold>Acceptance summary:</bold></p><p>The manuscript of Piccolo et al. studies the dynamics of Methyl-CpG-binding-protein in live neurons. Single-particle tracking of MeCP2 shows a mobile and immobile population, where the mobile population diffuses slower than gene specific transcription factors. The authors characterize in detail the contribution of DNA binding domain, the intrinsically disordered domain, and the AT-hook domain in the diffusion and DNA binding of MeCP2. In addition, the results show that the slow diffusion depends on non-specific chromatin interactions, and appear to be cell-type specific.</p><p>The presented experiments are well-performed and the results are convincing. The work shows new features of the complex behavior of MeCP2 and the authors present data to show how DNA methylation, chromatin compaction and specific protein sub-domains influence specific aspects of this behavior.</p><p><bold>Decision letter after peer review:</bold></p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;MeCP2 nuclear dynamics in live neurons results from low and high affinity chromatin interactions&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, including Job Dekker as the Reviewing Editor and Reviewer #1, and the evaluation has been overseen by Huda Zoghbi as the Senior Editor.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) This is critical point: SpotOn is a key tool that the authors use to evaluate and interpret their data. As far as I understand SpotOn assumes only one bound and one unbound state. Are the assumptions of SpotOn correct for a DNA binding factor with more than one binding state, as seems the case for MeCP2?</p><p>2) Possibly related to the previous point: MeCP2 shows very different diffusion behavior from other factors such as histones or Sox2. This also makes it more challenging to determine the individual bound and non-bound populations. For Sox2, the diffusion plot shows a bimodal population, but the MeCP2, the distribution is much broader and almost unimodal. In the mutants the distributions shifts, but it does not appear that the two populations are really separate. The bound fraction, and diffusion of bound molecules is then calculated as if these are really different populations. Could it be that this is just a single population, with binding sites of different affinity resulting in a broader distribution? Do the authors have any additional evidence to assume two different populations for MeCP2?</p><p>3) The authors state: &quot;The rate of diffusion of the unbound R133C protein is measurably increased&quot;. Figure 3D does not show that this effect of 133C on diffusion rate is statistically significant. Is it significant or not? If not then the authors cannot make this statement.</p><p>4) Figure 5D: The number of observations in heterochromatin is much larger. When down-sampled to the same level as observed in the euchromatic domains, is the difference still significant?</p><p>5) Is diffusion of MeCP2 in Purkinje cells still limited by the AT-hook domains? If not, then other interpretations for the altered mobility than altered chromatin compaction could explain the results.</p><p>6) Since transfection efficiency can change between experiments, and between cells, it would be nice if the authors could show that the concentration of transfected MeCP2 is similar to the endogenous level. If no antibody is available to perform Western blots, the authors could perform FCS on the HaloTagged cells to determine the concentration in endogenously-tagged and transfected cells. This is especially important for all the mutated constructs where the mutations and truncations could affect protein level or stability, and lower concentration may affect the fraction bound.</p><p>7) It somewhat disappointing that the difference in nuclear dynamics of MeCP2 in granule versus Purkinje cell was not examined in more detailed. For example, how similar are the affects of the Rett mutations on MeCP2 nuclear dynamics in these two types neurons?</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.51449.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) This is critical point: SpotOn is a key tool that the authors use to evaluate and interpret their data. As far as I understand SpotOn assumes only one bound and one unbound state. Are the assumptions of SpotOn correct for a DNA binding factor with more than one binding state, as seems the case for MeCP2?</p></disp-quote><p>We have now rewritten the first section of the Results to clarify this issue. In brief, there are two different types of imaging experiments that are used to reveal the dynamic properties of each protein included in the study.</p><p>The first is to acquire images at low excitation and long acquisition times (~2Hz) to assess the residence times of stably bound molecules (Figure 1âfigure supplement 1). The dwelling times in our study match those previously determined for Sox2, TBP and histone H2B in ES cells. In agreement with those studies, the dissociation kinetics of MeCP2 is best described by a double exponential decay that accounts for short-lived and long-lived populations of bound molecules (Figure 1âfigure supplement 1B) for all proteins studied, including MeCP2 and histone H1.0. Furthermore, the short-lived bound molecules of MeCP2 have dwell times of ~ 2 seconds, similar to the sequence specific transcription factors Sox2 and TBP, and histone H1.0.</p><p>The second technique is to track individual molecules at high speed (100Hz) to reveal rapid diffusion dynamics. This allows one to assess the fraction of bound molecules because they diffuse very slowly (&lt;0.08Î¼m<sup>2</sup>/s). However, long-lived and short-lived stable binding events cannot be distinguished in these experiments, and they are pooled into one number represented by the fraction bound. For the majority of data we have presented, we have used SpotOn to analyze fast tracking particles which we are able to monitor for no longer than ~2 seconds (200 frames at 10ms/frame) because the molecules are quickly bleached at high laser powers. SpotOn is used to model two states (bound and unbound) in each cell acquired at these high rates of imaging. It enables us to determine the fraction of MeCP2 that is stably bound, and the rapid rate of diffusion of unbound MeCP2 molecules that are imaged at these high speeds.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Possibly related to the previous point: MeCP2 shows very different diffusion behavior from other factors such as histones or Sox2. This also makes it more challenging to determine the individual bound and non-bound populations. For Sox2, the diffusion plot shows a bimodal population, but the MeCP2, the distribution is much broader and almost unimodal. In the mutants the distributions shifts, but it does not appear that the two populations are really separate. The bound fraction, and diffusion of bound molecules is then calculated as if these are really different populations. Could it be that this is just a single population, with binding sites of different affinity resulting in a broader distribution? Do the authors have any additional evidence to assume two different populations for MeCP2?</p></disp-quote><p>Studies from several laboratories (Nan et al., 1993; Mellen et al., 2012; Gabel et al., 2015) have demonstrated that high affinity binding of MeCP2 to methylated DNA (Kd ~ 1x10<sup>-9</sup>M) is similar to the binding of sequence specific transcription factors to their cognate binding sites. As discussed above, the residence time data we have presented confirms this fact and demonstrates that the short-lived stable interactions of MeCP2, Histone H1.0, Sox2 and TBP are similar. Based on these data, and previous studies of Sox2 and TBP in ES cells (Chen et al., 2014b), a diffusion coefficient of &lt;0.08 Î¼m<sup>2</sup>/s was chosen to calculate the fraction of stably bound MeCP2.</p><p>The conclusion that the unbound fraction of MeCP2 is not engaged in stable binding interactions with high affinity binding sites (5mCpG, 5mCpH, 5hmCpH) is supported by the fact that its average diffusion (~1Î¼m<sup>2</sup>/s) is more an order of magnitude faster than the values demonstrated for high affinity transcription factor interactions, and by our structure/function studies indicating that domains of MeCP2 outside of the MBD can impact its diffusion in the presence of a mutation (R106W) that completely abolishes stable binding.</p><p>The plots of diffusion coefficients shown in Figure 1E appear mono-modal because the diffusion of many more of the unbound MeCP2 molecules is slower than that measured for TBP or Sox2 despite the fact they are not stably bound to high affinity sites (note this is a logarithmic scale). Changes in the shapes of these plots are informative, and they almost certainly reflect a range of low affinity interactions with DNA or proteins that are mediated by the AT-Hook and NID domains. SpotOn analyzes unbound molecules as a single population to provide an average diffusion coefficient so that one can compare quantitatively the behavior of the entire unbound population.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) The authors state: &quot;The rate of diffusion of the unbound R133C protein is measurably increased&quot;. Figure 3D does not show that this effect of 133C on diffusion rate is statistically significant. Is it significant or not? If not then the authors cannot make this statement.</p></disp-quote><p>We have now modified the manuscript to reflect the reviewersâ comments. Although, as indicated by the reviewer, the difference in the average diffusion of MeCP2 R133C per cell is not statistically significant (Figure 3D), the distribution of diffusion coefficients is noticeably shifted and there is a significant trend toward higher diffusion coefficients (Figure 3C). We think it is important to point this out to the reader, and we have done so in very conditional terms. R133C results in increased diffusion coefficient, but this is a very subtle effect that is not measured by SpotOn fitting model over all the cells analyzed (Figure 3D).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) Figure 5D: The number of observations in heterochromatin is much larger. When down-sampled to the same level as observed in the euchromatic domains, is the difference still significant?</p></disp-quote><p>To understand whether this might alter the conclusions we have reached, we have performed additional statistical tests. Thus, we sub-sampled euchromatic data to match the number of particles recorded in heterochromatin and calculate the p value with KolmogorovâSmirnov test from data presented in Figure 5C (all cells) and in 5D (individual representative cells). In order to minimize data loss, we repeated this analysis in 1000 iterations of randomly selected particle values from the pool of euchromatin. In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig1">Author response image 1</xref> we plotted the log10 distribution of the p-values calculated. These data nicely confirm the statistic reported on panel 5D and indicate that the difference is not due to a sampling bias (The red dashed lines represent p-value=0.05).</p><fig id="respfig1"><label>Author response image 1.</label><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-51449-resp-fig1-v2.tif"/></fig><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) Is diffusion of MeCP2 in Purkinje cells still limited by the AT-hook domains? If not, then other interpretations for the altered mobility than altered chromatin compaction could explain the results.</p></disp-quote><p>While it would be very nice to test this directly, transfection of mutant constructs into Purkinje cells in slice preparations is exceedingly inefficient, and the technical difficulties associated with imaging very sparsely expressing cells in these preparations have prevented structure/function studies of this type. However, we believe the very different dynamic behaviors of MeCP2 molecules in these two very different nuclear types are fascinating and should be presented.</p><p>Of course, the implications of our data are many and significant. As alluded to by the reviewers, they certainly suggest that the IDD domain of MeCP2 (including the AT Hooks) has very little effect on diffusion in Purkinje cells and other nuclei of this type, and that this difference may have important functional consequences. Rather than enumerate these possibilities and speculate on the causes of this behavior (higher levels of 5hmC, differences in 3D chromatin architecture, altered levels of histone H1, etc..), we chose to make a very general statement that we believe is consistent with the data we have presented. If there are other interpretations of the data or the reviewer would like to suggest different language, we could edit the text appropriately.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) Since transfection efficiency can change between experiments, and between cells, it would be nice if the authors could show that the concentration of transfected MeCP2 is similar to the endogenous level.
