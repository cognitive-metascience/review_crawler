Here, we show that neurons in the mouse superior colliculus (SC) encode visual saliency by detecting motion contrast between stimulus center and surround. Excitatory neurons in the most superficial lamina of the SC are contextually modulated, monotonically increasing their response from suppression by the same-direction surround to maximal potentiation by an oppositely-moving surround. The degree of this potentiation declines with depth in the SC. Inhibitory neurons are suppressed by any surround at all depths. These response modulations in both neuronal populations are much more prominent to direction contrast than to phase, temporal frequency, or static orientation contrast, suggesting feature-specific saliency encoding in the mouse SC. Together, our findings provide evidence supporting locally generated feature representations in the SC, and lay the foundations towards a mechanistic and evolutionary understanding of their emergence.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>direction selectivity</kwd><kwd>saliency</kwd><kwd>vision</kwd><kwd>center-surround interactions</kwd><kwd>two-photon imaging</kwd><kwd>superior colliculus</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01EY020950</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Cang</surname><given-names>Jianhua</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01EY026286</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Cang</surname><given-names>Jianhua</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001809</institution-id><institution>National Natural Science Foundation of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>81770956</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Shi</surname><given-names>Xuefeng</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>TIanjin Science Fund for Distinguished Young Scholars</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>17JCJQJC46000</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Shi</surname><given-names>Xuefeng</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Two photon calcium imaging experiments show that excitatory and inhibitory neurons in the mouse superior colliculus are differentially modulated by the motion contrast between stimulus center and surround.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The detection of objects in the environment is crucial for an animal’s ability to efficiently and safely navigate the world. In the visual system, objects are processed by neurons that respond to specific features in their receptive fields (RFs), such as orientation, movement direction, luminance, and color. Being spatially restricted, each RF provides a local representation of the visual scene. At the perceptual level, however, the same stimulus presented within an RF could appear drastically different depending on its context. For example, a vertical bar would ‘pop out’ perceptually when it is surrounded by horizontal bars, but not among other identical vertical bars (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Li, 1999</xref>). Such saliency computation thus requires a comparison between local and global visual features at the neuronal level.</p><p>Most studies on feature-specific saliency computation have been conducted in primate and cat primary visual cortex (V1), predominantly in the context of orientation selectivity. It was shown that V1 neurons are suppressed by stimuli of the same orientation in regions surrounding the RF (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Jones et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Knierim and van Essen, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Sengpiel et al., 1997</xref>), consistent with the classical surround suppression seen at the level of the retina and lateral geniculate nucleus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Sachdev et al., 2012</xref>). Importantly, V1 neurons displayed lower levels of suppression when static gratings of orthogonal orientations were shown in the surround (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Kastner et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Knierim and van Essen, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Nothdurft et al., 1999</xref>). In response to moving gratings, orthogonal surrounds were even able to induce a certain level of response facilitation in primate V1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Jones et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Jones et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Sillito et al., 1995</xref>). In other words, depending on the relationship between the properties of the center and surround stimuli, differential levels of suppression or facilitation can occur, thus providing a neural basis for the perceptual ‘pop-out’ phenomenon.</p><p>It is theorized that feature-specific saliency computations are combined into a map to represent the total saliency value of each point in space (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Veale et al., 2017</xref>). Although the exact location of where the saliency map is first generated is still a matter of debate, there is a general agreement that the superior colliculus (SC) in the midbrain contains such a map (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Veale et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Zhaoping, 2016</xref>). In primates, SC neurons are not tuned to specific visual properties, consistent with the notion of feature-agnostic saliency representation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">White et al., 2017</xref>). In contrast, in lower vertebrates such as fish and birds, where neocortex has not evolved, neurons in the optic tectum, the homologue of the mammalian SC, can perform certain feature-specific saliency computations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Ben-Tov et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Frost et al., 1981</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Sun et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Zahar et al., 2012</xref>). This has led to the idea that the locus of saliency computation has migrated evolutionarily, among many other visual system functions, from the tectum to the visual cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Zhaoping, 2016</xref>).</p><p>These considerations thus raise an intriguing question about saliency computation in mice. Although neurons in mouse V1 show similar selectivity compared to those in higher mammals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Niell and Stryker, 2008</xref>), the SC remains the most prominent retinal target in mice, and mediates visually-guided behaviors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Ellis et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Liang et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Shang et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Wei et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Zhao et al., 2014</xref>). Unlike in primates, most visual neurons in the mouse SC are tuned to features such as motion direction or stimulus orientation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Gale and Murphy, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Wang et al., 2010</xref>). Here, we study how neurons in the <italic>stratum griseum superficiale</italic> (SGS) of the mouse SC respond to several types of motion contrast between RF center and surround. We use 2-photon calcium imaging to first study direction contrast in a highly selective population of SGS neurons in the superficial SGS (sSGS). Importantly, by imaging in transgenic mice with labeled GABAergic neurons, we reveal striking differences in the responses of excitatory and inhibitory neurons to direction contrast. We then demonstrate a bias in sSGS neuronal populations towards encoding direction contrast, as opposed to other features of the moving stimulus, possibly identifying a feature-specific saliency encoding in these superficial neurons. Finally, we delve deeper into the SGS to describe the depth-dependent profile of direction contrast responses. Together, our findings provide important information on how motion contrast is encoded by visual neurons in the SC.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Responses of sSGS excitatory neurons are modulated by motion contrast</title><p>We first performed 2-photon calcium imaging of SGS neurons in anesthetized mice using the synthetic calcium dye Cal-520.

A small circular patch of gratings (10° radius) was then placed at the center of the RFs and drifted in different directions, to determine the tuning and preferred direction of each imaged neuron. Consistent with our previous finding, about half of sSGS neurons were responsive to the drifting gratings (n = 355/811 GAD2<sup>-</sup> and n = 379/652 GAD2<sup>+</sup>, from 9 mice, see Materials and methods for details of determining responsiveness), and most of them were direction selective (DS), showing much higher increases in fluorescence to their preferred direction than to the opposite direction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>; 259/355, 73.0% of GAD2<sup>-</sup>, and 239/379, 63.1% of GAD2<sup>+</sup> neurons had gDSI ≥0.25).</p><p>For most responsive excitatory neurons (n = 294/355, 82.8%), the small patch of gratings covered their entire RFs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2A</xref>), such that gratings in the surround (an annulus from 10 to 30° radius) did not cause any response when presented alone (e.g., <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). However, when the surround gratings were presented simultaneously with the center stimulus, the response magnitude of sSGS neurons was dramatically altered. In the case when both the center and surround gratings moved along the preferred direction of a given excitatory neuron, we saw a classical surround-suppression of the center response (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C–D</xref>). In striking contrast, when the preferred direction in the center was coupled with a surround stimulus of opposite direction, most excitatory sSGS neurons increased their responses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C,E</xref>). In other words, to the same stimulus in their RF center, excitatory sSGS neurons could increase or decrease their response, that is, they are bidirectionally modulated, depending on what is shown in the surround.</p><p>Interestingly, a substantial population of excitatory sSGS neurons did not respond to the center or the surround gratings when presented separately but became responsive to particular Center-Surround (C-S) combinations (n = 191/811, 23.6%). This was despite the fact that the majority of these cells (154/191, 80.6%) had mappable RFs that were covered by the center patch (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A,B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2C</xref>).

These shifted responses were then averaged and illustrated in a 9 × 9 matrix (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). This matrix allows us to examine the responses under different C-S conditions. For example, the top row (Black trace in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>) represents the stimulus condition where the surround was ‘blank’, that is, only center grating was shown. As expected, these neurons were DS in response to the center grating alone, showing greater responses to the preferred directions than to the opposite direction (Black trace in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A–B</xref>). Furthermore, surround suppression was seen for all directions of the center stimulus when the surround gratings were moving in the same direction as the center (i.e., the diagonal in the matrix; Green traces in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A–B</xref>). Similarly, the potentiation by opposite surround was also seen for all directions of the center stimulus (Red traces in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A–B</xref>).</p><p>Interestingly, this modulation was geometric in nature, ranging from a divisive suppression by the same surround to a multiplicative potentiation by the opposite surround (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). In fact, a linear modulation of the center responses was also seen with intermediate differences between C-S directions (e.g., <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). We thus calculated the slope of these linear relationships (i.e., fold changes of center responses by the surround), and found that it gradually increased with the C-S direction difference (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>). In other words, excitatory sSGS neurons were monotonically tuned to motion contrast, showing maximal responses to the most salient stimulus with oppositely-moving center and surround. We also performed similar analyses with normalized responses for each cell before averaging and reached the same conclusions (data not shown). Furthermore, in addition to analyzing the averaged data, which reveal how sSGS excitatory neurons encode motion contrast as a population, we also examined the geometric relationship in individual cells. There was great variability in the goodness of fit between Center alone and C-S responses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A–D</xref>), but the vast majority of them could be reasonably fitted by a linear relationship (R<sup>2</sup> ≥0.5) with near zero y-intercept (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1E</xref>), suggesting a multiplicative modulation. Importantly, the average slope increased monotonically with the C-S direction difference (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1F–I</xref>), just like for the population response.</p><p>Finally, we performed a similar analysis for the ‘center silent’ neurons (n = 191), by averaging their responses to particular C-S direction differences. An emergent, and again monotonically increasing, response was seen as the C-S direction difference increased (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>). These cells thus display similar tuning to direction contrast as their center-responsive neighbors.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Inhibitory neurons in the sSGS are suppressed by motion contrast</title><p>Next, we analyzed how inhibitory sSGS neurons (GAD2<sup>+</sup>) responded to C-S direction contrast. Just like excitatory neurons, inhibitory neurons also experienced surround suppression when the surround direction matched the direction in the RF center (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A–B</xref>). They were, however, significantly less suppressed than their excitatory counterparts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>, KS test, p=6.0e-20, KS stat = 0.30). Furthermore, when the surround grating drifted in the opposite direction, the inhibitory neurons’ response to the preferred center stimulus was quite strongly suppressed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A and C</xref>). This is in stark contrast with the potentiation seen in excitatory sSGS neurons under the same conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>, KS test, p=1.46e-58, KS stat = 0.51). Consistently, compared with excitatory neurons, fewer ‘center-silent’ inhibitory cells became responsive when opposite center and surround was shown and their responses were weaker (n = 85/652; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>, compare with <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>).

Consistently, using this method, we found that a much larger proportion of excitatory sSGS neurons was significantly potentiated by the opposite-direction surround (n = 274 out of 546 responsive cells, 50.2%), compared to inhibitory neurons (n = 46 out of 464, 9.9%; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>).</p><p>Finally, we found that many center-responsive inhibitory neurons (204/379, 53.8%) could be activated by a surround alone that was moving in their preferred direction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1B</xref>, blue curve). Such a response profile was rarely observed in excitatory neurons. This was quite surprising given the fact that excitatory and inhibitory neurons had similar RF sizes when mapped with flashing squares (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2A–F</xref>, p=0.19, Mann-Whitney <italic>U</italic>-test comparing their RF size in panels E-F, n = 542 GAD2<sup>-</sup> and 425 GAD2<sup>+</sup> neurons responsive to flashing squares). It is possible that flashing squares might not provide enough drive to activate inhibitory neurons away from the center, leading to an underestimation of their effective RF size. Drifting gratings, on the other hand, could provide that drive, thereby revealing a potential difference between the RF properties of excitatory and inhibitory neurons in the sSGS. Alternatively, but non-exclusively, a wider spread of GAD2<sup>+</sup> RFs compared to their GAD2<sup>-</sup> neighbors could lead GAD2<sup>+</sup> neurons to sample inputs from beyond the center drifting gratings stimulus, therefore explaining those observations. This was true to some extent. The 2-dimensional standard deviation of GAD2<sup>+</sup> RF centroids for any given imaging field of view was statistically larger than that of GAD2<sup>-</sup> ones (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2G and H</xref>, p=0.03, paired t-test). However, while this difference is statistically significant, it is rather subtle, and unlikely to account for the surround-evoked responses in GAD2<sup>+</sup> cells.</p><p>Regardless of their origin, we performed two additional analyses to determine whether the ‘surround-alone’ responses could confound our conclusions. In one, we compared the responses of these cells to C-S stimuli vs. the sum of their respective responses to Center alone and to Surround alone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1C–D</xref>). In the other, we only included the inhibitory cells that did not show any significant response to the Surround alone stimulus and examined their response profiles (n = 175/379, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1E</xref>). Both analyses support the conclusion that inhibitory cells were suppressed by a surround stimulus, regardless of its direction. Together, these results demonstrate that sSGS excitatory and inhibitory neurons have slightly different RF properties and are differentially modulated by motion contrast. The greater suppression of inhibitory neurons by the opposite-direction surround suggests a possible role for them in mediating the potentiation of excitatory neurons through disinhibition.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>sSGS are specifically tuned to motion direction contrast</title><p>The responses we observed in the sSGS could be specific to the particular property of motion direction. Alternatively, such responses could be elicited by any type of feature-contrast between center and surround, in an indiscriminate manner.

We were limited in our imaging depth when using calcium indicators that disperse throughout the cell body and processes, due to the strong neuropil signal in the deeper SGS. To overcome this limitation, we used a genetically-encoded calcium indicator (AAV-H2B-GCaMP6s) that was largely restricted to the cell nucleus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>). This led to a substantial reduction of the neuropil signal in the deeper layers of the SGS, and allowed us to confidently image down to depths of around 200 µm. We characterized the performance of this indicator by performing simultaneous two-photon imaging and cell-attached recording to correlate the fluorescent signal with spiking activity. Although the ‘nuclear’ GCaMP6s was significantly slower than Cal-520 and could not resolve single spike activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1A–C</xref>), it was able to reliably report the tuning of SGS neurons to the C-S stimuli (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1D–E</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig6" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.35261.011</object-id><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><title>Direction contrast sensitivity declines with depth in the SGS.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Two-photon calcium imaging at different depths of the SGS, using AAV-H2B-GCaMP6s.

Largely consistent with the results using Cal-520, the very superficial SGS lamina was enriched with highly DS cells, including both excitatory and inhibitory neurons (black curves in Figure 6B and E, respectively; 109/125, 87.2% of GAD2<sup>-</sup> and 106/146, 72.6% of GAD2<sup>+</sup> neurons had gDSI ≥0.25). The degree of direction selectivity declined with depth in the SGS, confirming our previous single unit results and results from a recent study using high-density electrode recordings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Ito et al., 2017</xref>). Importantly, our results indicate that the decline was observed for both excitatory (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>, KS test, p=1.7e-16, KS stat = 0.62, between the most superficial (black) and deepest (magenta) cell populations) and inhibitory neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E</xref>, KS test, p=4.6e-7, KS stat = 0.39).</p><p>We then examined the depth profile of the surround modulation. In response to oppositely-moving surround, the response potentiation of excitatory neurons that we observed in the sSGS using Cal-520 was confirmed with nuclear GCaMP6s. Interestingly, this potentiation gradually turned into suppression with depth (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>, KS test, p&lt;0.01 between the four depths). On the other hand, surround of the same direction remained suppressive across depth, despite some subtle difference (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>). In the case of inhibitory neurons, no significant change was seen in the opposite surround modulation index with depth (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6F</xref>) and only minor difference in the same surround modulation index (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6G</xref>), but overall the cells remained similarly suppressed by the opposite or same surround.</p><p>The concurrent decline in excitatory cells’ gDSI and modulation index with depth suggested a potential correlation between these properties.

The responses of superficial excitatory neurons are bidirectionally modulated, increasing monotonically as a function of the direction difference between the center and surround, from suppression by the same-direction surround to maximal potentiation by an oppositely-moving surround. Such response profiles are likely important for the animal to detect object motion in the environment and distinguish it from self-induced global motion in the background.</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>Saliency computation and representation</title><p>Current theories postulate that visual saliency is analyzed separately by feature-specific channels, which are then combined into a feature-agnostic saliency map (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Veale et al., 2017</xref>). A classic example of feature-specific saliency computation takes place in V1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Li, 2002</xref>). Being orientation selective, V1 neurons modulate their responses depending on the orientation difference between the RF and its surround. In primate and cat V1, lower levels of suppression, or even facilitation, could occur when cross-oriented stimuli were shown in the surround (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Jones et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Jones et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Kastner et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Knierim and van Essen, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Nothdurft et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Sengpiel et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Sillito et al., 1995</xref>). More recent studies have shown similar findings in mouse V1, where responses were suppressed by an iso-oriented surround, but experienced an attenuation of suppression to a cross-oriented surround (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Self et al., 2014</xref>). This type of differential neuronal activity may underlie the ‘pop-out’ phenomenon mentioned earlier (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Li, 1999</xref>). Similarly, the direction-contrast dependent response might help the animal distinguish between self-induced motion in the visual scene, manifested as full-field motion, and actual object motion in the RF. Indeed, a similar role has been proposed for a population of neurons in mouse V1, under awake and running conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Keller et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Zmarz and Keller, 2016</xref>). Importantly, mouse studies have allowed researchers to explore the circuit mechanisms underlying surround suppression in more detail. With the available genetic toolkit in this species, the specific contributions of different types of cortical inhibitory neurons to surround-suppression are now being elucidated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Adesnik et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Nienborg et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>In lower vertebrates where neocortex has not evolved, the SC homologue optic tectum is the main visual center for signal processing, including saliency analysis. Tectal neurons in these species are usually motion sensitive and selective for movement direction. In barn owls, tectal neurons are differentially suppressed depending on the motion direction in the surround (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Zahar et al., 2012</xref>). In the pigeon tectum, a potentiating effect could be elicited under conditions of center-surround motion-opponency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Frost et al., 1981</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Sun et al., 2002</xref>). Additionally, studies in the archer fish showed that their tectal neurons exhibited contextual modulation which might underlie ‘pop-out’ in a visual search paradigm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Ben-Tov et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>In the primate SC, very few visual neurons are tuned to specific features such as direction or orientation. The SC is therefore thought to be the locus of integration of feature-specific cortical inputs into a feature-agnostic saliency map (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Veale et al., 2017</xref>), where neurons would respond indiscriminately to any feature contrast between the RF center and the surround. In contrast, neurons in the mouse SGS are mostly tuned to particular visual features such as motion direction. We demonstrate here that sSGS neurons in fact perform feature-specific saliency computations by encoding direction contrast in a monotonic, bidirectional, and cell-type specific fashion. Our findings are largely consistent with previous studies of orientation contextual modulation in rat SC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Girman and Lund, 2007</xref>), and more recently in mouse SC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Ahmadlou et al., 2017</xref>), where SGS neurons show greater responses when the center grating is surrounded by cross-orientated surround than by iso-oriented surround. Interestingly, we found that this computation is cell-type specific and more prominent in the very superficial SGS. In the mouse SC, direction selectivity is lost in the deeper laminae of the SGS, and the intermediate layers are multisensory integrators (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Cang and Feldheim, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Inayat et al., 2015</xref>). It is therefore possible that the transformation from a feature-specific saliency analysis to a feature-agnostic saliency map, or even more generally to a modality-agnostic saliency map, takes place between the deep SGS and the intermediate layers of the SC. Our results thus significantly expand on past findings of contextual modulation in the tectum as well as the SC. Importantly, the comparison of SC response properties across vertebrate species, including our current findings, supports the idea of a gradual evolutionary migration of saliency computation from a single locus in the SC/OT to a multi-structural process that involves cortical inputs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Zhaoping, 2016</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Mechanisms for motion contrast computation in the mouse SGS</title><p>One of the main reasons for studying saliency computation in mice is that we can monitor the activity of specific cell types using modern genetic and imaging techniques. Here we show that SGS excitatory and inhibitory neurons respond differently to the same motion contrast stimuli, an important finding that had not been shown in any other species. The inhibitory circuits in the rodent SGS have only been studied in the context of classical surround suppression, mostly using stimulus size tuning as a measure of modulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Binns and Salt, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Kasai and Isa, 2016</xref>). A recent two-photon imaging study in the mouse SGS showed that the activity of local inhibitory and excitatory neurons is equally suppressed by the surround, implicating long range inhibitory input in mediating the phenomenon (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Kasai and Isa, 2016</xref>). In our current study, however, we observe interesting differences in the responses of excitatory and inhibitory neurons. Inhibitory neurons are less susceptible to surround suppression, especially when they are direction selective (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). These neurons can nonetheless be much more suppressed by a surround moving in the opposite direction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>), potentially contributing to the increased responses in excitatory neurons.</p><p>Input from other brain areas could also contribute to surround modulation of SGS activity. The SGS receives direct inputs from both retina and visual cortex, in addition to a few other structures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">May, 2006</xref>). Visual cortex was removed in our experiments, ruling out its involvement in setting up those responses. This is consistent with the findings of a recent electrophysiological study suggesting that visual cortex may actually limit context-dependent modulation by cross-oriented gratings in the SGS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Ahmadlou et al., 2017</xref>). The same study also showed that this type of contextual modulation was more prominent in awake mice than in anesthetized mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Ahmadlou et al., 2017</xref>). How the direction-specific contextual modulation we discovered here might be influenced by anesthesia, and how it might be modulated by cortex in awake mice, remain to be determined.</p><p>Retinal inputs, on the other hand, were shown to be the source of direction selectivity in the SGS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Shi et al., 2017</xref>) and could provide contextually-modulated input. Surround-modulated suppression was observed under several motion-contrast regimes (spatial phase, spatial frequency, and velocity) in direction-selective retinal ganglion cells (DSGCs) in rabbits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chiao and Masland, 2003</xref>), and orientation-specific surround modulation of RGCs was shown in rats (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Girman and Lund, 2010</xref>). Furthermore, object motion sensitive (‘OMS’) RGCs were found in rabbits and salamander, which are suppressed by global motion but respond strongly to motion difference between RF center and surround (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Olveczky et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Baccus et al., 2008</xref>). The OMS cells included several RGC types, and their selectivity for differential motion is independent of direction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Olveczky et al., 2003</xref>). Even more relevantly, the same stimuli used in our experiments have also been used to investigate context modulation in mouse DSGCs in an unpublished study (Xiaolin Huang and Wei Wei, University of Chicago, personal communications). They showed that the oppositely-moving surround elicits smaller suppression than the same-direction surround, but never reaches potentiation; and the anti-phase surround causes similar responses as the opposite surround. These retinal studies thus suggest that some of the SC responses, including the suppression by same surround and its attenuation by anti-phase and cross-oriented static gratings, are likely inherited from the retina. However, these and other observations indicate that the bidirectional encoding of motion direction contrast by sSGS neurons is not inherited from the retina. Most notably, the modulation by out-of-phase and opposite surround is nearly identical in DSGCs, but dramatically different in the sSGS. Additionally, the fact that excitatory and inhibitory neurons in the sSGS, both of which receive direct retinal input (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Shi et al., 2017</xref>), exhibit strikingly different responses to center-surround stimuli argues for a role of intracollicular circuit mechanisms. These circuits may include long range excitatory and inhibitory connections from the surround, and they must be wired in a direction- and cell-type-specific manner to mediate the differential responses in excitatory and inhibitory neurons. They are also likely restricted to the superficial SGS to account for the depth-specific changes.</p><p>In conclusion, our study identified response correlates of motion saliency in the mouse SGS. The striking distinction between the responses of excitatory and inhibitory neurons to direction contrast in this structure makes it a strong candidate to be a locus of saliency encoding. This opens the door for future mechanistic studies that manipulate local inhibitory circuits in the SGS and examine the cellular and behavioral consequences. Our findings thus offer a unique opportunity to describe a circuit-level mechanism of saliency computation in the brain, and to look for downstream neuronal populations where feature-specific saliency representations are integrated into a feature-agnostic saliency map.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Animal preparation</title><p>Adult C57BL/6 mice of both sexes were used in this study (n = 24, 2–4 months old), <italic>Gad2-</italic>IRES-cre mice (from the Jackson Laboratory, Stock no. 010802) were either crossed with an Ai9 line (<italic>RCL-tdT</italic>, Stock no. 007909), or injected with AAV1.CAG.Flex.tdTomato.WPRE.bGH (University of Pennsylvania Vector Core, Allen Institute 864) in their SC, to express the red fluorescent protein tdTomato in glutamate decarboxylase two positive (GAD2<sup>+</sup>, GABAergic) neurons.

A burr hole was drilled on the left hemisphere using a dental drill, 0.75 mm lateral and 0.5 mm anterior of the lambda point.</p><p>A Nanoject II (Drummond) fitted with a glass pipette with a beveled tip and an inner diameter of 10–20 μm, was used for viral injection. Viral particles were loaded into the pipette, which was then lowered into the brain through the burr hole, first to a depth of 1.4 mm below the pial surface, and then retracted to a depth of 1.2 mm. At each depth a total volume of roughly 50 nL was delivered, in 2.3 nL pulses, 15 s apart. AAV-syn-H2B-GCaMP6s (generously provided by Dr. Loren Looger, Janelia Research Campus) was injected into the SC of GAD2-Cre x AI9 (<italic>RCL</italic>-tdT) animals (1:1 in PBS). Alternatively AAV-syn-H2B-GCaMP6s was mixed with AAV1.CAG.Flex.tdTomato.WPRE.bGH (5.1 × 10<sup>12</sup> GC/mL, University of Pennsylvania Vector Core, Allen Institute 864) (1:1:2 in PBS) and the same volumes were injected in the SC of GAD2-Cre mice at the aforementioned depths. The pipette was left in the tissue for 1–2 min before being slowly retracted. The skin was subsequently sutured back. Mice were given a dose of buprenex during surgery (0.05 mg/Kg, Sub-Q), and a dose of carprofen after (5 mg/Kg, Sub-Q), and were monitored daily for pain and wound health. Imaging was performed 10 to 21 days after injection.</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>Two-photon calcium imaging</title><p>After the mice were prepared for imaging as described in the previous sections, they were moved onto a heating pad under a two-photon scanning microscope (2P-SGS or Ultima Investigator, Bruker Nano Surface Division). The head bar was clamped at an angle so that the imaged SC surface was largely flat and perpendicular to the optical axis of the objective. A thin film of silicone oil was applied to the eyes for protection. A shield was placed around the craniotomy to block light from the visual stimulus during imaging. The SC was covered with 3% agarose in ACSF for stability. Imaging was performed with a Ti:sapphire laser (Coherent Chameleon Ultra II) at excitation wavelengths of 800 nm for Cal-520, 920 nm for H2B-GCaMP6s, and 720 or 1020 nm for tdTomato, using a 40X, 0.8-NA Leica, or a 16X, 0.8-NA Nikon objective, immersed in ACSF. Emitted signals from the Ca<sup>2+</sup> indicators and tdTomato were filtered into separate PMTs (green and red channels). Laser excitation power after the objective was around 10 mW for Cal-520 imaging, and varied between roughly 10 and 120 mW (depending on the depth) for H2B-GCaMP6s imaging. With the 2P-SGS, data were acquired using PrairieView software (Versions 5.0 and 5.3) in spiral scan mode at 2X optical zoom, resulting in a circular field of view with a diameter of 135 μm. Image resolution was 256 × 256 pixels and the acquisition rate was 8.079 Hz. Data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref> were acquired with the Ultima Investigator, using PrairieView software (Versions 5.4) with a resonant scanner at 4X optical zoom, resulting in a 206 × 206 μm field of view. Image resolution was 512 × 512 pixels and the acquisition rate was roughly 30 Hz. Frame-averaged data were used for the analysis (4-frame averages). Imaging with Cal-520 was performed in the superficial SGS (sSGS, no deeper than 50 μm from the SC surface), while imaging with H2B-GCaMP6s was performed across different depths of the SGS, ranging from the sSGS down to 205 μm below the surface.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Visual stimulus for imaging</title><p>Visual stimuli were generated with Matlab Psychophysics toolbox (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Brainard, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Niell and Stryker, 2008</xref>) on an LCD monitor (37.5 cm ×30 cm, 60 Hz refresh rate,~50 cd/m<sup>2</sup> mean luminance, gamma corrected). The screen was placed 25 cm away from the eye contralateral to the imaging site (the right eye), and slightly tilted at an angle matching that of the mouse's head, given that the mouse's nose was slightly elevated to correct for the curvature of SC and allow imaging from a relatively flat surface. The monitor was moved for every imaged field of view so that the cells' receptive fields were near the center of the screen. The placement of the monitor center in visual space varied between 30° and −25° in elevation (0° representing eye-level) and between 30° and 90° across the azimuth (0° representing the center of the binocular field) in all imaging experiments reported in this study. The ipsilateral eye was covered throughout the experiment.</p><p>Two types of visual stimuli were used for imaging. First, a flashing black square (5° x 5° in visual angle) on a gray background was used to map the receptive fields of the imaged neurons. The square was flashed in a 6 × 6 grid (30° x 30° in visual angle), for a duration of 1 s, followed by the presentation of a gray screen for 3 s. This stimulus set was shown to the mouse at least four times in a pseudo-random fashion for every imaged field of view.</p><p>The second visual stimulus was ‘center-surround’ square wave drifting gratings (100% contrast, 0.08 cpd, 2 Hz), presented on a gray background at the center of the screen so that the center component (20° across) covered the receptive fields of the imaged neurons. The surround was an annulus that started at the very edge of the center stimulus and extended 60° across. To assess responses to direction-contrast, eight different directions of motion were used for both center and surround gratings, ranging from 0° to 315° and tiling all of direction space in 45° increments. 0° represented forward motion from the animal’s perspective; positive values followed in a clockwise fashion, and negative values in a counterclockwise fashion. A blank (gray) condition was added to the eight directions for both center and surround for a total of 81 (9 × 9) unique center-surround combinations (including center alone conditions, surround alone conditions, and a gray screen condition). To assess responses to phase contrast, the 8 directions of the center stimulus were coupled with an anti-phase surround (180° phase difference), moving in the same direction as the center, for a total of 8 unique conditions. To assess responses to temporal frequency contrast, the 8 directions of the center stimulus were coupled with a surround at an either lower (1 Hz), or higher (4 Hz) temporal frequency, moving in the same direction as the center, for a total of 16 unique conditions. Finally, to assess responses to orientation contrast, static gratings of 4 different orientations (100% contrast, 0.08 cpd) were used for both center and surround, ranging from 0° to 135° and tiling all of orientation space in 45° increments. 0° represented vertical orientation; positive values followed in a clockwise fashion, and negative values in a counterclockwise fashion. A blank (gray) condition was added to the four directions for both center and surround for a total of 25 (5 × 5) unique center-surround combinations (including center alone conditions, surround alone conditions, and a gray screen condition). Each stimulus condition of the gratings was presented for 2 s, followed by a gray screen for 5 s. Every stimulus set was shown to the mouse at least four times in a pseudo-random fashion for every imaged field of view.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Imaging data analysis</title><p>Animals that had visible tissue damage to their SC after dye loading, where the dye failed to be incorporated into the cells, or where there was poor expression of H2B-GCaMP6s, were not subject to imaging. Data analysis was performed on all animals that were subject to imaging, and no data points were excluded from the resulting datasets.</p><p>Time-series frames were averaged to produce an average image of the field of view. In the cases where the imaging field shifted in the x-y plane over the course of the series, a semi-automated procedure was used to realign the frames. Specifically, a subset of the frames along the recording were manually realigned to match the first frame of the recording, and the corrected positions of all the intermediate frames were automatically extrapolated, leading to a sharper corrected average image, and spatially stable regions of interest (ROIs).</p><p>To determine whether each selected ROI is an inhibitory (GAD2<sup>+</sup>) or excitatory neuron (GAD2<sup>-</sup>), the experimenter referred to the red channel image of each field of view where GAD2<sup>+</sup> cells were labeled with tdTomato. This selection process relied exclusively on the expression of tdTomato and was performed blindly to the functional properties of the cells, which were determined at a later stage of the process.</p><p>For the analysis of Cal-520 imaging data, we followed our published procedures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Inayat et al., 2015</xref>). Briefly, ROIs were manually drawn on the average image of the collected time-series, and the intensity values of all pixels in each ROI were averaged for each frame to obtain the raw Ca<sup>2+</sup> signal for each cell. From the raw trace, and for each stimulus presentation, Δ<italic>F</italic>/<italic>F</italic><sub>0</sub> = (<italic>F – F</italic><sub>0</sub>)/<italic>F</italic><sub>0</sub>, was calculated, where <italic>F</italic><sub>0</sub> was the mean of the baseline signal over a fixed interval (1.25 s for gratings; 0.75 s for flashing squares) before stimulus onset, and <italic>F</italic> was the average fluorescence signal over a 2.5 s duration starting at 250 ms after stimulus onset and ending at 750 ms after stimulus offset for gratings (1.1 s duration, 250 ms after onset and 350 ms after offset, for flashing squares). A cell was considered responsive if its mean Δ<italic>F</italic>/<italic>F</italic><sub>0</sub> was more than two standard derivations above its <italic>F</italic><sub>0</sub> for at least one of the stimulus conditions. The mean value of Δ<italic>F</italic>/<italic>F</italic><sub>0</sub> for each of the stimulus conditions was then used to determine the direction tuning curve for every responsive cell, and to calculate a direction selectivity index and a response modulation index by the surround.</p><p>A similar procedure was used to analyze the H2B-GCaMP6s imaging data, with the exception that the 2.5 s integration time window of Δ<italic>F</italic>/<italic>F</italic><sub>0</sub> was shifted forward in time by 375 ms to account for the slower dynamics of H2B-GCaMP6s, compared to Cal-520. We analyzed this dataset with time windows of different latencies and durations, and our conclusions were not affected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplements 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">2</xref>, and See ‘Simultaneous two-photon imaging and cell-attached recording’ below).</p><p>To quantify the degree of direction selectivity, we calculated a global direction selectivity index (gDSI), which is the vector sum of Δ<italic>F</italic>/<italic>F</italic><sub>0</sub> responses normalized by their scalar sum (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Gale and Murphy, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Inayat et al., 2015</xref>): <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf4"> <mml:mi mathvariant="normal"/><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">g</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">D</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">S</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">I</mml:mi><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mfrac><mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mo>∑</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mi>R</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>θ</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:msup><mml:mrow><mml:mi>e</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>i</mml:mi><mml:mi>θ</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msup></mml:mrow></mml:mrow></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mo>∑</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mi>R</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>θ</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub></mml:mrow></mml:mrow></mml:mrow></mml:mfrac></mml:math></inline-formula>, where Rθ is the response magnitude in Δ<italic>F</italic>/<italic>F</italic><sub>0</sub> at direction θ of the center stimulus.</p><p>To calculate the modulation index, we first determined each neuron’s preferred direction as the center-stimulus direction that elicited the peak average Δ<italic>F</italic>/<italic>F</italic><sub>0</sub>.

We used glass micropipettes (1.8–2.5 μm tip diameter, 2.2–6.5 MΩ tip resistance) filled with ACSF (in mM: 125 NaCl, 5 KCl, 10 glucose, 10 HEPES, and 2 CaCl<sub>2</sub>, pH 7.4) and containing a mixture of 20 μM Alexa Fluor 488 and 594, for visualization under the microscope. Positive pressure was applied to the pipette, and the tip was brought to a position on top of a target neuron. The tip was subsequently lowered onto the cell, until a change in resistance was detected. Light suction was then applied to generate a seal and detect spiking activity. A MultiClamp 700B amplifier (Molecular Devices) in current-clamp mode and a System three workstation (Tucker-Davis Technologies) were used to record extracellular spiking. A minimal version of the Center-Surround stimulus (four directions and a blank in both center and surround) was used to elicit visual responses, and both image acquisition and the electrophysiological recording were synchronized to the visual stimulus.</p><p>The imaging and spiking data were then analyzed to compare their response magnitude to each stimulus condition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1A–B</xref>). Spike rate was averaged over the 2 s period of visual stimulus presentation (firing rate to the blank stimulus was subtracted). Due to its slow dynamics, the H2B-GCaMP6s calcium signal was averaged between 625 ms after stimulus onset and 1125 ms after offset for a duration of 2.5 s. This particular delay was longer than that used for Cal-520 (250 ms and 750 ms respectively). It was chosen so that for either reporter the start time coincided with a 20% response increase from baseline to the preferred C-S combination (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1C</xref>, blue and red curves). Note that because of the slow dynamics of H2B-GCaMP6s, and particularly the slow fluorescence decay time following a stimulus offset, a stable baseline was not always reached before the onset of the following stimulus. This resulted in negative Δ<italic>F</italic>/<italic>F</italic><sub>0</sub> values at some non-responsive conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1B</xref>). This could lead to an overestimation of the selectivity of cells, a foreseeable problem with calcium indicators that are slow or do not have single-spike resolution. Nevertheless, given the reasonably linear relationship between H2B-GCaMP6s and spike responses (n = 3, 2 mice; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1B,E</xref>), relative comparisons of responses within a single tuning curve and between cells are still valid. Some neurons exhibited uncharacteristic activity when patched (n = 2, 2 mice), which resulted in the immediate saturation of their calcium signal; a phenomenon very rarely observed during regular imaging sessions, and clearly induced by the recording procedure. Those cells were excluded from further analysis (data not shown).</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>Statistics</title><p>All pooled data were presented as mean ± s.e.m, unless stated otherwise. Significance was calculated using two-sided statistical tests including Mann-Whitney <italic>U</italic>-tests, Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) tests, Wilcoxon signed-rank tests, and paired <italic>t</italic>-tests as stated. Correlation coefficients and their corresponding p-values were calculated, in addition to first degree polynomial fits and their corresponding R<sup>2</sup> values and y-intercepts, as mentioned in the text.</p><p>To determine a significant difference between a neuron’s responses to any given pair of center-surround conditions (e.g. preferred-direction center vs. preferred center +oppositely moving surround), we performed a bootstrapping test. The four Δ<italic>F</italic>/<italic>F</italic><sub>0</sub> values (four trials) for each of the two compared stimulus conditions were pooled for a set of 8 values. Eight values were then sampled from that set 10,000 times, with replacement. Each of the generated sets was subsequently split into two subsets of 4 values randomly and the means of the two subsets subtracted to generate a distribution of the difference. The difference between the mean Δ<italic>F</italic>/<italic>F</italic><sub>0</sub> of the observed data was calculated, and depending on where that value fell with respect to the 95% confidence interval of the distribution, the response was considered significantly potentiated, suppressed, or unaltered. This measure gave us a more statistically tractable measure of modulation compared to the calculation of the modulation index, where a hard cutoff value of 0 separated between potentiated and suppressed neurons.</p><p>Note that when using this bootstrapping analysis we observe significant response suppression in center-silent neurons by a surround moving in the same direction, compared to their ‘response’ to the center alone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>). This indicates that our method for assigning response significance is rather conservative, and that some of these neurons might actually have some low-magnitude response to the center stimulus alone.</p><p>All analyses and graph plotting were performed in Matlab (MathWorks).

Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, Fred Rieke as the Reviewing Editor, and Andrew King as the Senior Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>The reviewers were enthusiastic and felt that the work potentially makes an important and timely contribution. At the same time, several issues need to be strengthened before we can reach a final decision. These include:</p><p>1) It is unclear how much of the results can be accounted for by the classic receptive field, and which require responses outside the classic receptive field.</p><p>2) The interpretation of the results needs to be discussed more carefully, with an emphasis on what is established and what is speculative. This should include clarifying that the origin of the measured signals and the connection to saliency are both speculative.</p><p>3) Additional analyses are needed to establish definitively that suppression is directionally tuned in excitatory but not inhibitory neurons.</p><p>These and other issues are detailed in the individual reviews below.</p><p>Reviewer #1:</p><p>This paper describes the encoding of motion in mouse SC, with a particular focus on how motion in the receptive field center and surround interact. The work is technically impressive and the results quite clear. My concerns are largely to do with the presentation and the strength of the conceptual advance of the work described.</p><p>Relation of results to saliency.</p><p>Throughout the paper, the results are described as a saliency computation. But unless I am missing something, the effects are close to fairly standard receptive field descriptions. Thus, for a cell sensitive to luminance, responses are suppressed with center and surround are stimulated with the same polarity inputs, and responses are potentiated with opposite polarity inputs. The current paper describes a similar receptive field behavior for motion. I would find the paper easier to read if this was described in terms of local vs. global motion rather than in terms of saliency. One issue I found particularly hard to relate the results of the paper to, was the idea of a saliency map.</p><p>Reviewer #2:</p><p>The manuscript provides a very readable, well-illustrated and interesting report on data from the superficial (i.e. visual sensory) layers of the superior colliculus in anaesthetised mouse. The authors use 2p imaging to measure calcium responses in inhibitory (GAD2 expressing) and other neurons. They report responses to stimuli composed of a drifting square-wave central grating, and a surround grating that could drift at the same rate in the same direction, or other directions, different drift rates, or different phase.</p><p>The experiments appear to be very well performed, and the analyses are clearly careful and well thought through. The current manuscript contributes significantly to our understanding of SC function by distinguishing excitatory from inhibitory neurons, and by showing that there is a depth dependence to these effects. The data may also be important for understanding the 'building blocks' of saliency computations.</p><p>The claims are as follows:</p><p>1) In very superficial excitatory neurons surrounds of the same motion direction suppress, but those of the opposite direction strongly facilitate. Strong facilitation is not seen for surrounds of different phase or temporal frequency.</p><p>2) Inhibitory neurons throughout layers instead show 'pan-direction' suppression.</p><p>3) There is reduced opposite-direction facilitation in deeper excitatory neurons.</p><p>Claim 1: The measurements in excitatory neurons show the expected suppression by surrounds moving in the same direction alongside an unexpected and powerful facilitation by oppositely moving surrounds. This is a very intriguing result and I would like to see some more evidence that this is not interactions among stimuli within the classical receptive field (if the surround is strongly suppressive, it could mask responses from the parts of the receptive field that it lies over, so lack of response to the surround alone needs to be treated with caution). I make this statement because the experiments in Figure 4 show that the suppression is reduced by manipulating surround drift rate or phase (i.e. the effect of these manipulations is in the same direction as the opposite-direction facilitation). Drift in opposite direction may have stronger impact than offset spatial phase and some analysis of models of direction-selectivity would be useful to be secure that the pattern of effects could not be attributed to interactions with DS receptive fields.</p><p>Claim 2: The measurements of surround suppression in inhibitory neurons are harder to interpret, as the authors point out, because the 'surround alone' stimulus drove responses strongly in many or most neurons. This probably would not change the overall conclusion that inhibitory neurons show suppression but not facilitation, but it certainly may impact on the estimates of direction sensitivity of surround suppression. More analyses are needed to be more secure in this. For example, the authors compare response to center stimulus to response to center + same surround stimulus (Figure 3B) but I think it more appropriate (here and in other analyses) to compare (center alone + surround alone) to the center + surround stimulus.</p><p>Claim 3: That deeper layers show less opposite direction facilitation is very intriguing. The analyses here however aren't quite as comprehensive as those above – for example I cannot see results for same direction surround, and therefore find it difficult to know whether the depth dependence reflects specific differences in direction-dependent suppression or also non-direction dependent suppression. It would also be useful to consider the impact of changes in receptive field size at deeper depths (Ahmadlou et al., 2017).</p><p>Reviewer #3:</p><p>Contextual features in visual scenes have large effects on sensory processing and behavior. In particular, these features have been suggested to work through fast, bottom-up mechanisms to alter the saliency of a stimulus. However, the mechanisms that support these effects, and the areas that are responsible, are not well understood. In this manuscript, Barchini et al., address this question by imaging the activity of identified GAD2<sup>+</sup> and GAD2<sup>-</sup> neurons in the mouse superior colliculus (SC), an area thought to be involved in the bottom-up contextual processing. They present a rich dataset in which they cleverly explore stimulus space and find that GAD2<sup>-</sup> neurons in the superficial layers of the SC undergo bidirectional contextual modulation. Altogether, these data are clear, beautifully quantified and reveal novel relationships between context and sensory processing in the SC. My only major request is that the authors clarify their proposed SC-intrinsic model for bidirectional contextual modulation.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>The authors argue (in the Abstract, Results section and Discussion section) that the bidirectional contextual modulation of GAD2<sup>-</sup> activity is driven by local interactions within the SC. However, there remain a number of confusing points about this model:</p><p>a) First, it is not clear what is driving the suppression of the GAD2<sup>+</sup> cells when the center and surround move in the opposite direction. In order for this to be a SC-intrinsic mechanism, there must be a population of GAD2<sup>+</sup> cells that is potentiated by opposite direction stimuli (to suppress the high DSI GAD2<sup>+</sup> cells), but these are rarely observed. Is it proposed that the potentiated neurons in Figure 3—figure supplement 1F are the source of this inhibitory drive to the GAD2<sup>+</sup> cells? Alternatively, is the proposal that this is mediated by longer-range inputs from GAD2<sup>+</sup> cells centered on the surround of the studied neurons? The authors need to clarify their model for how high DSI GAD2<sup>+</sup> cells are selectively suppressed by opposite center-surround stimuli.</p><p>b) Second, it is not clear what is driving the suppression of all cells when the center and surround move in the same direction. Again, if this is a SC-intrinsic mechanism, there must be a population of GAD2<sup>+</sup> cells that is potentiated by these stimuli. However, these are very rarely observed. Again, is this proposed to be a long-range mechanism? Or is it possible that the potentiation and suppression are supported by distinct mechanisms where the latter is inherited from the retina? The authors need to clarify their model for how same-direction stimuli suppress most SC cells.</p><p>c) Third, it is not clear what drives the depth-dependence of the observed effects. Despite the change in DSI with depth, the GAD2<sup>+</sup> cells are similarly suppressed by opposite direction stimuli at all depths. Thus, the suppression of these cells should be sufficient to drive potentiation of GAD2<sup>-</sup> cells at all depths. Is there a specific model of connectivity that the authors suggest can account for this?</p><p>d) Fourth, it is not clear why this effect is specific to direction. The authors demonstrate that cross-orientation stimuli are generally suppressive (though less suppressive than iso-orientation stimuli) in both GAD2<sup>-</sup> and GAD2<sup>+</sup> cells. They also show that when the center and surround are moving in the same direction, but antiphase or at different TFs, this disrupts the suppressive nature of the surround, though does not drive potentiation. How do these data fit into the authors' model for contextual modulation?</p><p>e) Finally, something strange is happening in Figure 3—figure supplement 1B. There seems to be a facilitation of GAD2<sup>+</sup> neurons' responses to the non-preferred direction when the preferred direction is in the surround, making these neurons orientation tuned. Is this true for individual neurons (are they orientation tuned in this context) or do some neurons start responding selectively to the opposite direction? Moreover, how does this result fit into the authors’ model of contextual modulation in the SC?</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were requested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for resubmitting your work entitled &quot;Bidirectional Encoding of Motion Contrast in the Mouse Superior Colliculus&quot; for further consideration at <italic>eLife</italic>.

This is related to the request in the previous round of reviews to show individual receptive fields.

In other words, it is about how mouse SC neurons encode motion stimuli of different saliency values: more salient when center and surround moving in different directions.</p><p>Therefore, our study does not directly address the saliency “map”, but instead, it reveals a 'building block' of saliency computation (reviewer #2).

This is a very intriguing result and I would like to see some more evidence that this is not interactions among stimuli within the classical receptive field (if the surround is strongly suppressive, it could mask responses from the parts of the receptive field that it lies over, so lack of response to the surround alone needs to be treated with caution). I make this statement because the experiments in Figure 4 show that the suppression is reduced by manipulating surround drift rate or phase (i.e. the effect of these manipulations is in the same direction as the opposite-direction facilitation). Drift in opposite direction may have stronger impact than offset spatial phase and some analysis of models of direction-selectivity would be useful to be secure that the pattern of effects could not be attributed to interactions with DS receptive fields.</p></disp-quote><p>This is an interesting possibility, but we think it’s unlikely for several reasons. First, if the “surround” stimulus indeed covers some of the classical RF, the cell could respond even more when the surround of “same” direction is coupled with the center stimulus at the cells’ preferred direction (i.e., the surround is also at the cell’s preferred direction), compared to “preferred center + opposite surround” (i.e., when the surround is at the cell’s null direction). But the opposite was actually observed: preferred center + opposite surround induced powerful facilitation. This indicates that, even if the surround covered some of the classical RF, it should not contribute to the observed facilitation. Second, the dramatic difference between excitatory and inhibitory cells in response to “center + opposite surround” argues against the possibility of “interactions among stimuli”, as that would cause similar changes in both cell types. Finally, our collaborator Dr. Wei Wei at University of Chicago used similar center-surround stimuli as ours to probe retinal responses. Their results strongly demonstrate that the facilitation we see in the SC excitatory cells are generated by local collicular circuits, thus not due to stimulus interactions.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Claim 2: The measurements of surround suppression in inhibitory neurons are harder to interpret, as the authors point out, because the 'surround alone' stimulus drove responses strongly in many or most neurons. This probably would not change the overall conclusion that inhibitory neurons show suppression but not facilitation, but it certainly may impact on the estimates of direction sensitivity of surround suppression. More analyses are needed to be more secure in this. For example, the authors compare response to center stimulus to response to center + same surround stimulus (Figure 3B) but I think it more appropriate (here and in other analyses) to compare (center alone + surround alone) to the center + surround stimulus.</p></disp-quote><p>We have performed the suggested analysis and generated new plots to compare “center alone + surround alone” to the response to “center + surround stimulus”. We did this for both excitatory (not shown) and inhibitory cells (Figure3 —figure supplement 1C-D). The only major difference is the even stronger suppression by the same surround stimulus in inhibitory neuron, which is expected due to the addition of the preferred-surround-only responses to the x-axis.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Claim 3: That deeper layers show less opposite direction facilitation is very intriguing. The analyses here however aren't quite as comprehensive as those above – for example I cannot see results for same direction surround, and therefore find it difficult to know whether the depth dependence reflects specific differences in direction-dependent suppression or also non-direction dependent suppression.</p></disp-quote><p>As suggested, we have added these panels to Figure 6 (panel D and G). Due to the added panels, we have split this Figure (now Figures 6 and Figure 7).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>It would also be useful to consider the impact of changes in receptive field size at deeper depths (Ahmadlou et al., 2017).</p></disp-quote><p>Our imaging is limited to the top 200 μm in depth, where there doesn’t seem to be much variability in RF size, consistent with a recent paper (Ito et al., 2017). RF sizes start to become noticeably larger below 200 um, a depth which we could not sample with calcium imaging. We therefore are not in a position to perform this analysis.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3:</p><p> <italic>Contextual features in visual scenes have large effects on sensory processing and behavior. In particular, these features have been suggested to work through fast, bottom-up mechanisms to alter the saliency of a stimulus. However, the mechanisms that support these effects, and the areas that are responsible, are not well understood. In this manuscript, Barchini et al., address this question by imaging the activity of identified GAD2</italic><sup>+</sup> <italic>and GAD2</italic><sup>-</sup> <italic>neurons in the mouse superior colliculus (SC), an area thought to be involved in the bottom-up contextual processing. They present a rich dataset in which they cleverly explore stimulus space and find that GAD2</italic><sup>-</sup> neurons in the superficial layers of the SC undergo bidirectional contextual modulation. Altogether, these data are clear, beautifully quantified and reveal novel relationships between context and sensory processing in the SC. My only major request is that the authors clarify their proposed SC-intrinsic model for bidirectional contextual modulation.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p></disp-quote><p> <italic>The authors argue (in the Abstract, Results section and Discussion section) that the bidirectional contextual modulation of GAD2</italic><sup>-</sup> <italic>activity is driven by local interactions within the SC. However, there remain a number of confusing points about this model:</italic></p><p>This concern as illustrated below in the 5 detailed points is all about the mechanisms of the observed bidirectional contextual modulation of GAD2<sup>-</sup> activity. We have tried to address the following 5 issues the best we can, but we simply do not know the exact circuit diagram to explain all aspects of this finding. However, we are very convinced that much of the observed modulation is due to local interactions in the SC. This is based on findings from our collaborator Dr. Wei Wei at University of Chicago. They used very similar center-surround stimuli as in our experiments so that we can compare surround modulation from RGCs to the SC.</p><p>The main finding in the retina is that the direction selective retinal ganglion cells (DSGCs) are greatly suppressed by same direction surround, and the suppression is reduced (but no potentiation) when the surround is antiphase or moving along opposite direction. The fact that opposite and antiphase surround cause similar responses in DSGCs, but very different responses in SC, strongly argue for a role of local circuits in this computation. We have mentioned some of the retinal findings in our Discussion section to make this point clearer.</p><p><italic>a) First, it is not clear what is driving the suppression of the GAD2</italic><sup>+</sup> <italic>cells when the center and surround move in the opposite direction. In order for this to be a SC-intrinsic mechanism, there must be a population of GAD2</italic><sup>+</sup> <italic>cells that is potentiated by opposite direction stimuli (to suppress the high DSI GAD2</italic><sup>+</sup> <italic>cells), but these are rarely observed. Is it proposed that the potentiated neurons in Figure 3—figure supplement 1F are the source of this inhibitory drive to the GAD2</italic><sup>+</sup> <italic>cells? Alternatively, is the proposal that this is mediated by longer-range inputs from GAD2</italic><sup>+</sup> <italic>cells centered on the surround of the studied neurons? The authors need to clarify their model for how high DSI GAD2</italic><sup>+</sup> <italic>cells are selectively suppressed by opposite center-surround stimuli.</italic></p><p>The reviewer is correct that there has to be an increased inhibitory drive to mediate the suppression of GAD2<sup>+</sup> cells when the center and surround move in opposite directions. We think it’s likely that this is mediated by long-range inhibition from the surround onto local inhibitory neurons. In other words, it’s from inhibitory neurons that are outside the imaged region. This is consistent with a recent finding by Kasai and Isa, 2016, which support the long range inhibition model. We have mentioned this in Discussion section.</p><p> <italic>b) Second, it is not clear what is driving the suppression of all cells when the center and surround move in the same direction. Again, if this is a SC-intrinsic mechanism, there must be a population of GAD2</italic><sup>+</sup> <italic>cells that is potentiated by these stimuli. However, these are very rarely observed. Again, is this proposed to be a long-range mechanism? Or is it possible that the potentiation and suppression are supported by distinct mechanisms where the latter is inherited from the retina? The authors need to clarify their model for how same-direction stimuli suppress most SC cells.</italic></p><p>As mentioned above, the global suppression by the same direction stimulus is most likely inherited from the retina. However, precise local circuits must exist to generate the potentiation in excitatory cells when the center and surround stimuli move in opposite directions. In other words, it is possible for these two phenomena to arise through distinct mechanisms: one feed-forward from the retina, and the other through local activity in the SC. We have clarified this in the revised Discussion section.</p><p> <italic>c) Third, it is not clear what drives the depth-dependence of the observed effects. Despite the change in DSI with depth, the GAD2</italic><sup>+</sup> <italic>cells are similarly suppressed by opposite direction stimuli at all depths. Thus, the suppression of these cells should be sufficient to drive potentiation of GAD2</italic><sup>-</sup> <italic>cells at all depths. Is there a specific model of connectivity that the authors suggest can account for this?</italic></p><p>This is indeed an intriguing finding. We do not have a specific model to explain the depth dependence effect, but we think it is informative to report this finding. However, it is relevant to note that just the suppression of inhibitory cells would not necessarily lead to potentiation in excitatory cells, because the excitatory retinal drive is also reduced at the same time. This consideration further supports a role of local circuits in this computation, and also suggests that such circuits would be lamina-specific. How such circuits are organized in different depths is completely unknown, and at this stage we can only speculate given the available data. We have mentioned this issue in Discussion section.</p><p> <italic>d) Fourth, it is not clear why this effect is specific to direction. The authors demonstrate that cross-orientation stimuli are generally suppressive (though less suppressive than iso-orientation stimuli) in both GAD2</italic><sup>-</sup> <italic>and GAD2</italic><sup>+</sup> <italic>cells. They also show that when the center and surround are moving in the same direction, but antiphase or at different TFs, this disrupts the suppressive nature of the surround, though does not drive potentiation. How do these data fit into the authors' model for contextual modulation?</italic> </p><p>This is indeed the heart of this question. As mentioned above, some of our findings can be explained by changes in the retina, but not for the direction-specific potentiation. A possible circuit is that long-range excitation and inhibition from the surround could be organized in the direction-specific manner. We are actively pursuing studies to reveal underlying circuits, but all we can do now in this paper is to speculate possible mechanisms. We have expanded this section of Discussion section.</p><p> <italic>e) Finally, something strange is happening in Figure 3—figure supplement 1B. There seems to be a facilitation of GAD2</italic><sup>+</sup> <italic>neurons' responses to the non-preferred direction when the preferred direction is in the surround, making these neurons orientation tuned. Is this true for individual neurons (are they orientation tuned in this context) or do some neurons start responding selectively to the opposite direction? Moreover, how does this result fit into the authors’ model of contextual modulation in the SC?</italic></p><p>The apparent orientation tuning is an “artifact” of our choice of the center-stimulus size. The center stimulus size captures very well the response of excitatory neurons, which are rarely and weakly driven by any stimulus in the surround. Many inhibitory neurons, on the other hand, are significantly driven by the surround grating alone (for which we speculated possible causes in the text). Thus, when an inhibitory cell is presented by its null direction at the center coupled with the opposite surround, the surround direction is actually at the cell’s preferred direction (+180 in the red tuning curve) and would induce significant responses. In other words, the peak of the blue tuning curve in Figure 3—figure supplement 1B accounts for the response observed at the tail end of the red tuning curve. As explained above, long-range inhibition and excitation are more likely to be involved in the observed effect, this result in question is unlikely a factor.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were requested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Reviewing editor comments:</p><p>OMS ganglion cells</p><p>The encoding of local motion described here resembles in several ways that of object-motion sensitive ganglion cells – see Olveczy et al., (2003), Baccus et al., (2008).
