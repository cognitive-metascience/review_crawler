autoimmune and infectious diseases. Here we conduct an in-depth interrogation of associations between genetic variation, gene expression and disease. We create a comprehensive map of regulatory variation in the MHC region using WGS from 419 individuals to call eight-digit HLA types and RNA-seq data from matched iPSCs. Building on this regulatory map, we explored GWAS signals for 4083 traits, detecting colocalization for 180 disease loci with eQTLs. We show that eQTL analyses taking HLA type haplotypes into account have substantially greater power compared with only using single variants. We examined the association between the 8.1 ancestral haplotype and delayed colonization in Cystic Fibrosis, postulating that downregulation of <italic>RNF5</italic> expression is the likely causal mechanism. Our study provides insights into the genetic architecture of the MHC region and pinpoints disease associations that are due to differential expression of HLA genes and non-HLA genes.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>major histocompatibility complex</kwd><kwd>eQTLs</kwd><kwd>gene expression</kwd><kwd>HLA types</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000900</institution-id><institution>California Institute for Regenerative Medicine</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>GC1R-06673</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Frazer</surname><given-names>Kelly A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>HG008118</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Frazer</surname><given-names>Kelly A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>HL107442</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Frazer</surname><given-names>Kelly A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>DK105541</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Frazer</surname><given-names>Kelly A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>DK112155</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Frazer</surname><given-names>Kelly A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund7"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000001</institution-id><institution>National Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>CMMI division award 1728497</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Frazer</surname><given-names>Kelly A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>T15LM011271</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Donovan</surname><given-names>Margaret KR</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Analysis of the major histocompatibility complex using whole genome sequencing and RNA-seq data from hundreds of individuals provides novel insights into mechanisms underlying associations of this interval with disease.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The 4 Mb major histocompatibility (MHC) region on chromosome 6p21.3, which encodes the human leucocyte antigen (HLA) gene complex, is highly polymorphic, gene dense, and has strong linkage disequilibrium (LD) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Dendrou et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Fehrmann et al., 2011</xref>). Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified many autoimmune and infectious diseases that are more prevalent in individuals carrying certain HLA types (alleles), whereas other HLA types are protective against disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Blackwell et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Gough and Simmonds, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Matzaraki et al., 2017</xref>). The molecular mechanisms by which certain HLA types predispose or protect against disease are currently unclear. Several studies have suggested that the mechanistic underpinnings underlying associations with some autoimmune diseases may be due to certain HLA types being more likely than other HLA types to atypically present self-antigens (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Klein et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Oldstone, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Yin et al., 2013</xref>). Expression differences between different HLA types of the same HLA gene could also contribute to disease associations. Finally, some of the genetic associations with specific HLA types could be due to causal variants on the same haplotype, that affect the expression or function of non-HLA genes in the MHC region (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Holoshitz, 2013</xref>). Hence there are complex interactions between genetic variation, gene expression and function of both HLA and non-HLA genes, and disease, rendering the MHC region an important but difficult interval to genetically interrogate.</p><p>Here, we used deep whole genome sequence (WGS) from 419 individuals to call full resolution (eight-digit) HLA types and RNA-seq data from 361 matched induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) to create a comprehensive map of regulatory variants in the MHC region. We identified eight-digit HLA types that are strongly associated with expression differences of their cognate HLA gene, and conducted eQTL analyses using both single-variants and eight-digit HLA types, which represent haplotypes of coding and regulatory variants. We built upon the comprehensive MHC regulatory map by functionally exploring GWAS signals for 4083 complex traits, finding strong evidence of colocalization for 180 disease loci with eQTLs. Our data are a valuable resource for both the genetics and disease-focus communities, providing insights into the genetic architecture of the MHC region that have not previously been described. To demonstrate the utility of our resource, we examined the common Caucasian 8.1 ancestral haplotype (8.1AH), which spans the entire MHC region and is associated with many autoimmune disorders and other diseases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Gambino et al., 2018</xref>), but is protective against bacterial colonization in Cystic Fibrosis (CF) patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Tomati et al., 2015</xref>). Here, we show that 8.1AH is associated with decreased expression of <italic>RNF5</italic>, and previous studies have shown that inhibition of RNF5 results in rescue of F508del mutant cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Sondo et al., 2018</xref>). Based on these observations, we postulate that downregulation of <italic>RNF5</italic> expression is the causal mechanism underlying the association between 8.1AH and delayed colonization in CF patients.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Eight-digit HLA typing</title><p>We used HLA-VBSeq (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Nariai et al., 2015</xref>) to estimate HLA types at eight-digit resolution for 30 genes [six HLA class I genes (HLA-A, -B, C, -E, -F, -G); eight HLA Class I pseudogenes (HLA-H, -J, -K, -L, -P, -T, -V, -W); twelve HLA class II genes (HLA-DMA, -DMB, -DOA, -DOB, -DPA1, -DPA2, -DPB1, -DPB2, -DQA1, -DQB1, -DRA, -DRB1); and four non-HLA genes (MICA, MICB, TAP1, and TAP2)] in 650 WGS samples (from 419 unique individuals) and identified 526 unique alleles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref>).

Colocalization methods integrating GWAS and eQTL studies can identify causal variants that are shared between a complex trait locus and altered gene expression; and thereby elucidate the mechanism underlying GWAS non-coding variants and identify their target genes. Although the human MHC region on 6p21.3 has been associated with many autoimmune and infectious diseases, it is typically excluded from eQTL studies due to its high SNP frequency and complex LD structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Lam et al., 2017</xref>). To address this gap, we developed a comprehensive map of regulatory variation in the MHC region using deep WGS from 419 individuals and RNA-seq data from matched iPSCs. We have previously shown that iPSCs are well-powered for eQTL mapping (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bonder et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Jakubosky et al., 2019a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Jakubosky et al., 2019b</xref>), have a distinct regulatory landscape relative to somatic tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">DeBoever et al., 2017</xref>), and thereby provide insights into regulatory variants that exert their effects during early development. While we demonstrate the feasibility of generating a map of regulatory variation for the MHC region and its utility for examining molecular mechanisms underlying disease associations in the interval, future studies using eQTLs from other cell types could increase the number of complex trait loci in the interval that are functionally annotated.</p><p>We constructed a large panel of HLA types at eight-digit resolution for 30 genes in the MHC region using a state-of-the-art computational algorithm, HLA-VBSeq (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Nariai et al., 2015</xref>), and the comprehensive IPD-IMGT/HLA database (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Robinson et al., 2016</xref>). To examine the extent that eight-digit HLA types were associated with expression levels of their cognate HLA gene, we estimated expression levels of the HLA genes by aligning RNA-seq reads to cDNA sequences specific for the HLA types called by HLA-VBSeq. Overall, we observed that the eight-digit HLA types were strongly associated with expression differences of the cognate HLA gene. This finding suggests that the associations between certain HLA types and disease may not only be driven by polymorphic amino acid epitopes resulting in differential binding affinities to specific peptides, but also in part by different expression levels.</p><p>We identified 56 eGenes in the MHC region that were associated with high numbers of primary eQTLs (median = 842) spanning relatively large distances (median = 2.1 Mb), which is consistent with the strong LD in the interval. We also conducted conditional eQTL analyses and discovered that the majority of these eGenes were associated with multiple independent regulatory variants. Given the complexity of conducting genetic association studies in the MHC region, we examined the primary and conditional eQTLs and showed that they have characteristics of regulatory variants including proximity to the TSS of their associated eGene, enrichment in active chromatin marks, and association with allele-specific expression of their eGene. We then tested the eQTL signals (primary and conditional) for all 56 eGenes against GWAS signals for 4083 complex traits from the UK Biobank and found strong evidence of colocalization with 180 disease loci. Given that the 8.1 ancestral haplotype (8.1AH) is an important genetic modifier of lung disease in Cystic Fibrosis (CF) patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Laki et al., 2006</xref>), we examined if any of the MHC eGenes colocalize with loci for complex traits contributing to phenotypic variation in CF, including pulmonary diseases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Stoltz et al., 2015</xref>), weight (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Leung et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Morison et al., 1997</xref>), as well as liver, biliary tract and gallbladder diseases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Assis and Debray, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Diwakar et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Herrmann et al., 2010</xref>). Our findings suggest that altered gene expression levels in the MHC region contributes to phenotypic variation in these complex traits and demonstrates the utility of our data to identify shared causal variants underlying GWAS and eQTL signals in the interval.</p><p>We hypothesized that HLA types, which represent a haplotype of many regulatory and coding SNPs, could exert a greater effect on gene expression than single variants. We conducted an HLA-type eQTL analysis and identified 114 eGenes, showing that indeed taking HLA type haplotypes into account substantially increased power to identify eGenes over single-variant eQTL analysis. HLA-type eQTLs largely clustered into four distinct genomic regions. We showed that this clustering was due to the fact that HLA-type eQTLs capture regulatory variants that act over relatively short distances and tend to be associated with the expression of only one or a few neighboring genes. Unfortunately, we were not able to conduct a colocalization analysis of HLA-type eQTLs and GWAS signals, because GWAS for complex traits have not yet been conducted using eight-digit HLA types. However, in the past few years, novel methods have been developed to impute HLA types from variants assayed by SNP arrays (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Jia et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Zheng et al., 2014</xref>), which makes conducting GWAS using HLA types feasible for currently existing datasets. Based on our findings, future GWAS directly testing associations between HLA types and complex traits are likely to uncover many novel associations.</p><p>We examined the association between the 8.1AH and delayed colonization in cystic fibrosis (CF) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Laki et al., 2006</xref>). We showed that <italic>RNF5</italic> expression was negatively associated with eight-digit HLA types for all six genes composing the 8.1AH. Interestingly, RNF5 was recently described as a potential novel drug target in CF, because, when RNF5 activity is decreased, the mutant CFTR protein becomes stabilized and its function as a cAMP-dependent chloride channel in the lung epithelium is partially rescued (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Sondo et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Tomati et al., 2015</xref>). Impaired ion transport mediated by CFTR is associated with reduced airway hydration and decreased mucociliary clearance, which leads to increased vulnerability to bacterial infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Dechecchi et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Munder and Tümmler, 2015</xref>). Hence, we postulate that downregulation of <italic>RNF5</italic> expression due to the presence of specific regulatory variants in 8.1AH is the likely mechanism underlying delayed colonization by <italic>S. aureus</italic> and <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic>. While our findings do not preclude that HLA types comprising 8.1AH have a direct role in the protection against bacterial colonization in CF, they suggest that reduced <italic>RNF5</italic> expression likely plays a major factor in the association between 8.1AH and colonization.</p><p>Taken together, our data provide insights into the genetic architecture of the MHC region and show that disease associations with HLA types cannot only be due to epitope differences but differential expression of HLA genes and associated non-HLA genes. Further, these data are a valuable resource for both the genetics and disease-focus communities that can be exploited to identify causal mechanisms underlying disease associations in the MHC region, and potentially novel drug targets.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th valign="top">Reagent type <break/>(species) or resource</th><th valign="top">Designation</th><th valign="top">Source or reference</th><th valign="top">Identifiers</th><th valign="top">Additional <break/>information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td valign="top">Software, algorithm</td><td valign="top">GATK</td><td valign="top">(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Van der Auwera et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Zhang et al., 2017</xref>)</td><td valign="top"/><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Software, algorithm</td><td valign="top">HLA-VBSeq</td><td valign="top">(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Nariai et al., 2015</xref>)</td><td valign="top"/><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Software, algorithm</td><td valign="top">SAMtools version 1.2</td><td valign="top">(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Li et al., 2009</xref>)</td><td valign="top"/><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Software, algorithm</td><td valign="top">STAR (2.5.0a)</td><td valign="top">(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Dobin et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Harrow et al., 2012</xref>)</td><td valign="top"/><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Software, algorithm</td><td valign="top">RSEM (1.2.20)</td><td valign="top">(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Li and Dewey, 2011</xref>)</td><td valign="top"/><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Software, algorithm</td><td valign="top">bcftools</td><td valign="top">(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Li et al., 2009</xref>)</td><td valign="top"/><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Software, algorithm</td><td valign="top">lmekin (coxme package)</td><td valign="top">R 3.5.1</td><td valign="top"/><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Software, algorithm</td><td valign="top">MBASED</td><td valign="top">(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Mayba et al., 2014</xref>)</td><td valign="top"/><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Software, algorithm</td><td valign="top">coloc.abf (coloc package)</td><td valign="top">R 3.5.1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Giambartolomei et al., 2014</xref>)</td><td valign="top"/><td valign="top"/></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap><sec id="s4-1"><title>Whole-genome sequencing data</title><p><italic>iPSCORE Resource</italic>: Whole genome sequencing (WGS) was performed for 273 individuals (152 females and 121 males) at Human Longevity, Inc (HLI) as described in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">DeBoever et al.

For each gene, we calculated concordance as the fraction of HLA types that matched in the 25 monozygotic twin pairs in iPSCORE or the 231 fibroblast-iPSC paired genomes from the same individual in the HipSci resource. We calculated Mendelian inheritance concordance for each gene as the percentage of HLA types segregating in non-overlapping trios (i.e. in families with multiple trios, each individual was only used once for this analysis). If one or more HLA types were undetermined for a given pair/trio, we excluded the pair/trio during the concordance calculation.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (HWE)</title><p>To investigate HWE, we performed a likelihood ratio test on the allele frequency of each HLA allele independently in 275 unrelated Caucasians in the iPSCORE and HipSci cohorts. We tested each HLA allele independently for several reasons: 1) calculating HWE on sites with tens or hundreds of alleles is highly computationally intensive and complicated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Eguchi and Matsuura, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Graffelman et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Guo and Thompson, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Li et al., 2014</xref>); and 2) the MHC region is under high selective pressure, therefore the proportions between different alleles do not satisfy the assumptions for HWE (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Hardy, 1908</xref>). All associations with p-values&lt;1×10<sup>−6</sup> were considered as significantly deviating from HWE and flagged in the HLA-type QTL analysis.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Comparison of observed HLA type frequencies with other populations</title><p>In the Allele Frequency Net Database (AFND) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">González-Galarza et al., 2015</xref>), 3,556,301 people were genotyped for 12 out of the 30 genes we examined in the MHC region at two-digit resolution, 3,469,268 people (17 genes) at four-digit, 124,721 people (14 genes) at six-digit, and 10,212 people (seven genes) at eight-digit. This would result in testing 226 alleles at two-digit resolution (115 iPSCORE and 101 HipSci), 395 alleles at four-digit resolution (222 iPSCORE and 173 HipSci), 321 alleles at six-digit resolution (174 iPSCORE and 147 HipSci), and 42 alleles at eight-digit resolution (21 iPSCORE and 21 HipSci). We conducted the allele frequency comparative analysis using four-digit resolution (identified by collapsing eight-digit HLA types) to maximize the number of individuals in AFND, the number of genes and the number of alleles. The allele frequency of each HLA type in iPSCORE, HipSci and in the AFND was calculated by dividing the total number of individuals containing the given HLA type by the total number of people in each cohort and a correlation value was calculated after fitting a linear model.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Human iPSCs used in expression studies</title><p>For the expression studies, we used RNA-seq data for 446 iPSC samples from 361 individuals (215 iPSCORE and 146 HipSci, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref>). For the 215 iPSCORE individuals, fibroblasts were reprogrammed, an iPSC clone obtained and RNA-seq data generated and processed as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">D'Antonio-Chronowska et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">D'Antonio et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">DeBoever et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Panopoulos et al., 2017</xref>). Briefly, sequenced RNA-seq reads were aligned to the Gencode V.19 transcriptome using STAR (2.5.0a) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Dobin et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Harrow et al., 2012</xref>). Gene expression levels (TPM) were calculated using RSEM (1.2.20) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Li and Dewey, 2011</xref>). For the 231 iPSC samples in HipSci (corresponding to 146 individuals), RNA-seq data were downloaded from the European Nucleotide Archive (ENA, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena">https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena</ext-link>, study PRJEB15299) and processed using the same pipeline used for the iPSCORE iPSC RNA-seq data.</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>Estimating HLA type-specific gene expression levels</title><p>The IMGT-IPD HLA database release 3.30.0 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Robinson et al., 2016</xref>), RSEM version 1.2.20 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Li and Dewey, 2011</xref>) contained cDNA sequences corresponding to each eight-digit resolution allele of the 24 HLA genes expressed in iPSCs. To minimize the number of variant differences between the RNA-seq reads mapping to the HLA genes, for each individual, we estimated HLA type-specific expression by replacing the canonical cDNA reference sequences of the 24 genes in Gencode v19 with cDNA sequences corresponding to the HLA types detected in the individual using HLA-VBSeq (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Nariai et al., 2015</xref>). Because individuals with heterozygous HLA types had two cDNA sequences associated with the same HLA gene, while homozygous individuals had only one, we determined HLA type-specific expression in two distinct ways. For heterozygous individuals, the TPM associated with each cDNA sequence was considered as HLA type-specific expression, while for homozygous individuals, the TPM was divided by two to obtain HLA type-specific expression levels.</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>HLA types associated with expression levels of cognate HLA gene</title><p>We compared the expression level distributions of each HLA type against all other alleles from the cognate HLA gene (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp5">Supplementary file 5</xref>).

We filtered variants that: 1) had a call rate &lt;95%; 2) had minor allele frequencies &lt; 1%; 3) deviated from HWE in the 275 unrelated Caucasian individuals (p&lt;1.0×10<sup>−6</sup>). We obtained 45,245 filtered variants (40,668 SNPs and 4577 small indels) in the MHC region (plus 1 Mb upstream and downstream; exact coordinates: chr6:29640168–33115544) using bcftools (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Li et al., 2009</xref>) and decomposed multiallelic genotypes using vt (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Tan et al., 2015</xref>). Out of the 383 Gencode v19 genes in the MHC locus (chr6:29640168–33115544), 146 were expressed genes (TPM ≥2 in at least 10 samples), including 24 HLA genes. eQTL analysis requires expression levels associated with each gene; therefore, for the 24 HLA genes, we transformed the estimated HLA type-specific expression levels to gene-level expression by summing the expression of both HLA types in each individual. Expression levels of all 146 genes were quantile-normalized across all individuals. Normalized gene expression levels were adjusted for sex, age, batch (iPSCORE and HipSci), iPSC passage, read depth, read length, ten PEER factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Stegle et al., 2010</xref>) and, to account for ethnicity, ten principal components calculated on the genotypes of 90,081 common SNPs in linkage equilibrium that we previously used to estimate the ethnicity of iPSCORE individuals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Panopoulos et al., 2017</xref>). To adjust for potential unknown sources of noise in gene expression, the ten PEER factors were calculated on genome-wide expression levels of 20,595 genes (with TPM ≥2 in at least 10 samples), rather than only on the expression levels of genes in the MHC region. We performed eQTL analysis for the 146 expressed genes and the 45,245 variants using a linear mixed model (lmekin from the coxme package in R) with a kinship matrix (to take population structure into account, including multiple ethnicities, members of the same family and twin pairs) calculated on 90,081 common SNPs distributed across the genome and in linkage equilibrium.</p><p>In order to detect significant eQTLs for each eGene, and then detect eGenes at genome-wide significance levels, we employed a three-step procedure to perform hierarchical multiple testing correction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Huang et al., 2018</xref>): 1) locally adjusted p-value at gene-level: nominal p-values were Bonferroni-corrected for the number of tests performed for each gene (45,245, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp6">Supplementary file 6A</xref>); the variant with the minimum adjusted p-value was considered as lead eQTL (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp6">Supplementary file 6B</xref>); 2) genome-wide adjusted p-value of lead eQTLs: to FDR-correct across all expressed genes, we further adjusted the p-values of the lead eQTLs using the p.adjust function in R with method = ‘BH’ (Benjamini-Hochberg) and n = 20,595 (corresponding to the number of expressed genes genome-wide) with a threshold of 0.05; and 3) eQTLs were identified for each significant eGene as variants with a locally adjusted p-value from step 1 &lt; 0.1.</p><p>To detect QTLs conditional on the lead eQTL, for each gene we repeated the eQTL adding the genotype from the lead eQTL as a covariate (Conditional 1).

We tested the distributions of AIF calculated using MBASED (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Mayba et al., 2014</xref>) on all samples and performed two distinct analyses. First, we tested if the 56 eGenes were more likely to have ASE by comparing their AIF in the samples where their associated lead eQTL was heterozygous with the 90 expressed MHC genes that did not have eQTLs using Mann-Whitney U test (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s4">Figure 4—figure supplement 4</xref>).

Finally, we examined all primary and conditional eQTLs (39,891 eQTL-eGene pairs tested, corresponding to 21,739 variants) to determine if eGenes in samples with heterozygous primary eQTLs had stronger AIF than samples homozygous for primary eQTLs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s5">Figure 4—figure supplement 5B</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-13"><title>Associations between eQTLs and GWAS</title><p>To test the associations between eQTL signal and complex traits and disease, we downloaded the summary statistics of 4,083 GWAS experiments from the UK BioBank (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.nealelab.is/uk-biobank">http://www.nealelab.is/uk-biobank</ext-link>).

diseases. Despite this, unravelling the relationship between genetic variation in the region and the expression of HLA and non-HLA genes with relevance to disease is a significant challenge. Here the authors have used deep sequencing of stem cells from 419 individuals to create an extensive map of regulatory variation in the MHC region, exploring genetic associations for over 4,000 different disease and traits, and uncovering links between 180 such associations with variation in the expression of specific genes. This study provides insights into the genetic architecture of the MHC region and sheds new light on the relatively underappreciated concept that non-coding, regulatory genetic variation in the MHC region can also contribute to disease risk. Therefore, this work has important implications for understanding the role of the MHC in human disease, and will be of interest to geneticists, immunologists, molecular biologists and clinical scientists.</p><p><bold>Decision letter after peer review:</bold></p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;In-depth genetic analysis of 6p21.3 reveals insights into associations between HLA types and complex traits and disease&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Mark McCarthy as the Senior Editor. The following individuals involved in review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Vivian G Cheung (Reviewer #1); Heather Cordell (Reviewer #2).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>In this manuscript whole genome sequencing is employed to obtain HLA genotypes, which are then used to in a gene expression analysis to identify the regulatory variants affecting HLA and non-HLA genes in the major histocompatibility complex region of human chromosome 6. The study implies that HLA types can predict the expression of non-HLA genes, and identifies potential clusters of co-expressed genes. As the HLA region is highly polymorphic and many of its variants have been associated with immune-based and other human diseases, an accurate approach for determining HLA genotypes from whole genome sequencing data, and an improved understanding of the impact of variants within the region on modulating gene expression, are important.</p><p>The essential revisions detailed below provide the collated comments and queries from the reviewers that need to be addressed. The reviewers were in agreement with respect to the need to give the paper a more cohesive structure, defining one or a few key questions and focusing on the most novel findings. We think that the suggestions regarding the statistical methods and the employment of simulation-based approaches are helpful and should be carefully considered. All reviewers also commented on the need to provide further support for the eQTL findings. Although we do not consider additional experimental validation to be necessary, we would like an indication of whether the eQTLs found were shared with those reported in previous studies or other available data sets. Other types of evidence that can support the eQTLs, such as the localisation of relevant variants in regulatory elements or GWAS enrichment of the variants, should also be investigated and reported.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Ideas presented in the Introduction are not taken up in the conclusion. The Introduction refers to &quot;altered self&quot; and &quot;mistaken identity&quot; hypotheses. Although the latter is taken up in the proof of principle, these terms are not used again, making the Introduction and Discussion somewhat disjointed. More generally, the paper covers a broad array of issues, but lacks focus: it was unclear exactly what the main idea is. If the focus is on demonstrating the enrichment of sites with regulatory role, a concern is that with respect to comparisons across studies with power that is non-comparable. If the idea is to defend the &quot;mistaken identity&quot; hypothesis, this needs to be taken up more thoroughly in the Discussion, given that the idea is now built upon, almost exclusively, a case study of one locus and its putative HLA-eQTL.</p><p>2) The history of HLA typing need to be amended. The text states that &quot;the development of array-based technologies provided methods to estimate HLA types at four-digit resolution&quot;. Four-digit resolution greatly predates array technologies, which were brought in late in the history of HLA typing as a means to impute four-digit alleles, given appropriate reference samples and SNP density. Similarly, the possibility of &quot;incorporating synonymous variants and non-coding regulatory variants&quot; is attributed to NGS-based methods (supported by a string of citations between 2012 and 2017) but (Sanger) sequencing and PCR-based with allele-specific primers describing these levels of variation have long been around (in fact, the data in the IMGT resource was generated by Sanger sequencing of cloned sequences). The critical step of the cited papers was in fact adapting NGS pipelines for HLA typing.</p><p>3) In Figure 4, there are 3 groups of genes (described in the subsection “Genes in the MHC region are enriched for SNP-eQTLs”): those who expression levels show association with 283 SNP alleles, those with 10 or fewer and those with more than 1,000 associations. The data shown in Figure 4 do not show the distributions of expression levels for each allele so it is not possible to tell whether the associations are driven by just a few samples. Can the authors replot some of the results with graphs where expression levels are on the y-axis, and the three genotype groups on the x-axis?</p><p>4) An important aspect of the study is the identification of &quot;four groups of genes that have alleles with highly correlated expression&quot;. This is largely supported by the results in Figure 5, which show sets of genes with significant correlations with HLA genotype (i.e., HLA-eQTL in the paper's terminology). This is a potentially interesting finding. Why was this analysis carried out in the first place? What are prior results that motivate the expectation that HLA allele identity will be predictive of expression of neighboring genes? Is this a causal mechanism or are HLA genes marking a haplotype with other genetic signatures? If documenting co-expression is of interest, why not examine it directly, rather than mediated through associations to an HLA type?</p><p>5) In the treatment of HLA-eQTLs, an interesting idea that yielded useful results, the authors chose not to examine the role of HLA genotypes on the expression of other HLA genes in the MHC region. This examination should either be expanded upon or a justification for the lack of a more extensive analysis needs to be provided.</p><p>6) The entire discussion of how levels of variability at 2 and 8 digit relate occupies a fair portion of the paper. Although essentially correct, much of the pattern seen is naturally expected given the nesting of 8 digit definitions within 2 digits. Thus, large sections of the paper relating diversity, using correlation analyses (Figure 2) and discussions of findings could be omitted. The very definition of these levels makes the patterns found and described expected. This shows up again in the discussion of concordance, where the fact that the values are higher for 2 digits is presented a result. This is unavoidable, given the nesting, which constrain the results so that the 2-digit concordance can only be the same as or greater than that at 8-digits. This is a feature of the data, not a result.</p><p>7) The paper dedicates considerable space to discussing variation among alleles. The usage of &quot;allele-specific expression&quot; as employed here does not match the usual definition, which refers to the &quot;comparing the expression of the alleles in a heterozygous individual (allele specific expression or ASE analysis)&quot; (https://doi.org/10.1186/s12864-018-5181-0). What is being done is in fact a test for differences in expression among alleles, a different question. Figure 3 treats the data as &quot;each point reporting one allele&quot;. However, in the text referring to this same analysis we read &quot;We (…) compared the TPM distributions between all samples carrying a specific HLA allele and all the other samples.&quot; This is a different analysis, since the two alleles of heterozygous individuals are confounded, both contributing to the locus-level expression. Although sometimes employed, extrapolating an individual's expression to an allele which is carried is an approach that introduces an additional source of uncertainty, which can be dealt with by analyzing the allele-level expression (since the allelic sequence in present in the index, allele-level expression could be directly compared). The paper needs to clarify what was done and justify the choices.</p><p>8) Throughout the manuscript, the authors refer to the personalized component in the index used to estimate expression levels as &quot;personalized transcripts&quot;. However, according to the Methods, cDNA sequences from the IMGT database were used instead of personalized isoform sequences. While this is a personalized index at the HLA level, it is not a personalized transcriptome-based index since transcriptomic diversity is not being assayed as in Gensterblum-Miller et al. (https://doi. org/10.4049/jimmunol.1701061).</p><p>9) The paper fails to acknowledge previous work. The statement &quot;The inability to genetically interrogate the MHC region&quot; fails to acknowledge work such as Lee et al. (https://doi.org/10.1093/bioinformatics/bty), Jensen et al. (10.1101/gr.218891.116), Aguiar et al. (10.1371/journal.pgen.1008091). Similarly, the paper states that high resolution data for high depth data has not been provided across the region, but the above papers do address this issue. Later, in Results, when discussing the use of personalized transcripts to determine gene expression levels the authors argue that &quot;the expression levels of genes in this region measured by RNA-seq may be inaccurate due to large numbers of mismatches between sequence reads and reference sequence&quot; but do not have results on this, and fail to cite papers such as Aguiar et al., 2019, which explores exactly the relationship between mismatches and accuracy of expression through simulations or more general treatments such as Panousis et al., 2014.</p><p>10) The paper presents several analyses to support the reliability of the HLA genotype calls. Initially, the study examines the SNP density interferes with alignment coverage. It then argues that values which are sequencing depths (not coverage) are comparable to other genome regions and thus claims this implies &quot;high quality&quot;. While the info on coverage and depth is useful, it is not clear that these values alone can be treated as proxies of high quality.</p><p>11) The paper also uses concordance among twins to &quot;examine the accuracy of the high-resolution HLA types&quot;. While concordance is useful to document if there are no experimental errors, it does not guarantee accuracy. For example, if there is a systematic error in the alignment procedure, the same and incorrect sample could be obtained in each case. Thus, this may be indicated as an assay to measure experimental replicability, but not accuracy.</p><p>12) The argument for an improvement in expression estimates using the personalized pipeline (subsection “Using personalized transcripts to determine gene expression levels”) is that class I estimates are higher and class II are lower, when the pipeline is used. It is unclear why this is support for greater accuracy. It would imply that the higher expression of class II with the standard reference index results in overestimates, but mismatches between that index and the individual's alleles don't make such a prediction. The fact that HLA class II genes have lower expression doesn't naturally lead to the prediction that the effect of a better index would be to lower expression. Accuracy would require some external measure of expression (which isn't available) or a simulation-based approach (as implemented in some previously cited studies).</p><p>13) The paper spends some time correlating genotype and allele frequencies, including a report of negative correlation between number of alleles and number of homozygous genotypes. The standard way to explore this is to test for deviations from Hardy-Weinberg proportions, something that can be done using various existing software packages.</p><p>14) The study also shows a correlation between allele frequencies in the two datasets. While this is comforting, it is a very coarse indicator, which at most could be reported as a supplementary result, but doesn't warrant inclusion in the body of the paper.</p><p>15) For the eQTL mapping, the authors have adjusted the expression levels for different batches, ethnicities etc, but have not controlled for the effects of population structure on the genotype data (see for example the use of PCA in Lappalainen et al., Nature, 2013). It would also be helpful to provide more details on how the samples were used in the analyses. More details on how the adjustments were made to ensure that ethnicity did not add unexpected structure to the data would be helpful. Additionally, only one of the MZ twins should be used – it is not clear that the twins were removed.</p><p>16) The authors should justify the use of the overly conservative Bonferroni correction in the eQTL mapping instead of the widely-used FDR correction in genome-wide studies. By querying the MHC region alone, the definition of significance becomes different from genome-wide studies, making contrasts between these (including the proportion of eGenes) not directly comparable. Wouldn't it be preferable to carry out a genome-wide analysis, and then use the distribution of p-values to estimate corrected values under a chosen FDR? This may give readers a better ability to place these findings in the context of previous eQTL studies.</p><p>17) The authors claim that there is an enrichment of eGenes on the MHC region by comparing with a previous genome-wide work which analyzed only a subset of the samples (215 of the 446 samples). Since sample size affects power to detect eGenes, the direct comparison is not appropriate. More generally, the notion that &quot;in the MHC region a large fraction of expressed genes are eGenes&quot; should be stated in that qualifies the identify of an eGene as contingent on the dataset. A gene can be an eGene in some studies and not others, as a function of sampling. Thus, the statement that &quot;genes in the MHC region are significantly enriched for having their expression levels modulated by regulatory variants&quot; is not supported by the analysis.</p><p>18) Further support for the eQTL findings. For some of the regulatory variants, are there any samples that are heterozygous and show that the two alleles are indeed expressed at the different levels? Were the eQTL variants enriched for localisation in regulatory sites? Were they enriched for GWAS signals and have the eGenes in question been previous linked to disease?</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.48476.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Ideas presented in the Introduction are not taken up in the conclusion.

Therefore, we have removed this analysis from the manuscript including the Results and Materials and methods, and all related figures.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7) The paper dedicates considerable space to discussing variation among alleles. The usage of &quot;allele-specific expression&quot; as employed here does not match the usual definition, which refers to the &quot;comparing the expression of the alleles in a heterozygous individual (allele specific expression or ASE analysis)&quot; (https://doi.org/10.1186/s12864-018-5181-0). What is being done is in fact a test for differences in expression among alleles, a different question. Figure 3 treats the data as &quot;each point reporting one allele&quot;. However, in the text referring to this same analysis we read &quot;We (…) compared the TPM distributions between all samples carrying a specific HLA allele and all the other samples.&quot; This is a different analysis, since the two alleles of heterozygous individuals are confounded, both contributing to the locus-level expression. Although sometimes employed, extrapolating an individual's expression to an allele which is carried is an approach that introduces an additional source of uncertainty, which can be dealt with by analyzing the allele-level expression (since the allelic sequence in present in the index, allele-level expression could be directly compared). The paper needs to clarify what was done and justify the choices.</p></disp-quote><p>We have greatly reduced the space in the text devoted to discussing expression differences among HLA types (alleles). We have eliminated all discussion of comparing alignments to reference versus cDNA sequences specific for the HLA types from the Results. We moved some of this to the supplementary figures.</p><p>We apologize for the confusion in the description of the analysis about obtaining expression levels from alignments to cDNA sequences specific for the HLA types. We have edited the Materials and methods to clarify that we treated homozygous and heterozygous individuals in different ways:</p><p>“The IMGT-IPD HLA database release 3.30.0(Robinson et al., 2016), RSEM version 1.2.20(Li and Dewey, 2011) contained cDNA sequences corresponding to each eight-digit resolution allele of the 24 HLA genes expressed in iPSCs. […] For heterozygous individuals, the TPM associated with each cDNA sequence was considered as HLA type-specific expression, while for homozygous individuals, the TPM was divided by two to obtain HLA type-specific expression levels.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>8) Throughout the manuscript, the authors refer to the personalized component in the index used to estimate expression levels as &quot;personalized transcripts&quot;. However, according to the Materials and methods, cDNA sequences from the IMGT database were used instead of personalized isoform sequences. While this is a personalized index at the HLA level, it is not a personalized transcriptome-based index since transcriptomic diversity is not being assayed as in Gensterblum-Miller et al. (https://doi. org/10.4049/jimmunol.1701061).</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that “personalized transcripts” is not the correct term to use. As discussed in response to comment 7, we have eliminated all discussion of comparing alignments to reference versus cDNA sequences specific for the HLA types from the Results. We referenced the paper by Gensterblum-Miller et al. in the Results section “Eight-digit HLA types associated with expression of cognate HLA gene”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>9) The paper fails to acknowledge previous work. The statement &quot;The inability to genetically interrogate the MHC region&quot; fails to acknowledge work such as Lee et al. (https://doi.org/10.1093/bioinformatics/bty), Jensen et al. (10.1101/gr.218891.116), Aguiar et al. (10.1371/journal.pgen.1008091). Similarly, the paper states that high resolution data for high depth data has not been provided across the region, but the above papers do address this issue. Later, in Results, when discussing the use of personalized transcripts to determine gene expression levels the authors argue that &quot;the expression levels of genes in this region measured by RNA-seq may be inaccurate due to large numbers of mismatches between sequence reads and reference sequence&quot; but do not have results on this, and fail to cite papers such as Aguiar et al., 2019, which explores exactly the relationship between mismatches and accuracy of expression through simulations or more general treatments such as Panousis et al., 2014.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewers for these comments. As part of focusing the paper we have removed all sections to which comment 9 is concerning. Nevertheless we have included references for: Jensen et al.(Jensen et al., 2017), Lee et al.(Lee et al., 2018), Panousis et al.(Panousis et al., 2014) and Aguiar et al.(Aguiar et al., 2019).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>10) The paper presents several analyses to support the reliability of the HLA genotype calls. Initially, the study examines the SNP density interferes with alignment coverage. It then argues that values which are sequencing depths (not coverage) are comparable to other genome regions and thus claims this implies &quot;high quality&quot;. While the info on coverage and depth is useful, it is not clear that these values alone can be treated as proxies of high quality.</p></disp-quote><p>In our original manuscript, we had concluded that WGS samples were high-quality because the read depth in the MHC region is comparable to the rest of the genome and that the SNP density is comparable to previous studies. This was based on the assumptions that, if the alignment were low-quality, the read depth would be lower than the rest of the genome and the SNP density distribution would be noisy and would not have the same shape as was previously observed. We understand that these assumptions are not sufficient to claim that WGS had high quality.</p><p>To address this comment, we have changed the title of the first section of the Results to “Eight-digit HLA typing” and we removed any reference to quality. We have modified the take-home message of this section to the fact that the alignment of all WGS samples is comparable to the rest of the genome and that the SNP density is similar to previous studies(Norman et al., 2017).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>11) The paper also uses concordance among twins to &quot;examine the accuracy of the high-resolution HLA types&quot;. While concordance is useful to document if there are no experimental errors, it does not guarantee accuracy. For example, if there is a systematic error in the alignment procedure, the same and incorrect sample could be obtained in each case. Thus, this may be indicated as an assay to measure experimental replicability, but not accuracy.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that concordance is not a measure of accuracy. When we describe high concordance we no longer refer to this as “accuracy” but rather “replicability” and have changed the section title in the Results section to “HLA types have high recall rates and reproducibility”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>12) The argument for an improvement in expression estimates using the personalized pipeline (subsection “Using personalized transcripts to determine gene expression levels”) is that class I estimates are higher and class II are lower, when the pipeline is used. It is unclear why this is support for greater accuracy. It would imply that the higher expression of class II with the standard reference index results in overestimates, but mismatches between that index and the individual's alleles don't make such a prediction. The fact that HLA class II genes have lower expression doesn't naturally lead to the prediction that the effect of a better index would be to lower expression. Accuracy would require some external measure of expression (which isn't available) or a simulation-based approach (as implemented in some previously cited studies).</p></disp-quote><p>We have eliminated most of the discussion on personalized expression from the manuscript. See answers to comments 7 and 8 for a description as to how we modified the manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>13) The paper spends some time correlating genotype and allele frequencies, including a report of negative correlation between number of alleles and number of homozygous genotypes. The standard way to explore this is to test for deviations from Hardy-Weinberg proportions, something that can be done using various existing software packages.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewers and have removed all the analyses describing correlations between genotypes and allele frequencies.</p><p>We have added the following to the Results:</p><p>“To estimate the accuracy of the 526 called HLA alleles we tested for Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (HWE) in the unrelated individuals and found that the vast majority (511, 97.1%) were in HWE (p &gt; 1 x 10<sup>-6</sup>, Figure 2—figure supplement 1A-C), consistent with the reproducibility values in twin pairs (96.7%) and in fibroblast-iPSC pairs (95.7%). […] Overall, HLA-VBSeq(Nariai et al., 2015) was able to accurately detect eight-digit resolution HLA alleles in the 650 WGS samples as evidenced by high recall rates, reproducibility and allele frequencies consistent with Hardy-Weinberg law.”</p><p>And added the following to the Materials and methods:</p><p>“Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (HWE)</p><p>To investigate HWE, we performed a likelihood ratio test on the allele frequency of each HLA allele independently in 275 unrelated Caucasians in the iPSCORE and HipSci cohorts. […] All associations with p-values &lt; 1 x 10<sup>-6</sup> were considered as significantly deviating from HWE and flagged in the HLA-type QTL analysis.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>14) The study also shows a correlation between allele frequencies in the two datasets. While this is comforting, it is a very coarse indicator, which at most could be reported as a supplementary result, but doesn't warrant inclusion in the body of the paper.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewers and have removed the figure showing the correlation between allele frequencies in the two datasets from the manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>15) For the eQTL mapping, the authors have adjusted the expression levels for different batches, ethnicities etc, but have not controlled for the effects of population structure on the genotype data (see for example the use of PCA in Lappalainen et al., Nature, 2013). It would also be helpful to provide more details on how the samples were used in the analyses. More details on how the adjustments were made to ensure that ethnicity did not add unexpected structure to the data would be helpful. Additionally, only one of the MZ twins should be used – it is not clear that the twins were removed.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that the use of a linear model (such as MatrixEQTL) to test for eQTLs is not appropriate when tested individuals are related. Therefore, we repeated the eQTL analysis (both on single variants and HLA types) using a linear mixed model that includes a kinship matrix to take population structure into account.</p><p>We have substantially re-written the Materials and methods to describe these analyses:</p><p>“eQTL detection</p><p>For eQTL analyses, we used the WGS from 361 individuals (215 iPSCORE and 146 HipSci, Supplementary file 2) for which iPSC RNA-seq data were available. […] We performed eQTL analysis for the 146 expressed genes and the 45,245 variants using a linear mixed model (lmekin from the coxme package in R) with a kinship matrix (to take population structure into account, including multiple ethnicities, members of the same family and twin pairs) calculated on 90,081 common SNPs distributed across the genome and in linkage equilibrium.”</p><p>We have changed Supplementary files 6, 7 and 9 with the new QTL results.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>16) The authors should justify the use of the overly conservative Bonferroni correction in the eQTL mapping instead of the widely-used FDR correction in genome-wide studies. By querying the MHC region alone, the definition of significance becomes different from genome-wide studies, making contrasts between these (including the proportion of eGenes) not directly comparable. Wouldn't it be preferable to carry out a genome-wide analysis, and then use the distribution of p-values to estimate corrected values under a chosen FDR? This may give readers a better ability to place these findings in the context of previous eQTL studies.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewers for suggesting how we could improve the eQTL analysis. In response to Comment 15, we have changed the method to perform the eQTL analysis from a linear model to a linear mixed model to account for random genetic effects, which has allowed us to use all the iPSC samples (including multiple samples from the same individual and from twin pairs) and therefore has improved our eQTL detection power.</p><p>To address the reviewers’ comments, we improved the explanation of the eQTL detection method in the Materials and methods section “eQTL detection”.</p><p>“In order to detect significant eQTLs for each eGene, and then detect eGenes at genomewide significance levels, we employed a three-step procedure to perform hierarchical multiple testing correction (Huang et al., 2018): 1) locally adjusted p-value at gene-level: nominal p-values were Bonferroni-corrected for the number of tests performed for each gene (45,245, Supplementary file 7A); the variant with the minimum adjusted p-value was considered as lead eQTL (Supplementary file 7B); 2) genome-wide adjusted p-value of lead eQTLs: to FDRcorrect across all expressed genes, we further adjusted the p-values of the lead eQTLs using the p.adjust function in R with method = “BH” (Benjamini-Hochberg) and n = 20,595 (corresponding to the number of expressed genes genome-wide) with a threshold of 0.05; and 3) eQTLs were identified for each significant eGene as variants with a locally adjusted p-value from step 1 &lt; 0.1.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>17) The authors claim that there is an enrichment of eGenes on the MHC region by comparing with a previous genome-wide work which analyzed only a subset of the samples (215 of the 446 samples). Since sample size affects power to detect eGenes, the direct comparison is not appropriate. More generally, the notion that &quot;in the MHC region a large fraction of expressed genes are eGenes&quot; should be stated in that qualifies the identify of an eGene as contingent on the dataset. A gene can be an eGene in some studies and not others, as a function of sampling. Thus, the statement that &quot;genes in the MHC region are significantly enriched for having their expression levels modulated by regulatory variants&quot; is not supported by the analysis.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that it would be misleading to compare the number of eQTLs across studies, where many other factors (most importantly, sample size) play important roles. Therefore, we have removed this statement from the text (Introduction, Results and Discussion).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>18) Further support for the eQTL findings. For some of the regulatory variants, are there any samples that are heterozygous and show that the two alleles are indeed expressed at the different levels? Were the eQTL variants enriched for localisation in regulatory sites? Were they enriched for GWAS signals and have the eGenes in question been previous linked to disease?</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewers for these suggestions. To respond to this comment we performed three additional analyses (explained below).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>For some of the regulatory variants, are there any samples that are heterozygous and show that the two alleles are indeed expressed at the different levels?</p></disp-quote><p>To respond to this comment, we performed enrichment analyses to determine if eQTLs were associated with allele-specific expression (ASE):</p><p>1) We tested if the 56 eGenes were more likely to have ASE than the other expressed genes in the MHC region. We obtained ASE data from our previous eQTL analysis on 215 iPSCORE iPSCs(DeBoever et al., 2017) and tested the distributions of major allele frequencies calculated using MBASED(Mayba et al., 2014) on all samples between the 56 eGenes and the other 90 genes expressed in the MHC region. We found that eGenes were significantly more likely to have ASE [mean allelic imbalance fraction (AIF) = 67.3%, compared with 61.9% in the other genes, p = 4.38 x 10<sup>-64</sup>, Mann-Whitney U test, Figure 4—figure supplement 4, Supplementary file 7].</p><p>2) Next, we investigated if eGenes in samples with a heterozygous lead eQTL had stronger AIF than samples homozygous for the eQTL using Mann-Whitney U test. We observed that eGenes in samples with heterozygous eQTLs (primary and conditional) have stronger ASE compared with eGenes in samples homozygous for eQTLs (39,891 eQTLs in total examined, corresponding to 21,739 variants; Figure 4—figure supplement 5A, B).</p><p>We describe these analyses in the Results (“eQTLs associated with the expression of 56 eGenes in the MHC region”), in the Materials and methods (“Associations between eQTLs and allele-specific expression in eGenes”), Figure 4—figure supplements 4 and 5.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Were the eQTL variants enriched for localisation in regulatory sites?</p></disp-quote><p>We obtained 15 ChromHMM(Ernst and Kellis, 2012) chromatin states in five iPSC lines from the Roadmap Epigenomics Consortium(Roadmap Epigenomics et al., 2015) and tested if the effect size of eQTLs changed between states.

To perform this analysis, we used the following approach:</p><p>1) For all 45,245 tested variants, we determined the overlapping chromatin mark in each of five Roadmap iPSCs;</p><p>2) We defined effect size deciles for all tested eQTLs (each eQTL-eGene pair identified by testing 45,245 variants in 146 expressed genes) and binned the eQTLs based on their effect size (Figure 4—figure supplement 3, Supplementary file 6);</p><p>3) For each Roadmap iPSC sample, we counted the number of eQTLs associated with each mark in each bin, creating a 10-by-15 matrix (10 bins and 15 chromatin marks);</p><p>4) For normalization, we divided each column by its average across all bins and log2-transformed each value (each chromatin mark was tested individually), in order to obtain enrichments centered around zero;</p><p>5) We plotted these enrichment values for each chromatin mark (Figure 4—figure supplement 3).</p><p>Figure 4—figure supplement 3 shows that, in all Roadmap iPSC samples, the eQTLs in the MHC region with the largest effect sizes were enriched for overlapping regulatory elements active in iPSCs including active transcription start sites (TSS), regions flanking active TSS, UTRs (defined as regions transcribed at 5’ and 3’) and transcribed regions.</p><p>We added a description of this analysis in the Results section “eQTLs associated with the expression of 56 eGenes in the MHC region”, in the Materials and methods section “Enrichment of eQTLs for regulatory elements” and in Figure 4—figure supplement 3.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Were they enriched for GWAS signals and have the eGenes in question been previous linked to disease?</p></disp-quote><p>We changed our approach to determine associations between eQTLs and complex traits to determine whether eQTL signals in the MHC region, rather than single variants, were associated with any of the 4,083 traits described in the UK BioBank.
