AMPA receptor (AMPAR) diffusion at synapses observed a large mobile extrasynaptic AMPAR pool. Using super-resolution microscopy, we examined how fluorophore size and photostability affected AMPAR trafficking outside of, and within, post-synaptic densities (PSDs) from rats. Organic fluorescent dyes (≈4 nm), quantum dots, either small (≈10 nm diameter; sQDs) or big (&gt;20 nm; bQDs), were coupled to AMPARs via different-sized linkers. We find that &gt;90% of AMPARs labeled with fluorescent dyes or sQDs were diffusing in confined nanodomains in PSDs, which were stable for 15 min or longer. Less than 10% of sQD-AMPARs were extrasynaptic and highly mobile. In contrast, 5–10% of bQD-AMPARs were in PSDs and 90–95% were extrasynaptic as previously observed. Contrary to the hypothesis that AMPAR entry is limited by the occupancy of open PSD ‘slots’, our findings suggest that AMPARs rapidly enter stable ‘nanodomains’ in PSDs with lifetime <underline>&gt;</underline>15 min, and do not accumulate in extrasynaptic membranes.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.27744.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Forgetting is a common experience in our everyday life. Yet much remains unknown about how we remember, and about why our memories sometimes fail us. The brain contains 80 to 100 billion nerve cells or neurons, which communicate with one another at junctions called synapses. At a synapse, one neuron releases a chemical message, which must diffuse across a small gap, and then activate proteins called receptors on another neuron. If the first neuron activates the second repeatedly, the second cell responds by inserting additional receptors into its membrane at the synapse. This strengthens the connection between the two neurons.</p><p>Strengthening of synapses is thought to be one of the key mechanisms underlying learning. To confirm this, it would be helpful to be able to monitor the movement and position of individual receptors at synapses. However, the space between the two nerve cells at at synapse, called the synaptic cleft, is no more than 40 nanometers wide. This is about 25 times thinner than a human hair, and too small to be seen with light microscopy. Electron microscopy can visualize synapses, but does not work in living tissue. The only other option is to attach a fluorescent label – either a dye or a man-made crystal called a quantum dot – to a protein found in synapses and monitor the resulting fluorescence. Though the probe must be small enough to pass through the synaptic cleft to do this.</p><p>Using fluorescence microscopy, researchers have examined the distribution in synapses of proteins called AMPA receptors, which have a key role in memory. Multiple studies have shown groups of AMPA receptors gathered outside synapses. This has led to the suggestion that during learning, AMPA receptors wait outside the synapse until a space becomes available within the synapse’s membrane. However, this has yet to be confirmed directly, in part because conventional fluorescent dyes and quantum dots are too bulky to enter synaptic clefts when bound to a receptor.</p><p>Lee et al. have now developed a quantum dot that is only 10 nanometers wide and therefore small enough to enter the synaptic cleft with an AMPA receptor attached. These small quantum dots were then used to label AMPA receptors in neurons collected from rats and then grown in a petri dish, which provided a completely new view of synapses. The images show that the majority of AMPA receptors in neurons circulate within confined domains – a little like holding pens – inside the synapse, rather than waiting outside as previously assumed. Labeling the receptors with smaller 4-nanometer-wide fluorescent tags produces a similar picture. Further work is still need to determine how AMPA receptors get into the synapse and contribute to new memories.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>AMAP receptors</kwd><kwd>synapses</kwd><kwd>super-resolution imaging</kwd><kwd>small qdots</kwd><kwd>glutamate receptor</kwd><kwd>single molecule tracking</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Rat</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>NIH NS090903</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Green</surname><given-names>William N</given-names></name><name><surname>Selvin</surname><given-names>Paul R</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000001</institution-id><institution>National Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>PHY-1430124</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Selvin</surname><given-names>Paul R</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000001</institution-id><institution>National Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>CBET-1264051</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Park</surname><given-names>Sheldon</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>NIH NS100019</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Green</surname><given-names>William N</given-names></name><name><surname>Selvin</surname><given-names>Paul R</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Small probes show that most AMPA receptors are constrained near or in the synapses.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>A major goal of cellular and molecular neuroscience is to characterize how synapses change during synaptic plasticity, the leading cellular correlate of learning and memory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Volk et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Huganir and Nicoll, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Kneussel and Hausrat, 2016</xref>). The position and dynamics of the two major ionotropic glutamate receptors (iGluRs), α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid receptors (AMPARs) and N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDARs), are critical for synaptic strength. AMPARs traffic intracellularly from sites of synthesis and assembly to exocytosis sites near synapses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Anggono and Huganir, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Henley et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Greger and Esteban, 2007</xref>). Despite much elegant work, it is still unclear what mechanisms limit AMPAR entry into and exit out of PSDs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Malinow and Malenka, 2002</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Park et al., 2004</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Wang et al., 2008</xref>). The different steps involved in AMPAR trafficking at synapses under constitutive conditions (no plasticity) are depicted schematically in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref>. As shown, AMPAR trafficking consists of its exo- and endocytosis at sites on the plasma membrane (steps 1 and 1’, respectively), diffusion to and from these sites and PSDs (steps 2 and 2’) and entry into and exit from PSDs (steps 3 and 3’). The positioning of the AMPAR endo- and exocytosis sites with respect to PSDs is uncertain with some evidence for endo- and exocytosis sites within spines relatively close to PSDs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Kennedy et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Lu et al., 2007</xref>), other evidence that the sites are on dendrite shafts outside of spines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Yudowski et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Tao-Cheng et al., 2011</xref>), and also that both locations may exist regulated by synaptic plasticity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Tao-Cheng et al., 2011</xref>). Another complication is that the recycling pathway under constitutive conditions may be different from the pathway with synaptic plasticity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Zheng et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Henley et al., 2011</xref>). This suggests that different endo- and exocytosis sites may exist under constitutive conditions versus synaptic plasticity.</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.27744.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Schematic diagrams of the dynamics of AMPARs and labeling strategies for AMPARs.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) AMPAR entry into and exit from the PSD.

Commercial or ‘big’ quantum dots (bQDs) with a diameter &gt;20 nm were observed (at least occasionally) within synaptic clefts of inhibitory synapses by electron microscopy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Dahan et al., 2003</xref>). bQDs are extremely bright, photostable and their position can be localized to within ~10 nm in the millisecond time-scale (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Pinaud et al., 2010</xref>). Studies of AMPARs tagged with bQDs led to the conclusion that 50–80% of AMPARs are extrasynaptic and highly mobile (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Groc et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Opazo et al., 2010</xref>). This significant highly mobile pool of extrasynaptic AMPARs has been proposed to exist because of the slow rate that extrasynaptic AMPARs enter PSDs. This slow rate of motion and accumulation of extra-synaptic AMPARs is thought to occur because of the limited availability of ‘slots’ in PSDs (See <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref>, route 3) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Shi et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Opazo et al., 2012</xref>). Slots are defined as placeholders for AMPARs in PSDs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Malinow et al., 2000</xref>). Once in PSD slots, AMPARs are generally assumed to be immobilized, although Nair et al. observed that AMPARs underwent constrained diffusion in what they defined as ‘nanodomains’, that is sub-synaptic regions where AMPARs are confined to (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Nair et al., 2013</xref>). New slots may become available when AMPARs exit from PSDs (route 3’) or if more slots are created or removed by different forms of synaptic plasticity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Malinow et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Shi et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Malinow, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Giannone et al., 2010</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Groc et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Heine et al., 2008</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Nair et al., 2013</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Makino and Malinow, 2009</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Opazo et al., 2012</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Henley and Wilkinson, 2016</xref>). The presence of such a large pool of mobile AMPARs on the extrasynaptic surface of dendritic membranes is thought to be an important contributor to the mechanisms that underlie synaptic plasticity such as LTP and could help synapses recover from pair-pulse depression during periods of fast synaptic transmission (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Heine et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Tao-Cheng et al., 2011</xref>).</p><p>To avoid the potential problem of using large probes, other workers have used single particle tracking (spt) of small (&lt;5 nm) fluorescent probes permanently (generally via a linkage protein) or temporarily bound to an AMPAR. One such technique is called sptPALM (spt- photoactivated localization microscopy) where an iGluR is fused with a photoactivatable fluorescent protein (pa-FP) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Manley et al., 2008</xref>). Another technique is called universal points accumulation for imaging in nanoscale topography (uPAINT) which measures an organic fluorescent probe that is temporarily bound to the receptor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Sharonov and Hochstrasser, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Giannone et al., 2010</xref>). However, there are contradictory results using these methods. Using uPAINT, AMPARs were found to be highly mobile (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Giannone et al., 2010</xref>), or stationary (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Nair et al., 2013</xref>). Using sptPALM and FRAP, another fluorescence technique, workers found that AMPARs were highly mobile. However, fluorescent proteins for sptPALM and FRAP are sensitive to both internal and external AMPAR receptors, which may obfuscate the issue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Nair et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Heine et al., 2008</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Makino and Malinow, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Ashby et al., 2006</xref>).</p><p>Determining whether AMPARs or other neurotransmitter receptors are synaptic (outside PSDs) or extrasynaptic (inside PSDs) has been difficult because of four factors: (1) Synapses are nanometer in scale below the diffraction limit of visible microscopy; (2) Most microscopy has been limited to two-dimensions, where in reality, the dimensions are three-dimensional; (3) Recombinantly tagged imaging probes cannot readily distinguish intracellular vs. cell-surface receptors; (4) Probe photostability limits the localization precision and the length of image acquisition, particularly for single-molecule studies.</p><p>Here we use 3-dimensional super-resolution microscopy on cell-surface AMPARs labeled with different-sized fluorescent probes—bQDs (&gt;20 nm), small quantum dots (sQD ≈10 nm) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Cai et al., 2014</xref>) or organic fluorophore (≈ 4 nm) in cultured neurons. These probes are highly fluorescent; bQDs are nearly infinitely photostable; sQDs are photostable for several minutes; and selected organic fluorophores can be photostable for ~1 min. We analyzed the diffusion constants, trajectories, distances from the center of PSDs, changes that occurred over time after transfection, and the role of the extracellular matrix in regulating diffusion. To better resolve PSD dimensions, we used 3-D super-resolution imaging of a PSD protein, Homer1c.</p><p>We find that &gt; 90% of AMPARs labeled with organic fluorescent dyes or sQDs are found in PSDs. Less than 10% of these labeled AMPARs are highly mobile and extrasynaptic. However, when AMPARs are labeled with bQDs, virtually all AMPARs (90–95%) are highly mobile and extrasynaptic, presumably because bQDs are sterically hindered from entry into synaptic clefts. We conclude that mobile AMPARs enter PSDs and do not accumulate in extrasynaptic membranes as previously observed in studies using the AMPARs labeled with bQDs. Our data further suggest that AMPAR entry is not regulated by a limited number of ‘slots’ where AMPARs are bound after entry into PSDs. Instead AMPARs are found to diffuse within surprisingly stable ‘nanodomains’ confining AMPARs to sites within PSDs that may regulate access to presynaptic glutamate release.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>AMPAR labeling strategy and localization</title><p>We labeled surface-expressed tagged (AP-tag or EGFP) versions of the GluA2 subunits of the AMPAR receptor.

Qualitatively, the receptors are often in nanodomains, sub-synaptic regions where the receptor is confined (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2b, f</xref>; also, Figure 4d and e). The distance between the center of Homer1c cluster to the center of the AMPAR-sQD is close: a maximum of 150±42 nm, with 75% and 91% of receptors being localized within 0.5 µm and 1.0 µm, respectively, of Homer1c.</p><p>Lastly, we also employed organic dyes to observe the diffusion of AMPA receptors in live neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2c and g</xref>; summarized in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>). This allows a direct comparison of AMPA receptors labeled with bQD and sQD and those labeled with organic fluorophores in live neurons. One advantage of the uPAINT technique using organic dyes compared to sptPALM is that the uPAINT technique only labels cell-surface receptors if cell-impermeable organic dyes are used. By choosing fairly photostable dyes, uPAINT also allows a relatively long time (limited by the photobleaching) for the motion to be measured. Here, we find that AMPARs labeled with organic-fluorophores on live cells are colocalized with Homer1c (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2c</xref>). To measure the overall population of AMPARs within one synapse, as opposed to the behavior of an individual AMPAR, we obtained super-resolution (direct-STORM) images for neuronal receptors using a heavily labeled organic fluorophore (SA-Cy3B) after fixing the neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2d and e</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Heilemann et al., 2008</xref>). Cy3B is particularly good with STORM because it can be made photoactivatable with NaBH<sub>4</sub> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Vaughan et al., 2012</xref>). Furthermore, we can label extensively with many organic fluorophores because the hydrodynamic diameter of organic fluorophores is ~1 nanometer and even when conjugated with streptavidin, they are only about 4 nm in diameter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Dikić et al., 2012</xref>). Consequently, SA-organic dyes are significantly smaller than either bQDs or sQDs or even labeled-antibodies (which are commonly used to label AMPARs). In addition, non-specific labeling was insignificant. These findings were similar to those obtained using sparsely labeled sQDs and organic dyes labeling on live neurons. Thus, by all three techniques (with sQDs, with live- and fixed-neurons labeled with organic fluorophores) we find that the localization of AMPA receptors is predominantly at the synaptic regions. In addition, we observe in these fixed samples, that there is typically one nanodomain per synapse (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2h</xref>), although multiple nanodomains do exist (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2j</xref>).</p><table-wrap id="table1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.27744.013</object-id><label>Table 1.</label><caption><title>Summary of AMPA receptor diffusion that are synaptically-bound, measured with various fluorophores and tags.</title></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th><bold>Fluorophore</bold></th><th><bold>Size (nm)</bold></th><th><bold>Tag</bold></th><th><bold>Diffusion coefficient (μm<sup>2</sup>/s)</bold></th><th><bold>Trajectory range (nm) (±width)</bold></th><th><bold>Synaptic receptors (%)</bold></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td> Big Qdot</td><td>~20</td><td>SA</td><td>10<sup>-2.5±0.02</sup></td><td>390 ± 140</td><td>5</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="3"> Small Qdot</td><td rowspan="3">~10</td><td>SA</td><td>10<sup>-2.41±0.02</sup></td><td>418 ± 172</td><td>75</td></tr><tr><td> GBP</td><td>10<sup>-2.53±0.02</sup></td><td>420 ± 170</td><td>82 (92)</td></tr><tr><td> mSA</td><td>10<sup>-2.59 ± 0.02</sup></td><td>363 ± 144</td><td>88 (84)</td></tr><tr><td> Atto647</td><td rowspan="2">~5</td><td rowspan="2">SA</td><td>10<sup>-2.55 ± 0.02</sup></td><td>380 ± 156</td><td>77 (73)</td></tr><tr><td> CF633</td><td>10<sup>-2.70 ± 0.01</sup></td><td>380 ± 140</td><td>90 (93)</td></tr></tbody></table><table-wrap-foot><fn><p>Note: The first and second number for the synaptic receptors corresponds to the percentage of AMPAR in the lower left hand box and the area under the Gaussian curve for the trajectories, respectively, as outlined in each peaks of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figures 3</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">5</xref>.

As illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3c</xref>, AMPARs in the α peak are localized outside the synaptic spine on the dendritic shaft distant from Homer1c labeling. Furthermore, the AMPARs are undergoing free diffusion confined over large (&gt;1 um) regions in the dendritic shaft. The β peak has two components, both of which are diffusing slow. 5% of all AMPARs are colocalized with PSDs labeled by Homer1c; 22% are <italic>not</italic> localized to a labeled Homer1c (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3d</xref>).

By looking at the diffusion constants, one sees a distribution of constrained diffusion: 84, 100% and 96%. Both results are in direct contrast with the results for labeling with the bQDs. In addition, the diffusion constant for AMPARs linked via SA to sQD is somewhat broader than the sQD coupled to GFP via GBP, which is somewhat broader than the mSA. (The mSA result is approximately equal to the smaller organic fluorophores—see below). This possibly implies that, although SA-sQDs are significantly better than the bQD to label AMPARs, smaller ligands (like mSA) or organic-fluorophores (coupled via SA: see below) are better to study synaptic receptors in neurons.</p><p>We find that labeling with sQD to AMPAR is not a function of DIV, as day 14 is essentially identical to day 16, for all three ligands used. This says that the diffusion time and trajectory is a <italic>not</italic> a function of time, and therefore that the time-dependence, possibly due to cross-linking and differential interaction with extracellular matrix, is not a problem for sQDs-AMPARs. This gives us confidence about our results with sQDs.</p><p>We note that heat maps tell about the range of diffusion of AMPAR, but do not give the absolute distance from the PSD. Rather it is the trajectory range of receptors which does this (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2e–j</xref>, or <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3c–e</xref>, or <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4d–g</xref>). To get whether the AMPAR is labeling near or in the PSD, we plot in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4f</xref>, the histogram of the distance of AMPAR from the center of Homer1c. The histogram shows that 75% of receptors are localized within 0.5 µm of Homer1c and 91% within 1.0 µm, generally undergoing constrained-diffusion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2d, f</xref>). This strongly implies that the great majority of AMPARs are within the PSD. This further implies that our labeling strategy using the small probes does not limit access to the synaptic cleft.</p><p>We also need to take into account those sQDs that are bound to AMPARs but not in a synapse. (For the bQDs, this was 22–5%=17%.) We find that there is 12% of labeled mSA-sQD-AMPAR undergoing constrained diffusion not around a labeled Homer1c. Whether this is due to AMPAR constrained within a PSD containing an unlabeled Homer1c, or constrained within some other domain, is not known.</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>AMPARs labeled with organic dyes coupled with SA</title><p>These results are similar to AMPARs labeled with sQDs. We labeled AMPARs using SA-Atto647N or SA-CF633 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>).

In addition, Atto647N has a positive charge and is relatively hydrophobic, whereas CF633 is negatively charged and hydrophilic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Zanetti-Domingues et al., 2013</xref>). Somewhat better, more specific labeling was shown with CF633. Overall, these factors have been found to be significant in terms of the measurement of the diffusion of membrane proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Zanetti-Domingues et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>A heat map shows that the diffusion constants and range of AMPARs are both quite small when labeled with Atto647N (post-transfection day 1 and day 3) and CF633 (post-transfection day 1) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5a and b</xref>). The results for Atto647N at various concentrations (0.1–1 nM) are similar (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2</xref>). There is a slight difference between the two dyes chosen, which indicates that CF633 might have more specific labeling. With Atto647N, fitting the trajectories regardless of the diffusion constants, there is 27% of the AMPAR which has longer trajectory range and larger diffusion constants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5a</xref>); these are not much present with the CF633 dye, where we find 93% are constrained in nanodomains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5b</xref>). Finally, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5c</xref> is the image of the main peak, α in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5a</xref>, which shows that AMPAR is not just constrained, but is constrained around the PSD. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5d</xref> indicates that 81% of AMPAR-SA-CF633 is localized within 0.5 µm of Homer1c, and this number increases to 98% within 1 μm.

In neurons, surface receptors such as AMPARs and NMDARs, possibly interact directly or indirectly with the ECM, so that the ECM may affect the lateral diffusion of surface receptors in the synapses and surrounding locations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Dityatev and Schachner, 2003</xref>). Recent studies have shown that the ECM is also involved in the mechanism of recruiting glutamate receptors through lateral diffusion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Dityatev and Schachner, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Dityatev et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Frischknecht et al., 2009</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Frischknecht and Gundelfinger, 2012</xref>). In particular, one recent study claimed that when the ECM was enzymatically removed, the extra-synaptic AMPA receptors moved at a higher diffusion rate and the exchange of synaptic receptors was increased (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Frischknecht et al., 2009</xref>). They therefore concluded that the ECM might regulate short-term synaptic plasticity.</p><p>However, the observations were on AMPARs labeled by bQDs, so their conclusions should be re-examined in light of our results above. We therefore compared AMPARs labeled with bQDs and sQDs on untreated cultured neurons and on neurons in which ECM was removed using Hyaluronidase. Recall that with bQD, in the presence of ECM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3a</xref> and dotted lines in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6a</xref>), we have two populations of AMPAR-bQD: 73% are fast moving (D ~ 10<sup>-1.20 ± 0.01</sup> = 0.063 µm<sup>2</sup>/s) over a large distance and 27% are slow moving (D ~ 10<sup>-2.0</sup> - 10<sup>-3.0</sup> µm<sup>2</sup>/s), and constrained to be approximately 0.5 μm from the Homer1C. After ECM removal, we find that the slow-moving ones (the β peak in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3a</xref> or the white dotted line in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6b</xref>) are gone. All of the remaining AMPAR-bQDs freely diffuse outside of synapses on the membrane of dendrites. In contrast, with small qdots, we observe that the average and distribution of the diffusion coefficient of AMPA receptors was almost the same before (D<sub>ave</sub>=0.015 ± 0.0006 µm<sup>2</sup>/s) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6b</xref>, dotted line) and after (D<sub>ave</sub>=0.013±0.0004 µm<sup>2</sup>/s) ECM removal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6c</xref>). Thus, sQD-tagged AMPAR diffusion is not significantly affected by the presence of ECM, presumably because virtually all of these AMPARs are confined to PSDs where diffusion is limited by interactions with PSD scaffold proteins. Only the bQD-tagged AMPARs, which are virtually all extrasynaptic, are significantly affected by ECM. These results provide an explanation for the changes that occur in the diffusion and trajectories of the bQD-tagged AMPARs going from DIV 14 to 16 in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3a and b</xref>. As the neurons develop in culture, progressively more ECM is deposited on the neuronal membrane going from DIV 14 to 16 thereby reducing AMPAR diffusion and trajectories.</p></sec><sec id="s2-8"><title>Using sQDs for longer measurements of AMPARs in PSDs</title><p>We find that AMPARs labeled with sQDs differ from AMPARs labeled with bQDs in being able to consistently enter synaptic clefts and nanodomains within PSDs.

Using AMPARs labeled with sQDs we examined the stability of AMPAR nanodomains in PSDs over 15 min, exciting the sQDs for 30 s at a time, every 5 min. A previous study observed that most nanodomains were stable for up to one hour, but some nanodomains were dynamic, appearing and disappearing within minutes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Nair et al., 2013</xref>). This other study, however, used AMPARs labeled with either organic fluorophores or recombinant fluorescent proteins, which limited the imaging to the ensemble average of AMPAR in PSDs. They were therefore unable to observe the dynamics of single receptors except for much shorter times (&lt;&lt;minute), corresponding to the photobleaching time of organic fluorophores. Here we used sQDs to study the dynamics of the nanodomains of the same AMPAR in synapses for long periods (from 15 min repeatedly, and up to 60 min occasionally) of time. A total of 126 synapses were observed.</p><p>As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>, we first located AMPARs for 30 s, immediately followed by PSD imaging using Homer 1 c super-resolution. AMPARs were then imaged three times more, every 5 min for 15 min, and PSD imaged one final time (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7a</xref>). The finite photostability of the fluorescent protein prevented the Homer1c from being monitored more than this.

As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7c and d</xref>, when imaged at the beginning (AMPAR-red, Homer1c-green) and the end of the fifteen-minute period (AMPAR-blue, Homer1c-brown), the synapse itself had changed position only slightly. To see how much the synapse had drifted over the 15 min, we aligned the images. We first made a linear adjustment, moving both the AMPA receptor trace and the Homer1c cluster about 100 nm and we then rotated the trace and cluster 19° to align them (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7c</xref>) from one perspective and from then rotated the synapse 10°, perpendicular to the first axis, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7d</xref>. With these relatively minor adjustments, the two images of the synapse nearly perfectly overlapped (right hand side of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7c, d</xref>). In addition, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7e</xref> shows that the shape of the trace of the AMPAR (~200 nm in size) observed at 0, 5, 10 and 15 min, remained quite constant. This indicates that the nanodomain, defined by the constrained area of a single AMPAR, was extremely stable for the fifteen-minute measurement period.</p><p>Occasionally, AMPAR nanodomains were observed to move within PSDs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1</xref>). Using the same protocol, the AMPAR nanodomain was first observed at the very edge of the PSD (0 min) after which the nanodomain moves further within the PSD and does not move further. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1(b–d</xref>, the shape and size of the AMPAR nanodomain changes little (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7f</xref>), and only the nanodomain position changed after the initial time-point. In one example we also imaged a highly mobile extrasynaptic AMPAR enter into a nanodomain in PSD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s2">Figure 7—figure supplement 2</xref>). As shown, the AMPAR during the initial time point is widely diffusing near a spine but outside of the PSD. During the last time 15 min time-period, the same AMPAR enters a nanodomain at the edge of the PSD. These images suggest that AMPARs immediately enter nanodomains as they arrive at PSDs after which the nanodomain can reposition within the PSD to a more stable location. In summary, due to the photostability of sQDs we have been able to characterize new details of AMPAR nanodomains and find that they are stable for significant times.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>With synaptic plasticity, the numbers of AMPARs in PSDs change. Even under basal conditions, the AMPARs are recycling and therefore constantly moving in and out of synaptic clefts and PSDs. AMPAR endocytosis and exocytosis is very likely ongoing at synapses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Greger and Esteban, 2007</xref>) and occurs at sites outside of spines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Anggono and Huganir, 2012</xref>) or within spines away from PSDs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Henley et al., 2011</xref>). Consequently, it is important to identify where highly mobile AMPA receptors are located. As we described above, currently the consensus viewpoint is that AMPARs enter PSDs from a highly mobile pool of AMPARs in the dendritic membrane, largely outside of the spine (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref>, beginning with route 1). Other evidence indicates that the site of exocytosis is in the spine (route 3). In both cases, according to this data, a large mobile pool of extrasynaptic AMPARs originates from sites in the membrane and then diffuses into the PSD (route 2).</p><p>In this study, we find very little evidence for a sizeable pool of mobile extrasynaptic receptors in or around the spines. Most of the previous evidence in support of this AMPAR pool was from studies using super-resolution bQD-tagged AMPARs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Opazo et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Giannone et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Nair et al., 2013</xref>). Indeed, we too observe this behavior with bQDs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). However, when using when AMPARs that are tagged by significantly smaller fluorophores—sQDs or organic fluorophores (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figures 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">5</xref>)—they are overwhelmingly in the synapse:~84–97% of AMPA receptors were immobilized within PSDs and only 5–16% were freely diffusing in the dendrite membrane. Consequently, we believe that bQDs are too large to enable AMPARs to enter the synaptic cleft. We therefore believe that the previous results with bQDs have been misleading.</p><p>Our results are consistent with studies using a variety of techniques that have found that AMPA receptors are largely localized to synapses and a relatively small extrasynaptic pool exists. First, electrophysiology has estimated the population of receptors in the synapses as well as in the dendrites. Cottrell <italic>et al</italic>. observed the density of AMPARs by measuring the glutamate-evoked response current through glutamate stimulating in synaptic regions or in dendrites. They observed the high current signal after glutamate stimulation in synaptic regions, but very low current signal with stimulation in extra-synaptic regions. Through comparing signal strength, they concluded that less than 1% of AMPA receptors were populated in the extra-synaptic regions after synaptogenesis by 11 days (or more) in vitro (DIV) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cottrell et al., 2000</xref>). Second, studies using fluorescence microscopy showed that AMPARs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">MacGillavry et al., 2013</xref>) were co-localized with PSD-95 in dissociated cultured neurons, indicating that they were heavily colocalized with the synaptic regions. In addition, it was reported that AMPA receptors were mostly localized at the synaptic region in hippocampal neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Passafaro et al., 2001</xref>). They observed that more than 75% of AMPA receptors, both subunits GluA1 and GluA2, were colocalized with Shank at the synaptic regions. Also, their spatial and temporal fluorescence images showed that the exocytosed receptors accumulated over time (~30 min) at the synaptic regions. Third, electron microscopy (EM) was used to show that AMPA receptors were localized at synapses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Kharazia et al., 1996</xref>), although they could also exist in extrasynaptic domains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Tao-Cheng et al., 2011</xref>), especially after synaptic excitation at exocytosis and/or endocytosis sites. All these observations indicate that most AMPARs are localized and clustered at synaptic PSDs in mature neurons.</p><p>The question arises as to why we observed so few highly-mobile extrasynaptic AMPARs. One possible reason is that in our protocol we have approximately 6 min of dead time with the addition of fluorophores and their binding to cell-surface AMPARs. It is likely many of the labeled AMPARs are diffusing into PSDs during the dead time and we do not observe them. Another possibility is that once AMPARs enter PSDs their residence time there is lengthy and we do not observe AMPARs exiting from PSDs because the rate of exit is much slower compared to the time period (usually 50 s) we use to monitor AMPAR dynamics.</p><p>We also performed experiments where we compared bQD-tagged AMPARs to sQD-tagged AMPARs with and without removing the ECM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). In this case, only the extrasynaptic bQD-tagged AMPARs, which are largely sterically hindered from entering PSDs, were affected. Previous studies found that ECM was acting as a diffusion barrier for extrasynaptic AMPARs during their membrane diffusion from extrasynaptic sites to entry into PSDs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Frischknecht and Gundelfinger, 2012</xref>). Our data is consistent with this conclusion and also supportive of our findings that show the different localization of bQD-tagged AMPARs and sQD-tagged AMPARs. The diffusion of sQD-tagged AMPARs was not affected by enzymatic removal of the ECM because they are almost all within the PSDs away from the effects of ECM removal. Diffusion of bQD-tagged AMPARs was significantly affected because they are largely highly mobile and extrasynaptic. Our findings on the bQD-tagged AMPARs are almost identical to the previous findings of others looking at the effects of ECM removal on bQD-tagged AMPARs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Frischknecht et al., 2009</xref>).</p><p>We conclude that the vast majority of AMPARs rapidly enter PSDs and are confined to sub-synaptic diffusion in nanodomains. The diffusion constant is about 10x slower than that of free extrasynaptic AMPARs. The AMPARs therefore do not accumulate in extrasynaptic membranes as previously inferred in studies using AMPARs labeled with bQDs. In previous studies, the findings that AMPARs accumulate in a highly mobile pool of AMPARs in extra-synaptic dendritic membranes suggested that this AMPAR pool existed because of limits in the numbers of AMPARs that are stabilized within PSDs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Opazo et al., 2012</xref>). According to Opazo et al., AMPARs are not stabilized within PSDs until ‘slots’, defined as PSD place-holders for AMPARs become free inside the PSD. Consequently, in this model, AMPARs build up outside of PSDs. We do not observe the highly mobile AMPAR pool when bQDs are replaced by a variety of smaller (organic and sQDs) fluorophores and linkers indicating that the highly mobile pool is an artifact of using bQDs attached to the AMPARs. Thus, the number of synaptic AMPARs does not appear to be limited by whether PSD slots are already occupied.</p><p>The picture that emerges from our data is that after entry into PSDs, AMPARs are mobile but constrained within confined sub-synaptic nanodomains that are surprisingly stable, lasting for more than 15 min. It is likely that the AMPAR entry <italic>into</italic> PSDs is more rapid than the membrane diffusion rate <italic>to</italic> the PSDs. If this were not case, there would be accumulation of a mobile extra-synaptic pool, similar to what is observed when bQDs are attached to the AMPARs. The positioning of these nanodomains is likely critical for the AMPARs to receive glutamate from the presynaptic release sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Tang et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Jeyifous et al., 2016</xref>). Our conclusion that the number of synaptic AMPARs is not limited by whether PSD slots are occupied suggests that other factors regulate AMPAR numbers in PSDs. Potential candidates for what limits AMPAR numbers in PSDs are AMPAR exocytosis rate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref>, route 1), AMPAR endocytosis rate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref>, route 3) and/or barriers such as extracellular matrix (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>) that regulate AMPAR membrane diffusion on the membrane (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref>, route 2).</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Microscope</title><p>Experiments were performed with a Nikon Ti Eclipse microscope with a Nikon APO 100 X objective (N.A. 1.49).

As we reported earlier (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Lee et al., 2012</xref>), making fiduciary-marked patterns on coverslips is a very efficient method to correct stage drift instead of using the previously favored fluorescent beads and gold nano-particles as fiduciary markers to correct stage drift. The perfectly stable fiduciary-marked patterns proved far superior to correct stage drift since it is impossible to perfectly immobilize beads or nano-particles on a coverslip surface, making it especially difficult to image live cells. More importantly, randomly spreading beads or nano-particles is a critical drawback for using them as fiduciary markers because it needs optimal number of fiduciary markers in the region of interest, whereas our fiduciary markers are a uniform pattern. Thus, the fluorescent beads and gold nanoparticles that have typically been used to correct stage drift are not effective, especially when imaging live cells.</p><p>We have previously reported that mammalian cells can be stably cultured on fiduciary-marked coverslips without any other coating or treatment; however, although we had no problems taking super-resolution images of mammalian cells with this fiduciary pattern, we were not able to culture dissociated neurons on fiduciary-patterned coverslips.</p><p>In general, poly-(L/D)-lysine coating is necessary to culture dissociated neurons on glass coverslips because the cell membranes of neurons are negatively charged. Poly-lysine coating is not sufficient for neurons to adhere the fiduciary marker coverslips. We then employed laminin to coat coverslips. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3(a)</xref>, we first coated poly-lysine after treating coverslips in oxygen plasma and then applied an additional coating of laminin on the fiduciary-patterned coverslips. We found that dissociated neurons could be stably cultured on fiduciary-patterned coverslips after coating them with both poly-lysine and laminin, sequentially, as in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3(b)</xref>. In terms of connection between neurons, we could obtain comparably good neurons on the fiduciary marked coverslip as we could culture them on the poly-lysine coated coverslip. More details to coat poly-lysine and laminin on the fiduciary marked coverslips were described in the method section.</p><p>As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3(b–d)</xref>, once neurons have been stably cultured on fiduciary-patterned coverslips, they can then be successfully transfected. Furthermore, IR illumination, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3(b)</xref>, is effective to allow clear observation of uniformly patterned fiduciary markers without affecting the visibility of fluorescence color channels. Hence, these coated fiduciary patterned coverslips are very useful to exclude stage drift, allowing for the culture, transfection, and super-resolution imaging and tracking of live neurons.</p><p>Here, to demonstrate the method for taking super-resolution fluorescence images, neurons were transfected with two plasmids, one allowing expression of the post-synaptic protein homer1 with a photoactivable fluorescence protein, mGeos or mEOS3.2, and the other allowing expression of glutamate receptors, AMPARs with AP tag to biotinylate. We then labeled the glutamate receptors using qdots conjugated with either streptavidin or anti-GFP nanobodies. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3(c)</xref>, at 530 nm ~ 700 nm of emission in wavelength, we observed fluorescence from the proteins and receptors without any auto-fluorescence from the fiduciary pattern. We could clearly observe the fiduciary pattern in the IR channel and the live cells in the visible channels, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3(d)</xref>. Fiduciary markers in the IR image are tracked, fitting the fiduciary markers using either the Gaussian or the Airy function. The IR camera electronically synchronizes with the visible camera so that the traces of fiduciary markers as recorded by the IR camera accurately calculates the stage drift at the time the cells are imaged. We can then correct the super-resolution cell images for stage drift accordingly.</p><p>The fiduciary marker trace corresponds to the stage drift. Thus, through this post-processing, we can correct for stage drift. Since fiduciary markers are stationary, stage drift can be much more accurately calculated using them than when using more conventional existing methods of calculating stage drift with fluorescent beads or gold nano-particles. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>, using fiduciary markers, stage drift can be controlled within an error of around 1 nm for x and y and 15 nm for z.</p></sec><sec id="s4-3"><title>Chromatic aberration</title><p>Another technical difficulty is chromatic aberration. The three-dimensional multi-color super-resolution imaging technique allows us to observe the interaction between two different species/types of proteins or organelles in cells; however, the color shifts that occur in different color channels is a concern to take images can be even more pronounced and problematic in super resolution images different color channels. These color shifts will cause the images to be slightly different. Even though we observe exactly the same object at different color channels, the images will be a little mismatched in different color channels. Since the refractive index of light depends on its wavelength, this chromatic aberration causes focus on an object to be detected in a little different place in each color channel. This means that we have to correct this difference chromatic aberration for studying the interaction between different proteins or organelles when using multi-color super-resolution imaging.</p><p>Most commercially available objective lenses are designed to optically minimize chromatic aberration. Based on our measurements, this optical design for objective lenses will corrects within the margin of error of about 100 nm; however, given that the spatial resolution of super-resolution microscopy is only about 20 ~ 30 nm, a margin of the error of 100 nm is a significant error. This means that achromatic optical design is not sufficient to correct chromatic aberration, especially in super-resolution imaging.</p><p>Using our method, chromatic aberration can be corrected within a margin of error of 2 nm. We accomplish this with as reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">DeWitt et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Pertsinidis et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Wang et al., 2014</xref>). In order to correct chromatic aberration, we made a nano-hole pattern on a silver- coated coverslip. Using a thermal evaporator, a glass coverslip is coated with silver at a thickness of about 100 nm using a thermal evaporator. The nanohole pattern is produced by fast ion beam (FIB) equipment, sputtering holes of about 100 nm in size every 1.5 μm. Holes are about 100 nm in diameter and are located every 1.5 μm.</p><p>We took images for the nanoholes on three at the different color channels. As shown in supporting figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s7">Figure 2—figure supplement 7(a–d)</xref>, the positions of the nanohole patterns are slightly different on each color channel. In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s7">Figure 2—figure supplement 7(d)</xref>, the red and green spots are the nanoholes in the green channel and in one of two red channels, shown by zooming in on the image of the the overlaid two color images. The significantly different position of the two sets of nanohole patterns is a result of shows the positions of red and green spots are significantly different, which is caused by chromatic aberration.</p><p>We measured the chromatic aberration between the green (GFP) 530 nm channel and red (RFP) 600 nm channel and 705 nm channels. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s7">Figure 2—figure supplement 7(e)</xref>, the average difference in the location of the nanoholes in between two the nanohole pattern on channels 530 nm and 600 nm is about 80 nanometers. We found a similar range for the difference between nanohole locations in any two of the three-color channels. This means that, when obtaining multi-color super-resolution images, the error of co-localizations of any two colors is expected possible to be at least approximately 80 nm.</p><p>Furthermore, we also evaluated the validity of the mapping functions for 3D imaging. We obtained the mapping function at a focal point of z = 0, focal point, with an error of 2 nm, and, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s7">Figure 2—figure supplement 7(e)</xref>, this mapping function can be applied is valid up to within z= ±400 nm with an error of only 4 nm. when the error is 2 nm at z = 0. Actually, we obtained the mapping function at z=200 nm, 400 nm, 600 nm, and 800 nm and, as represented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s7">Figure 2—figure supplement 7(e)</xref>, the error is a little smaller than when using the mapping function obtained at z = 0; however, since a 3 D super-resolution image using astigmatism is not discrete along the z axis, it is not easy to have mapping functions along the z axis. At focal points above 400 nm, the error dramatically increased. We obtained the mapping function at z = 200 nm, 400 nm, 600 nm, and 800 nm, as represented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s7">Figure 2—figure supplement 7(e)</xref>. At focal points above 400 nm, the error dramatically increased. Although the error is a little smaller at focal points higher on the z axis than when using the mapping function obtained at z=0, we conclude that when getting 3D images using astigmatism, the mapping function at z=0 is accurate enough to correct chromatic aberration. This is because a 3 D super-resolution image using astigmatism is not discrete along the z axis. Hence, it would be too time consuming to try to obtain more accurate mapping functions all along the z axis.</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>Cell culture and labeling</title><p>Primary hippocampal cultures were prepared from E18 rats according to UIUC guidelines as previous described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Cai et al., 2014</xref>) with the following modifications.

For labeling endogenous AMPARs using antibody, we conjugated Alexa647 NHS ester (Thermo-Fisher: A37573, Waltham, MA) with anti-GluR2(Anti-Glutamate Receptor 2 Antibody, extracellular, clone 6C4: Sigma-Aldrich: MAB397, St. Louis, MO)</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Expression and purification of mutant mSA</title><p>To express mSA, <italic>E. coli</italic> strain BL21(DE3) pLysS was transformed with an appropriate expression vector and plated on Luria Bertani (LB) agar containing ampicillin. Several colonies were selected from the plate for overnight growth at 37°C in an LB starter culture containing 200 μg/ml ampicillin. The following morning, the starter culture was diluted 100 fold into Terrific Broth (TB) containing 0.05% glucose, 0.5% glycerol, 0.2% α-lactose, 1 mM MgSO4, 900 μM biotin, and 200 μg/ml ampicillin. The cells were grown at 37°C and 300 rpm until OD<sub>600</sub> reached 0.3, at which point the shaker temperature was reduced to 20°C. Once the culture has reached OD<sub>600</sub>=0.6, IPTG was added to the final concentration of 75 μM and the shaker speed was increased to 375 rpm. After 24 hr induction at 20°C, cells were removed by centrifugation and the culture medium containing secreted mSA was collected for purification. The medium was sonicated with a 200 W sonicator (30 s on, 30 s off for 4 cycles at 50% amplitude capacity). The pH of the culture medium was adjusted to 7.5 using NaOH and imidazole was added to 10 mM. The medium was then centrifuged at 12,000 rpm for 20 min to remove any precipitates. The clarified medium was passed through a column packed with Ni-NTA Superflow Agarose pre-equilibrated in PBS and 10 mM imidazole. The column was then washed with PBS and 20 mM imidazole. Finally, the bound protein was eluted with 300 mM imidazole in PBS. The eluted protein was concentrated and buffer exchanged to 100 mM glycine buffer pH 2.3 using a centrifugal filter to remove bound biotin. Finally, the sample was buffer exchanged to PBS. Yields were estimated based on A<sub>280</sub> measurements and purity was assessed by SDS-PAGE with Coomassie staining.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Characterization of mutant mSA</title><p>All streptavidin homologs have a conserved three dimensional structure, but differences in the binding pocket residues lead to differences in biotin binding. For example, the main chain root mean squared deviation between mSA and streptavidin is 0.82 Å but there is ~10<sup>5</sup> fold difference in their binding affinities. Although extremely high affinity is not needed for labeling live cells, rapid dissociation of bound biotin interferes with detection and measurement because it results in loss of fluorescence intensity over time. As such, improving the dissociation kinetics (i.e. slowing the off rate k<sub>off</sub>) of mSA is important to develop a useful imaging reagent. We have previously demonstrated that replacing S25 with histidine reduces k<sub>off</sub> by 7.5 fold by blocking solvent entry into the binding pocket through steric hindrance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Demonte et al., 2013</xref>). Keeping water molecules out of the binding pocket is important because they compete with mSA-biotin hydrogen bonds and lead to biotin dissociation. S25 is located in the loop between β−strands 1 and 2 (L1,2), which is found at the subunit interface of streptavidin but is solvent exposed in mSA. Therefore, blocking solvent entry in mSA in part involves recreating the lost physical barrier near L1,2.</p><p>To improve the dissociation kinetics further, we modeled the binding pocket of mSA using high affinity dimer bradavidin II (Brad2), which binds biotin with K<sub>d</sub> &lt;10<sup>−10</sup> M (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Helppolainen et al., 2008</xref>). L1,2 and the binding loop L3,4 adopt nearly identical conformations in mSA and Brad2, thus allowing key residues to be reliably modeled in mSA. The Brad2 residue corresponding to mSA S25 is R17, which makes a hydrogen bond and a salt bridge with G103 and D104, respectively, to form a solvent barrier around L1,2 as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1(a, b)</xref>. Arginine is larger than serine and histidine and is therefore more effective in blocking solvent entry. To reconstruct the solvent barrier in mSA, we mutated S25 to R, and measured the dissociation rate of the mutant mSA using fluorescence polarization spectroscopy. The dissociation rate of mSA-S25R is slower than that of mSA or mSA-S25H.</p><p>Brad2 also contains F42 in L3,4 to create a hydrophobic lid over bound biotin and trap the molecule in the binding pocket. Mutating F42 to alanine significantly reduces the affinity of interaction, indicating that the hydrophobic lid also plays an important role in biotin binding. We therefore introduced the corresponding mutation T48F in mSA-S25R to create a hydrophobic binding pocket and further reduce the dissociation rate. The measured k<sub>off</sub> of mSA-S25R/T48F (mSA-RF) is 37 fold lower compared to original mSA, that is. t<sub>½</sub>=402 min, and ~5 fold lower than the best mutant to date, thst is mSA-S25H (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1c</xref>). The single point mutant mSA-T48F resulted in only limited improvement in biotin dissociation (t<sub>½</sub>=13 min), indicating that the two mutations function cooperatively. We also tested an alternative design of the hydrophobic lid with a tryptophan, mSA-S25R/T48W/D124T (or mSA-RWT), which had similarly slow dissociation kinetics, t<sub>½</sub>=330 min (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1c</xref>). Therefore, construction of solvent barriers through cooperative mutations in L1,2 and L3,4 can modulate the dissociation kinetics and improve the mSA-biotin interaction.</p><p>To demonstrate the use of new engineered mSA in cell labeling, we expressed a biotin acceptor peptide (AP) fused to CFP and a transmembrane helix (TM) on the surface of HEK293. We then added purified <italic>E. coli</italic> biotin ligase, BirA, to the cell culture to induce site-specific biotinylation of AP. The cells were fixed and labeled with mSA-RF—EGFP for imaging by confocal microscopy. The CFP positive cells were selectively labeled, suggesting high specificity of interaction between mSA-RF and biotin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1d and e</xref>). Furthermore, the intensity of EGFP fluorescence remained high after 1 hr, indicating that the interaction is stable and mSA-RF remained stably bound during measurement.</p><p>In order to verify whether SA-qdots were in fact cross-linking, we compared the diffusion coefficient of mSA-qdots and SA-qdots on the lipid bilayer at different concentrations (0.2% and 1.0%) of biotinylated lipid molecules. If a qdot binds to one biotinylated lipid molecule, the resulting labeled lipid molecule will diffuse at the same rate as a free diffusion of a lipid molecule; whereas, if a qdot binds to multiple biotinylated lipid molecules, the diffusion rate will significantly slow down as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2</xref> .</p><p>We first determined whether there is any difference in the diffusion rate of molecules labeled in three ways: (1) those labeled with normal SA-qdot conjugates formed with big qdots (one conjugate has many streptavidin and numerous binding site on SA-big qdots); (2) those labeled with normal SA-qdot conjugates formed with small qdots (one conjugate has four binding sites from the streptavidin); and (3) those labeled with mSA-qdot conjugates using monomeric streptavidin and small qdots (one conjugate has only one binding site). We hypothesized that normal streptavidin conjugates with both small and big qdots would be much more likely to bind multiple biotins than would be the case with mSA conjugates. We found this to be the case, as represented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4—figure supplement 3</xref>. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4—figure supplement 3</xref> shows that there was little difference in the diffusion rate of molecules labeled with normal SA-qdots, whether conjugated with small or big qdots: there were a large number of slow diffusive qdots for both normal streptavidin conjugates, indicating that they had cross-linked to multiple molecules, even at the 0.2% biotin concentration shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4—figure supplement 3</xref>. At 1.0% biotin, there was even a larger population of slow diffusive qdots, that is, cross-linked qdots. By contrast, in the case of mSA qdot conjugates, we found that most qdot conjugates were freely diffusive at 0.2% as well as at 1.0% biotin concentration; that is, mSA-qdots do not show a slow diffusive population of labeled molecules at either 0.2% or 1.0% concentrations. These observations showed that normal streptavidin frequently cross-links to multiple molecules while monomeric streptavidin did not.</p><p>In order to further examine cross-linking of normal and monomeric streptavidin, we compared the run length of kinesin (K432, biotin at C-terminus). It is well known that when the cargo (in this case the streptavidin-qdot conjugate) binds to multiple motor proteins, the cargo will be transported over a longer distance than when the cargo binds to a single motor protein. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Beeg et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Furuta et al., 2013</xref>) A single motor protein transports cargo approximately 1 um, while multiple motor proteins can walk farther than 1 um. Thus, if we compare the run length of kinesin using SA-qdots and mSA-qdots at different ratios of kinesin and qdots, then we can examine the possibility that one qdot is binding to multiple proteins versus binding to a single protein. For accuracy of labeling, we want to confirm that binding is to a single protein and a shorter kinesin run length will indicate this.</p><p>In the case of mSA-qdots, we found the run length was the same as that of a single kinesin at a ratio of 2:1 (two kinesin molecules to one qdot). As expected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s4">Figure 4—figure supplement 4</xref>), the run length was not changed even when the ratio of kinesin to qdots was increased to 6:1. This means that mSA-qdots do not bind to multiple motor proteins. By contrast, in the case of SA-qdots, the run length of kinesin was more than the typical run length of kinesin, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s4">Figure 4—figure supplement 4</xref>. Even at a ratio of 2:1, the histogram of run lengths shows that some kinesin walked longer than the typical kinesin run length. At 6:1, we found that the run length significantly increased, indicating cross-linking. These results mirror the results we obtained in our first experiment about diffusion rates of labeled molecules in the lipid bilayer.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Track AMPA receptors</title><p>After focusing the sample in bright field, the Perfect Focus System was activated to minimize the sample drift in z direction.

A Matlab code was used to recover the trajectories of the QDs. In brief, the code finds locations of QDs in time t, and searches for nearby QDs in time t+1 as the next point on the trajectory. In the 3-D single particle tracking experiment, the maximum displacement of a QD in one time step is set to be 1 μm. The trajectory range was obtained by calculating the range of the trajectory in the x-, y-, and z- direction, and using the maximum of the three parameters. The diffusion coefficients from the trajectories were calculated in Matlab by fitting the first 4 points of mean-square-displacement curve. For the PALM data, positions of proteins detected in each frame are localized, cluster analysis was used for identify synapses. To determine if a trajectory was synaptic, the centers of synapses were determined, and trajectories within 2 μm radius of each synapse were identified. For each of these trajectories, the average distance was calculated between the center of the nearest synapse and all points on the trajectory. Any trajectories with an average distance smaller than 0.55 μm were considered synaptic.</p><p>The visualizations of post-synaptic densities and sQD labeled AMPA/NMDA receptor tracking trajectories were created using VMD 1.9.2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Humphrey et al., 1996</xref>), a widely-used program for visualizing and analyzing macromolecular structures and molecular dynamics (MD) simulation trajectories.

Or do they represent bonafide release sites?</p><p>Reviewer #2:</p><p>This paper investigates the role of label size in controlling the distribution and dynamics of tagged surface receptors, here in particular the AMPARs. Position and dynamics of these receptors are critical in many aspects of neuroscience. The general theme that antibody-labeled receptors may not enter synapses has been present in the field for many years, but a thorough and systematic examination of the problem has not been published. A few comparisons among probes have been published, typically showing at least a mild size-dependence of synaptic diffusion coefficient, and concluding that small tracking tags are to be preferred. Thus, there is ample value in continued searching for the ideal probes.</p><p>The particular value of quantum dots may warrant special treatment, since they have been revolutionary in driving discovery and characterization of protein motion in and on cells. However, their predominance in single-particle tracking studies recently has been substantially lessened with the advent of brighter, more stable dyes and the proliferation of alternative labeling methods. For instance, QD photostability underlies their prime utility, but this paper like others obtains high-resolution tracks based on Atto dyes. The ~10 nm precision achieved in typical experiments here is only slightly better than for the best dyes; much of that error stems inevitably from protein motion and other aspects of the imaging strategy not from error that could be overcome with more signal photons. Thus, the impact of the paper is undermined by the fact that the authors present no particularly compelling reason to use QDs over other label types.</p><p>Fundamentally, the data in the paper are weak in that it appears that most results were obtained from single example neurons. For instance, the 2566 trajectories from the one bQD neuron in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref> are by no means independent measurements.</p><p>Related, the idea that a change in diffusion from 1 to 3 days transfection is at best indirect evidence of cross-linking. Won't the difference in α vs β peak height difference be extremely sensitive to the proportion of the imaged area of the dendrite occupied by synapses? Isn't a difference thus expected during this developmental period of intense synaptogenesis? Because this varies widely between cells, this can only be addressed more systematically than is done here.</p><p>If the major point is to compare large and small QDs, can't the two probes be applied together and imaged in the same neurons at the same time? This would give much higher confidence in any differences observed.</p><p>Reliance on overexpressed AMPARs undermines the potential relevance of the conclusion. We do not know how the expressed receptors recapitulate, avoid, or interfere with the expression pattern of endogenous receptors.</p><p>Problems associated with the size of the quantum dot and the ability of a multi-liganded label to oligomerize should not be conflated. Small, polyvalent labels can cross-link receptors yet presumably can enter the synapse well.</p><p>The paper is riddled with grammatical and language errors and is far from suitable for publication. It will require extensive editing before any new submission.</p><p>Reviewer #3:</p><p>The purpose of this study is to determine whether AMPARs are delivered to the synapse by lateral diffusion or exocytosis. This study uses extracellularly tagged GluA2 to track the movement of AMPARs and determine their ability to localize at synapses. They use different sized tags to determine what effect this has on synaptic trafficking. Not surprisingly they find that large QDs impede synaptic trafficking more than small QDs. It is unclear to me how the authors use this data to argue that synaptic AMPARs are delivered by exocytosis. The logic escapes me.</p><p>There has been a lot of work using QDs carried out by the Choquet lab. The authors fail to discuss this work adequately. Do they agree with this work or not. The author's cite a few old papers to support their conclusion that there are few nonsynaptic AMPARs. However, there are many papers that unequvically show the existence of endogenous AMPARs on extrasynaptic mambranes. For instance, there is EMgold (e.g., Tao-Cheng et al., 2011), outside out dendritic patches (e.g., Andrasfalvy et al., J. Physiol. 552: 35, 2003) and 2P glutamate uncaging on dendritic shafts (e.g., Soares et al., J. Neurosci. 2013).</p><p>[Editors’ note: what now follows is the decision letter after the authors submitted for further consideration.]</p><p>Thank you for resubmitting your work entitled &quot;Super-resolution Imaging of Synaptic and Extra-synaptic Pools of AMPA Receptors with Different-sized Fluorescent Probes&quot; for further consideration at <italic>eLife</italic>. Your revised article has been favorably evaluated by Richard Aldrich as Senior editor and three reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors.</p><p>The manuscript has been improved but there are some remaining issues that need to be addressed before a final decision can be made, as outlined below:</p><p>1) Overall, the presentation is rather impenetrable. The key comparisons are spread over the paper, presented confusingly, and are diluted by unrelated details. A tendency to state important results as true without quantitative support is still also a weakness here. A serious effort should be made to improve the flow of the paper and presentation of the data and conclusions.</p><p>2) Data was added in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>, but 5D vs 5E are so obviously different that it undermines the conclusion that they are the same in the way the authors stress. If these images were analyzed in the same way, how could one distribution cut off abruptly at ~1 μm where the other extends smoothly to 2 um? Plus, there's obviously a prominent peak at ~0.4 μm in 5D that is absent in 5E. Isn't this critical to interpreting the distribution of receptors or the performance of the labeling strategies? Sure, the general point holds and supports the general conclusion, but to baldly state that they are the same when they in fact are quite different really suggests that the authors haven't evaluated this question very critically.</p><p>3) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref> was added, which is interesting and a good use of the QDs. The volume illustrations in panels C, D, E are nearly uninterpretable, though, since the overlays become almost black. Is there evidence that the receptor imaged in different epochs really is the same receptor? Surely there must be some exchange, increases, or decreases in number over 15 min. More seriously, there is little attempt to use the approach to evaluate some of the key questions that it raises, and it boils down mostly to a couple of anecdotes rather than a serious contribution.</p><p>4) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref> also provides a new but confusing operational definition of a nanodomain (paragraph three in subsection “Using sQDs for longer measurements of AMPARs in PSDs”). A nanodomain in Nair and MacGillavry is a delineated subsynaptic region where receptors are denser than elsewhere in the synapse. Through most of this paper, &quot;nanodomain&quot; is used pretty much synonymously with &quot;synapse&quot; since there's no attempt to distinguish subregions of the synapse and no effort at quantifying high or low areas of receptor density. Indeed, the size of the &quot;nanodomain&quot; in 7F is probably close to or equal to the entire synapse. Then in 7 to suggest that where one receptor is present for long periods is the same as one of those other nanodomains is confusing and I believe premature. I think it would be of interest to determine whether further analysis of the sQD tracking can help relate these terms to one another, but that surely would be many experiments and is well beyond the scope of this paper; instead, please avoid the confusion entirely and not use &quot;nanodomain&quot; so liberally particularly in this section of the paper.</p><p>5) There is no definition of &quot;constrained&quot; diffusion in the paper, either mathematically or otherwise. Surely slow is not the same thing as constrained, as implied in subsection “AMPAR-labeling: Diffusion constants and trajectory range”? Don't the authors want to distinguish between &quot;confined&quot; and slow, and to measure the confinement radius? Or is &quot;constrained&quot; just defined as being &quot;pretty slow and pretty short range&quot;?</p><p>6) The first conclusion in the Discussion (receptor distribution around spines) is not even dealt with directly in the paper; no effort is made to measure density on spines, and no number is even given for the total proportion of receptors outside synapses-only the proportion of those that are outside the synapse but within 2 um.</p><p>7) There is an extensive literature using FRAP and optical antagonists to deduce receptor mobility, and this should be evaluated in light of the current results as well. FRAP results have shown mobile fractions ranging from 10 to 90% and have been key support for the idea that receptors continually exchange and diffuse into the synapse during LTP.</p><p>8) The final paragraph of the Discussion contains many premature statements.</p><p>– The PSD slot hypothesis long predates Opazo, Sainlos and Choquet, 2012. It stemmed from electrophysiological observations following molecular manipulations, not from imaging results.</p><p>– The slot hypothesis even as stated in Opazo does not predict that AMPARs cannot enter the PSD-it merely states that there is no way for synapses to anchor and retain them if they do enter.</p><p>– It is unclear why a small pool of extrasynaptic receptors suggests that there are or are not slots.</p><p>– The presence of clustered receptors in the synapse also does not seem to bear on whether a saturable molecular complex is involved in retaining them.</p><p>– If the authors wish to argue that mobility itself is a sign that slots do not exist, they need to make that argument more carefully and thoroughly. Isn't a receptor bound to almost any component of the PSD likely to be nearly completely immobilized?</p><p>– What's the difference between a slot and a place within the synapse where a receptor is constrained from leaving?</p><p>9) A comment from the original second reviewer seems to have been somewhat poorly answered: &quot;Fundamentally, the data in the paper are weak in that it appears that most results were obtained from single example neurons. For instance, the 2566 trajectories from the one bQD neuron in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref> are by no means independent measurements.&quot;. The authors reply that &quot;The data is from independent measurements made from a minimum of 6 different areas per coverslip and 4 independent culture preparations. So the 2566 trajectories mentioned, in fact, are truly independent measurements.&quot; This reply is not fully correct. The 2566 trajectories are not truly independent from each other – surely at least some trajectories come from the same series of images (movies). The authors should make more efforts to point out how many trajectories were analyzed per movie, and how many movies they analyzed, from how many coverslips, and from how many independent cultures.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.27744.036</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p>[Editors’ note: the author responses to the first round of peer review follow.]</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1:</p> <p>This work suggests that AMPA receptors are primarily localized to individual to synapses rather than diffusing in the membrane of the dendrite outside synapses.</p> <p>Major concerns:</p> <p>1) Expression level of GluA2.

Furthermore, the staining with live and fixed cells is similar providing further evidence that with fixation we are not labelling intracellular aggregates of AMPARs.

We consider that this is confirmatory of our sQD data. We got 3D high-precision data, which is significantly better than any other data. Note that achieving 3D data requires more photons than simply 2D, so the extra photons are desired. Furthermore and most importantly, sQDs still have much better photostability as compared with any organic fluorophores, and that enabled us to perform imaging experiments where we tracked the same single particle for over 15 minutes.

We explained why we select to transfect GluA2 and Homer1c which are minimized the affect of overexpression. In terms of cross-linking, as answered above, we deemphasized the possibility of cross-linking. (Whatever the reason for the time-dependence with bQD, it is completely gone with the sQDs and the organic fluorophores.) In addition, in order to show the advantage to use or develop small qdots, we added the new data which is the long-term measurement of AMPA receptors as in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplements 1</xref>,<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s3">3</xref>.

Briefly, our main disagreement with the Choquet lab is the interpretation of the work using bQD-tagged AMPARs. We obtain basically the same results tracking bQD-tagged AMPARs as the Choquet lab. They have interpreted the results as indicating that most AMPARs are located outside of PSDs in a highly mobile pool. We disagree with this interpretation because additional experiments performed in our manuscript here, using either sQD-tagged AMPARs or AMPARs tagged with even smaller organic fluors, gave very different results. We have interpreted all of the results as indicating that most AMPARs are located within of PSDs showing constrained diffusion in AMPAR nanodomains. Furthermore, we interpret the opposite results obtained with bQD-tagged AMPARs as indicating that the bQDs act to hinder AMPAR entry into PSDs.</p><p>We are not claiming that all AMPARs are found in PSDs. There is clearly ~10% of the AMPARs that are extrasynaptic and some of these are likely highly mobile AMPARs diffusing from site of exocytosis to PSDs and from PSDs to sites of endocytosis. As we explain in the Discussion, our data in good agreement with the papers cited by the reviewer and “the existence of endogenous AMPARs on extrasynaptic membranes.”</p><p>[Editors' note: the author responses to the re-review follow.]</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The manuscript has been improved but there are some remaining issues that need to be addressed before a final decision can be made, as outlined below:</p> <p>1) Overall, the presentation is rather impenetrable.

A tendency to state important results as true without quantitative support is still also a weakness here. A serious effort should be made to improve the flow of the paper and presentation of the data and conclusions.</p> </disp-quote><p>We have made a number of detailed, but important changes, which we hope will make the paper easier to read. In particular, we now define the term “nanodomain” as sub-synaptic domain: they are <italic>not</italic> at all equivalent to “synaptic” domains, where the AMPARs tend to diffuse in. This is the same definition used by Nair et al.,2013, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>, may have added to this confusion because it wrongly implied that these nanodomains were sometimes the same size of the synapses. (They are smaller.) We have also defined “slots” according to their original definition by Malinow. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref> is also somewhat changed. We have hopefully clarified the conclusions of the paper, using these more-clear definitions.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Data was added in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>, but 5D vs 5E are so obviously different that it undermines the conclusion that they are the same in the way the authors stress. If these images were analyzed in the same way, how could one distribution cut off abruptly at ~1 μm where the other extends smoothly to 2 um?

Sure, the general point holds and supports the general conclusion, but to baldly state that they are the same when they in fact are quite different really suggests that the authors haven't evaluated this question very critically.</p> </disp-quote><p>The data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figures 5D and 5E</xref> show that the distances between Homer1 and the receptors when analyzed using the same software but using different fluorophores and live versus fixed neurons. As we described in subsection “Using sQDs for longer measurements of AMPARs in PSDs” of the main text, Atto647N created more background noise than did CF633, perhaps caused by the charge and hydrophobicity of the two dyes: Atto647N is positively charged and hydrophobic, whereas CF633 is negatively charged and hydrophilic (Zanetti-Domingues et al., 2013). Also, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref> shows measurement taken of live neurons, while <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref> shows measurement from fixed neurons. We believe the broader distribution shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref> is the result of the dyna mics inherent in live neurons, with Atto647N showing a bit broader distribution of ~ 0.3 or 0.4 due to the noisiness of the data. In order to better show the substantial similarity between <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref> and the results obtained from cleaner data and fixed neurons shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>, we have changed <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref> to show the results using CF633 as the main figure and the results using the Atto647N dye in inset.

Is there evidence that the receptor imaged in different epochs really is the same receptor? Surely there must be some exchange, increases, or decreases in number over 15 min. More seriously, there is little attempt to use the approach to evaluate some of the key questions that it raises, and it boils down mostly to a couple of anecdotes rather than a serious contribution.</p> </disp-quote><p>In response to your comment, we have increased the brightness of the images shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figures 7D and 7E</xref> to improve the quality particularly in the overlay areas. We have changed <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref> substantially so it is clear what is the movement due to the synapse moving (which is small) and what is the size of the nanodomain. It is now clear that the nanodomain is just a small segment of the synapse. In order to clarify that we observed the same receptors over 15 minutes and that they were not jumping around, we have also added <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s3">Figure 7—figure supplement 3C</xref>. For this experiment, we used a very low concentration of qdots to label receptors, and found that we were able to observe the total distribution of labeled qdots, tracking each individual receptor throughout the entire time frame. There was almost no change in the position of receptors during each 30 second period as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>, and there was no change of the position of labeled receptors in any 5 minute period, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s3">Figure 7—figure supplement 3C</xref>. This indicates that we observed the same receptor throughout the measurement period. We agree that there must be exchange, increase, or decrease in the number of receptors over time, but it is not very clear yet how fast and frequently the number of receptors changes. Our observation implies that in the basal condition, there is minimal change in the number of AMPARs. The ability to see a single receptor over an extended period of the time shows the superiority of small qdots to observe the dynamics of post-synaptic receptors after LTP or LTD induction.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref> also provides a new but confusing operational definition of a nanodomain (paragraph three in subsection “Using sQDs for longer measurements of AMPARs in PSDs”). A nanodomain in Nair and MacGillavry is a delineated subsynaptic region where receptors are denser than elsewhere in the synapse. Through most of this paper, &quot;nanodomain&quot; is used pretty much synonymously with &quot;synapse&quot; since there's no attempt to distinguish subregions of the synapse and no effort at quantifying high or low areas of receptor density. Indeed, the size of the &quot;nanodomain&quot; in 7f is probably close to or equal to the entire synapse. Then in 7 to suggest that where one receptor is present for long periods is the same as one of those other nanodomains is confusing and I believe premature. I think it would be of interest to determine whether further analysis of the sQD tracking can help relate these terms to one another, but that surely would be many experiments and is well beyond the scope of this paper; instead, please avoid the confusion entirely and not use &quot;nanodomain&quot; so liberally particularly in this section of the paper.</p> </disp-quote><p>We apologize for this confusion. We do not intend to use nanodomain as a synonym for “synapse”. As the editor pointed out, a nanodomain means the sub-synaptic region where receptors are highly clustered, but it also means the region where receptors are constrained by scaffold (or slot) proteins. In this paper, we used “nanodomains” as the region where a receptor was constrained. We have clarified our use of the term, as discussed in the main text of the letter above. In this study, we focused on observing the dynamics of a single receptor. Although it is possible to analyze the density of fixed neurons as added in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s4">Figure 5 —figure supplement 4C</xref> (the histogram of the AMPAR density), we were not concerned with the density of receptors in this study. Even with fixed neurons, it is not easy to measure the absolute total number of labeled receptors. Fundamentally, when getting super-resolution images, the blinking of dyes is not a single event for each fluorophore and it is not possible to label 100% of the receptors, and it is not relevant to the aim of this research. Hence, we avoid discussing the density of receptors, and instead clarify our definition of nanodomains.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) There is no definition of &quot;constrained&quot; diffusion in the paper, either mathematically or otherwise. Surely slow is not the same thing as constrained, as implied in subsection “AMPAR-labeling: Diffusion constants and trajectory range”? Don't the authors want to distinguish between &quot;confined&quot; and slow, and to measure the confinement radius? Or is &quot;constrained&quot; just defined as being &quot;pretty slow and pretty short range&quot;?</p> </disp-quote><p>Our definition of &quot;constrained&quot; diffusion is that diffusing AMPARs are restricted to a subdomain by interactions with scaffold or slot proteins. Hence, we added this to subsection “AMPAR-labeling: Diffusion constants and trajectory range “, with references (Shi et al., 2001; Opazo, Sainlos and Choquet, 2012). We certainly want to distinguish between confined and slow. This is the reason why we plotted both the diffusion coefficient and the trajectory range of AMPARs in the two-dimensional heat map. In the two-dimensional heat maps, the lower left area shows confined receptors.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) The first conclusion in the Discussion (receptor distribution around spines) is not even dealt with directly in the paper; no effort is made to measure density on spines, and no number is even given for the total proportion of receptors outside synapses-only the proportion of those that are outside the synapse but within 2 um.</p> </disp-quote><p>As we mentioned in response to comment #4 above, we measured the dynamics of receptors at the single molecule level, so that this measurement is not a way of analyzing the density of receptors on spines. As we stated, it was previously thought that the extra-synaptic AMPA receptors are the main pool for providing receptors to the synapses, but our data suggests that the previous finding of large pools of extra-synaptic receptors was an artifact due to big size qdots. Indeed, we reproduced those results with large qdots, which we clarified this in subsection “AMPARs labeled with bQD coupled with SA are largely highly mobile and extrasynaptic”. Then in subsection “AMPARs labeled with sQD by different linkers (SA, GBP, or mSA)”, we clarified that we did not find large pools extra-synaptically when we used small qdots. In each case, our summary of results with bQDs and sQDs is followed by explanation of our experimental methodology and results.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7) There is an extensive literature using FRAP and optical antagonists to deduce receptor mobility, and this should be evaluated in light of the current results as well. FRAP results have shown mobile fractions ranging from 10 to 90% and have been key support for the idea that receptors continually exchange and diffuse into the synapse during LTP.</p> </disp-quote><p>Yes, we are aware of this previous literature. Almost all studies using FRAP used expressed proteins such as AMPAR subunits with fluorescent proteins tags. A concern that we have with these studies is the difficulty in distinguishing whether the proteins are located in an intracellular organelle or on the cell surface. Thus, we think it is not a reliable method to measure the dynamics of surface AMPARs. For readers, we added more references in the third paragraph of the Introduction section.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>8) The final paragraph of the Discussion contains many premature statements.</p> </disp-quote><p>We apologize for a lack of clarity about the definition of AMPAR PSD slots and some of our statements about these slots. We have rephrased the relevant parts of the Abstract, Introduction and the last paragraphs of the Discussion, to make this issue clearer. Of most relevance is the hypothesis of other workers that the accumulation of mobile, extrasynaptic AMPARs is caused by the occupancy of AMPAR slots in PSDs. Our findings that this pool of extrasynaptic AMPARs is absent indicates that previous observations of a large mobile extrasynaptic AMPAR pool is an artifact of using big quantum dots.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– The PSD slot hypothesis long predates Opazo, Sainlos and Choquet, 2012. It stemmed from electrophysiological observations following molecular manipulations, not from imaging results.</p> </disp-quote><p>We agree that the PSD slot hypothesis predates Opazo, Sainlos and Choquet, 2012 and have added additional references to reflect this fact.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– The slot hypothesis even as stated in Opazo does not predict that AMPARs cannot enter the PSD-it merely states that there is no way for synapses to anchor and retain them if they do enter.</p> </disp-quote><p>We completely agree with the reviewer and have changed the writing so this no longer is an issue.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– It is unclear why a small pool of extrasynaptic receptors suggests that there are or are not slots.</p> </disp-quote><p>We apologize for the confusion and have rephrased the Abstract so that there is no longer reference to the existence of slots.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– The presence of clustered receptors in the synapse also does not seem to bear on whether a saturable molecular complex is involved in retaining them.</p> </disp-quote><p>Again, we agree with the reviewer and hope that the rewriting has addressed this concern.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– If the authors wish to argue that mobility itself is a sign that slots do not exist, they need to make that argument more carefully and thoroughly. Isn't a receptor bound to almost any component of the PSD likely to be nearly completely immobilized?</p> </disp-quote><p>As stated immediately above, we do not want to argue whether slots do exist or not</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– What's the difference between a slot and a place within the synapse where a receptor is constrained from leaving?</p> </disp-quote><p>We simply suggest that sQDs show that receptors are, contrary to previous research with bQDs, in the synaptic regions. See subsection “AMPARs labeled with sQD by different linkers (SA, GBP, or mSA)”. We do not know nor claim that the reason is that there are slots or other places within the synapse that constrains the receptors</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>9) A comment from the original second reviewer seems to have been somewhat poorly answered: &quot;Fundamentally, the data in the paper are weak in that it appears that most results were obtained from single example neurons. For instance, the 2566 trajectories from the one bQD neuron in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref> are by no means independent measurements.&quot;. The authors reply that &quot;The data is from independent measurements made from a minimum of 6 different areas per coverslip and 4 independent culture preparations. So the 2566 trajectories mentioned, in fact, are truly independent measurements.&quot; This reply is not fully correct. The 2566 trajectories are not truly independent from each other – surely at least some trajectories come from the same series of images (movies). The authors should make more efforts to point out how many trajectories were analyzed per movie, and how many movies they analyzed, from how many coverslips, and from how many independent cultures.</p> </disp-quote><p>We added this information in figure legends of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">6</xref>, e. g., “6 cells, 4 independent dissociation, 1 dissociation per week”</p></body></sub-article></article>
