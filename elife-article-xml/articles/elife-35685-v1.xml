When proliferation cessation is irreversible, cells are senescent. By contrast, if the arrest is only temporary, cells are defined as quiescent. These cellular states are hardly distinguishable without triggering proliferation resumption, hampering thus the study of quiescent cells properties. Here we show that quiescent and senescent yeast cells are recognizable based on their mitochondrial network morphology. Indeed, while quiescent yeast cells display numerous small vesicular mitochondria, senescent cells exhibit few globular mitochondria. This allowed us to reconsider at the individual-cell level, properties previously attributed to quiescent cells using population-based approaches. We demonstrate that cell’s propensity to enter quiescence is not influenced by replicative age, volume or density. Overall, our findings reveal that quiescent cells are not all identical but that their ability to survive is significantly improved when they exhibit the specific reorganization of several cellular machineries.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>quiescence</kwd><kwd>senescence</kwd><kwd>mitochondria</kwd><kwd>aging</kwd><kwd>actin</kwd><kwd>proteasome</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>S. cerevisiae</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001665</institution-id><institution>Agence Nationale de la Recherche</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>ANR-12-BSV6-0001</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Laporte</surname><given-names>Damien</given-names></name><name><surname>Sagot</surname><given-names>Isabelle</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004794</institution-id><institution>Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Laporte</surname><given-names>Damien</given-names></name><name><surname>Gouleme</surname><given-names>Laëtitia</given-names></name><name><surname>Sagot</surname><given-names>Isabelle</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100006251</institution-id><institution>Université de Bordeaux</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Laporte</surname><given-names>Damien</given-names></name><name><surname>Gouleme</surname><given-names>Laëtitia</given-names></name><name><surname>Jimenez</surname><given-names>Laure</given-names></name><name><surname>Khemiri</surname><given-names>Ines</given-names></name><name><surname>Sagot</surname><given-names>Isabelle</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Mitochondria morphology can be use to identify quiescent and senescent yeast cells.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>All cells integrate a complex combination of environmental cues and intracellular signals before committing to a new round of cell division. If these composite indicators are unfavourable to proliferation, the cell has several potential fates. First, it may enter quiescence, a reversible, non-dividing cellular state. As such, quiescent cells not only have to remain viable over time, but also have to maintain their proliferation capacity. Alternatively, a cell may enter senescence, a state in which cells remain metabolically active but will never divide again (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Campisi and d'Adda di Fagagna, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Blagosklonny, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">O'Farrell, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Valcourt et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Cheung and Rando, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Salama et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Terzi et al., 2016</xref>). Ultimately, cells die, either accidentally or in a programmed manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Nomenclature Committee on Cell Death 2009 et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Galluzzi et al., 2012</xref>). Consequently, within both unicellular organism colonies and eukaryotic tissues, cell populations are highly heterogeneous and composed of dividing, quiescent, senescent and dead cells. This heterogeneity is further complicated by the fact that with time, cells age. Cellular aging is viewed as a combination of genetically encoded processes and an accumulation of irreversible macromolecular damages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">López-Otín et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Kowald and Kirkwood, 2016</xref>). In fact, two aging paradigms have been defined. The replicative age is the number of divisions a cell can potentially undergo before entering senescence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Mortimer and Johnston, 1959</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Hayflick and Moorhead, 1961</xref>). The chronological age is the time a non-proliferating cell remains viable and capable of giving rise to a progeny (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Fabrizio and Longo, 2003</xref>), quiescent cells being by definition the archetype of chronologically aging cells.</p><p>To decipher the complex interplay between cell proliferation, quiescence, senescence and cell death, and understand the impact of cellular aging, each cell category has to be identified and eventually tracked in space and possibly in time. This is a formidable technical challenge, particularly because quiescent cells can currently only be identified <italic>a posteriori,</italic> after experimentally testing their capacity to re-proliferate. Therefore, there is a crucial need for criteria recognizable in living cells that robustly correlate with the fate of non-dividing cells at the individual-cell level.</p><p><italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> has been a powerful model for studying cellular aging. In this eukaryote, a single environmental change can induce various individual responses, even in a clonal population (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Honigberg, 2016</xref>). For example, when a yeast population exhausts one nutrient, it enters a so-called ‘stationary phase’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Gray et al., 2004</xref>). This population is heterogeneous and composed of quiescent, senescent and dead cells, the proportion of which evolves with time and differs depending on the nature of the exhausted nutrient (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Davidson et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Klosinska et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">Werner-Washburne et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Laporte et al., 2017</xref>). Several laboratories have attempted to identify each cell category according to differences in their physical properties. The Werner-Washburne laboratory has pioneered these studies utilizing a density gradient that separates the stationary phase population into two sub-fractions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Allen et al., 2006</xref>). This study led to a Boolean concept in which only dense small daughter cells were considered as <italic>bona fide</italic> quiescent cells, while the light fraction, called non-quiescent, supposedly contained senescent and dead mother cells. A corollary to this dichotomy is that replicative age strongly impacts the cell's ability to face chronological age. Yet, as acknowledged later by the authors, this model is over-simplistic, as both sub-populations are highly heterogeneous and do contain quiescent cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Aragon et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Davidson et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">Werner-Washburne et al., 2012</xref>). More recently, centrifugal elutriation was used to separate cells of a stationary phase culture according to their volume. The authors showed that a sub-population of very small daughter cells (2–4 µm in diameter) contains mostly senescent or dead cells, challenging thus the ‘density model’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Svenkrtova et al., 2016</xref>). These discrepancies highlight the limitations of cell population sub-fractionation techniques, their strongest caveat being to assign to sub-populations properties that define individual cells.</p><p>Mitochondria play key roles in cellular aging (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Sun et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Kauppila et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Sebastián et al., 2017</xref>). These organelles are metabolic centers involved in multiple essential cellular processes, including the production of ATP by oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Nunnari and Suomalainen, 2012</xref>). In <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic>, mitochondrial respiration dysfunctions severely affect cell’s ability to face both replicative and chronological aging, (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Fabrizio and Longo, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Martinez et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Trancíková et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bonawitz et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Aerts et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Ocampo et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Beach et al., 2015</xref>). Importantly, mitochondrial morphology defects have been observed in replicatively-old yeast mother cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Scheckhuber et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Veatch et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">McFaline-Figueroa et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Hughes and Gottschling, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Fehrmann et al., 2013</xref>). In proliferating yeast, mitochondria form a dynamic tubular meshwork (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Friedman and Nunnari, 2014</xref>) but intriguingly, in the early 1960’s, Yotsuyanagi reported that upon proliferation cessation, mitochondria re-organize into peripherally-localized vesicles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib97">Yotsuyanagi, 1962</xref>), a rearrangement also observed more recently (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Stevens, 1981</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Dürr et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Sagot et al., 2006</xref>), but never investigated.</p><p>Here we show that following carbon source exhaustion, proliferation cessation is accompanied by a drastic reorganization of the mitochondrial network. We demonstrate that in cells entering quiescence, mitochondrial tubules progressively fragment into numerous small cortical vesicles. In contrast, cells that will enter senescence display few large globular mitochondria that form upon the diauxic shift. These observations enable us to distinguish quiescent and senescent cells within a heterogeneous stationary phase population. We thus re-examined, at the single-cell level, some controversial properties assigned to quiescent cells using population-based approaches. We show that neither cell density nor cell volume could discriminate cell fate. Importantly, we establish that replicative age does not impinge on a cell’s ability to face chronological aging, at least for the first 15 divisions. Finally, we analyze the significance of actin cytoskeleton reorganization into Actin Bodies (AB) and proteasome re-localization from the nucleus into proteasome storage granules (PSG) previously observed in non-dividing cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Sagot et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Laporte et al., 2008</xref>). Overall, our findings reveal that not all quiescent cells are identical, yet quiescence establishment predominantly ensues upon the reorganization of specific cytoplasmic elements.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Mitochondrial network reorganization upon proliferation cessation</title><p>Mitochondrial network morphology was analyzed in wild-type (WT) cells expressing the mitochondrial matrix protein Ilv3 fused to RFP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Jimenez et al., 2014</xref>), the expression of which having no effect on cell proliferation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>). Cells proliferating in glucose-rich liquid medium (YPD) displayed a dynamic branched tubular mitochondrial network, as expected from previous studies. Interestingly, we observed that upon glucose exhaustion, mitochondria tubules progressively fragmented. With time, these fragments appeared shorter and shorter and after 7 days, the population was composed of ~85% of cells displaying small and immobile cortical mitochondrial vesicles (&gt;50 per cell) that may be an ultimate form of tubule fragmentation. In addition, we found ~10% of cells exhibiting 2 to 4 large globular mitochondria and ~5% of cells in which we could not detected any Ilv3-RFP signal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). As cultures aged, the percentage of non-fluorescent cells increased, the percentage of cells with vesicular mitochondria decreased and the percentage of cells with globular mitochondria remained stable (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref>).

Moreover, the mtDNA binding protein Abf2-GFP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Diffley and Stillman, 1991</xref>), the MICOS complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Pfanner et al., 2014</xref>), the Tim/Tom transporters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Harbauer et al., 2014</xref>) and other components belonging to the mitochondrial matrix, the inner and the outer membranes were detected in both cells types (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C–E</xref>). However, while vesicular mitochondria contained both respiratory chain enzymes and ATP synthase subunits, some of OXPHOS proteins were not detected in 7-days-old cells with globular mitochondria (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C–E</xref>). These led us to speculate that cells with globular mitochondria may be respiration deficient. To test this idea, we took advantage of the observation that the formation of cells with globular mitochondria could be triggered by switching proliferating cells from fermentation to respiration, their percentage reaching a plateau at 8.7 ± 0.1%, 4 hr after the carbon source exchange (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>). The formation of cells with globular mitochondria was induced as above and 4 hr after the medium switch, cells were pulse-stained with FITC-conjugated concanavalin A (ConA-FITC), a lectin that binds the yeast cell wall. Cells were then released in YPGE or in YPD as a control. While the percentage of ConA-FITC positive cells with globular mitochondria rapidly decreased in YPD, it remained constant in YPGE, even 15 hr after the pulse (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>). In addition, within ConA-FITC positive cells with globular mitochondria, the mother/daughter cells ratio remained constant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1H</xref>, right), confirming that these cells did not proliferate in YPGE.

As such, they were considered as quiescent (Chi test value &lt;10<sup>−26</sup>). Interestingly, upon quiescence exit, mitochondria vesicles rapidly fused and reformed short tubules before bud emergence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A</xref>). Of note, in some experiments, we noticed that the cells could display both a vesicular and a vacuolar Ilv3-RFP staining, the latter resulting either from mitophagy or an increased Ilv3-RFP degradation in the vacuole. These cells had similar re-proliferation capacities than cells with an Ilv3-RFP signal exclusively localized into cortical vesicles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1B</xref>). Thus, both cell types were considered as a unique cell category.</p><p>We then wonder if increasing the time allowed to re-proliferate would increase the number of cells able to exit quiescence. To prevent pad overcrowding, highly diluted suspensions of 7 days old cells were deposited on YPD pads and cell re-proliferation was scored 12 hr after re-feeding. We found that 98 ± 2% of the cells with vesicular mitochondria were able to re-proliferate within 12 hr (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). In conclusion, almost all cells with vesicular mitochondria were quiescent, although some cells re-entered the proliferation cycle faster than others.</p><p>By contrast,~90% of the 7-days-old cells displaying globular mitochondria were unable to re-enter proliferation, even after 12 hr on microscope pad (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B–C</xref>). These cells were thus considered as senescent (Chi test value &lt;10<sup>−140</sup>). To address the kinetic of entry into senescence, cells with globular mitochondria re-proliferation capacities were analyzed at various time points after their formation, that is after the diauxic shift. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>, the percentage of cells with globular mitochondria able to re-proliferate within 6 hr on a pad progressively decreased. After 7 days, less than 10% of these cells were able to re-proliferate, in agreement with <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>. Thus, while cells with globular mitochondria were unable to proliferate under respiratory conditions whatever their age, the formation of globular mitochondria was not associated with an immediate loss re-proliferation capacity in glucose rich medium. Nevertheless, after 7 days, most of these cells appeared senescent. These data indicate that respiratory deficient cells with globular mitochondria enter senescence, but in a non-synchronous manner.</p><p>To study the link between globular mitochondria, respiration capacities and senescence, we first artificially increased the number of respiratory deficient cells using ethidium bromide (EB, (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Slonimski et al., 1968</xref>) and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>). This treatment induced an increase in the percentage of cells with globular mitochondria (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>), more than 90% of which being senescent after 7 days (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G</xref>). In parallel, we observed that following carbon source exhaustion, rho zero cells rearranged their mitochondrial network into 5 to 20 round and swollen mitochondria (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1D</xref>). After 14 days, these cells were alive but unable to re-proliferate on a microscope pad or to give rise to a progeny on plate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1C–D</xref>). As such, 14 days old rho zero cells can be considered as senescent. Finally, we studied the ERMES mutant <italic>mmm1Δ</italic>. Proliferating <italic>mmm1Δ</italic> cells are known to display enlarged mitochondria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Dimmer et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Hanekamp et al., 2002</xref>). Accordingly, after 7 days of culture, <italic>mmm1Δ</italic> cells exhibited abnormally big mitochondria (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1E</xref>). As expected, <italic>mmm1Δ</italic> cells were massively respiratory deficient (98 ± 4%). After 16 days, we found that most <italic>mmm1Δ</italic> cells appeared senescent (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1E</xref>). Taken together these experiments indicate that the inability to metabolize respiratory carbon sources correlates with the inability to maintain quiescence.</p><p>Finally, we observed that the mitochondrial network morphology was also drastically modified following the exhaustion of other nutrients. As stated above, upon respiratory carbon source exhaustion (glycerol/ethanol and lactate), no cell with globular mitochondria were observed, the majority of the cells displaying a vesicular network and being quiescent. Phosphate depletion, just as carbon depletion, led to both globular and vesicular mitochondria formation and more than 90% of the cells were able to form a colony. By contrast, as shown previously, nitrogen exhaustion led to massive mitophagy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Camougrand et al., 2008</xref>) and rapidly caused cell death (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1F</xref>).</p><p>In conclusion, the above data demonstrate that following carbon source exhaustion, the mitochondrial network organization correlates with individual cell fate: unstained cells are dead, cells with globular mitochondria appeared senescent and cells with vesicular mitochondria are quiescent (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2H</xref>), these findings being reproducible in both the W303 and the CEN-PK strain backgrounds (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1F–G</xref>). Hence, the mitochondrial network morphology can predict the fate of yeast cells facing chronological aging. We took advantage of this robust hallmark to revisit, at the individual cell level, some controversial quiescent cell properties that were uncovered at a population scale.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Cell volume and the ability to face chronological age</title><p>Cell volume has been suggested to strongly influence non-proliferating cell survival.

First, we found that 4 hr after the diauxic shift, mother and daughter cells have a similar propensity to form globular mitochondria (15 ± 6% and 11 ± 4% respectively (p-value=0.049)). Next, we observed that 7-days-old mother and daughter cells with vesicular mitochondria have a similar ability of exiting quiescence within 6 hr (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). We then scrutinized mother cells and studied their re-proliferation capacity as a function of their replicative age that is the number of bud scars. As expected, the older the mother, the less frequent in the total population (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). Interestingly, the percentage of cells with globular or vesicular mitochondria was not significantly different between mother cell replicative age categories (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>). Finally and importantly, we found that within mother cells with vesicular mitochondria, the replicative age did not influence cell re-proliferation capacities (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>). Notwithstanding, since cells with more than 15 bud scars are very rare in a yeast population (theoretically 1/2<sup>number of division</sup>), we could not study these very old mother cells with a statistical significance using our individual cell approach.

These observations demonstrate that a cell displaying AB and/or PSG and/or a vesicular mitochondrial network has at least 90% probability of being in a quiescent state after 7 days of culture in YPD. Interestingly, among cells with globular mitochondria, 57% formed AB whereas none assembled PSG (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>). Reciprocally, 5% of the cells with AB displayed globular mitochondria, but none of the cells with PSG displayed globular mitochondria (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>). This strongly suggests that AB can assemble even if cells are unable to proliferate under respiratory conditions, while PSG can not.

Indeed, the majority of the cells that will maintain their proliferation capacities for a prolonged period displayed numerous cortical mitochondrial vesicles, while cells that are unable to re-proliferate exhibit globular mitochondria. Mitochondria morphology can thus be utilized as a predictor of cell fate. Using this individual cell property, we found that cell volume, density, and replicative age do not significantly influence the propensity to enter quiescence. We further demonstrated that even if quiescent cells are not identical and display various physical (density, volume), cellular (the presence of AB, PSG, vesicular mitochondria) or historical (replicative age) features, quiescence establishment is most frequently associated with the specific reorganization of cellular machineries.</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>Mitochondria reorganization in quiescent cells</title><p>Upon quiescence establishment, cells reorganize their tubular mitochondrial network into numerous cortical vesicles. We have shown that this fragmentation can occur even if known components of the fission machinery (Dnm1, Fis1, Caf4 or Mdv1) are absent, or if selective mitophagy is inoperative, attesting that critical actors of the yeast mitochondrial fission apparatus remain to be identified. In fact, the molecular mechanisms underlying mitochondrial reorganization upon quiescence establishment could involve quiescence specific proteins, lipids and/or the modification of cytoplasmic physical properties such as a pH drop or increased viscosity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Joyner et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Munder et al., 2016</xref>). Yet, why would small vesicles be more beneficial to quiescent cells than tubules? One hypothesis could be that upon re-entry into proliferation, defective vesicular mitochondria might not be incorporated into the reassembling tubular network, but would rather be targeted for degradation. A vesicular network might thus be a way to easily select and eliminate defective mitochondria. This would not only improve the fitness of the quiescence exit step, but also participate in the rejuvenation of the progeny.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Mitochondria and senescence</title><p>The definition of senescence is operational and one can never be sure that cells that appear senescent may not re-renter proliferation in very specific environmental conditions. Here, we have shown that cells with globular mitochondria are unable to re-enter the proliferation cycle even 12 hr after re-feeding with glucose. Thus, in our experimental conditions, these cells were considered as senescent.</p><p>In <italic>P. anserina</italic>, senescence is accompanied by mitochondrial fragmentation into large globular pieces (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Scheckhuber et al., 2007</xref>) and cristae reticulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Brust et al., 2010</xref>). In these cells, the inner membrane forms spherical vesicles, ATP synthase dimers dissociate and large inner/outer membrane contact sites form (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Daum et al., 2013</xref>). In metazoans, abnormal mitochondria, referred to as ‘giant mitochondria’, have been observed in various senescent models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Sato and Tauchi, 1975</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Tandler and Hoppel, 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Murakoshi et al., 1985</xref>) and respiratory chain failure has been proposed to cause premature senescence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Stöckl et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Stöckl et al., 2007</xref>). Yet, in these models, it remains unclear if mitochondrial morphological defects contribute to the permanent proliferation arrest or if they are rather a consequence of cell entry into senescence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib98">Ziegler et al., 2015</xref>). Here we establish that in yeast, the formation of globular mitochondria occurs shortly after glucose exhaustion and precludes the loss of re-proliferation capacity, a process that is not synchronous within the population.</p><p>The loss of re-proliferation capacity is clearly associated with cell’s inability to respire. This incapacity probably results from an accidental event that either may be the consequence of spontaneously arising mutation or be indirectly due to a severe metabolic crisis. Why would respiratory deficient cells be more prone to lose their proliferation capacity? Trehalose accumulation is known to be crucial for chronological aging as it fuels re-entry into proliferation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Samokhvalov et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Kyryakov et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Shi and Tu, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Cao et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Laporte et al., 2017</xref>). Respiratory mutants are defective in trehalose stockpiling and immediately mobilize their disaccharide reserves upon glucose exhaustion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Enjalbert et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Ocampo et al., 2012</xref>). Limited trehalose storage in respiratory deficient cells with globular mitochondria might thus be responsible for their inability to re-enter the proliferation cycle. In fact, respiratory deficient yeast cells population were previously shown to display a shorter chronological life span than their WT counterparts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Fabrizio and Longo, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Trancíková et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bonawitz et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Aerts et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Ocampo and Barrientos, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Ocampo et al., 2012</xref>). This apparent reduced ability to face age observed at the population scale may result from an increased percentage of senescent cells within the population.</p><p>Even if in our experimental conditions, senescence mostly concerns respiratory deficient cells, it is very likely that other individual cell deficiency could lead to senescence in other environmental context, for example a starvation for other nutrients. The distinct routes to yeast senescence are likely as yet undiscovered.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Replicative and chronological aging</title><p>During both the replicative and chronological aging processes, the accumulation of damaged macromolecules is proposed to lead to senescence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Longo et al., 2012</xref>). Intriguingly, in budding yeast, both aging processes have been associated with mitochondria dysfunction and morphological defects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Veatch et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Hughes and Gottschling, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Ocampo et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Fehrmann et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Beach et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">López-Lluch et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Dakik and Titorenko, 2016</xref>) and this study). In yeast, chronological age reduces cell’s replicative capacity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Ashrafi et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Murakami et al., 2012</xref>) as cells that have survived passage through stationary phase for a long period of time have a shortened replicative capacity. Conversely, after the study by Allen <italic>et al</italic>, it was proposed that only daughter cells were capable of entering quiescence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Allen et al., 2006</xref>). Here we found no difference in the ability to enter quiescence between daughter and mother cells of various replicative age (&lt;15 bud scars) with vesicular mitochondria. Moreover, we found that mother cells of various replicative age (&lt;15 bud scars) and daughter cells have the same propensity to become senescent. Yet, because very old mother cells are rare in a yeast cell population, our individual cell tracking strategy does not allow us to conclude about replicatively very old cells. Therefore, if chronological age impinges on cell’s replicative capacity, the reverse influence is not obvious and, if it exists, it is anecdotal at a population scale because it concerns only very few old mother cells.</p></sec><sec id="s3-4"><title>Cell volume and chronological aging</title><p>Recently, it was shown that although displaying similar viability, non-dividing small cells lose their proliferative capacity faster than larger cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Svenkrtova et al., 2016</xref>). Importantly, these small cells were shown to be unable to respire (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Svenkrtova et al., 2016</xref>). Consistently, we found that very small cells are more prone to display globular mitochondria and rapidly appear senescent. Intriguingly, we also found that cells with globular mitochondria tend to be smaller than cells with vesicular mitochondria (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1C</xref>). One hypothesis to account for this phenomenon is that since trehalose is a desiccation protectant, cells with globular mitochondria may shrink faster because of a limited trehalose content. Besides, since mother cells with globular mitochondria are larger than daughter cells with vesicular mitochondria (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1C</xref>), we can exclude the idea that cell volume below a threshold would cause the formation of globular mitochondria.</p></sec><sec id="s3-5"><title>Cellular reorganization and quiescence</title><p>Quiescence is defined as a reversible arrest of proliferation. In fact, this simple operational concept is not that straightforward. Indeed, while it is easy to understand that quiescence encompasses different molecular processes depending on the cell type, it was demonstrated that for a given cell type, quiescence establishment does not take the same route depending on the nature of the inducing signal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Coller et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Klosinska et al., 2011</xref>). In addition, different ‘degrees’ of quiescence may exist depending on chronological age (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Gookin et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Coller et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Laporte et al., 2017</xref>). Thus, quiescence can be viewed as a continuum that tends to senescence and/or ultimately to cell death unless conditions favorable to proliferation are met. Consequently, the idea that quiescence establishment is the result of a universal program is clearly an over-simplification.</p><p>This plasticity is further exemplified by the numerous cellular rearrangements that have been associated with proliferation cessation. In yeast, upon carbon source exhaustion, many proteins relocalize to cytosplamic foci (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Brengues et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Teixeira et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Sagot et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Laporte et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Narayanaswamy et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Noree et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Tapia and Morano, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Liu et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Shah et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Shah et al., 2014</xref>), the actin and microtubule cytoskeletons are re-shaped (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Sagot et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Laporte et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Laporte et al., 2015</xref>) and organelles are reorganized (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib97">Yotsuyanagi, 1962</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Laporte et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Laporte et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Laporte and Sagot, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Guidi et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Rutledge et al., 2015</xref> and this study). Some of these rearrangements have been observed in less than 50% of the cells of a non-proliferating population (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Shah et al., 2014</xref>), while others concern more than 95% of individual cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Sagot et al., 2006</xref>). Here we show that even if more than 90% of 7 days old cells displaying vesicular mitochondria, or AB or PSG are capable to exit quiescence within few hours, the very few remaining cells are not. Conversely, it is possible to find very few cells that are able to re-proliferate but that do not display these reorganizations. Moreover, the relative proportion of each cell category evolves with chronological age and probably also with the environmental context. Therefore, although statistically significant, none of these rearrangements is an absolute marker of senescent or quiescence. Should such markers exist? If yes, they would have to concern all individuals and should be relevant all along chronological age.</p><p>Overall, our data highlight the fact that quiescence does not imply uniformity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">O'Farrell, 2011</xref>) and therefore cannot be apprehended at a population level (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Matson and Cook, 2017</xref>). What, then, makes a quiescent cell? Even if none of the cellular rearrangements identified to date can be used as an absolute quiescence fingerprint, they nevertheless shed light on the obscure biology of quiescent cells. Indeed, while some events occurring upon proliferation cessation are not crucial for cell survival, like telomere clustering (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Laporte et al., 2016</xref>), some of the structures assembled in quiescent cells unambiguously improve the ability to undergo chronological aging. This is the case for actin, microtubule and mitochondria re-organization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Sagot et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Laporte et al., 2013</xref> and this study). Deciphering the underlying molecular rationale and the hierarchical relationships between these reorganizations is now critical for a better understanding of quiescence.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th>Resource</th><th>Designation</th><th valign="bottom">Source or reference</th><th valign="bottom">Identifiers</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Software</td><td>ImageJ</td><td valign="bottom">Department of Health and Human Services, NIDA</td><td valign="bottom">RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/SCR_003070">SCR_003070</ext-link></td></tr><tr><td>Software</td><td>GraphPad Prism 5</td><td valign="bottom">GraphPad Software, Inc.

Cells ‘cut’ by the edge of the image or outline fusion between two or more cells were removed by selecting ROI<sub>cell</sub> between 4.75 and 34 µm<sup>2</sup>. The ‘ROI tool’ in Image J was used to sequentially measure for each ROI<sub>cell</sub> the number of objects (NO), the area and the circularity. Circularity was obtained as followed: (4π×([Area]/[Perimeter]<sup>2</sup>) and ranged from 0 (elongated polygon) to 1 (perfect circle).</p><p>Four fluorescent subsequent planes were selected around the focal plane. A maximal projection was created and the background subtracted (rolling ball radius: five pixels). The mean (mean<sub>Intensity</sub>) and maximal fluorescence intensities (max<sub>Intensity</sub>) were measured. The max<sub>Intensity</sub> measured for 7 days old cells was divided by 2.5 and used to threshold the maximal projection (Mask<sub>globular</sub>). The mean<sub>Intensity</sub> was multiply by 3, and used as a threshold to generate the Mask<sub>initial</sub>. Using the ‘analyze particles’ tool of image J, we generated the Mask<sub>tubule</sub> by filtering the Mask<sub>initial</sub> with a size of 20–5000 pixel<sup>2</sup> and a circularity of 0–0.5 (masks display). The Mask<sub>vesicules</sub> was created with the same approach but using a size of 0–12 pixel<sup>2</sup> and a circularity between 0.85–1. Finally, using the ‘Image calculator’ feature of image J, we generated the Mask<sub>fragment</sub> = Mask<sub>initial</sub> – (Mask<sub>tubule</sub> +Mask<sub>vesicules</sub>).</p><p>ROIs<sub>cell</sub> were applied to the Mask<sub>globular</sub>. A ROI<sub>cell</sub> in which the signal area &gt;0.0018 µm<sup>2</sup> (<italic>i.e.</italic> &gt;2 pixels) was considered as a cell with globular mitochondria. ROIs<sub>cell</sub> were applied to Mask<sub>initial</sub>, Mask<sub>tubule</sub>, Mask<sub>vesicules</sub> and Mask<sub>fragment</sub>. In each ROI<sub>cell</sub>, the numbers of objects (NO_<sub>Mask</sub>) was determined. In case of NO_<sub>initial</sub> &gt;4, the percentage of object in each mask was calculated: % NO_<sub>tubule</sub> = NO_<sub>tubule</sub>/NO_<sub>initial</sub>, % NO_<sub>vesicle</sub> = NO_<sub>vesicle</sub>/NO_<sub>initial</sub> and % NO_<sub>fragment</sub> = NO_<sub>fragment</sub>/NO_<sub>initial</sub>. For each cell, when the % NO_<sub>vesicules</sub> was the highest, the cell was considered as ‘vesicular’ as it displays an important number of objects with high circularity.</p><p>‘Tubular’ and ‘fragmented’ mitochondria were distinguished based on two parameters: (1) the axial property of tubular network (low circularity) and (2) their relative areas (<italic>i.e.</italic> the total areas/number of objet). The % NO_ and the (area/NO_) for each ROI<sub>cell</sub> on Mask<sub>tubule</sub> and Mask<sub>fragment</sub> were compared. If for a Mask<sub>tubule</sub> these two parameters were higher than for the Mask<sub>fragment</sub>, the cell was defined as ‘tubular’ if these two parameters were lower, the cell was defined as ‘fragmented’. If none of these criteria were met, a new filter was applied. A cell was considered as ‘vesicular’ if NO_<sub>vesicules</sub> = NO_<sub>initiale</sub>. A cell was considered as ‘tubular’ if Area<sub>tubule</sub>/NO_<sub>tubule</sub> &gt; Area<sub>vesicules</sub>/NO_<sub>vesicules</sub> and &gt; Area<sub>fragment</sub>/NO_<sub>fragment</sub>. Finally a cell was considered as ‘fragmented’ if Area<sub>fragment</sub>/NO_<sub>fragment</sub> &gt; Area<sub>vesicules</sub>/NO_<sub>vesicules</sub> and &gt; Area<sub>tubule</sub>/NO_<sub>tubule</sub>. These filters were used for NO_<sub>initial</sub> &lt;4.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Miscellaneous</title><p>Glucose concentration was measured using the d-Glucose/d-Fructose UV test kit (Roche, SW).

Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by and Randy Schekman as the Senior/Reviewing Editor.

Several past studies identified methods to do this, but to date, all have some potential limitations. In this study, the authors show that as yeast cells enter stationary phase, mitochondrial structure changes from a tubular network to a collection of small fragmented vesicles in the majority of cells. However, a subpopulation of cells, ~10%, contain large globular mitochondria. The authors track the fate of these non-dividing cells, and show that ~90% of cells with globular mitochondria are senescent, while only 10% of cells with vesicular mitochondria are senescent. Based on this observation, the authors suggest that tracking mitochondrial morphology is a mechanism by which to identify quiescent and senescent cells in a population. They then go on to show that previously identified phenotypes such as replicative age, cell density, and cell volume do not always correlate or impact a cell's ability to undergo senescence or quiescence. Overall, this is a high-quality manuscript that will have a significant impact on the field of quiescence. The data are clear, and the manuscript is well constructed.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) A major weakness is that detailed methods are not provided for how the mitochondrial network is characterized. A fragmented network seems quite similar to a globular network. Use of statistical methods is not provided for how these two network morphologies are characterized. Have the authors developed an algorithm to sort the different morphologies and what are the parameters that are considered (i.e., length vs. width, etc.). If the morphology is characterized by eye, separating fragmented from vesicular seems like this could vary by user. This seems critical to include in the Materials and methods as other researchers may want to use this approach.</p><p>2) The authors have clearly demonstrated that cells with globular mitochondria are more likely to enter senescence, while those with fragmented vesicular mitochondria are more likely quiescent. This is interesting and suggests a link to mitochondrial dysfunction and senescence. However, I am concerned that the mitochondrial phenotypes do not provide a great way to identify senescent versus quiescent cells in a population as the authors suggest. Currently, the way the data is presented in Figure 2, including the summary in 2G, it appears that identifying globular mitochondria containing cells is a great way to separate out quiescent/senescent. However, when analyzing a total cell population, fragmented mitochondrial cells make up ~90% of the population, and ~10% of those are senescent. Globular mitochondrial cells are ~10% of the population, and ~90% are senescent. That means that if one looks at 100 cells, about 18 cells would be senescent, and the proportion that are globular and fragmented would be ~50:50. Thus, one can only identify about half of the cells that are senescent in the population using mitochondrial morphology. The authors should include a representation of the Figure 2B data in this form, showing what fraction of the total senescent cells in the population have fragmented or globular mitochondria. They should also update Figure 2G to provide a more accurate depiction of this. As it stands, 2G does not show that about 50% of the senescent cells contain vesicular mitochondria. The bigger issue is that when presented this way, it becomes apparent that while mitochondrial phenotype correlates with probability of senescence, it can only identify a subpopulation of senescent cells in the population. The authors should make sure their Discussion highlights this in the manuscript.</p><p>3) Another concern in Figure 2B is that the authors only examine the cells for 6 hours. This doesn't seem long enough to conclude that these cells will not divide again. Is it possible that globular mitochondrial containing cells take longer to exit quiescence? The authors should include an experiment where they track cells for much longer than 6 hours, perhaps using their ConA-FITC labeling technique.</p><p>4) A weakness in this manuscript is that the authors propose that the ability to respire is important for moving into quiescence; testing the distribution on YPGE would be useful for clarifying this aspect further as one would not expect cells on YPGE to become senescent. The authors also tend to make larger claims in the Discussion that have not been tested such as the proposal that vesicular mitochondria may be able to be eliminated more easily; testing this with an autophagy assay is necessary to confirm this mechanism.</p><p>5) Subsection “Mitochondrial network reorganization upon proliferation cessation”, first paragraph: Since the BY deletion-strain collection is prone to accumulate secondary mutations these results should be confirmed with hand-made deletion strains or deletions in other strain backgrounds used in this study (W303 or CEN-PK).</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were requested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for resubmitting your work entitled &quot;Mitochondria reorganization upon proliferation arrest predicts individual yeast cell fate&quot; for further consideration at <italic>eLife</italic>.

With time, the mitochondrial fragments progressively appear shorter and shorter. We believe that the vesicular network observed in about 85% of the cells at 7 days is an ultimate form of fragmentation of the tubules observed in proliferating cells. Therefore, we think that the physiological differences between cells with vesicular mitochondria and cells with short mitochondrial tubules are loose. This is now clearly stated in the text.</p><p>Yet, we have developed a semi-automated method to discriminate the different cell categories. Briefly, cells with globular mitochondria were identified based on fluorescence intensity and cells with vesicular or fragmented mitochondria were differentiated using object number per cell and object circularity. This method is provided in the Materials and methods section. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig1">Author response image 1</xref> presents the results obtained using the above method in the most complex situation, i.e. the kinetic of entry of a WT cell population into stationary phase.

The problem with the representation by “cell fate” is that the percentages greatly vary with the chronological age of the culture. Indeed, as shown Figure 2C (that is now 2D), after 2 days of culture, about 70% of the cells with globular mitochondria are able to re-enter the proliferation cycle. However, after 7 days of culture, 90% of the cells with globular mitochondria are unable to re-enter the proliferation cycle. Thus if we consider 10 globular cells, after 2 days of culture, 3 will be senescent while after 7 days of culture, 9 will be senescent. By contrast, the representation by “morphology” is independent of the culture age (at least for the first 5 weeks) since as soon as the diauxic shift is passed, the percentage of cells with globular or vesicular mitochondria stay about constant (Figure 1—figure supplement 1B).</p><p>Importantly, our objective is not to identify <italic>all</italic> the senescent cells. Indeed, this exercise is always open to criticisms since a cell is considered as senescent until a way to make it re-enter proliferation is found. In the new Figure 2C, as suggested by the reviewers in the point #3 below, we show that if we leave the cells longer time to re-proliferate after re-feeding on pad, almost all cells with vesicular mitochondria will re-proliferate (98% +/-2 after 12h compared to 90% after 6h on the pad). By contrast, whatever the time on the pad, 90% of the 7 days old cells with globular mitochondria do not re-enter the proliferation cycle and can thus be considered as senescent.</p><p>For all these reasons, we believe that our representation by “mitochondrial morphology” is less misleading than a representation by “cell fate”, which is strongly influenced by both the time in culture and the time allowed to re-proliferate. Yet, we have softened Figure 2G by adding “apparently senescent”, and discussed that point more clearly in the Discussion section.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Another concern in Figure 2B is that the authors only examine the cells for 6 hours. This doesn't seem long enough to conclude that these cells will not divide again. Is it possible that globular mitochondrial containing cells take longer to exit quiescence? The authors should include an experiment where they track cells for much longer than 6 hours, perhaps using their ConA-FITC labeling technique.</p></disp-quote><p>As explained in the manuscript, because most cells rapidly re-proliferate on the pad and invade the field of analysis, it is not possible to track individually a large number of cells for more than 6h after re-feeding. However, as suggested by the reviewer, we have left more time for cells to re-proliferate on pads that were inoculated with very few cells. In those experiments, individual cell full progeny cannot be tracked because of overcrowding (see new Figure 2C).</p><p>Nevertheless, we observed that 98% +/-2 of 7 days old cells with vesicular mitochondria re-proliferate after 12h on the pad (compare to 90% after 6h). Thus most of the 7d-old cells with vesicular mitochondria were quiescent. By contrast, and importantly, increasing the time on the pad did not change cells with globular mitochondria ability to re-enter proliferation (13% +/- 10% after 6h and 9%+/- 1% after 12h). These data are now presented in the new Figure 2C.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) A weakness in this manuscript is that the authors propose that the ability to respire is important for moving into quiescence; testing the distribution on YPGE would be useful for clarifying this aspect further as one would not expect cells on YPGE to become senescent.</p></disp-quote><p>As suggested by the reviewer, we have addressed the morphology of the mitochondrial network of cells grown in YPGE or in rich medium containing lactate and as expected by the reviewer, we found no cells with globular mitochondria. Importantly, almost all the cells grown for 4 or 9 days in YPGE or lactate were viable and capable to give rise to a progeny. These data are shown in the new Figure1—figure supplement 1F.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The authors also tend to make larger claims in the Discussion that have not been tested such as the proposal that vesicular mitochondria may be able to be eliminated more easily; testing this with an autophagy assay is necessary to confirm this mechanism.</p></disp-quote><p>This is just a hypothesis proposed in the Discussion section. In fact, if true, quiescent cells should have two distinct types of mitochondrial vesicles: some functional and some non-functional. We are currently testing this possibility and some preliminary data are provided as “confidential data for the reviewers” but we believe that testing this hypothesis and deciphering the underlying mechanism will involve many complex experiments that are beyond the scope of this manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) Subsection “Mitochondrial network reorganization upon proliferation cessation”, first paragraph: Since the BY deletion-strain collection is prone to accumulate secondary mutations these results should be confirmed with hand-made deletion strains or deletions in other strain backgrounds used in this study (W303 or CEN-PK).</p></disp-quote><p>We are aware that these strains could be unstable.

The manuscript and data presented are high quality and will be of significant interest to the readers. A minor concern stemming from new data included in the manuscript is the phenotype of the mdm34Δ ERMES mutant, which the authors find is not respiratory deficient and doesn't share similar morphology to the mmm1Δ mutant. This is in disagreement with previous reports that mdm34 deletion strains are respiratory deficient. I wonder if it's possible that the mdm34 mutant cells the authors are working with have acquired a suppressor mutation, perhaps in Vps13, which is very common with these mutants (see PMID: 26370498). The authors may want to sequence the Vps13 locus in their mdm34 mutant strains, and consider excluding this data from the manuscript if the mdm34Δ strain contains a suppressor mutation that renders it respiration positive.</p></disp-quote><p>In our hands, at the individual cell level, only 16% of the <italic>mdm34Δ</italic> cells were respiratory defective. The <italic>mdm34Δ</italic> mutant was originally described as unable to grow on respiratory carbon sources (Dimmer et al., 2002; Youngman et al., 2004) but Youngman et al. described that <italic>mdm34Δ</italic> strains rapidly “acquire” the ability to grow on non-fermentable carbon source.</p><p>Lang et al. (2015) have demonstrated that two dominant mutations in the <italic>VPS13</italic> gene can suppress the <italic>mdm34Δ</italic> respiration defective phenotype (Lang et al., JCB, 2015). These mutations are at position 1814: TTA⋄TCA (L605S) and at position 3665: CCT⋄CAT (P1222H). As requested by the reviewer, we have sequenced the <italic>VPS13</italic> allele in the <italic>mdm34Δ</italic> Ilv3-RFP strain used in Figure2—figure supplement 1E-F and found none of the above mentioned mutations (please see the chromatograms in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig5">Author response image 5</xref>).</p><fig id="respfig5"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.35685.027</object-id><label>Author response image 5.</label><caption/><graphic mime-subtype="jpeg" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-35685-resp-fig5-v1"/></fig><p>In addition, we have backcrossed our <italic>mdm34Δ</italic> Ilv3-RFP strain with a WT strain and found a “slow growth on glucose medium” phenotype that segregates 3:1, suggesting that indeed, a single mutation suppresses the previously reported “slow growth on glucose medium” phenotype of the <italic>mdm34Δ</italic> mutation.</p><p>In our strain, the <italic>mdm34</italic> gene is disrupted with the KanMX gene (Research Genetics strain from Invitrogen). Accordingly, the colonies with a “slow growth on glucose medium” phenotype are resistant to kanamycine (please see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig6">Author response image 6</xref>). Furthermore, as expected if a single mutation suppresses the <italic>mdm34Δ</italic> “slow growth on glucose medium” phenotype, the other [KanR] colony in each tetrad grew normally on YPD. Moreover, after 24h, the [<italic>mdm34Δ “slow growth on glucose medium”; KanR]</italic> colonies did not grow on YPGE, while, as expected, the <italic>[mdm34Δ+suppressor; KanR]</italic> colonies did.
