Atg14L, the mammalian ortholog of Atg14 in yeast and a critical regulator of autophagy, mediates the production PtdIns3P to initiate the formation of autophagosomes. However, it is not clear how Atg14L is regulated. In this study, we demonstrate that ubiquitination and degradation of Atg14L is controlled by ZBTB16-Cullin3-Roc1 E3 ubiquitin ligase complex. Furthermore, we show that a wide range of G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) ligands and agonists regulate the levels of Atg14L through ZBTB16. In addition, we show that the activation of autophagy by pharmacological inhibition of GPCR reduces the accumulation of misfolded proteins and protects against behavior dysfunction in a mouse model of Huntington's disease. Our study demonstrates a common molecular mechanism by which the activation of GPCRs leads to the suppression of autophagy and a pharmacological strategy to activate autophagy in the CNS for the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.06734.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.06734.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.06734.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Proteins need to be folded into specific three-dimensional shapes for them to work properly. However, the folding process does not always work perfectly, and proteins are sometimes misfolded. If left to accumulate, these misfolded proteins can damage cells, and most long-term human neurodegenerative diseases, such as Huntington's disease, Parkinson's disease, and Alzheimer's disease, are caused by the build-up of misfolded proteins in the brain.</p><p>Autophagy helps to clean up misfolded proteins (and other damaged cell components) by first wrapping them in membrane vesicles. The membrane-wrapped vesicles—known as autophagosomes—then move to fuse with lysosomes, a different kind of membrane compartment in the cell, which breaks down misfolded proteins and recycles the degradation products. In mammalian cells, a protein called Atg14L is critical in the process of autophagosome formation.</p><p>The levels of autophagosome formation are regulated by signals that originate from outside the cell. However, it is not clear if and how cells respond to external signals to control the levels of autophagy by regulating the amount of Atg14L. The G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) are the largest class of membrane proteins that our cells have that are involved in sensing and responding to external signals. The activation of GPCRs has been shown to lead to diverse physiological responses. Zhang et al. now show that when any of a wide range of different signaling molecules bind to the GPCRs, the receptors activate a protein called ZBTB16 that leads to the degradation of Atg14L to inhibit autophagy.</p><p>Furthermore, Zhang et al. found that blocking the activity of the GPCRs with a drug can activate autophagy and reduce the amount of misfolded proteins in the cell. In mice that have a version of a gene that causes Huntington's disease, this inhibition also protects against the symptoms of the disease. The challenge now is to identify appropriate GPCRs that can be safely manipulated to control the levels of autophagy in the brain in order to reduce the levels of the misfolded proteins that cause neurodegeneration.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.06734.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.06734.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author keywords</title><kwd>autophagy</kwd><kwd>ubiquitination</kwd><kwd>GPCR</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000049</institution-id><institution>National Institute on Aging</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R37 AG012859</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Yuan</surname><given-names>Junying</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000049</institution-id><institution>National Institute on Aging</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01-AG047231</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Yuan</surname><given-names>Junying</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001809</institution-id><institution>National Natural Science Foundation of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>31129004</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Yu</surname><given-names>Qiang</given-names></name><name><surname>Yuan</surname><given-names>Junying</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100002367</institution-id><institution>Chinese Academy of Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Yuan</surname><given-names>Junying</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.3</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Under normal nutritional conditions, G-protein coupled receptors can control autophagy by regulating the degradation of key autophagic regulator Atg14L through ZBTB16-mediated ubiquitination and proteasome degradation.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Autophagy is an important intracellular catabolic mechanism that mediates the turnover of cytoplasmic constituents via lysosomal degradation. In multi-cellular organisms, autophagy serves important functions in mediating intracellular protein degradation under normal nutritional conditions. Defects in autophagy lead to the accumulation of misfolded proteins in the central nervous system, an organ that is protected from nutritional deprivation under physiological conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Hara et al., 2006</xref>). How cells regulate autophagy under normal nutritional condition is an important unsolved question in the field. In mammalian cells, adaptor protein Atg14L/Barkor in complex with Vps34, the catalytic subunit of the class III PI3K, and the regulatory proteins Beclin 1 and p150, function as a key driver in orchestrating the formation of autophagosomes by regulating the formation of Vps34 complexes and for targeting to the isolation membrane involved in initiating the formation of autophagosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Obara and Ohsumi, 2011</xref>). However, it remains to be determined how Atg14L is regulated in response to extracellular signaling.</p><p>G-protein (heterotrimeric guanine nucleotide–binding protein)-coupled receptors (GPCRs) are important regulators of cellular responses to diverse stimuli with major clinical implications (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Foord et al., 2005</xref>). While the activation of GPCRs is known to lead to numerous downstream events, the role and mechanism of autophagy regulated by GPCRs is not yet clear. Furthermore, it is also not clear how the signaling of GPCRs controls the levels of PtdIns3P.</p><p>ZBTB16, also known as promyelocytic leukemia zinc finger or Zfp145, is a member of ‘BTB-POZ’ protein family and mediates the binding of CUL3, a core component in multiple cullin-RING-based BCR (BTB-CUL3-RBX1) E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase complexes and its substrates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Furukawa et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Geyer et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Xu et al., 2003</xref>). In this study, we investigated the mechanism by which ZBTB16 regulates autophagy. We show that CUL3-ZBTB16 regulates autophagy by mediating the proteasomal degradation of Atg14L, which is controlled by GPCR ligands through GSK3β phosphorylation. Furthermore, we show that inhibiting GPCRs by pharmacological means leads to the activation of autophagy in the central nervous system (CNS) and ameliorates neural dysfunction in a mouse model of Huntington's disease. Our study identified a common mechanism by which multiple GPCR ligands mediate autophagy through regulating the levels of Vps34 complexes and a pharmacological strategy to activate autophagy in the CNS to inhibit neural dysfunction induced by the accumulation of misfolded proteins.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Regulation of Atg14L levels by ZBTB16</title><p>A genome-wide siRNA screen identified ZBTB16 as one of the hits that when its expression is knocked down can lead to the activation of autophagy and increased production of PtdIns3P (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Lipinski et al., 2010</xref>). Since PtdIns3P is produced by Vps34 complexes, the class III PtdIns3 kinase, we hypothesize that ZBTB16 might affect the levels/activity of Vps34 complexes. Although ZBTB16 is known to be involved in regulation of transcription in nucleus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Mathew et al., 2012</xref>), ZBTB16 is predominantly localized in the cytoplasm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Costoya et al., 2008</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>), suggesting that ZBTB16 might have a non-nuclear function. To test this hypothesis, we screened for the effects of ZBTB16 knockdown on the levels of Atg14L, Vps34, Beclin1, and UVRAG. Interestingly, we found that knockdown of ZBTB16 led to specific increases in the levels of Atg14L, a key component of Vps34 complexes specifically involved in regulating autophagy, and corresponding increases in the ratio of LC3II/tubulin and a reduction in the levels of p62, indicating the activation of autophagy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Matsunaga et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Zhong et al., 2009</xref>). Overexpression of Atg14L has been shown to induce autophagy under normal nutritional conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Matsunaga et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Fan et al., 2011</xref>). On the other hand, the levels of Beclin1, Vps34, UVRAG were not affected by the knockdown of ZBTB16 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). We compared the changes of LC3II/tubulin in the presence or absence of chloroquine (CQ), an inhibitor of lysosomal degradation. We found that compared to that of ZBTB16 knockdown or CQ treatment, the presence of CQ with ZBTB16 knockdown led to a further increase in the ratio of LC3II/tubulin, suggesting that ZBTB16 deficiency led to an increase in autophagic flux (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>).<fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.06734.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>ZBTB16 mediates the proteasomal degradation of Atg14L.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) The cytoplasmic and nuclear fractions of HeLa cells cultured in normal media were separated by using Paris Kit (Ambion) and analyzed by western blotting using indicated antibodies.

Interestingly, we found that the levels of Atg14L were dramatically increased in the kidney, heart, liver, and brain of ZBTB16−/− mice compared to that of wt (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref>). The levels of autophagy as indicated by the ratio of LC3II/tubulin were significantly higher in ZBTB16−/− mice than that of wt mice. From these results, we conclude that ZBTB16 is an important regulator of Atg14L and autophagy.</p><p>To further characterize the impact of ZBTB16 on the levels of Atg14L, we transfected an expression vector of ZBTB16 into HeLa cells. Overexpression of ZBTB16 led to down-regulation of Atg14L protein in a dose-dependent manner but not that of its mRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C</xref>). Thus, ZBTB16 regulates the protein levels of Atg14L but not its mRNA.</p><p>Since ZBTB16 is known to function as an adaptor for CUL3-ROC1 complex of ubiquitin ligase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Xu et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Mathew et al., 2012</xref>), we next tested the effect of this complex on the levels of Vps34 complexes. Overexpression of CUL3-ROC1-ZBTB16 led to the reduction in the levels of transfected as well as endogenous Atg14L (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F–G</xref>). Overexpression of ZBTB16 also had a minor reducing effect on the levels of Vps34 and Beclin1, but not that of UVRAG (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1D</xref>), consistent with a coordinated regulation of Vps34 complexes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Itakura et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Matsunaga et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Zhong et al., 2009</xref>). The down-regulation of Atg14L by CUL3-ROC1-ZBTB16 can be rescued by MG132, which inhibits the proteasomal degradation, but not by E64d, an inhibitor of lysosomal degradation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F–G</xref>). Finally, we found that knockdown of CUL3 led to increases in the levels of Atg14L and autophagy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1E</xref>). The effect of knockdown ZBTB16, Cullin3, and ROC1 was also confirmed using image-based LC3-GFP assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1F</xref>). Taken together, these results suggest that CUL3-ROC1-ZBTB16 complex may promote the degradation of autophagic-specific Vps34 complexes through proteasomal pathway.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>CUL3-ROC1-ZBTB16 mediates the ubiquitination of Atg14L</title><p>Since ZBTB16 is known to function as an adaptor for CUL3-ROC1 ligase complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Furukawa et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Geyer et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Xu et al., 2003</xref>), we next investigated the possibility that Atg14L might be able to bind to ZBTB16.

Interestingly, the treatment with LY294002 led to significant reductions in the levels of ZBTB16 and concomitant increases in the levels of ATG14L and LC3II/tubulin ratio and autophagic flux, suggesting the induction of autophagy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1J</xref>). Thus, the inhibition of class I PI3 kinase and AKT and activation of GSK3β may contribute to the reduction in the levels of ZBTB16 and the increases that of Atg14L.</p><p>Since phosphorylation of substrates provides an important targeting mechanism for Cul3-Roc1 E3 ubiquitin ligase complexes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Petroski and Deshaies, 2005</xref>), we hypothesized that serum starvation induced degradation of ZBTB16 is regulated by phosphorylation. As inhibition of class I PI3 kinase by LY294002 led to the activation of GSK3β, which is known to be activated by serum starvation to regulate cell survival (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Frame and Cohen, 2001</xref>), we examined the possibility that GSK3β be involved in mediating the degradation of ZBTB16 upon serum starvation. The phosphorylation of Ser9, an inhibitory phosphorylation event, in GSK3β is strongly inhibited in serum- starved HeLa cells as reported (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2A</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Sutherland et al., 1993</xref>). Consistent with a role of GSK3β in regulating ZBTB16, knockdown of GSK3β, or the addition of SB216763, an inhibitor of GSK3β, restored the levels of ZBTB16 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2B</xref>). Thus, GSK3β might be involved in regulating ZBTB16 in response to serum removal.</p><p>We tested the possibility that GSK3β might phosphorylate ZBTB16. Indeed, we found that the expression of constitutively active GSK3β (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Stambolic and Woodgett, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Zhao et al., 2012</xref>) could lead to phosphorylation of ZBTB16, which can be inhibited by SB216763 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2C</xref>). In addition, the interaction of ZBTB16 and GSK3β could be detected, suggesting that ZBTB16 might be a substrate of GSK3β (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2D</xref>). A search of Scansite (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://scansite.mit.edu/">http://scansite.mit.edu</ext-link>) identified three possible sites in ZBTB16 for GSK3β: S184, T282, and S347. Interestingly, we could detect increased phospho-ZBTB16 under serum starvation condition, and the phosphorylation of ZBTB16 could be inhibited by inhibitors of GSK3β (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3G</xref>). We found that S184A mutation, but not S347A mutation, eliminated the phosphorylation of ZBTB16 induced by serum starvation condition detected by pan-phospho-Ser antibody (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3H</xref>). On the other hand, T282A mutation-eliminated phosphorylation induced by serum starvation condition detected by pan-phospho-Thr antibody (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3I</xref>). Furthermore, S184A and T282A mutations also eliminated phosphorylation by GSK3β in vitro (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3J–K</xref>) or in cells expressing constitutively active GSK3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2E</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Stambolic and Woodgett, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Zhao et al., 2012</xref>). Blocking of ZBTB16 phosphorylation, however, had no effect on the mTOR pathway as Torin1, an inhibitor of mTOR, could still induce autophagy in HeLa cells expressing ZBTB16 S184A/T282A (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2F</xref>). Taken together, we conclude that S184 and T282 of ZBTB16 may be phosphorylated by GSK3β in cells under serum starvation condition.</p><p>To determine if ubiquitination of ZBTB16 might be affected by serum starvation, we expressed wt and S184A/T282A mutant ZBTB16 in HeLa cells. We found that serum starvation significantly enhanced auto-ubiquitination of wt ZBTB16, but not S184A/T282A mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). Consistently, auto-ubiquitination of S184D/T282E ZBTB16 mutant was significantly enhanced compared to that of wt (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). On the other hand, the abilities of S184A/T282A and S184D/T282E ZBTB16 mutants to mediate the ubiquitination of Atg14L were higher and lower than that of wt, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>). Since both S184 and T282 are localized in the region of ZBTB16 that is important for binding to Atg14L, we tested the effect of phosphor-mimetic mutation in ZBTB16 on the interaction with Atg14L. Consistently, the interaction of S184D/T282E ZBTB16 mutant with Atg14L was significantly weaker than that of wt (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>). Finally, to examine if S184/T282 phosphorylation of ZBTB16 might be critical functionally to regulate autophagy under serum starvation condition, we analyzed the response of HeLa cells expressing wt or S184A/T282A mutant to serum starvation. Since endogenous and overexpressed wt ZBTB16 proteins are degraded upon serum starvation while S184A/T282A mutant is not, this experiment provides an opportunity to test if the persistent levels of S184A/T282A mutant under serum starvation condition might be able to suppress the increases in Atg14L and autophagy. Interestingly, we found that the increases in the levels of Atg14L and reduction in that of p62 were blocked by the expression of S184A/T282A (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>). Thus, we conclude that phosphorylation of S184/T282 of ZBTB16 by GSK3β is functionally important for regulating Atg14L under serum starvation condition to promote autophagy.<fig id="fig4" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.06734.010</object-id><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><title>Phosphorylation of S184/T282 of ZBTB16 by GSK3b is functionally important for regulating Atg14L under serum starvation condition to promote autophagy.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) The expression vectors of Flag-tagged wild type or mutants ZBTB16 and HA-Ub were transfected into HeLa cells and cultured for 24 hr.

The presence or absence of serum, however, had no effect on the predominant cytoplasmic localization of ZBTB16 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1C</xref>). The effect of serum starvation on the increased ATG14L and decreased ZBTB16 levels can also be suppressed by the addition of bovine serum albumin (BSA) with different degree of purity, SDF1, or lysophosphatidic acid (LPA), which are known GPCR ligands (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B–D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1D–G</xref>).

Untreated N171-Q82 mice develop intranuclear expanded polyglutamine inclusions and neuritic aggregates and behavioral abnormalities, including loss of coordination, tremors, hypokinesis, and abnormal gait, before dying prematurely. We found that the treatment of AMD3100 significantly reduced the frequency of hindlimb clasping when suspended by tail (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>). We monitored the effect of AMD3100 on motor function using rotarod test. The motor deficit in N171-Q82 mice is detectable at 10–11 weeks of age (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Schilling et al., 1999</xref>). Beginning at 11 weeks of age, AMD3100 or vehicle control was administered daily to HD mice until the end of their life. When tested at 13.5 weeks of age, the N171-Q82 mice received AMD3100 showed significantly improved motor function as indicated by the extended time on rotarod (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>).

We found that the levels of expanded polyglutamine in brain tissues of N171-82Q mice at the age of 15 weeks were dramatically reduced compared to that of vehicle-treated mice as shown by western blotting (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6F</xref>). Furthermore, the accumulation of expanded polyglutamine in the cortex, striatum, and hippocampus was significantly reduced after the treatment of AMD3100 as shown by immunostaining (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6G</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1E</xref>).</p><p>Taken together, we conclude that the activation of autophagy by inhibiting GPCR signaling can promote the degradation of expanded polyQ and preserve neuronal functions by inhibiting Atg14L degradation through ZBTB16-mediated ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6H</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Our study reveals a novel mechanism by which GPCRs and the associated intracellular signaling mediators regulate autophagy by controlling the ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation of Atg14L mediated by ZBTB16-CUL3-ROC1. Our study provides a mechanism of crosstalk between autophagy and proteasome, two major intracellular degradative machineries. Since GPCRs represent the largest family of membrane-bound receptors that can interact with a broad range of ligands, including small organic compounds, eicosanioids, peptides, and proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Lagerström and Schiöth, 2008</xref>), our results suggest that autophagy can be regulated by a much wider range of extracellular signals and conditions beyond starvation condition than currently appreciated. Furthermore, we demonstrate as a proof-of-principle that suppression of GPCR signaling by AMD3100 can activate autophagy to reduce the accumulation of expanded polyglutamine repeats, extend survival, and ameliorate neurodysfunction in a mouse model of Huntington's disease. Since our study suggests that ZBTB16-regulated Atg14L ubiquitination and degradation is a common downstream mechanism modulated by GPCR signaling in control of autophagy, our study suggests the possibility to explore regulators of additional GPCRs to manipulate autophagy in the CNS. Since GPCRs represent the most common ‘druggable’ targets, our results demonstrate a potentially wide range of possible targets for safely modulating the levels of autophagy through pharmacological manipulations of GPCR signaling. Our data, however, do not rule out that GPCRs might regulate additional pathways in control of autophagy; nor do we exclude the possibility that ZBTB16 has substrates, in addition to Atg14L, in regulating autophagy.</p><p>The phosphorylation of targeting substrates often serves as a signal and prelude for binding, ubiquitination, and proteasomal degradation mediated by Cullin-RING ligase complexes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Petroski and Deshaies, 2005</xref>). In this case, we found that phosphorylation of S184/T282 in the center domain of ZBTB16 by GSK3β may provide a signal to disrupt the inhibitory folding and thereby activate its auto-ubiquitination activity. On the other hand, the phosphorylation of S184/T282, which is in the domains of ZBTB16 involved in binding to Atg14L, inhibits its interaction with Atg14L and therefore, reduces the ubiquitination and degradation of Atg14L. Since the interaction of ZBTB16 and Atg14L is mediated by the binding to the BATS domain, a lipid-binding domain that binds to highly curved autophagosome structures enriched with PI3P (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Matsunaga et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Fan et al., 2011</xref>). Consequently, the interaction of ZBTB16 with Atg14L is potentially competitive with the role of Atg14L in promoting the formation of autophagosomes, consistent with its negative role in regulating autophagy. Thus, the degradation of ZBTB16 upon inhibition of GPCR signaling may not only release Atg14L from proteasomal degradation but also provide a permissive signal to allow the binding of the BATS domain with PI3P, an important event during the formation of autophagosomes.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Chemicals and cytokines</title><p>From Sigma Aldrich: LY294002, MG132, E64d, SB216763, Forskolin, LPA, endothelin 1, AMD3100, U0126, BSA, Rapamycin, cycloheximide.

Your article has been favorably evaluated by Vivek Malhotra (Senior editor) and 3 reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors.</p><p>The following individuals responsible for the peer review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Noboru Mizushima (Reviewing editor) and Zhenyu Yue (one of the other two peer reviewers).</p><p>The Reviewing editor and the other reviewers discussed their comments before we reached this decision, and the Reviewing editor has assembled the following comments to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>The authors previously identified ZBTB16 as one of the autophagy-suppressing genes in a genome-wide siRNA screen (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Lipinski et al. 2010</xref> Dev. Cell). Zhang et al. show in the present manuscript that the ZBTB16-Cullin3-Roc1 E3 ubiquitin ligase complex induces proteasomal degradation of ATG14L under normal growing conditions. The activity of this E3 complex is inhibited when ZBTB16 is phosphorylated by GSK3b under starvation conditions. Furthermore, the authors show that the GPCR-cAMP pathway negatively regulates the GSK3b, and thereby promotes degradation of ATG14L. Finally, they demonstrate that AMD3100, a GPCR antagonist, increases the level of ATG14L and autophagic flux, and has a therapeutic effect in a Huntington disease mouse model.</p><p>Overall, this well-designed, interesting study reveals the novel regulation mechanisms of starvation-induced autophagy and provides an important therapeutic potential of autophagy-regulating drugs. The following points, however, need to be addressed to support and strengthen the overall proposal.</p><p>Major comments:</p><p>1) While it appears to be clear that the Akt-GSK3b-ZBTB16-ATG14L pathway play a role in starvation-induced autophagy, how much this pathway contributes to the overall autophagy regulation is not very clear. In particular, Akt can also regulate autophagy through inhibition of mTORC1, another important regulator of autophagy, and the major signaling pathway is this unclear. Can inhibition of mTORC1 (e.g. by torin 1) induce autophagy in cells expressing ZBTB16S184A/T282A? Do the levels of ATG14L and ZBTB16 change only by serum starvation, but not by amino acid starvation, which is another potent autophagy-inducible condition? If so, upregulation of ATG14L by ZBTB16 suppression is not critically important for starvation-induced autophagy.</p><p>2) It is not shown in this manuscript whether overexpression of ATG14L is sufficient for the increase in autophagic flux. This is a critical point that should be addressed experimentally. Furthermore, it was already suggested that overexpression of Atg14L can induce autophagy even in nutrient-rich conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Matsunaga et al. 2010</xref> J. Cell Biol., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Fan et al. 2011</xref> PNAS). The authors should cite and discuss these previous findings.</p><p>3) Although the authors show that serum starvation for as short as 30 min induces ZBTB16 reduction and Atg14L accumulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>), they determined the induction of autophagy by serum starvation at 24 h (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>). To be consistent, the authors should monitor the LC3 conversion at earlier time points. If autophagy is not induced at earlier time points even though Atg14L accumulation occurs quickly, the authors should clearly mention the fact. The current manuscript may give an impression that Atg14L accumulation quickly induces autophagy and thus may be misleading.</p><p>Minor comments:</p><p>1) The authors should be careful by not over-interpreting the results. They should include the discussion about the possibility that GPCR-GSK3beta-ZBTB16-Atg14L axis, though important, may represent an over-simplified pathway of autophagy regulation, as GPCR-GSK3beta regulates a variety of pathways and ZBTB16 has many other substrates beyond Atg14L. The observed change in the Atg14L levels alone may not be sufficient to drive alteration of autophagy in particular in the context of AMD3100.</p><p>2) It would be helpful for readers if the authors could include a summary model showing how serum starvation or inhibition of GPCRs induces autophagy through stabilization of ATG14L because many factors and negative regulations are involved in the authors' model.</p><p>3) As ZBTB16 knockout mice are viable, it would be informative to provide or discuss any phenotypes of these mice that can be explained by a defect in autophagy.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.06734.017</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>1) While it appears to be clear that the Akt-GSK3b-ZBTB16-ATG14L pathway play a role in starvation-induced autophagy, how much this pathway contributes to the overall autophagy regulation is not very clear.

Autophagy is known to be involved in the process of spermatogenesis. E.g. autophagy has been reported to be involved in paternal mitochondrial destruction during spermatogenesis of Drosophila (Politi et al., 2014). Deletion of Atg7 blocks spermatogenesis at late stage (Wang et al., 2014). Thus, it is possible that the male sterility of ZBTB16 is due to over-activation of autophagy. However, since the male sterility of ZBTB16-/- mice has not been characterized, it is difficult to suggest anything even in the Discussion at this stage.</p></body></sub-article></article>
