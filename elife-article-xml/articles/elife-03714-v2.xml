enterotoxigenic <italic>E. coli</italic> (ETEC) require hyperglycosylation for functioning. Here we demonstrate that TibC from ETEC harbors a heptosyltransferase activity on TibA and AIDA-I, defining a large family of bacterial autotransporter heptosyltransferases (BAHTs). The crystal structure of TibC reveals a characteristic ring-shape dodecamer. The protomer features an N-terminal β-barrel, a catalytic domain, a β-hairpin thumb, and a unique iron-finger motif. The iron-finger motif contributes to back-to-back dimerization; six dimers form the ring through β-hairpin thumb-mediated hand-in-hand contact. The structure of ADP-D-glycero-β-D-manno-heptose (ADP-D,D-heptose)-bound TibC reveals a sugar transfer mechanism and also the ligand stereoselectivity determinant. Electron-cryomicroscopy analyses uncover a TibC–TibA dodecamer/hexamer assembly with two enzyme molecules binding to one TibA substrate. The complex structure also highlights a high efficient hyperglycosylation of six autotransporter substrates simultaneously by the dodecamer enzyme complex.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.03714.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.03714.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.03714.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Bacteria release proteins known as virulence factors to help them infect host cells. Many bacteria are surrounded by two membranes, so virulence factors must be able to pass through both of these membranes.</p><p>Autotransporters are a group of virulence factors that pass through the inner membrane and anchor themselves in the outer membrane; this allows part of the autotransporter to project from the surface of the bacterial cell and stick to the surface of the cell that the bacterium is about to infect. Many autotransporters are coated with sugar molecules and this increases their ability to adhere to cells. Enzymes called glycosyltransferases ensure that this sugar coating process takes place.</p><p>Autotransporters contain two sections: the passenger domain and the beta domain. The passenger domain is important for virulence, while the beta domain forms a pore in the outer membrane that the passenger domain passes through to reach the outer surface of the bacterium. TibA and AIDA-1 are autotransporters associated with two types of bacteria that infect the intestines and cause diarrhea. Similar autotransporters are found in a wide range of bacteria, but the precise details of how these autotransporters are coated with sugar molecules are not fully understood.</p><p>Yao et al. now show that a glycosyltransferase called TibC, which is found in many bacteria, adds large numbers of sugar molecules to the passenger domains of both TibA and AIDA-1. To learn more about this process Yao et al. used X-ray diffraction to work out the structure of TibC. Strikingly, this revealed that TibC proteins come together to form a large circular structure that contains two rings, each made of six TibC proteins. The integrity of this structure is maintained by the presence of iron atoms, which also gives TibC a characteristic brown colour.</p><p>Yao et al. also studied what happens when TibC binds to TibA; a technique called electron cryo-microscopy revealed that six TibA molecules are distributed along the inner surface of the circular TibC structure, with each TibA protein binding to two TibC proteins. This arrangement allows for the efficient transfer of sugar molecules from the glycosyltransferase to the autotransporter.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.03714.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.03714.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author keywords</title><kwd>bacterial autotransporter</kwd><kwd>glycosyltransferase</kwd><kwd>bacterial pathogenesis</kwd><kwd>cryo-EM</kwd><kwd>enzyme complex</kwd><kwd>enzyme catalysis</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>E. coli</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000011</institution-id><institution>Howard Hughes Medical Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>55007431</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Shao</surname><given-names>Feng</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100002855</institution-id><institution>Ministry of Science and Technology of the People's Republic of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>2012CB518700 and 2014CB849602</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Yao</surname><given-names>Qing</given-names></name><name><surname>Lu</surname><given-names>Qiuhe</given-names></name><name><surname>Xu</surname><given-names>Yue</given-names></name><name><surname>Shao</surname><given-names>Feng</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001809</institution-id><institution>National Natural Science Foundation of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Program for Distinguished Young Scholars 31225002</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Shao</surname><given-names>Feng</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100002367</institution-id><institution>Chinese Academy of Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>XDB08020202</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Shao</surname><given-names>Feng</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001809</institution-id><institution>National Natural Science Foundation of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Program for Distinguished Young Scholars 31230018</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Zhu</surname><given-names>Ping</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Protein heptosyltransferases modify a group of bacterial autotransporters for virulence function and employ a novel structural mechanism for the processive hyperglycosylation of the autotransporter.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Protein glycosylation is one of the most abundant post-translational modifications in all domains of life (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Spiro, 2002</xref>). Recent studies have appreciated protein glycosylation in bacteria, which is often associated with pathogen virulence and immune modulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Szymanski and Wren, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abu-Qarn et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Nothaft and Szymanski, 2010</xref>). For instance, flagella glycosylation is found in many bacteria species including <italic>Campylobacter jejuni</italic>, <italic>Helicobacter pylori</italic>, <italic>Clostridium spp.</italic> and <italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic>, contributing to bacterial locomotion or virulence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Schirm et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Nothaft and Szymanski, 2010</xref>). Recently, we and others have shown that secreted effectors from enteropathogenic <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> (EPEC) and related enteric pathogens harbor an arginine <italic>N</italic>-acetylglucosamine transferase activity that modifies host death-domain proteins and is essential for bacterial colonization in infected mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Li et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Pearson et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>The autotransporter secretion pathway (also known as the type V secretion system) in bacteria delivers autotransporters onto the bacterial surface. Autotransporters, representing the largest family of bacterial virulence factors, share a similar structural organization containing a signal peptide followed by a functional passenger domain and a C-terminal β-barrel translocation domain. Autotransporters play a critical role in diverse aspects of bacterial physiology including proteolytic digestion of host proteins, biofilm formation, adhesion and invasion of host cells, and intracellular motility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Henderson et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Lazar Adler et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Wells et al., 2007</xref>). A subfamily of autotransporters, including AIDA-I (adhesin involved in diffuse adherence) from diffusely adhering <italic>E. coli</italic> (DAEC) 2787 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Benz and Schmidt, 1989</xref>) and TibA from enterotoxigenic <italic>E. coli</italic> (ETEC) H10407 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Elsinghorst and Weitz, 1994</xref>), are glycosylated in their passenger domains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Lindenthal and Elsinghorst, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Benz and Schmidt, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Sherlock et al., 2006</xref>), which functions in bacterial autoaggregation and adhesion to host cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Benz and Schmidt, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Sherlock et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Charbonneau and Mourez, 2007</xref>). AIDA-I and TibA-like autotransporters are present in diverse bacterial species. Previous studies carried out in the ectopic system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Benz and Schmidt, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Moormann et al., 2002</xref>) indicate a role for AAH (autotransporter adhesin heptosyltransferase) in DAEC and its ETEC homologue TibC in AIDA-I and TibA glycosylation. However, AAH and TibC harbor no sequence homology to known glycosyltransferases and there has been no biochemical evidence demonstrating their glycosyltransferase activity.</p><p>In a separate parallel study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Lu et al., 2014</xref>) we showed that AAH is a <italic>bona fide</italic> heptosyltransferase belonging to a large bacterial autotransporter heptosyltransferase (BAHT) family. Here we determine the crystal structures of TibC heptosyltransferase, both alone and in complex with ADP-D-glycero-β-D-manno-heptose (ADP-D,D-heptose). The structure shows a symmetric ring-shape dodecamer. The protomer features a β-hairpin thumb and an iron-finger motif, both required for the dodecamer assembly. The ligand-bound structure reveals a sugar transfer mechanism and determinants for the ligand stereoselectivity for TibC and AAH. Furthermore, electron cryomicroscopy (cryo-EM) analyses of a TibC–TibA dodecamer/hexamer enzyme–substrate complex reveal the structural basis for high efficient autotransporter hyperheptosylation by the TibC dodecamer.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>TibC catalyzes AIDA-I/TibA heptosylation and confers AIDA-I-mediated bacterial adhesion to host cells</title><p>We first confirmed the autotransporter heptosyltransferase activity of TibC and its function in mediating bacterial adhesion to host cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Lu et al., 2014</xref>). Co-expression of TibC or AAH together with AIDA-I in <italic>E. coli</italic> BL21 cells resulted in a tight adhesion of the bacteria to HeLa cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>) and AIDA-I glycosylation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). Co-expression of TibC also induced TibA glycosylation in the heterologous system (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). We further identified a minimal passenger domain fragment of TibA (TibA<sub>305-350</sub>) that could be efficiently glycosylated by TibC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D,E</xref>). TibA<sub>305-350</sub> tagged with Flag epitopes at both termini was then fused C-terminal to the Small Ubiquitin-like Modifier (SUMO). The SUMO-Flag-TibA<sub>305-350</sub>-Flag fusion protein showed a slower migration on the SDS-PAGE gel when co-expressed with TibC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>). Electrospray ionization (ESI) mass spectrometry analysis gave a mass of 20,758 Da that matched the theoretical mass (20,757 Da) of SUMO-Flag-TibA<sub>305-350</sub>-Flag (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>). Co-expression of TibC resulted in mass increase of 576, 768, or 960 Da, corresponding to the addition of 3, 4, and 5 heptoses, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>). The modified fusion protein was further digested with the endoproteinase Asp-N for liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) analysis. Asp-N digestion is expected to yield two major peptide fragments, DK-<sub>305</sub>SASKVIQNSGGAVITNTSAAVSGTN<sub>329</sub> and <sub>330</sub>DNGSFSIAGGSAVNMLLENGG<sub>350</sub>. We were able to detect abundant signals for both unmodified and modified DK-<sub>305</sub>SASKVIQNSGGAVITNTSAAVSGTN<sub>329</sub> in full scan MS analyses and only weak signals of the modified <sub>330</sub>DNGSFSIAGGSAVNMLLENGG<sub>350</sub> peptide, probably due to the hydrophobic nature. Mass measurements indicated that both peptides had multiple heptose modifications; a mixed population of modified peptides, containing different numbers of heptose conjugations, was observed. Similarly to that performed with AAH modification of AIDA-I (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Lu et al., 2014</xref>), serine residues (Ser-313 and Ser-322 within DK-<sub>305</sub>SASKVIQNSGGAVITNTSAAVSGTN<sub>329</sub>), but not threonine residues, were identified to be the modification sites by electron transfer dissociation (ETD) mass spectrometry (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1H</xref>). Supporting the heptosyltransferase activity of TibC, recombinant TibC was found to directly modify synthetic peptides derived from the passenger domains of either AIDA-I or TibA in which ADP-D,D-heptose, but not the anomer ADP-L,D-heptose, could serve as the sugar ligand (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1I</xref>).<fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.03714.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>TibC catalyzes TibA/AIDA-I heptosylation and confers AIDA-I-mediated bacterial adhesion to host cells.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) <italic>E. coli</italic> BL21 expressing EGFP was transformed with a plasmid harboring Flag-AIDA-I (pAIDA-I) together with a vector or Myc-tagged autotransporter adhesin heptosyltransferase (AAH)/TibC.

The overall shape of the dodecamer ring resembles a circular garland with an external diameter of 145 Å and a height of 72 Å. Parts of the 12 protomers are lined side by side at the central plate to form the stem of the garland with an inner diameter of ∼110 Å (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). The inner surface of the stem is decorated with uniformly distributed 12 ferric ions, forming a characteristic iron belt along the ring (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). The presence of ferric ions is expected from the brownish color of recombinant TibC protein in solution. Six symmetric TibC protomers project upwards from the central plate while the other six project downwards, generating a gear-like shape at both sides. Two adjacent TibC protomers projecting oppositely contact each other in a back-to-back manner around a dyad axis; six back-to-back dimers are further linked together in a hand-in-hand fashion around a sixfold axis to form the garland-like ring (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>).

Different from the classical Rossmann fold that has α-helices flanking the central β-sheet, the β-sheet in the N-lobe is flanked by α-helices (α1–4) at one side but the β-barrel at the other side (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>).

The β-hairpin thumb mediates the hand-in-hand contact between adjacent dimers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). Phe-265 and Val-266 at the tip of the thumb, together with a nearby Phe-368 from the catalytic domain, contact the same set of residues from the adjacent protomer to form a hydrophobic cluster (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). To validate the structural observations, the three residues were each subjected to mutational analyses. TibC F368D mutant was largely insoluble.

This was accomplished by soaking the sugar ligand into crystals of the catalytically inactive TibC D110A mutant. Structural determination was achieved by molecular replacement, which revealed extra omit density in the TibC catalytic domain.

The hydrogen bond contact, though weak, is incompatible with a guanine due to its saturated N1, providing a structural basis for the specificity of TibC in using ADP-activated sugar donor.

The β-phosphate has strong interactions with Thr-226 and Lys-230 in the ligand-binding pocket of TibC. Lys-230 is also close to the heptose hydroxyl O5; its positive charge could potentially alleviate the negative charge of β-phosphate, thereby facilitating nucleophilic attack of the heptose C1 by the substrate acceptor.<fig-group><fig id="fig6" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.03714.014</object-id><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><title>Crystal structure of the TibC-ADP-D,D-heptose complex and sugar ligand stereoselectivity.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Structure of the TibC-ADP-D,D-heptose complex.

In contrast, TibC exhibited a high stereoselectivity for ADP-D,D-heptose. To reveal the underlying structural basis, we modeled the structure of sugar ligand-bound AAH using the TibC complex as the template and examined TibC/AAH residues within 5 Å from the sugar ligand (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>). This led to the identification of residue 300 in TibC (294 in AAH) as a possible structural determinant. In TibC, residue 300 is a proline and its main-chain carbonyl oxygen forms two hydrogen bonds with D,D-heptose hydroxyl O4 and O6, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E</xref>). Notably, the latter interaction is incompatible with L,D-heptose due to the chiral inversion of C6 and the resulting spatial distance. For AAH, the side-chain hydroxyl of Ser-294 can have a polar interaction with hydroxyl O6 in D,D-heptose or hydroxyl O7 in L,D-heptose (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E</xref>), thereby capable of tolerating both sugar ligands. Consistent with these structural indications, TibC P300S mutant could use both ADP-D,D-heptose and ADP-L,D-heptose while AAH S294P mutant instead became selective for ADP-D,D-heptose (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2A</xref>).

Cryo-EM micrographs revealed a well-defined shape of the TibC–TibA dodecamer/hexamer complex at an intermediate resolution (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1A</xref>), allowing for single particle structural analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1 fig7s2">Figure 7—figure supplements 1, 2</xref>).

The cross-correlation coefficient (CCC) for TibA in the final model is 0.76 (only a small N-terminal portion of TibA<sub>55-350</sub> is out of the density). The reconstruction revealed that six TibA<sub>55-350</sub> molecules are distributed along the inner surface of the TibC dodecamer ring and share its sixfold axis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref>). Importantly, each TibA<sub>55-350</sub> binds to two TibC protomers of a back-to-back dimer, suggesting that two enzyme molecules are responsible for catalyzing full heptosylation of one TibA substrate. Ser-176 is the closest sugar acceptor situated at the entrance of the catalytic cleft of one TibC protomer (TibC-A), but the distance to the catalytic base exceeds 20 Å (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s3">Figure 7—figure supplement 3A</xref>). A similar distance was observed between the other TibC protomer (TibC-B) and its possible substrate acceptor (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s3">Figure 7—figure supplement 3A</xref>). Thus, the 8.9 Å TibC–TibA dodecamer/hexamer complex model represents a sugar transfer incompetent state, designated hereafter as the resting state. Moreover, the spiral shaft of TibA β-helix adopts a trend roughly parallel to the sixfold axis of the dodecamer which, together with the patterned solenoid-like surface distribution of heptosylation sites on TibA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Lu et al., 2014</xref>), indicates a possible screw propelling-like mechanism for processive heptosylation of TibA by the dodecamer ring.</p></sec><sec id="s2-10"><title>Active state of the TibC–TibA dodecamer/hexamer complex</title><p>The static X-ray structures of TibC dodecamer and TibA<sub>55-350</sub> were also docked into the 8.2 Å EM map, but the TibA moiety had a few degrees of bending with a protrusion into the catalytic center of one TibC protomer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A,B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s3">Figure 7—figure supplement 3B</xref>). The extra protruding density could not be appropriately fit despite extensive attempts at possible solutions. The heterogeneity observed in the cryo-EM image likely reflects the dynamic catalytic motions; the protruding density was tentatively interpreted as the TibA loop bearing the sugar acceptor Ser-176. This interpretation was supported by molecular dynamics (MD) simulation of a resting state TibC<sub>2</sub>–TibA<sub>55-350</sub> trimer. In the 400 ps steered MD simulation, pulling Ser-176 in TibA<sub>55-350</sub> towards the heptose led to a proportional increase in the CCC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D, E</xref>). A subsequent 20 ns unbiased MD simulation produced an ensemble of TibA models that matched the EM density with a best overall CCC value of 0.87 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>). The final model of the entire complex was well accommodated by the experimental map (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s3">Figure 7—figure supplement 3B</xref>). The protruding loop was assigned to residues 170–180 of TibA, resulting from disruption of a local β-strand within these residues. The loop placed Ser-176 into a position ready for attacking the sugar donor in one TibC protomer (TibC-A) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s3">Figure 7—figure supplement 3C</xref>). This ‘protrusion’ state of TibA was designated as the catalytically competent active state. Notably, the other TibC protomer (TibC-B) in the back-to-back dimer and its possible substrate acceptor appeared to be in the resting state (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s3">Figure 7—figure supplement 3C,D</xref>), suggesting that only one of the two enzyme molecules in the dimer can be productive in transferring the sugar onto TibA at a time. It is worth mentioning here that the EM dataset presumably covers a continuous series of catalytic stages; the two discrete classifications employed in our reconstruction may not give a complete picture of all catalytic motions of the TibC–TibA enzyme/substrate complex. The active state structure, which was reconstructed from two-thirds of the total particles, probably contains the majority of representative conformational stages in the catalytic process and therefore is used to represent the overall structure of the TibC–TibA dodecamer/hexamer complex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><sec id="s3-1"><title>The large ring-shape platform of TibC dodecamer for efficient heptosylation of TibA</title><p>TibC is distinct from known glycosyltransferases in that it adopts an unusual giant dodecamer ring architecture in catalyzing simultaneous glycosylation of six molecules of TibA autotransporter. The selection of a double-layered ring with a large hollow channel is advantageous and provides a favorable environment for cooperative catalysis in a structurally economical manner. Assembly of the dodecamer into a ring can reduce the solvent-accessible surface area and renders a stable enzymatic machinery complex beneficial to efficient catalysis. Moreover, the spatial arrangement of the back-to-back TibC dimer, binding to the different glycosylation sites in one TibA, suggests a divalent catalysis is also probably contributing to the high catalytic efficiency required for hyperglycosylation. Thus, the dodecamer/hexamer enzyme/substrate complex with six symmetric units may represent a best compromise between structural economy and catalytic cooperativity/efficiency.</p><p>The TibC complex, compared with other macromolecular assemblies with large interior volumes such as ferritin and multimeric chaperones/proteases, is more permeable with 12 titled grooves extending from outside to the interior chamber. These grooves are optimally imbedded and close to the catalytic center, allowing for easy access of ADP-heptose from outside into the TibC particle. The catalytic center, on the other hand, is structurally best accessible from the interior, where TibA is located and can readily deliver the to-be-glycosylated serine by loop protrusion. We further speculate that the energy used to drive the rotation and shuttle motion of the TibA substrate is partially derived from breakdown of the ADP-heptose glycosidic bond occurring during catalysis. Further experiments such as obtaining a higher resolution cryo-EM structure of the TibC<sub>12</sub>–TibA<sub>6</sub> complex, which may capture more catalytic stages/events, are necessary to validate the proposed model for TibC-catalyzed processive heptosylation of TibA.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>The unique iron-finger motif</title><p>Another most unusual feature of the TibC protomer structure is the presence of the 1Fe-0S iron-finger motif. The iron-finger motif does not fulfill the previously defined function of serving as an electron carrier in rubredoxin protein. Biochemical and structural studies have underscored the singular importance of this motif in mediating the back-to-back dimer formation and TibA substrate recognition. Interestingly, the iron-finger motif, adopting a topological fold similar to the zinc-finger motif, follows a right-handed helical path in binding to TibA β-helix, which is analogous to DNA binding by zinc-finger motifs. In addition, the recognition specificity and the interaction strength of this motif will have been precisely tuned during macromolecular evolution so that specific substrate recognition, sliding of the TibA β-helix along the reaction channel, and efficient protrusion of the TibA loop can all occur in a catalytically productive manner. It will be interesting to elucidate the detailed mechanism by which iron-finger motif-mediated substrate recognition is effectively coupled with its promoting of the TibA loop protrusion.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Constructs and recombinant proteins</title><p>The cDNAs encoding TibC and TibA were PCR amplified from genomic DNA of ETEC strain H10407.

An aliquot of 3.5 μl of TibC or TibC–TibA<sub>55-350</sub> complex (∼1 mg/ml) was absorbed onto a glow-discharged Quantifoil holey carbon grid (R2.1, 300 mesh; Jena Biosciences, Germany). The grid was blotted in an FEI Vitrobot Mark IV (FEI Company, Hilsboro, OR) using 4 s blotting time and blotting force 2 with 100% humidity at 283 K, and then plunged into the chilled liquid ethane. The grids were immediately transferred into a Titan Krios electron microscope (FEI Company) operated at 300 kV. For the TibC dodecamer, approximately 3000 images were semi-automatically collected following the Leginon procedure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Carragher et al., 2000</xref>) using a 4 K × 4 K Gatan UltraScan4000 CCD (model 895, Gatan Inc, Pleasanton, CA) at a nominal magnification of 75,000×. For the TibC–TibA<sub>55-350</sub> complex, ∼1800 cryo-EM images were recorded using a 2K × 2K Gatan Tridiem CCD camera (Gatan Inc) at a nominal magnification of 81,000× with the energy filter turned off. The corresponding pixel size on the specimen level is 1.196 and 1.778 Å/pixel for TibC and TibC–TibA<sub>55-350</sub> complex datasets, respectively. The range of nominal defocus is 2.3–3.6 μm for TibC and 2.7–4.1 μm for TibC–TibA<sub>55-350</sub> data. The electron dose is 20 e−/Å·s for each CCD frame. For both TibC and TibC–TibA<sub>55-350</sub> micrographs, the particles were semi-automatically boxed using e2boxer.py in EMAN2 package (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Tang et al., 2007</xref>) followed by interactively screening. The particles with the wrong shape and size were discarded. Approximately 10,200 and 56,000 particle images were cropped out and normalized (mean = 0, standard deviation = 1) for TibC and TibC–TibA<sub>55-350</sub> complex, respectively. After determining the defocus and B-factor, the particles were phase-flipped for contrast transfer function (CTF) correction using e2ctf.py in EMAN2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Tang et al., 2007</xref>).</p><p>For the TibC dataset, two-dimensional multivariate statistical analysis-based reference-free classification was performed in EMAN2 to further eliminate particles belonging to the class averages with blurry appearance. Particles contained in the averages, which were redundant in the ring-like view, were also removed to avoid introducing orientation isotropy. A total of 8546 particles from the TibC data were used for subsequent data processing. The initial model was built using e2initialmodel.py with C1 symmetry applied and was iteratively refined against the phase-flipped particles until no further improvement could be obtained. During the projection-matching refinement process, a Fourier ring correlation (FRC) was chosen to compare the similarity between the class averages and re-projections of the model, and C6 symmetry was enforced as indicated by the reference-free class averages. 20% of the worst particles in each class were discarded in each round of iteration. The information over a 20–100 Å resolution range and SSNR weighting were considered in the comparison in several early iterations. In the last four rounds of iterations, the information was expanded to the full resolution range and the step angle was assigned to 2.0°. The map obtained in the last iteration was then subjected to B-factor correction with a damping factor of −210 Å<sup>2</sup> to enhance the high resolution information using the program embfactor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Fernandez et al., 2008</xref>).</p><p>For the TibC–TibA<sub>55-350</sub> complex data, the processing procedure before reconstruction was similar to that described for the TibC data above. A total of 53,303 particles were finally employed for 3D reconstruction. The starting model used was a 60 Å low-pass filtered TibC dodecamer reconstruction (C6 symmetry applied). After several rounds of refinement running, the phase-flipped particle images were imported into RELION (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Scheres, 2012</xref>) for 3D classification. After 30 rounds of iterations with three-class classification, two classes that contained 35,300 members in total and showed almost identical reconstruction in the TibA density were merged together for subsequent 3D refinement. Finally, two clusters that corresponded to the ‘active’ and ‘resting’ conformations of the complex were acquired. After the 3D refinement converged, the particles corresponding to the two clusters were sorted for subsequent single-model projection-matching refinement in EMAN2. Final maps for the two conformations were independently reconstructed through projection-matching refinement with the step angle of 1.68° for the active conformation and 3.6° for the resting conformation.

Your article has been favorably evaluated by Richard Losick (Senior editor) and 3 reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors.</p><p>The Reviewing editor and the other reviewers discussed their comments before we reached this decision, and the Reviewing editor has assembled the following comments to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>The authors show, both in <italic>E. coli</italic> and <italic>in vitro</italic>, that TibC heptosylates the autotransporters TibA and AIDA-I. These findings are both notable for the identification of the enzyme responsible for glycosylation, because the sequence did not reveal such activity, and because of the dearth of information about heptosylating enzymes. In addition, the authors provide the X-ray structure of TibC, the first of the BAHT family of bacterial heptosyltransferases. The structure is an unusual ring-shaped dodecamer, with a catalytic domain that resembles the classic GT-B motif of nucleotide activated glycosyltransferases. However, the enzyme forms an unprecedented dodecamer in solution and, remarkably, in the asymmetric unit of the crystal structure. The authors show that a beta-hairpin thumb is essential for catalysis and dimerization and subsequent dodecamerization. They also prepared structure-guided mutants and analyzed the effects on catalysis. One of the mutants resulted in a cocrystal structure with ADP-D, D-heptose, which supported the proposed roles of several amino acids. The authors also describe a number of additional interesting features of the structure including a unique iron finger motif that contributes to back to back dimerization within the dodecamer. Finally, they used cryo-EM to analyze the autotransporter TibA and the complex of TibA and TibC, suggesting the complex consists of 12 TibC and 6 TibA molecules. The reviewers all agree that these are exciting findings that provide a significant contribution to the glycosyltransferase/carbohydrate, autotransporter, and post-translational modification fields that warrant publication in <italic>eLife</italic>.</p><p>The reviewers were much less enthusiastic about the MD simulations and the strong conclusions drawn from them. The suggested protrusion mechanism for the glycosylation acceptor sites is very speculative and even the notion that the enzyme indeed performs processive catalysis is not supported by any biochemical data. This part of the manuscript is not needed for an otherwise very good story and insufficiently supported at present for publication. It is requested to either remove the model or gather much more experimental data (structural and kinetic) in support of a processive, screw propelling mechanism.</p><p>The reviewers request you to address the questions listed below in your manuscript: 1) The authors need to include B-factors for the protein and ligand ADP-D, D-heptose in the data collection table, especially for the low-resolution data set of the ligand complex.</p><p>2) The authors need to test whether the TibC mutant that was amenable to crystallization has the identical enzymatic activity of the parent.</p><p>3) The authors need to include analytical ultracentrifugation or SEC-multi-angle light scattering in addition to their gel filtration data to determine in a more quantitative manner the molecular weights in solution for TibC alone and the TibA-TibC complex.</p><p>4) The authors should, in addition to the 2FoFc map, also include an FoFc omit map of the ligand-binding site with the ligand excluded from the refinement (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>).

The authors need to show the data as it will aid future investigations in other labs.</p><p>6) The authors need to describe in more detail how they know the metal is iron (color alone is not definitive). They should provide ICP-MS and/or SAD data. In addition, the refined B-factors of the irons should be listed.</p><p>7) The authors show two stereoisomers of nucleotide-heptose are accepted by AAH. It will be important to know if one is used much more efficiently as it could have an impact on the identity of the heptoses on AIDA_I in DAEC.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.03714.022</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p>We have performed all the suggested experiments and fully addressed the comments made by the reviewers. Meanwhile, we would like to bring to your attention that about a week ago we published a sister article complementary to the current study in <italic>Cell Host &amp; Microbe</italic>. In that paper (<italic>Cell Host &amp; Microbe</italic>, 16, 351–363), we focus on the biochemical and biological functions (in both cell culture and mouse infection) of AAH heptosylation of AIDA-I autotransporter and biochemically define and characterize the BAHT family of heptosyltransferase. The main points of the <italic>Cell Host &amp; Microbe</italic> paper do not overlap with the current manuscript that is more focused on the structure of TibC alone and in complex with the sugar donor as well as the TibA substrate. The two papers illustrate a complete story of the BAHT family of heptosyltransferase from genetic and physiological function to biochemical characterization and structural mechanism. The two papers, coming out around the same time, will generate a bigger impact in the field of bacterial pathogenesis and protein glycosylation.</p><p><italic>The reviewers were much less enthusiastic about the MD simulations and the strong conclusions drawn from them. The suggested protrusion mechanism for the glycosylation acceptor sites is very speculative and even the notion that the enzyme indeed performs processive catalysis is not supported by any biochemical data. This part of the manuscript is not needed for an otherwise very good story and insufficiently supported at present for publication. It is requested to either remove the model or gather much more experimental data (structural and kinetic) in support of a processive, screw propelling mechanism</italic>.</p><p>Following the reviewer’s particular suggestion, we have removed the MD simulation part (Figure 8 and its supplement) and also the model for processive heptosylation mechanism (Figure 9). Despite that we have compromised to satisfy the reviewers, we would like to emphasize that our MD simulation was performed at a highest standard. We are very confident that the results are of sufficient quality, and insightful and stimulating for the enzyme catalysis field. We will submit that part of the story separately. However, I do understand that a hard-core experimental biologist may not appreciate the computational results that much.</p><p><italic>1) The authors need to include B-factors for the protein and ligand ADP-D, D-heptose in the data collection table, especially for the low-resolution data set of the ligand complex</italic>.</p><p>As requested by the reviewers, we have updated the crystallography table, in which the B-factors for the protein and ligand are included. The refined B-factors for the iron are also listed in response to another comment raised by the reviewer. It is important to note that the B factor for the protein ligand complex is arbitrarily assigned and fixed to 150 for the final refinement because the relatively resolution of the TibC/ADP-heptose complex (3.9 Å), which is a general practice in protein crystallography. The reason we chose this method for the low resolution refinement is because fixed B-factor refinement could reduce the unfavorable ratio of parameters (degrees of freedom) vs data to avoid the potential overfitting problem. In fact, it is a common sense that the atomic B-factors have little significance to reflect the internal thermal motion of atoms when the resolution falls below 3.5 Å. In practice, this method produces the lowest Rfree. Accordingly, we have added a REMARK card to the deposited coordinate file to indicate this.</p><p><italic>2) The authors need to test whether the TibC mutant that was amenable to crystallization has the identical enzymatic activity of the parent</italic>.</p><p>Done. In the revised <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A, B</xref> and C, we now demonstrate that TibC mutant used for crystallization has the identical enzymatic activity and biological function as the wild type protein.</p><p><italic>3) The authors need to include analytical ultracentrifugation or SEC-multi-angle light scattering in addition to their gel filtration data to determine in a more quantitative manner the molecular weights in solution for TibC alone and the TibA-TibC complex</italic>.</p><p>Done. We have performed the requested analytical ultracentrifugation experiments. The data included as new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2–figure supplement 2</xref> show the measured molecular masses of both TibC alone and TibA-TibC complex, which are consistent with the gel filtration data.</p><p><italic>4) The authors should, in addition to the 2FoFc map, also include an FoFc omit map of the ligand-binding site with the ligand excluded from the refinement (</italic><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6"><italic>Figure 6B</italic></xref><italic>).

Please see the revised <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>, which includes an FoFc omit map of the ligand-binding site (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>) and the distances of the Pro-ligand and Ser-Ligand (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E</xref>).</p><p><italic>5) The authors mention use of a tandem MS experiment, but they list it as data not shown. The authors need to show the data as it will aid future investigations in other labs</italic>.</p><p>Done. We have included the tandem MS data as the new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1H</xref>.</p><p><italic>6) The authors need to describe in more detail how they know the metal is iron (color alone is not definitive). They should provide ICP-MS and/or SAD data. In addition, the refined B-factors of the irons should be listed</italic>.</p><p>We have recently published a sister paper in <italic>Cell Host &amp; Microbe</italic>, in which we demonstrate the biochemical activity of AAH and more importantly, the physiological function of AIDA-I heptosylation in a mouse infection model. In that paper, we did perform ICP-MS analysis and demonstrate that the color results from the iron in TibC protein. We have cited the <italic>Cell Host &amp; Microbe</italic> paper to indicate this information. Moreover, our TibC crystal structure was solved by using anomalous signals from the bound ferric ion, which confirms from another angel that the metal is iron. The B-factor for iron has also been included in the revised Table 1.</p><p><italic>7) The authors show two stereoisomers of nucleotide-heptose are accepted by AAH. It will be important to know if one is used much more efficiently as it could have an impact on the identity of the heptoses on AIDA_I in DAEC</italic>.</p><p>In response to the reviewers’ comments, we have titrated the amounts of AAH for both ADP-D, D-heptose and the anomer ADP-L, D-heptose ligands in the <italic>in vitro</italic> enzymatic assay. The data included as <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6-figure supplement 2B</xref> show that AAH has a slight preference for ADP-L, D-heptose vs ADP-D, D-heptose. As a continuous enzymatic assay allowing for quantitative measurements of enzyme kinetics has not been established for this kind of novel enzymatic activity, the Western blot-based titration data is only of an indication nature, but does provide some useful information for future studies.</p></body></sub-article></article>
