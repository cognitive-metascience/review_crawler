Mutations of proteins in the pathway cause neurodegenerative diseases, suggesting defective mitochondrial turnover contributes to neurodegeneration. In primary rat hippocampal neurons, we developed a mitophagy induction paradigm where mild oxidative stress induced low levels of mitochondrial damage. Mitophagy-associated proteins were sequentially recruited to depolarized mitochondria followed by sequestration into autophagosomes. The localization of these mitophagy events had a robust somal bias. In basal and induced conditions, engulfed mitochondria remained in non-acidified organelles for hours to days, illustrating efficient autophagosome sequestration but delayed lysosomal fusion or acidification. Furthermore, expression of an ALS-linked mutation in the pathway disrupted mitochondrial network integrity and this effect was exacerbated by oxidative stress. Thus, age-related decline in neuronal health or expression of disease-associated mutations in the pathway may exacerbate the slow kinetics of neuronal mitophagy, leading to neurodegeneration.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>mitophagy</kwd><kwd>neurodegeneration</kwd><kwd>mitochondrial quality control</kwd><kwd>autophagy</kwd><kwd>parkin</kwd><kwd>lysosome acidification</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd><kwd>Rat</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000065</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R37 NS060698</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Holzbaur</surname><given-names>Erika LF</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000011</institution-id><institution>Howard Hughes Medical Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Hanna H Gray Fellowship</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Evans</surname><given-names>Chantell S</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>In neuronal mitophagy, Parkin and OPTN induce efficient sequestration of damaged somal mitochondria into autophagosomes, but slow turnover via lysosomal acidification may be a point of vulnerability for the cell.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The mitochondrial network is a dynamic interconnected system of organelles undergoing continuous renewal and rearrangement to support cellular needs. Given that neurons have high-energy demands at sites far from the soma, the targeted delivery and regulated removal of mitochondria are essential at these distal sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Millecamps and Julien, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Sheng, 2014</xref>). These organelles utilize mitochondrial membrane potential to perform cellular functions, including energy generation and Ca<sup>2+</sup> buffering. Mitochondrial damage or depolarization decreases function and signals maintenance mechanisms to repair or eliminate damaged organelles.</p><p>Due to the unique characteristics of neurons, multiple quality control mechanisms likely function independently to maintain mitochondrial health (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Evans and Holzbaur, 2019</xref>). In one pathway, mitochondrial fragments are engulfed in autophagosomes via basal, non-selective autophagy that initiates in the distal axon (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Maday and Holzbaur, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib105">Wong and Holzbaur, 2014b</xref>). Autophagy, a conserved lysosomal degradation pathway, involves the engulfment of cargo to be degraded by a double-membrane organelle. Autophagosomes mature during trafficking along the axon to the soma by fusion with lysosomes, which leads to efficient cargo degradation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Cheng et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Hollenbeck, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Lee et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Maday and Holzbaur, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Maday et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Neisch et al., 2017</xref>). In a second maintenance mechanism, dysfunctional mitochondria are removed through selective mitophagy, where damaged organelles are specifically sequestered and eliminated from the cell, also via the autophagic machinery (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Harper et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Misgeld and Schwarz, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Nguyen et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib100">Wang and Klionsky, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib108">Youle and Narendra, 2011</xref>). This pathway has been implicated in several neurodegenerative diseases including Parkinson's disease (PD) and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Evans and Holzbaur, 2019</xref>).</p><p>Mitophagy is primarily regulated by two proteins linked to familial PD, PTEN-Induced Putative Kinase 1 (PINK1) and Parkin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Kitada et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Narendra et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Narendra et al., 2010b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">Valente et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib100">Wang and Klionsky, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib108">Youle and Narendra, 2011</xref>). PINK1 recruits Parkin to phospho-ubiquitinate outer mitochondrial membrane proteins, which act as a specific cue for organelle degradation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Geisler et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Kane et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Kazlauskaite et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Koyano et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Matsuda et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Narendra et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Narendra et al., 2010b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Ordureau et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Ordureau et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Poole et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Sarraf et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib98">Vives-Bauza et al., 2010</xref>). Optineurin (OPTN), an autophagy receptor causative for glaucoma and ALS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Maruyama and Kawakami, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Maruyama et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Rezaie et al., 2002</xref>), is recruited to the mitochondrial surface where it interacts with ubiquitin through its ubiquitin binding in ABIN and NEMO (UBAN) domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Gleason et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Heo et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Lazarou et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Moore and Holzbaur, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Rogov et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib103">Wild et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib104">Wong and Holzbaur, 2014a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib111">Zhu et al., 2007</xref>). Other mitophagy receptors, such as Nuclear Dot Protein 52 kDa (NDP52) and TAX1 Binding Protein 1 (TAX1BP1), may be recruited in parallel, downstream from Parkin activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Heo et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Lazarou et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Moore and Holzbaur, 2016</xref>). OPTN association with the damaged mitochondrial surface is stabilized though phosphorylation by TANK-Binding Kinase 1 (TBK1), a serine/threonine kinase mutated in familial ALS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Freischmidt et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Heo et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Richter et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib103">Wild et al., 2011</xref>). Subsequently, microtubule-associated protein light chain 3 (LC3), is targeted to the ubiquitinated mitochondria via the LC3 interacting region (LIR) of OPTN (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Stolz et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib103">Wild et al., 2011</xref>), leading to engulfment of the organelle inside an LC3-positive autophagosome. Thus, OPTN is specifically recruited to depolarized organelles to mediate sequestration by an autophagosome and eventual degradation following lysosomal fusion.</p><p>Initial work to characterize mitophagy was performed in non-polarized cell types, such as HeLa cells, with subsequent studies focused on analyzing this mechanism in neurons. These results have been controversial, and the relative contribution of PINK1/Parkin-dependent mitophagy to neuronal health in vivo remains unclear. The mitophagy pathway in primary neuronal cultures appears to utilize the same molecular players described in non-neuronal cell lines, suggesting that PINK1/Parkin-mediated mitophagy is a conserved process across cell types. Surprisingly, however, in vivo studies have not fully supported this idea. PINK1 and Parkin knock-out (KO) mice display mild phenotypes with no dopaminergic neuron loss, a hallmark of PD, implying there are additional compensatory pathways contributing to neuronal mitophagy in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Akundi et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Goldberg et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Kitada et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Perez and Palmiter, 2005</xref>). In sharp contrast, KO rat models of PINK1 exhibited significant dopaminergic neuron loss, and null or mutant flies of PINK1 or Parkin display morphological defects in dopaminergic neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Cha et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Clark et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Dave et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Park et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib102">Whitworth et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib106">Yang et al., 2006</xref>). The use of the acid-sensitive <italic>mito</italic>-QC mitophagy probe also did not reveal deficits in tissues of high metabolic demand in mice (<italic>mito</italic>-QC<sup>+/+</sup> <italic>Pink1</italic><sup>-/-</sup>) or in dopaminergic neurons of PINK1 and Parkin mutant flies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Lee et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">McWilliams et al., 2018</xref>). However, the use of another acid-sensitive mt-Keima probe illustrated insufficiencies in basal mitophagy in dopaminergic neurons of Parkin-deficient flies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Cornelissen et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Katayama et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Sun et al., 2015</xref>). Using the same probe in non-neuronal cells, essential roles for PINK1 and Parkin were shown in mitophagy following exhaustive exercise, hypoxic exposure, or rotenone treatment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Kim et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Sliter et al., 2018</xref>). Further, stable isotope labeling of flies showed a slowing in the turnover of mitochondrial proteins isolated from the heads of Parkin null flies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib97">Vincow et al., 2013</xref>). Interestingly, recent work described an inflammatory phenotype in PINK1 and Parkin KO mice after acute or chronic mitochondrial stress that could be rescued by depletion of a regulator of the type 1 IFN signaling response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Sliter et al., 2018</xref>). Thus, the respective roles of PINK1 and Parkin in mitophagy versus inflammation remain unclear, making it important to more fully characterize this pathway in neurons.</p><p>Neurons are highly polarized cells with extended axonal and dendritic processes and significant local energy demands (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Misgeld and Schwarz, 2017</xref>). This cellular morphology results in unique challenges for the cell and raises interesting questions as to whether all mitochondria are subject to the same quality control mechanisms and whether neuronal mitophagy is spatially regulated. In primary cortical neurons, the use of cyanide m-chlorophenylhydrazone (CCCP) treatment to induce mitochondrial damage resulted in an accumulation of Parkin-positive mitochondria in somatodendritic compartments, where damaged organelles underwent autophagosome engulfment and lysosomal degradation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cai et al., 2012</xref>). Neurons treated with CCCP or Antimycin A (AA; a potent complex III inhibitor) displayed enhanced retrograde mitochondrial motility, suggesting damaged organelles are trafficked back to the soma for degradation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cai et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Miller and Sheetz, 2004</xref>). This finding is supported by a recent report in which photo-converted axonal mitochondria underwent mitophagy in the soma after oxygen/glucose deprivation and reperfusion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib110">Zheng et al., 2019</xref>). In contrast, a study using hippocampal neurons characterized axonal mitophagy induced by treatment with AA or by selective local damage using the construct mito-KillerRed, a genetically encoded photosensitizer that causes light-induced reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Ashrafi et al., 2014</xref>). Clearance of axonal mitochondria was reported to be locally mediated by the autophagic pathway and dependent on PINK1 and Parkin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Ashrafi et al., 2014</xref>). In addition, several reports have described arrested axonal mitochondrial motility after damage due to the removal of Miro, a mitochondrial motor adaptor protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Hsieh et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Liu et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib99">Wang et al., 2011</xref>). These later findings have led to a model in which damaged mitochondria remain stationary to allow for efficient local degradation and to prevent dissemination of damaged components through fusion, but consensus on this point is lacking (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib110">Zheng et al., 2019</xref>). However, in vivo studies of mitophagy in PINK1 or Parkin mutant flies found no enhanced accumulation of axonal mitochondria in motor neurons, but did report dramatic changes in the morphology of somal mitochondria, indicating neuronal mitophagy may be compartmentally restricted (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Devireddy et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Sung et al., 2016</xref>). Furthermore, analysis of basal mitophagy in Purkinje cells from <italic>mito</italic>-QC mice illustrated mitophagic events in somatodendritic compartments, with no axonal events reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">McWilliams et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>One potential reason for the apparent disconnect between in vitro and in vivo studies, as well as the lack of consensus among studies using primary neurons may be the methods used to initiate mitochondrial damage, including treatments with reagents that are highly toxic to neuronal health. Here, we developed a protocol in which mild oxidative stress was used to induce low levels of mitochondrial damage in primary hippocampal neurons without compromising the entire neuronal network, allowing us to readily visualize turnover under conditions in which stressed cells remain viable. Live-cell imaging was used to visualize the spatiotemporal dynamics of mitophagy-associated protein recruitment to damaged mitochondrial fragments. We found a pronounced accumulation of OPTN-positive mitochondria in the somal compartment of stressed neurons. In contrast, OPTN recruitment was rarely visualized in either dendrites or axons. The time course of mitophagy appears to be much slower in neurons than other cell types, with acidification and clearance occurring many hours after initial damage. Expression of an ALS-associated mutation in OPTN is sufficient to disrupt mitochondrial health under basal conditions and this is exacerbated by oxidative stress. Together, these data indicate that OPTN-dependent mitophagy is an important pathway for both the homeostatic regulation of the somal mitochondrial network and the cellular response to stress.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Low-level induction of ROS leads to selective mitochondrial damage without compromising the overall mitochondrial network</title><p>We used multicolor live-cell imaging to examine the spatial and temporal dynamics of mitophagy following mitochondrial damage.

In parallel, a low dose of AA (3 nM) was used as a positive control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Cell viability limited the time frame of AA treatment, but since AA is a more potent damaging agent, the 2 h AA time point was compared to the 6 h time points from either AO-free or control conditions.

Thus, large-scale changes in mitochondrial morphology or polarization state were not detected in the somal mitochondrial network following stress.</p><p>In neurons, we examined the endogenous expression levels of mitophagy-associated proteins, including Parkin, TBK1, OPTN, LC3, and LAMP1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Heo et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Lazarou et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Moore and Holzbaur, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Narendra et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Richter et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib104">Wong and Holzbaur, 2014a</xref>). Protein levels remained consistent across treatments, with the exception of an increase in Parkin expression following 1 h AO-free treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1GâH</xref>), although it should be noted that the magnitude of the increase was comparable to the nonsignificant increases in Parkin levels following other mitophagy treatments. We also observed no significant differences in the expression levels of ATG5 and ATG16L1, proteins required for autophagy initiation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1B-C</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Mizushima et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Suzuki et al., 2001</xref>). The lack of change in endogenous protein expression suggests that under these conditions, mitophagy is driven by the translocation of existing proteins to damaged mitochondria rather than de novo protein synthesis, which correlates with the time-sensitive nature of this mechanism. However, it is possible that small changes in protein levels due to mitophagic flux cannot be detected via Western blot analysis.</p><p>We next determined whether our mitochondrial damage paradigm was sufficient to not only induce organelle damage, but to initiate neuronal mitophagy. In HeLa cells expressing exogenous Parkin, OPTN was efficiently recruited to fragmented mitochondria within 30 min following CCCP treatment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Moore and Holzbaur, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib104">Wong and Holzbaur, 2014a</xref>). In contrast, Parkin is endogenously expressed in hippocampal neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1GâH</xref>), so Parkin overexpression was not utilized in these experiments unless explicitly stated, to ensure that overexpression did not hyperactivate the pathway leading to non-physiological levels of mitophagy. Cells were transfected with Mito-DsRed and Halo-OPTN and treated for 1 h with control or AO-free media. Monitoring across focal planes using z-stack images, we visualized OPTN rings formed around small spherical mitochondrial fragments distributed throughout the soma (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1I</xref> and <xref ref-type="video" rid="video1">Video 1</xref>).

In contrast, the percentage of OPTN puncta on linear mitochondria was similar in either condition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1D</xref>). It should be noted that the majority of OPTN puncta (~60â70%) were not associated with mitochondria. These puncta may represent either the self-association of OPTN or the recruitment of OPTN to other autophagy substrates, such as protein aggregates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Korac et al., 2013</xref>). Of note, OPTN puncta were also observed in cells expressing endogenous levels of OPTN by immunocytochemistry, indicating they are not a consequence of overexpression.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>OPTN and TBK1 are specifically recruited to damaged mitochondria in hippocampal neurons</title><p>In non-neuronal cells, OPTN, NDP52, and TAX1BP1 are proposed to mediate the autophagic clearance of damaged mitochondria, while p62 clusters organelles without directly facilitating mitophagy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Heo et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Lazarou et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Moore and Holzbaur, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Narendra et al., 2010a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib104">Wong and Holzbaur, 2014a</xref>).

After mitophagy induction by mild oxidative stress, most mitochondria exhibited normal dynamics and were dual-labeled with Mito-DsRed and TMRE. In contrast, OPTN-positive mitochondria were labeled with Mito-DsRed but displayed little to no TMRE signal, demonstrating specific OPTN recruitment to damaged organelles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). Additionally, we noted that the mitophagy-associated proteins Parkin and TBK1 robustly colocalized along with OPTN to damaged, ubiquitinated organelles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2DâF</xref>).

To address this question, we first characterized the effect of mild oxidative stress in the axon. We measured axonal mitochondria and autophagosome dynamics and observed no differences in motility, density, and area flux between conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3âfigure supplement 1AâH</xref>). Recent work has shown that oxygen/glucose deprivation and reperfusion induce a transient upregulation of retrograde mitochondrial motility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib110">Zheng et al., 2019</xref>), so it possible that there was a transient response prior to our observation window. While we did note a decrease in the length of axonal mitochondria in both AO-free and AA conditions compared to control conditions, we found no significant difference in TMRE signal per cell (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3âfigure supplement 1IâJ</xref>). The decrease in length suggests that mitochondrial fragmentation may be induced by oxidative damage, so we measured the average number of fusion and fission events per neuron, but saw no change in mitochondrial fission (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3âfigure supplement 1K</xref>).</p><p>Next, we investigated the spatial dynamics of OPTN-mediated neuronal mitophagy by acquiring z-stacks of neuronal compartments (soma, dendrite, or axon) following mitophagy treatments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3AâC</xref>). Cells were transfected with Mito-DsRed, Halo-OPTN, and YFP-Nav<sub>II-III</sub>, which localizes to the proximal region of the axon initial segment (AIS) and was used to discriminate between axons and dendrites. A higher percentage of AO-free treated neurons displayed OPTN-positive mitochondria compared to control cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>). Strikingly, in AO-free treated neuronsÂ ~Â 95% of all mitophagic events occurred in the somal compartment, with limited events in either dendrites or axons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>); this trend was also observed in control conditions.

To address this possibility, we searched specifically for mitophagic events in the axons of control and treated cells.

In sharp contrast to our observations of LAMP1 co-localization, nearly all mitophagy events observed were LysoT-negative, no matter the treatment condition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>). A small number of OPTN-positive mitochondria became LysoT-positive at longer timepoints. These observations illustrate that following induction of neuronal mitophagy, acidification and turnover of damaged mitochondria is quite slow.</p><p>However, it may be that our mitophagy induction paradigm unexpectedly disrupts the acidification state of cellular autophagosomes and lysosomes. We examined the acidification of both organelles and determined that neither autophagosome nor lysosome acidification was disrupted by antioxidant deprivation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5âfigure supplement 1AâC</xref>). These data are consistent with previous reports that autophagosomes effectively fuse with lysosomes to degrade cargo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Boland et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Kimura et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Lee et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Maday et al., 2012</xref>). In addition, we monitored expression level of Transcription Factor EB (TFEB), a master transcriptional regulator of genes that are involved in lysosomal biogenesis and function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bajaj et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Sardiello, 2016</xref>).

We saw no changes in the levels of TFEB or pTFEB<sup>S211</sup> across all treatments compared to control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5EâG</xref>). We also examined Cathepsin D (CatD), a protease localized to lysosomes that nonspecifically degrades autophagosomal contents following autophagosome-lysosome fusion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Benes et al., 2008</xref>). ProCatD is targeted to intracellular vesicles where it undergoes processing to form an active enzyme, CatD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Benes et al., 2008</xref>). The levels of ProCatD remained consistent across treatments, with the exception of a minor decrease in expression following 6 h AO-free treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5HâI</xref>). No changes in expression levels of active CatD were seen in either the AO-free or AA conditions compared to control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5H and J</xref>). Thus, the delay in the degradation of damaged mitochondria reported here is specific to mitophagic events.</p><p>We compared these observations to the time course of mitophagy in HeLa cells treated with AA/Oligomycin A (10 Î¼m) to initiate complete turnover of the mitochondrial network. We found a similar time course of mitochondrial fragmentation and engulfment by LC3, complete withinÂ ~1â2 hr. However, the time course of mitophagosome acidification was markedly faster in HeLa cells as compared to primary neurons, withÂ &gt;80% of OPTN-positive mitochondrial fragments also positive for LysoT within 1 h after mitophagy induction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5âfigure supplement 2</xref>). Thus, we find that in neurons damaged mitochondria are efficiently sequestered, but the acidification of these mitophagosomes, which is required to fully degrade the engulfed mitochondrial fragments, takes more than 6 h and is much slower than the corresponding time course in HeLa cells expressing exogenous Parkin.</p><p>While LAMP1 is routinely used as a marker of lysosomes, recent work has demonstrated that a portion of LAMP1-positive organelles did not colocalize with lysosomal hydrolases, implying not all LAMP1 is on degradation-competent vesicles but also on late endosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Cheng et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib107">Yap et al., 2018</xref>). Under our conditions, we determinedÂ ~86% of LAMP1 or LAMP2 structures were LysoT-positive (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5âfigure supplement 1DâE</xref>). Since earlier steps in the formation of autophagosomes are not rate-limiting (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5âfigure supplement 1FâG</xref>), most damaged organelles are efficiently sequestered in autophagosomes within an hour of damage, forming mitophagosomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>). In control conditions, the majority of mitophagosomes were LAMP1-positive, butÂ â¤50% were LAMP1-positive in treated conditions. Moreover, most mitophagosomes were LysoT-negative across all conditions, consistent with the slow acidification of engulfed mitochondria under both control and oxidative stress conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figures 5B, D and K</xref>). These findings suggest that most damaged mitochondria are efficiently engulfed in mitophagosomes (LC3-positive) or âlateâ mitophagosomes (both LC3- and LAMP1-positive), but have yet to fuse with protease-containing lysosomes to become degradation-competent mitophagolysosomes (LC3-LAMP1-LysoT-positive; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5L</xref>).</p><p>To test this idea, we examined mitochondrial flux using a tandem Cox8-EGFP-mCherry reporter.

The temporal dynamics of lysosomal fusion and acidification were determined by comparing LAMP1 recruitment to damaged mitochondria following mitophagy induction (1 or 6 h control/AO-free or 2 h AA). We quantified the relative percentage of OPTN-positive mitochondria rings that were LAMP1-negative, dual LAMP1 labeled, or LAMP1 RFP-only labeled (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6DâE</xref>). Consistent with previous data, mitophagic events in control cells were predominantly LAMP1-positive. Interestingly, there was a shift in a sub-population of events that were LAMP1-negative after 1 h to LAMP1 RFP-only following 6 h in control media, exhibiting mitochondrial turnover on a longer time scale. Induction of mitophagy by antioxidant deprivation substantially increased both the fraction of LAMP-1 negative and the total number of mitophagy events compared to control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E</xref>). However, as with the tandem reporter for mitochondria, most mitophagic events in all conditions were dual labeled with SEP and RFP, confirming that these damaged organelles are sequestered in a non-acidified âlateâ mitophagosome.</p><p>As previously mentioned, two types of OPTN localization were observed with damaged mitochondria, OPTN rings and puncta (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2DâF</xref>). OPTN puncta may represent an early stage of nucleation, but it also conceivable that an OPTN ring collapses into punctum following rounds of lysosome fusion at the end stages of mitophagy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6âfigure supplement 1A</xref>), causing the pre-ring and post-ring formation states of OPTN to be morphologically indistinguishable. To address this possibility, we repeated our quantification, this time including OPTN-positive mitochondrial puncta and rings. Using this criterion, we observed a larger percentage of LAMP1-negative and LAMP1 RFP-only mitophagic events, as well as an overall increase in the total number of events for all treatments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6âfigure supplement 1B</xref>). This analysis suggests that OPTN-positive puncta are most likely to be in non-acidified organelles formed prior to the expansion of OPTN to form a full ring, and further support a model were sequestration of damaged organelles occurs quickly, but acidification is delayed in neuronal mitophagy.</p></sec><sec id="s2-6"><title>âAgedâ mitochondria are sequestered in the soma during basal mitophagy</title><p>To investigate long-term autolysosome sequestration hours after initial damage, we performed SNAP-tag pulse-chase experiments.

However, a rigorous analysis of OPTN-mediated mitophagy in neurons has yet to be carried out, limiting our understanding of how this mechanism functions in neurons expressing endogenous levels of Parkin, and further, how defects in the pathway might lead to neurodegeneration. In this study, we used multicolor live-cell imaging to examine the spatiotemporal dynamics of OPTN-mediated mitophagy in primary hippocampal neurons. We find that mild oxidative stress, induced through antioxidant deprivation or by low doses of AA, results in minor somal and axonal mitochondrial fragmentation, without compromising the overall network (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1CâF</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3âfigure supplement 1</xref>).

Using this experimental paradigm, we saw frequent mitophagic events in the soma, with only limited events in either dendrites or axons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>).

This quality control mechanism is compartmentally restricted to the soma and rarely occurs in the axon. As a result, other quality control pathways may regulate axonal mitochondria.

LC3 translocation occurs after OPTN andÂ ~75% of OPTN-positive mitochondria are LC3-positive, forming mitophagosomes an hour after initial damage. Under basal conditions, âlateâ mitophagosomes (OPTN-LAMP-positive mitochondria) routinely form within an hour. However, mitophagy induction perturbs this pathway, increasing the number of LAMP1-negative OPTN-positive mitochondria. Interestingly, only a small fraction of OPTN-positive mitochondria are acidified in either basal or induced conditions, suggesting lysosomal acidification to eliminate damaged organelles is rate-limiting.</p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-50260-fig9-v1.tif"/></fig><p>Additionally, we determined that âlateâ mitophagosome formation is efficient under basal conditions, but oxidative stress can overwhelm the system. Surprisingly, lysosomal acidification and turnover were rarely observed in either basal or stressed conditions at all time points tested (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). These findings were confirmed using tandem markers for mitochondria and lysosomes, where we could simultaneously monitor localization and acidification (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6âfigure supplement 1</xref>). Moreover, mitophagosomes that were LAMP1- and LysoT-negative were still visualized a full day after treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). Taken together, these results illustrate that sequestered mitochondria are persistently sequestered in non-acidified organelles, where removal of damaged mitochondria is slow and inefficient (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9B</xref>). Interestingly, this delay was shown to be specific to these mitophagic events, as most neuronal lysosomes were efficiently acidified (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5âfigure supplement 1</xref>). We speculate that this slow acidification is attributed to the multiple autophagosome-lysosome fusion events that may be required to fully acidify a mitophagolysosome. Alternatively, ion transporters or other proteins associated with this vesicular compartment could be differentially regulated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Majumdar et al., 2011</xref>), but further work will be required to determine the underlying cause. Of note, the slow time course of mitophagosome acidification in primary neurons following very limited mitochondrial damage differs markedly from the more rapid process in HeLa cells engaged in the wholesale turnover of their mitochondrial networks (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5âfigure supplement 2</xref>).</p><p>Importantly, the slow removal of sequestered mitochondrial fragments occurs under both basal and stressed conditions, suggesting that this is a potential point of vulnerability in the pathway supporting neuronal homeostasis. This susceptibility can be exacerbated by multiple factors related to aging and neurodegeneration, including increased levels of oxidative damage to cellular organelles, changes in lysosomal acidification with aging (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Lee et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Lie and Nixon, 2019</xref>), or the expression of mutations in pathway components. These alterations to the system might further impede the rate of turnover, increasing neuronal sensitivity to damage and degeneration. We tested this idea by expressing an ALS-linked OPTN mutation, and observed an overall decrease in the membrane potential of the mitochondrial network (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8F</xref>). It is likely that damaged mitochondria were not efficiently sequestered but instead free to fuse with the cellular network disrupting overall cellular health. We propose that expression of mutant OPTN is detrimental to the neuron through a feedforward mechanism. First, OPTN<sup>E478G</sup> fails to translocate to damaged organelles, which may perturb the mitophagy pathway in a dominant-negative manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Moore and Holzbaur, 2016</xref>). Second, decreased mitochondrial network health due to mutant expression could increase the number of damaged organelles that need to be recycled via mitophagy. However, OPTN<sup>E478G</sup> is not recruited to these depolarized mitochondria, further compounding the problem, leading to cellular stress and potential neurodegeneration.</p><p>Since the OPTN<sup>E478G</sup> mutation is autosomal dominant, one copy is sufficient to cause neurodegeneration and ALS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Maruyama et al., 2010</xref>). In an OPTN<sup>WT</sup> background, our data indicates that the mitophagic pathway can cope with hours of oxidative stress to effectively sequester damaged mitochondria and maintain neuronal health. However, the expression of OPTN<sup>E478G</sup> is sufficient to disrupt the mitochondrial network even under control conditions. In this mutant background, a second hit to the system induced by long-term oxidative stress resulted in additional mitochondrial network damage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8F</xref>). It appears that mutant expression and stressed conditions further enhance the susceptibility of the neuron to cellular stress. Thus, we propose that mitochondrial quality control is tightly regulated in neurons, where sequestration of damaged organelles is critical to prevent dissemination of damaged components and disruption of the pathway is sufficient to cause neurodegeneration.</p><p>A constitutive pathway for axonal autophagy has been reported in neurons both in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Maday and Holzbaur, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib105">Wong and Holzbaur, 2014b</xref>) and in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Neisch et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Soukup et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Stavoe et al., 2016</xref>). In this pathway, autophagosomes non-selectively engulf and degrade mitochondrial fragments at the axon tip. But this is distinct from the selective receptor-mediated clearance of damaged mitochondria described here, which is almost entirely a somal quality control mechanism. The spatial specificity of mitophagy was previously postulated based on observations in vivo in <italic>Drosophila</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Devireddy et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Sung et al., 2016</xref>), qualitative findings of acidified mitochondria only within the soma in <italic>mito</italic>-QC mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">McWilliams et al., 2016</xref>), and visualization of the somal clearance of ischemically damaged axonal mitochondria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib110">Zheng et al., 2019</xref>). Countering this literature is a report of axonal mitochondria turnover downstream from PINK1 and Parkin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Ashrafi et al., 2014</xref>) and studies indicating that axonal mitochondria motility is arrested following mitochondrial damage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Hsieh et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Liu et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib99">Wang et al., 2011</xref>), necessitating a local clearance mechanism. It may be that under wholesale disruption of the mitochondrial network, initiated by CCCP or higher levels of Antimycin/Oligomycin, there is more widespread induction of mitophagy downstream from Parkin, leading to the local mitophagy of axonal mitochondria previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Ashrafi et al., 2014</xref>). However, we argue that the limited damage examined here may more accurately reflect the levels of mitochondrial turnover seen in vivo and during aging, stress, or expression of dominant mutations in pathway components, such as the OPTN<sup>E478G</sup> mutant. Under these conditions, as we demonstrate in vitro and was previously shown in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Devireddy et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">McWilliams et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Sung et al., 2016</xref>), the PINK1/Parkin mitophagy pathway is compartmentally restricted to the soma. Thus, neuronal mitophagy is both molecularly and spatially distinct from the previously characterized constitutive axonal autophagy pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Evans and Holzbaur, 2019</xref>).</p><p>While we focus here on the PINK1/Parkin pathway, given its genetic links to neurodegenerative diseases like PD and ALS, it is likely that additional and potentially compensatory pathways are actively contributing to mitochondrial quality control in neurons. Previous studies have proposed that mitochondrial ubiquitin ligase 1 (MUL1) plays a role in mitochondrial quality control in neurons, where it functions as an additional E3 ubiquitin ligase in a parallel pathway to Parkin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Ambivero et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Puri et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib109">Yun et al., 2014</xref>). Other studies have suggested that alternative pathways such as NIPSNAP/Parkin-mediated mitophagy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Nautiyal et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Princely Abudu et al., 2019</xref>) and NIX/BNIP3L-dependent mitophagy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bellot et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Koentjoro et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Real et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Sowter et al., 2001</xref>) support mitochondrial clearance. Further studies will be required to quantitatively assess the interplay of these various pathways in mitochondrial quality control in neurons and the extent of their overlap. In addition, further work will be required to determine the relative contributions of defects in mitophagy and systemic changes in inflammation that can also be induced by mutations in PINK1 and/or Parkin, although it is likely that both aspects contribute to the onset of neurodegeneration in PD and perhaps ALS. The continued development of more physiologically relevant model systems coupled to rigorous quantitative analysis will be required to address these important questions and advance therapeutic strategies for neurodegeneration.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Reagents</title><p>Constructs used include the following: Mito-DsRed (kindly provided by.

neurons. Under mild oxidative stress, OPTN is recruited to damaged mitochondria and promotes recruitment of additional autophagy proteins and formation of an autophagosome, occurring robustly in the cell soma. OPTN- and LAMP1-positive structures remained in a non-acidic state for extended time periods, suggesting that acidification of lysosomes containing mitochondria is rate-limiting for degradation. This work is relevant to Parkinson's disease and ALS.</p><p><bold>Decision letter after peer review:</bold></p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Mitophagosome acidification is rate-limiting in the maintenance of the somal mitochondrial network in neurons&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Suzanne Pfeffer as the Senior Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>This paper addresses the interesting question of how the autophagy cargo adaptor OPTN is employed in post-mitotic neurons to remove damaged mitochondria downstream of the Parkin ubiquitin ligase. Parkin is recruited to damaged mitochondria in response to PINK1 activation and catalyzes ubiquitylation of a number of proteins on the outer membrane of mitochondria. OPTN then binds to ubiquitin chains to promote recruitment of the autophagy machinery. The authors characterize this process in neurons in the presence of &quot;endogenous&quot; mitochondrial damage. Through a series of studies, they provide evidence that mitoautophagosomes acidify slowly, suggesting that acidification is a rate-limiting step in mitophagy.</p><p>While the reviewers all feel that the paper is timely and interesting, there are several concerns that need to be addressed before the paper can be considered further. These concerns generally fall into 4 areas:</p><p>1) OPTN overexpression. The paper extensively employs ectopic expression of tagged OPTN. Although this is very useful for detection of OPTN-coated mitochondria, it raises issues in the context of the model wherein mitolysosome acidification is rate-limiting in neurons. Depending upon the levels of overexpression, it is possible that autophagosome formation is accelerated in some way that makes acidification seem slow (rate-limiting). The paper also tries to make comparisons with HeLa cells in this context. Because the abundance of endogenous OPTN relative to the tagged OPTN isn't shown in either the case of neurons or HeLa cells, it is difficult to know the extent to which this may be an issue in the experiments that are shown. It is important to show the levels of overexpression either in the population, or preferably in individual cells using endogenous OPTN antibodies. This issue is also important in light of the fact that there are a substantial number of OPTN puncta that are not co-localized with mitochondria. Are these aggregates resulting from overexpression or are they something else? DO such OPTN puncta appear in neurons using endogenous antibodies? In terms of overexpression of OPTN accelerating early steps, it may be possible to visualize mitoautophagosomes using GFP-LC3, and since this is functioning at a step downstream of OPTN recruitment, it may allow an independent assessment of whether acidification is rate-limiting.</p><p>2) Lysosome acidification as the rate-limiting step. All three reviewers had concerns about this strong conclusion, which is also featured in the Title of the paper. This reflects, in part, the OPTN overexpression as discussed above, as well as the approaches being used to examine acidification. The reviewer' feel that a more direct method, including measurement of mitophagic flux using Keima or mito-QC would strengthen the results. Is there evidence of mitochondria inside lysosomes that have not yet either activated the Keima red-shift or converted the yellow GFP-mCherry signal to mCherry only, which would indicate non-instantaneous acidification, and if so, what is the time constant for conversion to the acidic state? There is also some concern that the LAMP1 marker used for marking lysosomes may also, when overexpressed, mark autophagosomes, making the designation of mitolysosomes complicated. It may be possible to follow local diffusion (i.e. signal expansion) of lysotracker from a lysosome into an OPTN-positive autophagosome in order to measure the length of time from full OPTN recruitment to acidification. Previous studies have used this approach to examine the kinetics by live-cell imaging.</p><p>3) A third issue brought up by the reviewers concerns the question of whether the pathway being examined is the Parkin-PINK1 pathway or not. This is the expectation given the fact that OPTN is recruited to the damaged mitochondria, but isn't formally demonstrated. Might it be possible to deplete PINK1 or Parkin by shRNA and examine the number of OPTN-positive mitochondria that appear over time in individual cells relative to cells transfected with control shRNA?</p><p>4) The current work implies that the delay in acidification is specific to mitophagosomes. However, the acidification rate of autophagosomes in general, under the authors experimental conditions, was not tested. The authors could monitor the formation of OPTN -ve LC3 puncta using their mild depolarising media and determine if these equally take as long to become acidified.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic></p><p>This paper describes an analysis of mitophagy in neuronal cells. Mitophagy is perhaps best understood in the context of PINK1 and PARK2-dependent mitochondrial ubiquitylation and targeting to the autophagosome via an OPTN-TBK1-dependent pathway (although NDP52 and TAX1BP1 can also function in this pathway redundantly with OPTN). The majority of studies examining PARK2-dependent mitophagy have been done in cancer cell lines overexpressing PARK2 and there has been conflicting data for PARK2-dependent mitophagy in neuronal cell lineages. This paper tries to address some of these conflicting data and also presents a new model related to lysosomal acidification as being rate-limiting for mitophagy in neurons.</p><p>In mito-QC or mito-Keima mice that lack PINK1 or PARK2, there is no discernable defect in mitophagic flux across all/most tissues, indicating that the majority of mitophagic flux is through a PARK2-independent pathway. However, this doesn't necessarily mean that there isn't a small amount of flux (not detectable by the methods used) that is still PARK2-dependent in specific classes of neurons. Additionally, previous studies have used various types of mitochondrial depolarizing agents to examine mitophagy in neurons in culture. In some experiments, mitophagy is initiated in the axon while in others, it occurs in the soma. While there are discrepancies in some of the conclusions, it's also probably fair to say that some of the conclusions are not really based on strong experiments. As such, there is still much that is unclear concerning when, where, and how mitochondria are degraded by autophagy in neurons.</p><p>This study uses removal of anti-oxidants (AOF) from the media as a way to induce endogenous mitochondrial damage, with the idea that it will be possible to examine mitophagy mechanisms in a more physiological setting. The paper is primarily based on imaging.</p><p>Major comments:</p><p>Throughout the paper, the authors employ overexpression of Halo-OPTN. There is the distinct possibility that overexpression of OPTN can artificially accelerate steps in mitophagy that are downstream of PARK2-action on mitochondria. This complicates the interpretation of the data in terms of the rates of mitochondrial turnover and the conclusions related to lysosomal acidification being limiting. The recent finding that autophagy receptors (NDP52 in particular) can recruit ULK1-FIP200 raises the question as to whether having additional receptor in the cell could accelerate autophagosome formation around ubiquitylated mitochondira. Additionally, in Figure 1I, there appear to be many Halo-OPTN puncta that are not co-localizing with mitochondria. It is unclear what these puncta are. Do they reflect Halo-OPTN aggregates, for example, resulting from overexpression? Or are they OPTN localized on other autophagic cargo?</p><p>In Figure 2 the authors examine localization of PARK2, TBK1 and OPTN with mitochondria and correlate it with TMRE signal. In some sense, it's a bit hard to judge because they are only showing AOF treated samples and so there isn't a systematic quantification of the number of OPTN-coated mitochondria in the absence of oxidative stress. There are a lot of OPTN-positive, TBK1-positive puncta whose identity are unknown. I also am unsure what the authors mean concerning Figure 2G, where the authors say that the number of OPTN on linear mitochondria are &quot;low and similar in either conditions&quot;. The value is ~29%, which is much higher that the OPTN on fragmented mitochondria, so this doesn't seem to make sense. I am also not sure about the argument made concerning the aspect ratio with and without AOF in Figure 2H. The highest signal in the control sample is also the &lt;1.5 ratio, and this only marginally increased with AOF. So, it would seem to be hard to conclude that this small mitochondria directly represents the ones that are subsequently tagged with OPTN.</p><p>Figure 3 looks at the frequency of OPTN encircled mitochondria in axons, dendrites and soma, indicating that virtually no OPTN-positive mitochondria are seen in the axon. The frequency of OPTN-positive mitochondria relative to the total mitochondrial volume in the soma indicates that with AOF, there is a very small amount of damaged mitochondria relative to the total mitochondrial volume. Given this very low value, it would appear to take many axons in order to achieve a similar mitochondrial volume in order to directly compare the frequency of damage and capture by OPTN. So based on a stochastic damage argument, it may be very difficult to detect damaged mito in the axon but that doesn't necessarily mean it doesn't happen there. So, the conclusion in subsection âOPTN-mediated mitophagy occurs preferentially in the somatodendritic compartment of hippocampal neuronsâ might be too strong.</p><p>The experiment in Figure 5 is a bit hard to interpret. Since LAMP1 is overexpressed, it is possible that it is marking organelles such as endosomes, in addition to lysosomes. In any event, the apparent number of LysoT positive puncta is far lower than the number of LAMP1 positive puncta, albeit not in the same cells. The major conclusion is that lysosomes are acidified more slowly in neurons, and results in HeLa cells overexpressing OPTN and LAMP1 are used to compare the rates of lysosome acidification. Interpretation of this experiment is difficult because there is no indication of the levels of expression of OPTN/cell. If OPTN overexpression can accelerate the assembly of a fully coated autophagosome around the damaged mitochondria, and therefore the rate of fusion with a lysosome since full closure is required, then the difference in the apparent rate of acidification could simply represent the levels of OPTN in each cell being examined. Since there are no measurements of OPTN levels/per cell and specifically in the cells that are being imaged, it makes it challenging to make the conclusion that rates of acidification are intrinsically slower in neurons. If much less overexpressed OPTN is present in neurons than HeLa, this could explain the difference seen. The authors examined cathepsin cleavage, and find only minor differences as measured in a western blot assay. Since cathepsin processing also requires low lysosomal pH, this a priori would suggest no issue with lysosomal acidification at a global level in the neurons, raising the question of precisely how acidification is regulated.</p><p>With regards to the conclusions in Figure 5, an ultrastructure analysis in the cited Cheng et al., 2018 paper suggests that LAMP1 can be present on immature double membrane autophagosome-like structures. Is it possible that some of the LAMP1-positive signals lacking LysoT positivity are actually autophagosomes that are LAMP1 positive but not yet fused with a lysosome? Could LAMP1 overexpression affect the interpretation of the experiments?</p><p>Subsection âLow-level induction of ROS leads to selective mitochondrial damage without compromising the overall mitochondrial networkâ. In the two color old/new mitochondrial experiment, it's hard to imagine how the age can be precisely controlled using the described protocol. The SNAP tag for mito localization contains a COXVIII MTS sequence. As such, it would seem like any mitochondria with a functional translocon could import the SNAP-tag protein, regardless of whether it is old or new, however the authors state that the two populations are &quot;distinct&quot;. The interpretation that old mitochondria can import the newly synthesized snap tag is consistent with most of the mitochondria being double labeled (Figure 6C). Because the mass of old mitochondria is much larger than the mass of new mitochondria that has been made since the new dye was added (dye added for 1 hour) and the number of those mitochondria not undergoing intermixing by fusion is small, the frequency with which such a &quot;new&quot; mitochondria would be identified as damaged and associated with OPTN would be particularly low, relative to the much more abundant old mito. So it seems possible, that this experiment doesn't really have the statistical power to rule out similar rates of old and new mitochondrial engulfment. The authors argue that the absence in green signal means that they are exclusively old, but it also may be that the signal to noise isn't equivalent. The labeling period for old was 24 hours while the labeling for new was only 1 hour. Therefore, all things being equal in terms of mitochondrial assembly/fission/fusion, there should be far less signal for new snap relative to old snap/per individual mito.</p><p>In Figure 7, the authors examine an OPTN mutant found in ALS, and see general but small effects on mitochondrial size. This experiment is somewhat limited by the fact that OPTN deletion by siRNA is only ~60%, and it is possible that the overexpressed OPTN mutant (not sure how much it is overexpressed as they didn't show a western of the transfected cells) may also act as a dominant negative â binding TBK1 but not Ub chains. What isn't clear is whether the authors have missed an opportunity to statistically determine whether the OPTN mutant encircles damaged mito. The experiments are largely limited to mito morphology.</p><p>An important weakness of the analysis is the absence of a direct demonstration of mitophagic flux.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>In their manuscript, Evans and Holzbaur present data arguing two main points regarding mitophagy in neurons: (1) that mitophagy occurs mainly in the soma and not in axons, contrary to some previous work by others, and (2) that neuronal mitophagy is significantly slower relative to other cell types, as result of slow acidification of mitoautophagosomes. Although the experiments are generally well-performed additional evidence is required in support of their main conclusions.</p><p>Major comments:</p><p>1) The implication throughout the paper is that the optineurin rings forming around mitochondria in response to mild oxidative stress are due to PINK1/Parkin dependent mitophagy. This should be demonstrated with knockdown or knockout of PINK1 and Parkin. This is particularly important given lack of clarity on the role of PINK1/Parkin mitophagy in neurons in response to more physiologically relevant stressors.</p><p>2) A major finding of the manuscript is that mitophagy occurs primarily in the cell soma and not the axons, in contrast to the findings of Ashrafi et al. As a rationale for this discrepancy, they suggest that they are applying a milder stress (withholding antioxidants from neuronal media) that does not lead to global bioenergetic collapse. This explanation doesn't seem satisfactory, however, as Ashrafi et al., also, used a variety of experimental setups to induce local damage mitochondria without affecting the overall bioenergetics of the neuron. An alternative explanation for the discrepancy might be that the particular exposure used by Evans and Holzbaur (withholding antioxidants) preferentially increases oxidative stress and mitochondrial damage in the cell soma as opposed to the axons. Does ROS increase equally in the axon and cell body with antioxidant withdrawal? Does the authors treatment result in TMRE negative mitochondria in axons that are not captured by Optineurin in contrast to the cell soma? When the authors treat with antimycin for 2 hours (which increases ROS locally at the mitochondria) do they see the same preferential increase in mitophagy in the soma or are mitochondria in the axons also targeted? Ashrafi saw axonal events as soon as 45 minutes, do the authors see axonal events at these early timepoints? Ashafri noted increased axonal events with the use of lysosomal inhibitors. If these are used by the authors, do they then see axonal events?</p><p>3) In Figure 5 the authors compare the speed of mitophagosome maturation in neurons and HeLa cells. They conclude that the difference in speed reflects a difference in processes downstream of mitochondrial ubiquitination, but the level mitochondrial ubiquitination is likely very different in neurons with endogenous Parkin subjected to mild oxidative stress and HeLa cells over-expressing Parkin and fully depolarized with OA. Could this account for the difference in maturation rate? Do the authors still see a difference in the speed of mitophagosome maturation when the two cell types are subjected to more equal treatment â e.g., in neurons and HeLa cells that are both overexpressing Parkin and are subjected to the same oxidative stress (e.g., antimycin)? Additionally, the authors note that acidification of mitoauthophagosomes is delayed in neurons? How long is it delayed? What do they see at time points longer than one day?</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic></p><p>In the manuscript by Evans and Holzbaur, the authors examine the dynamics of OPTN recruitment to mitochondria and subsequent delivery to lysosomes following mild oxidative stress in primary rat hippocampal neurons. The authors mainly use transfected neurons and live-cell microscopy and find that OPTN is rapidly recruited to a subset of mitochondria, primarily in the soma, following anti-oxidant removal from the cell media. This then correlated with subsequent recruitment of mitophagy and lysosomal markers. Surprisingly, and the main take home message from the manuscript, was that the OPTN puncta on mitochondria do not become efficiently acidified (as visualized by col-localisation with lysotracker), from which the authors conclude that this is a rate-limiting step during neuronal mitophagy.</p><p>This is an intriguing manuscript with many interesting observations. The identification of &quot;mild&quot; depolarising conditions that trigger a mitophagy response will be useful to the field and certainly does appear more physiological that the use of CCCP or oligomycin/antimycin. The microscopy images are impressive and convincing in what they show. However, I think more work is needed to determine whether this phenomenon is specific to mitophagosomes and neurons in general.</p><p>Major comments:</p><p>1) I think more robust analyses of lysosome acidification are needed. It is surprising and very interesting that there is a large delay in acidification of mitolysosomes. Is this a general phenomenon, i.e. are acidified lysosomes scarce in these cells? What is the percentage of LAMP1 structures (regardless of co-localising with OPTN) that are LysoTracker +ve? If it is low, could this mean that most of the LAMP1-GFP is not in lysosomes? Could the authors use another lysosomal marker to confirm?</p><p>2) Related to the above point, the authors only use LysoTracker to estimate lysosomal acidification. Is there another way the authors could estimate this â for example using ratiometric fluorophores, such as Keima or mCherry-GFP?</p><p>3) Is the delay in acidification specific to mitolysosomes? What about autophagosomes in general? The authors could monitor the formation of OPTN -ve LC3 puncta under their conditions and determine if these equally take as long to become acidified. The authors may wish to discuss Ralph Nixon's work (e.g. Boland et al., 2008) that argues autophagosome fusion with lysosomes is very efficient in neurons.</p><p>4) Are the authors sure it is mitophagosome acidification that is rate-limiting and not an earlier step in the pathway? For example, is it possible that the autophagosome is not fully sealed (despite appearing circular by fluorescence microscopy). The authors could look at early autophagosome markers such as ULK1, ATG5 or WIPI that are not present on mature autophagosomes. Or mature autophagosome markers such as STX17.</p><p>5) The authors imply that this delay is specific to neurons, yet they only look in hippocampal neurons and compare this to HeLa cells overexpressing Parkin. I think the authors need to provide some more data in relevant cell lines for a better comparison. What about cortical neurons, as well and comparing with primary fibroblasts (which should contain all the relevant Parkin pathway components)?</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were requested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for resubmitting your work entitled &quot;Degradation of engulfed mitochondria is rate-limiting in Optineurin-mediated mitophagy in neurons&quot; for further consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>.

I think the authors have done a great job in strengthening their manuscript â my main concern was with the lysosomal acidification studies and the use of the dual reporters means the data are much more convincing. I just have a few small points remaining:</p><p>1) The LAMP2 data, mentioned in subsectionâ Acidification of OPTN-positive mitochondria is a rate-limiting step in neuronal mitophagyâ and in the comments to reviewers does not seem to be in the manuscript. The authors mention Figure 4E, but these are only LC3-related. Please include the data.</p><p>2) Likewise, the authors show data in the reviewers comments that the OPTN/LC3 structures are WIPI -ve. I do not see these data in the manuscript. This shows that the structures are not early autophagosomal in nature and thus they will be of interest to readers (and not just this reviewer) and so should be included (at least in the supplemental). I'm assuming WIPI2B is expressed in these cells and does indeed form puncta with LC3 when autophagy is induced?</p><p>3) I also take on the point that the authors have made in response to my concern raised in point 5 â i.e. that HeLa cells overexpressing Parkin are a suitable system to compare to the neurons. The HeLa cell has been instrumental in the field in terms of building up the mechanism of PINK/Parkin mitophagy. But this is not a &quot;normal&quot; cell. Normally, it does not undergo this pathway as it does not express Parkin! I think to avoid doing more experiments, the authors can be more accurate in what they state and say that this delay in acidification does not occur in HeLa cells expressing Parkin. For example in subsection âAcidification of OPTN-positive mitochondria is a rate-limiting step in neuronal mitophagyâ: &quot;â¦..much slower than the corresponding time course in non-neuronal cells.&quot; Should be replaced with &quot;â¦..much slower than the corresponding time course in HeLa cells.&quot;</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.50260.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>This paper addresses the interesting question of how the autophagy cargo adaptor OPTN is employed in post-mitotic neurons to remove damaged mitochondria downstream of the Parkin ubiquitin ligase.

All three reviewers had concerns about this strong conclusion, which is also featured in the Title of the paper. This reflects, in part, the OPTN overexpression as discussed above, as well as the approaches being used to examine acidification. The reviewer' feel that a more direct method, including measurement of mitophagic flux using Keima or mito-QC would strengthen the results. Is there evidence of mitochondria inside lysosomes that have not yet either activated the Keima red-shift or converted the yellow GFP-mCherry signal to mCherry only, which would indicate non-instantaneous acidification, and if so, what is the time constant for conversion to the acidic state? There is also some concern that the LAMP1 marker used for marking lysosomes may also, when overexpressed, mark autophagosomes, making the designation of mitolysosomes complicated. It may be possible to follow local diffusion (i.e. signal expansion) of lysotracker from a lysosome into an OPTN-positive autophagosome in order to measure the length of time from full OPTN recruitment to acidification. Previous studies have used this approach to examine the kinetics by live-cell imaging.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that additional methods were needed to further strengthen our conclusion that lysosome acidification is rate-limiting in neuronal mitophagy. To address this point, we utilized the mitochondrial matrix directed tandem fluorescent reporter Cox8-EGFP-mCherry to look at mitophagic flux (Rojansky et al., 2016); this construct is similar to the <italic>mito</italic>-QC previously described (Allen et al., 2013; McWilliams et al., 2016). We identified OPTN-positive mitochondria and looked for the presence or absence of EGFP fluorescence coincident with mCherry fluorescence to identify non-acidified and acidified organelles. Using this assay, we found OPTN-positive mitochondria that were dual labeled with the tandem reporter, suggesting they were in non-acidified compartments. This data is now included in the revised manuscript (please see Figure 6).</p><p>To use LAMP1 as a second, independent reporter for acidified degradation-competent organelles, we utilized a dual labeled SEP-LAMP1-RFP construct where superecliptic pHluorin (SEP) is fused to the lumen of LAMP1-RFP (Farias et al., 2017). The fluorescent signal of the SEP will quench in acidic environments (pH &lt; 6; (Sankaranarayanan et al., 2000)). We felt that a dual reporter system would provide more reliable measurements than the local diffusion of lysotracker from a lysosome. As a control experiment, we used this construct to determine the number of acidified lysosomes per cell (see Figure 5âfigure supplement 1) and found it to be consistent with other methods used. We then identified OPTN-positive mitochondria and quantified the relative percentage that were dual or single labeled with the tandem LAMP1 probe. We determined the majority of sequestered mitochondria were dual positive for green and red fluorescence with the SEP-LAMP1-RFP tandem probe, again suggesting that this represents a substantial population of non-acidified organelles (see Figure 6 and Figure 6âfigure supplement 1).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) A third issue brought up by the reviewers concerns the question of whether the pathway being examined is the Parkin-PINK1 pathway or not. This is the expectation given the fact that OPTN is recruited to the damaged mitochondria, but isn't formally demonstrated. Might it be possible to deplete PINK1 or Parkin by shRNA and examine the number of OPTN-positive mitochondria that appear over time in individual cells relative to cells transfected with control shRNA?</p></disp-quote><p>To formally demonstrate whether this pathway is PINK1/Parkin-dependent, we performed Parkin knock-down and rescue experiments. The percent of neurons with OPTN-positive mitochondria was determined in neurons following antioxidant removal for 1 hour, see Figure 2âfigure supplement 2 of the revised manuscript. We observed an overall 30% reduction in Parkin expression by immunoblot analysis of cell lysates, but it is important to note that this measurement is an underestimate of the reduction in Parkin expression in the imaged neurons, as transfection rates are low in hippocampal neurons and the immunoblot measurement is from an entire plate of cells and so includes neurons that did not take up siRNA. When imaging neurons, we selected cells that were transfected and therefore have also taken up siRNA. Importantly, this level of knock-down was sufficient to significantly inhibit the number of cells with OPTN-positive rings, from ~35% down to less than 10%. This deficit was rescued by reexpression of WT Parkin. These data along with our recruitment data indicate that the PINK1-Parkin pathway is involved, although we cannot rule out the involvement of other possible ROS-induced E3 ligases in addition to Parkin. This point is directly addressed in the Discussion section.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) The current work implies that the delay in acidification is specific to mitophagosomes.

We determined that 75% of autophagosomes in a cell were acidified and that there was no significant difference in acidification between control or AO-free treated conditions at 1 or 6 hours.

See Figure 5âfigure supplement 1 of the revised manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1:</p><p>This paper describes an analysis of mitophagy in neuronal cells. Mitophagy is perhaps best understood in the context of PINK1 and PARK2-dependent mitochondrial ubiquitylation and targeting to the autophagosome via an OPTN-TBK1-dependent pathway (although NDP52 and TAX1BP1 can also function in this pathway redundantly with OPTN). The majority of studies examining PARK2-dependent mitophagy have been done in cancer cell lines overexpressing PARK2 and there has been conflicting data for PARK2-dependent mitophagy in neuronal cell lineages. This paper tries to address some of these conflicting data and also presents a new model related to lysosomal acidification as being rate-limiting for mitophagy in neurons.</p><p>In mito-QC or mito-Keima mice that lack PINK1 or PARK2, there is no discernable defect in mitophagic flux across all/most tissues, indicating that the majority of mitophagic flux is through a PARK2-independent pathway. However, this doesn't necessarily mean that there isn't a small amount of flux (not detectable by the methods used) that is still PARK2-dependent in specific classes of neurons. Additionally, previous studies have used various types of mitochondrial depolarizing agents to examine mitophagy in neurons in culture. In some experiments, mitophagy is initiated in the axon while in others, it occurs in the soma. While there are discrepancies in some of the conclusions, it's also probably fair to say that some of the conclusions are not really based on strong experiments. As such, there is still much that is unclear concerning when, where, and how mitochondria are degraded by autophagy in neurons.</p><p>This study uses removal of anti-oxidants (AOF) from the media as a way to induce endogenous mitochondrial damage, with the idea that it will be possible to examine mitophagy mechanisms in a more physiological setting. The paper is primarily based on imaging.</p><p>Major comments:</p><p>1) Throughout the paper, the authors employ overexpression of Halo-OPTN. There is the distinct possibility that overexpression of OPTN can artificially accelerate steps in mitophagy that are downstream of PARK2-action on mitochondria. This complicates the interpretation of the data in terms of the rates of mitochondrial turnover and the conclusions related to lysosomal acidification being limiting. The recent finding that autophagy receptors (NDP52 in particular) can recruit ULK1-FIP200 raises the question as to whether having additional receptor in the cell could accelerate autophagosome formation around ubiquitylated mitochondira. Additionally, in Figure 1I, there appear to be many Halo-OPTN puncta that are not co-localizing with mitochondria. It is unclear what these puncta are. Do they reflect Halo-OPTN aggregates, for example, resulting from overexpression? Or are they OPTN localized on other autophagic cargo?</p></disp-quote><p>Halo-OPTN does form puncta that do not colocalize with mitochondria. However, we observed a similar distribution of endogenous OPTN in the soma of neurons and in HeLa cells, please see Figure 2âfigure supplement 1 and additional images above. These observations are consistent with previous work demonstrating the punctate appearance of endogenous OPTN (Park et al., 2006).</p><p>It is possible that some of these puncta localize with autophagic cargos. OPTN has been suggested to function in aggrephagy and some of these Halo-OPTN puncta could localize with aggregated proteins (Korac et al., 2013). Consistent with this, we observed that many of the Halo-OPTN puncta colocalize with EGFP-LC3 and LAMP1-EGFP (see above for representative images). However, it is difficult to determine whether these puncta represent OPTN-mediated clearing events or overexpressed protein that is being cleared from the cell, as both are destined for autophagosome engulfment and degradation via lysosomal fusion.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) In Figure 2 the authors examine localization of PARK2, TBK1 and OPTN with mitochondria and correlate it with TMRE signal. In some sense, it's a bit hard to judge because they are only showing AOF treated samples and so there isn't a systematic quantification of the number of OPTN-coated mitochondria in the absence of oxidative stress. There are a lot of OPTN-positive, TBK1-positive puncta whose identity are unknown. I also am unsure what the authors mean concerning Figure 2G, where the authors say that the number of OPTN on linear mitochondria are &quot;low and similar in either conditions&quot;. The value is ~29%, which is much higher that the OPTN on fragmented mitochondria, so this doesn't seem to make sense. I am also not sure about the argument made concerning the aspect ratio with and without AOF in Figure 2H. The highest signal in the control sample is also the &lt;1.5 ratio, and this only marginally increased with AOF. So, it would seem to be hard to conclude that this small mitochondria directly represents the ones that are subsequently tagged with OPTN.</p></disp-quote><p>On average ~95% of OPTN-positive mitochondria were TMRE negative in both control and AO-free conditions. Since mitophagy can occur at a basal level, OPTN-positive mitochondria were found in both control and treated conditions, but the number of events was higher in AO-free treated conditions compared to control (see Figure 3D, F for the percent of cells with OPTN-positive mitochondria). In Figure 2D-F, we observed two types of localization that occurred using upstream mitophagy-associated proteins, the formation of rings around damaged mitochondria and puncta that colocalized with isolated mitochondrial fragments. We highlighted examples of each using arrows, but every event was not highlighted.</p><p>As shown in Figure 1âfigure supplement 1D, ~30-40% of total OPTN puncta were found on mitochondria. Of this population, most were localized to linear mitochondria under both control and AO-free conditions. Although, the percent associated with rounded mitochondria was observed to increase significantly upon mild stress in the AO-free condition. We have now clarified this description in the revised manuscript.</p><p>We measured the mitochondrial aspect ratio to determine whether we could quantify minor changes in the mitochondrial network. Overall, we observed a small but significant decrease in the mitochondrial aspect ratio. The binned data illustrate that the fraction of mitochondria with an aspect ratio of â¤1.5 was greater in neurons treated with AO-free media compared to control (now Figure 1âfigure supplement 1A). Additionally, we measured the diameter of OPTN-positive mitochondrial rings and found they were on average ~1.2 Âµm (data not shown). Together these data suggest that some of the small mitochondria represent the ones that are engulfed by OPTN.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Figure 3 looks at the frequency of OPTN encircled mitochondria in axons, dendrites and soma, indicating that virtually no OPTN-positive mitochondria are seen in the axon. The frequency of OPTN-positive mitochondria relative to the total mitochondrial volume in the soma indicates that with AOF, there is a very small amount of damaged mitochondria relative to the total mitochondrial volume. Given this very low value, it would appear to take many axons in order to achieve a similar mitochondrial volume in order to directly compare the frequency of damage and capture by OPTN. So based on a stochastic damage argument, it may be very difficult to detect damaged mito in the axon but that doesn't necessarily mean it doesn't happen there. So, the conclusion in subsection âOPTN-mediated mitophagy occurs preferentially in the somatodendritic compartment of hippocampal neuronsâ might be too strong.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for the insightful comment and agree that it may be difficult to detect damaged mitochondria in the axon based on the stochastic damage argument. We determined the somal mitochondrial content was ~0.2 Âµm<sup>3</sup>/Âµm<sup>3</sup> (Figure 1F) and the axonal mitochondrial content to be ~0.02 Âµm<sup>3</sup>/Âµm<sup>3</sup> (data not shown). Based on these values and the number of somas analyzed in Figure 3, 210-280 axons would need to be analyzed. Since this is not the ideal system for such analysis, we cannot definitively rule out the possibility that an event occurred that we did not image. As a result, we have changed the statement to say âwith limited events in dendrites and axons.â Additionally, we discuss this caveat and provide more axonal analysis in the Results section.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The experiment in Figure 5 is a bit hard to interpret. Since LAMP1 is overexpressed, it is possible that it is marking organelles such as endosomes, in addition to lysosomes. In any event, the apparent number of LysoT positive puncta is far lower than the number of LAMP1 positive puncta, albeit not in the same cells. The major conclusion is that lysosomes are acidified more slowly in neurons, and results in HeLa cells overexpressing OPTN and LAMP1 are used to compare the rates of lysosome acidification. Interpretation of this experiment is difficult because there is no indication of the levels of expression of OPTN/cell. If OPTN overexpression can accelerate the assembly of a fully coated autophagosome around the damaged mitochondria, and therefore the rate of fusion with a lysosome since full closure is required, then the difference in the apparent rate of acidification could simply represent the levels of OPTN in each cell being examined. Since there are no measurements of OPTN levels/per cell and specifically in the cells that are being imaged, it makes it challenging to make the conclusion that rates of acidification are intrinsically slower in neurons. If much less overexpressed OPTN is present in neurons than HeLa, this could explain the difference seen. The authors examined cathepsin cleavage, and find only minor differences as measured in a western blot assay. Since cathepsin processing also requires low lysosomal pH, this a priori would suggest no issue with lysosomal acidification at a global level in the neurons, raising the question of precisely how acidification is regulated.</p></disp-quote><p>We quantified the number of LAMP-positive organelles that are LysoT positive in cells overexpressing LAMP1 or LAMP2, and determined that ~89% of LAMP1 and ~88% of LAMP2 organelles colocalized with LysoT, suggesting no overall defects with lysosomal acidification. Additionally, we confirmed this finding using the SEP-LAMP1-RFP construct. We have further clarified this important issue in the revised manuscript (please see Figure 5âfigure supplement 1 and accompanying text). To address the question of OPTN expression levels, as discussed above in our general response, we now provide images of non-transfected and Halo-OPTN overexpressed cells to illustrate representative levels of endogenous and overexpressed OPTN in the cells we chose for analysis (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig2">Author response image 2</xref> for images).</p><p>While we appreciate the reviewerâs comment that OPTN expression levels could accelerate the assembly of fully coated autophagosomes around damaged mitochondria, we argue that this is less relevant in our experimental conditions. In neurons, we see on average ~1-5 events per cell, which is low and distinct from the number of events during wholesale disruption of the mitochondrial network that is seen in HeLa cells treated with CCCP. As described in Figure 1, we are observing a minor fraction of the neuronal mitochondrial volume turnover. Additionally, we relied on endogenous levels of PINK1 and Parkin to initiate this pathway instead of overexpressed protein. If experimental conditions caused a substantial increase in the number of OPTN-coated mitochondria, then this point would become more relevant. We did look at cathepsin levels and observed no changes in our experimental paradigm. Importantly, we now include data to confirm that lysosomal acidification is normal (see Figure 5âfigure supplement 1). Thus, it would appear that only mitophagolysosome acidification is slow. We plan to follow up on this interesting observation in the future.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>With regards to the conclusions in Figure 5, an ultrastructure analysis in the cited Cheng et al., 2018 paper suggests that LAMP1 can be present on immature double membrane autophagosome-like structures. Is it possible that some of the LAMP1-positive signals lacking LysoT positivity are actually autophagosomes that are LAMP1 positive but not yet fused with a lysosome? Could LAMP1 overexpression affect the interpretation of the experiments?</p></disp-quote><p>Cheng et al., (2018) showed that there is a gradient in the number of LAMP1 organelles that contain Cathepsin D, with soma being higher than the axons and dendrites. In the Results for Figure 5, we argue that the observed discrepancy between LAMP1+/total and LysoT+/total may be in part due to the possibility that some of LAMP1 signal is on âlateâ mitophagosomes (LC3LAMP1-positive) that have yet to fuse with degradative-competent organelles.</p><p>To address this issue more directly, we utilized a tandem SEP-LAMP1-RFP reporter where we could monitor acidified degradative-competent organelles. Using this method, we determined that the vast majority of OPTN rings around damaged mitochondria were dual labeled, indicating non-acidified compartments (see the new Figure 6).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Subsection âLow-level induction of ROS leads to selective mitochondrial damage without compromising the overall mitochondrial networkâ. In the two color old/new mitochondrial experiment, it's hard to imagine how the age can be precisely controlled using the described protocol. The SNAP tag for mito localization contains a COXVIII MTS sequence. As such, it would seem like any mitochondria with a functional translocon could import the SNAP-tag protein, regardless of whether it is old or new, however the authors state that the two populations are &quot;distinct&quot;. The interpretation that old mitochondria can import the newly synthesized snap tag is consistent with most of the mitochondria being double labeled (Figure 6C). Because the mass of old mitochondria is much larger than the mass of new mitochondria that has been made since the new dye was added (dye added for 1 hour) and the number of those mitochondria not undergoing intermixing by fusion is small, the frequency with which such a &quot;new&quot; mitochondria would be identified as damaged and associated with OPTN would be particularly low, relative to the much more abundant old mito. So it seems possible, that this experiment doesn't really have the statistical power to rule out similar rates of old and new mitochondrial engulfment. The authors argue that the absence in green signal means that they are exclusively old, but it also may be that the signal to noise isn't equivalent. The labeling period for old was 24 hours while the labeling for new was only 1 hour. Therefore, all things being equal in terms of mitochondrial assembly/fission/fusion, there should be far less signal for new snap relative to old snap/per individual mito.</p></disp-quote><p>In Figure 7, the labeling period is the same for both âfirstâ and âsecondâ SNAP ligands (30 minutes of labeling, 2 quick washes, and a 30 minute washout). The first SNAP ligand labeled expressed Mito-SNAP from the time of transfection until the SNAP Block labeling, ~24 hours; this is termed the âoldâ mito population. The second SNAP ligand labeled Mito-SNAP that was expressed from the time after SNAP Block until imaging, ~22 hours; this is termed the âyoungâ mito population. The dark SNAP Block was added to saturate any remaining binding sites after the first SNAP labeling (1 ÂµM SNAP-block; 2 hours of labeling, 2 quick washes, and a 30 minute washout).</p><p>It is possible that mitochondria with a functional translocon could import the SNAP-tag protein and ligand, but we would argued that the damaged OPTN-positive mitochondria would not have the capacity to import new protein or be labeled by the new ligand because it is sequestered. Thus, these rounded structures would indicate that they were labeled and engulfed before the addition of the new SNAP-ligand. In the revised manuscript, we more clearly describe the labeling protocol in the text and figure legends and have updated the labeling schematic in the revised Figure 7.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In Figure 7, the authors examine an OPTN mutant found in ALS, and see general but small effects on mitochondrial size. This experiment is somewhat limited by the fact that OPTN deletion by siRNA is only ~60%, and it is possible that the overexpressed OPTN mutant (not sure how much it is overexpressed as they didn't show a western of the transfected cells) may also act as a dominant negative â binding TBK1 but not Ub chains. What isn't clear is whether the authors have missed an opportunity to statistically determine whether the OPTN mutant encircles damaged mito. The experiments are largely limited to mito morphology.</p></disp-quote><p>Please see the revised Figure 8âfigure supplement 1C for a western blot showing relative equal levels of overexpression of Halo-OPTN WT and E478G.

We observed a 30% reduction in Parkin expression by immunoblot analysis. It is important to note that this measurement is an underestimate, as lysates were generated from an entire plate of hippocampal neurons, which transfect at a low efficiency and therefore includes many cells that did not take up the siRNA. When imaging neurons, we selected cells that were transfected and therefore did take up the Parkin siRNA. This level of knock-down was sufficient to significantly inhibit the number of cells with OPTN-positive rings, from ~35% down to less than 10%, which was rescued by re-expression of WT Parkin. This data has been included in the revised manuscript, please see Figure 2âfigure supplement 2.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) A major finding of the manuscript is that mitophagy occurs primarily in the cell soma and not the axons, in contrast to the findings of Ashrafi et al. As a rationale for this discrepancy, they suggest that they are applying a milder stress (withholding antioxidants from neuronal media) that does not lead to global bioenergetic collapse. This explanation doesn't seem satisfactory, however, as Ashrafi et al., also, used a variety of experimental setups to induce local damage mitochondria without affecting the overall bioenergetics of the neuron. An alternative explanation for the discrepancy might be that the particular exposure used by Evans and Holzbaur (withholding antioxidants) preferentially increases oxidative stress and mitochondrial damage in the cell soma as opposed to the axons. Does ROS increase equally in the axon and cell body with antioxidant withdrawal? Does the authors treatment result in TMRE negative mitochondria in axons that are not captured by Optineurin in contrast to the cell soma? When the authors treat with antimycin for 2 hours (which increases ROS locally at the mitochondria) do they see the same preferential increase in mitophagy in the soma or are mitochondria in the axons also targeted? Ashrafi saw axonal events as soon as 45 minutes, do the authors see axonal events at these early timepoints? Ashafri noted increased axonal events with the use of lysosomal inhibitors. If these are used by the authors, do they then see axonal events?</p></disp-quote><p>Ashrafi et al., (2014) induced mitochondrial damage using much higher doses of AA (20 or 40 ÂµM) or locally via mito-KillerRed. In the mito-KillerRed experiments, imaging was initially performed in HBSS buffer instead of Hibernate E to enhance the effects of ROS produced by mito-KillerRed. We argue that this approach may affect the overall bioenergetics of the neuron.</p><p>We performed experiments to observe the ROS production of axonal mitochondria in neurons treated with antioxidant removal or by a much lower concentration of AA. We measured CellROX fluorescence intensity in the soma and processes of hippocampal neurons using fluorescence microscopy (note CellROX measurements in Figure 1B were performed on a plate reader). In these experiments, we observed significant increases in ROS production, measured by increases in CellROX intensity, in both the soma and processes of hippocampal neurons following 6 hours AO-free or 2 hours of 3 nM AA treatment (Figure 3G-H), suggesting that our global treatment targets all mitochondria. Further, since we observed shorter axonal mitochondria after 2 hours AA treatment, this timepoint should be sufficient to identify axonal events.</p><p>To follow up on this point, we measured axonal mitochondrial health using TMRE and saw no differences in TMRE intensity across these conditions (Figure 3âfigure supplement 1J). However, this is not surprising as we did not observe differences in the somal mitochondrial population, where we routinely saw mitophagic events (Figure 1D). These observations are fully consistent with our approach of inducing low level damage without grossly perturbing the overall mitochondrial network.</p><p>We treated cells for 2 hours with AA and looked for colocalization of OPTN with fragmented mitochondria in the axon. Of the 21 neurons analyzed, we did not observe OPTN-positive mitochondria in the axon. Yet, similar treatments resulted in 35% of neurons having OPTN-positive mitochondria rings in the soma (Figure 3F), suggesting preferential increases in the somal compartment. Additional experiments were performed where AA treatments were reduced to 1 hour. Again, we observed mitophagic events were rare in the axon (3 events in 1 axon of the 28 neurons analyzed), but routinely found in soma (Figure 3D). However, we think it likely that if we did use a 10-20-fold higher dose of AA, we might see more evidence of axonal mitophagy as previously described (Ashrafi et al., 2014). It is possible that neurons are in a survival state, where axonal mitochondria undergo mitophagy locally to preserve the health of the neuron. We clarify this point in the revised manuscript. In general, however, under the paradigm described here axonal mitophagic events were rare across all conditions and did not increase with mild oxidative stress relative to control or with longer incubation times (1 vs 6 hours).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) In Figure 5 the authors compare the speed of mitophagosome maturation in neurons and HeLa cells. They conclude that the difference in speed reflects a difference in processes downstream of mitochondrial ubiquitination, but the level mitochondrial ubiquitination is likely very different in neurons with endogenous Parkin subjected to mild oxidative stress and HeLa cells over-expressing Parkin and fully depolarized with OA. Could this account for the difference in maturation rate? Do the authors still see a difference in the speed of mitophagosome maturation when the two cell types are subjected to more equal treatment â e.g., in neurons and HeLa cells that are both overexpressing Parkin and are subjected to the same oxidative stress (e.g., antimycin)? Additionally, the authors note that acidification of mitoauthophagosomes is delayed in neurons? How long is it delayed? What do they see at time points longer than one day?</p></disp-quote><p>While we appreciate the point that we could use alternate paradigms to induce mitochondrial stress or attempt to equalize levels of Parkin expression to make HeLa cells a closer model of neuronal mitophagy, we thought that the more important question was to determine whether there is a universal deficit in autophagosome/lysosome acidification in hippocampal neurons subjected to mild oxidative stress, or whether there is a specific deficit in the acidification and eventual degradation of mitophagolysosomes. We therefore focused on this point. New data now included in the manuscript reveal that there is no overall perturbation in the extent of either autophagosomal or lysosomal acidification in neurons incubated in AO-free media as compared to control conditions (Figure 5âfigure supplement 1). Thus, our data suggest that delayed acidification of mitophagosomes or âlateâ mitophagosomes is specific in neurons. Using our experimental conditions, it would be difficult to continuously image cells for days. However, in Figure 7 we include data demonstrating the persistence of pulse-labeled OPTN-positive mitochondria that had yet to undergo autophagosome or lysosome engulfment 24 hours after mitophagy induction. Thus, the delay in acidification of mitophagolysosomes appears to be on the order of hours to days.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3:</p><p>In the manuscript by Evans and Holzbaur, the authors examine the dynamics of OPTN recruitment to mitochondria and subsequent delivery to lysosomes following mild oxidative stress in primary rat hippocampal neurons. The authors mainly use transfected neurons and live-cell microscopy and find that OPTN is rapidly recruited to a subset of mitochondria, primarily in the soma, following anti-oxidant removal from the cell media. This then correlated with subsequent recruitment of mitophagy and lysosomal markers. Surprisingly, and the main take home message from the manuscript, was that the OPTN puncta on mitochondria do not become efficiently acidified (as visualized by col-localisation with lysotracker), from which the authors conclude that this is a rate-limiting step during neuronal mitophagy.</p><p>This is an intriguing manuscript with many interesting observations. The identification of &quot;mild&quot; depolarising conditions that trigger a mitophagy response will be useful to the field and certainly does appear more physiological that the use of CCCP or oligomycin/antimycin.

However, I think more work is needed to determine whether this phenomenon is specific to mitophagosomes and neurons in general.</p><p>Major comments:</p><p>1) I think more robust analyses of lysosome acidification are needed. It is surprising and very interesting that there is a large delay in acidification of mitolysosomes. Is this a general phenomenon, i.e are acidified lysosomes scarce in these cells? What is the percentage of LAMP1 structures (regardless of co-localising with OPTN) that are LysoTracker +ve? If it is low, could this mean that most of the LAMP1-GFP is not in lysosomes?

Furthermore, we observed a considerable amount of LC3-II via western blot across all conditions (Figure 1G-H).

However, in both control and AO-free conditions OPTN-LC3-positive mitochondria were negative for WIPI2B, suggesting that these autophagosomes are fully formed.</p><fig id="respfig5"><label>Author response image 5.</label><caption><title>Representative images of neurons 1 h after control or AO-free treatment.</title><p>Mitophagosomes are indicated by red arrows and inset.

I think the authors need to provide some more data in relevant cell lines for a better comparison. What about cortical neurons, as well and comparing with primary fibroblasts (which should contain all the relevant Parkin pathway components)?</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for their comment. The use of HeLa cells provides an alternative cell line to investigate mitophagy. Since HeLa cells are readily used to characterize mitophagy and we observed similar temporal dynamics for OPTN and LC3 translocation, we felt that it was a suitable system to compare for rates of mitophagosome acidification. Previous work has looked at the time course of mitophagy in cortical neurons where the authors suggested that mitophagy was slower and compartmentally restricted compared to non-neuronal cells (Cai et al., 2012), consistent with our findings â we further clarify this point in the revised manuscript.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were requested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The manuscript has been improved but there are some remaining issues that need to be addressed before acceptance, as outlined below:</p><p>Based on the comments of reviewer 3, a couple of changes in the manuscript are still needed. First, some data that are described in the rebuttal don't appear in the paper, so Figure 4 may need to be updated to include data that were discussed in the rebuttal. In addition, there are a couple of suggested changes to the text that will need to be addressed.</p><p>Reviewer #3:</p><p>This is a re-review of the manuscript by Evans et al., describing the slow maturation/impaired acidification of mitophagosomes in the soma of neurons. I think the authors have done a great job in strengthening their manuscript â my main concern was with the lysosomal acidification studies and the use of the dual reporters means the data are much more convincing. I just have a few small points remaining:</p><p>1) The LAMP2 data, mentioned in subsectionâ Acidification of OPTN-positive mitochondria is a rate-limiting step in neuronal mitophagyâ and in the comments to reviewers does not seem to be in the manuscript. The authors mention Figure 4E, but these are only LC3-related. Please include the data.</p></disp-quote><p>In addition to providing the percent of LAMP1 and LAMP2 structures that were Lyso-T positive in the text, we now include images in the revised manuscript (please see Figure 5âfigure supplement 1).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Likewise, the authors show data in the reviewers comments that the OPTN/LC3 structures are WIPI -ve. I do not see these data in the manuscript. This shows that the structures are not early autophagosomal in nature and thus they will be of interest to readers (and not just this reviewer) and so should be included (at least in the supplemental). I'm assuming WIPI2B is expressed in these cells and does indeed form puncta with LC3 when autophagy is induced?</p></disp-quote><p>At the reviewerâs request, we now include the WIPI2B data in Figure 5âfigure supplement 1. WIPI2B, an early autophagosome marker, has been shown to be critical in the autophagy pathway, as depletion of WIPI2 in DRG neurons significantly decreased autophagosome biogenesis (Stavoe et al., 2019). In hippocampal neurons, we observed WIPI2B puncta that colocalized with LC3 in the soma, indicating immature autophagosomes (examples are highlighted by green arrows).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) I also take on the point that the authors have made in response to my concern raised in point 5 â i.e. that HeLa cells overexpressing Parkin are a suitable system to compare to the neurons. The HeLa cell has been instrumental in the field in terms of building up the mechanism of PINK/Parkin mitophagy. But this is not a &quot;normal&quot; cell. Normally, it does not undergo this pathway as it does not express Parkin! I think to avoid doing more experiments, the authors can be more accurate in what they state and say that this delay in acidification does not occur in HeLa cells expressing Parkin. For example in subsection âAcidification of OPTN-positive mitochondria is a rate-limiting step in neuronal mitophagyâ: &quot;â¦..much slower than the corresponding time course in non-neuronal cells.&quot; Should be replaced with &quot;â¦..much slower than the corresponding time course in HeLa cells.&quot;</p></disp-quote><p>The statement has been changed to âmuch slower than the corresponding time course in HeLa cells expressing exogenous Parkin.â</p></body></sub-article></article>
