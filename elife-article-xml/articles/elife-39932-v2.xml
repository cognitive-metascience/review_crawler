about the interplay of these nucleation factors. Here, we show that the budding yeast Stu2 in complex with the γ-tubulin receptor Spc72 nucleates microtubules in vitro without the small γ-tubulin complex (γ-TuSC). Upon γ-TuSC addition, Stu2 facilitates Spc72<bold>–</bold>γ-TuSC interaction by binding to Spc72 and γ-TuSC. Stu2 together with Spc72<bold>–</bold>γ-TuSC increases microtubule nucleation in a process that is dependent on the TOG domains of Stu2. Importantly, these activities are also important for microtubule nucleation in vivo. Stu2 stabilizes Spc72<bold>–</bold>γ-TuSC at the minus end of cytoplasmic microtubules (cMTs) and an in vivo assay indicates that cMT nucleation requires the TOG domains of Stu2. Upon γ-tubulin depletion, we observed efficient cMT nucleation away from the spindle pole body (SPB), which was dependent on Stu2. Thus, γ-TuSC restricts cMT assembly to the SPB whereas Stu2 nucleates cMTs together with γ-TuSC and stabilizes γ-TuSC at the cMT minus end.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>TOG domain protein</kwd><kwd>Stu2</kwd><kwd>microtubule nucleation</kwd><kwd>γ-TuSC</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>S. cerevisiae</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001659</institution-id><institution>Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Schi295/4-3</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Gunzelmann</surname><given-names>Judith</given-names></name><name><surname>Lin</surname><given-names>Tien-chen</given-names></name><name><surname>Neuner</surname><given-names>Annett</given-names></name><name><surname>Jäkle</surname><given-names>Ursula</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Biochemical and genetic approaches show that the XMAP215 homolog Stu2 directly interacts with the small gamma-tubulin complex and its recruitment factor Spc72 to instigate functions in cytoplasmic microtubule organization.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Microtubules (MTs) are cylindrical polymers composed of tubulin, a heterodimer of α- and β-tubulin, with β-tubulin facing the more dynamic MT plus end and α-tubulin the less dynamic MT minus end (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Mitchison, 1993</xref>). One factor that promotes MT nucleation and that resides at the MT minus end is the γ-tubulin complex, which is composed of γ-tubulin and additional γ-tubulin complex proteins (GCPs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Zheng et al., 1995</xref>). The γ-tubulin small complex (γ-TuSC) of budding yeast contains γ-tubulin Tub4, GCP2/Spc97 and GCP3/Spc98. The γ-TuSC oligomerizes into a left-handed spiral upon interaction with the γ-tubulin receptor protein Spc110 at the nuclear side of the yeast spindle pole body (SPB) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Geissler et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Knop and Schiebel, 1997</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Kollman et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Nguyen et al., 1998</xref>). In human cells, the γ-TuSC, together with GCP4, GCP5 and GCP6, forms a stable γ-tubulin ring complex (γ-TuRC) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Zheng et al., 1995</xref>). Through the interaction of γ-tubulin with α/β-tubulin, the kinetic barrier of α/β-tubulin oligomerization is overcome and MT assembly is facilitated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kollman et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Roostalu and Surrey, 2017</xref>).</p><p>Stu2, as well as XMAP215/ZYG-9/Dis1/Alp14/Msps/ch, belongs to a family of proteins that contain TOG (Tumour Overexpressed Gene) domains (here collectively called TOG-domain proteins) and function as MT polymerases. They localize to both the plus and the minus end of MTs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Ayaz et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Ayaz et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Brouhard et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Podolski et al., 2014</xref>). The two TOG domains at the N-terminus of budding yeast Stu2 can directly bind α/β-tubulin. Further on, Stu2 can be recruited to MTs via its C-terminal MT-binding site. This interaction of Stu2 with MTs recruits the α/β-tubulin heterodimer to the growing MT plus end, promoting MT polymerisation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Al-Bassam et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Ayaz et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Ayaz et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Brouhard et al., 2008</xref>).</p><p>Proteins such as the human ‘Transforming Acidic Coiled Coil’ (TACC) protein CDK5RAP2, the <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic> SPD-5 or the budding yeast γ-TuSC receptor protein Spc72 target TOG domain proteins to sites of MT nucleation at the centrosome and the SPB (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Chavali et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chen et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cuschieri et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Raff, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Sato et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Usui et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Woodruff et al., 2017</xref>). In vitro studies indicated a role for TOG domain proteins in MT nucleation, in cooperation with either the γ-tubulin complex or the MT binding protein TPX2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Roostalu et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Thawani et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Wieczorek et al., 2015</xref>). Just recently, it was suggested that XMAP215 has the ability to interact with purified human γ-tubulin via its C-terminal MT-binding domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Thawani et al., 2018</xref>). Furthermore, an in vitro study suggests that the <italic>C. elegans</italic> SPD-5 forms a gel-like matrix, which is able to recruit ZYG-9 and the microtubule stabilizing protein TPXL-1 (TPX2 homolog). These proteins together concentrate α/β-tubulin, leading to MT nucleation in form of asters, without the action of γ-tubulin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Woodruff et al., 2017</xref>). The emerging picture is that TOG-domain proteins have the ability to nucleate MTs in vitro. However, the following open questions remain: (1) Do TOG domain proteins have the ability to nucleate MTs in vivo independently of γ-tubulin complexes? (2) Do TOG domain proteins have structural functions at the MT minus end? (3) Is the role of TOG-domain proteins in MT nucleation context specific (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Roostalu and Surrey, 2017</xref>)?</p><p>The <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> SPB provides an ideal system to address these questions because it has spatially distinct MT nucleation sites at the SPB. The SPB is embedded in the nuclear envelope and only the cytoplasmic side recruits Stu2 through binding to the γ-TuSC receptor protein Spc72 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chen et al., 1998</xref>). By contrast, the pericentrin orthologue Spc110 localizes and oligomerizes γ-TuSC on the nuclear side of the SPB without Stu2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Kilmartin and Goh, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Knop and Schiebel, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Lin et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Sundberg et al., 1996</xref>). Spc110 has a well-established Centrosomin Motif 1 (CM1) that interacts with γ-TuSC. Interestingly, the cytoplasmic Spc72 has only a degenerated CM1 whose function has not been investigated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chen et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Usui et al., 2003</xref>).</p><p>Here, we analysed the role of Stu2 at MT nucleation sites and its cooperation with γ-TuSC. Unlike the Spc110–γ-TuSC interaction, we found that γ-TuSC binding to Spc72 is of relatively low affinity. However, binding of Stu2 to Spc72 increases the affinity for γ-TuSC 20-fold. Consistent with these in vitro data, Stu2 stabilized the γ-TuSC cap at the minus end of single cytoplasmic microtubules (cMTs) in vivo. Furthermore, in vitro reconstitution of MT assembly indicated that the purified Stu2–Spc72 complex was already sufficient to nucleate MT asters. Addition of recombinant γ-TuSC to the Spc72–Stu2 complex promoted γ-TuSC oligomerization into a functional MT nucleation template independent of the TOG domains of Stu2. However, efficient MT nucleation from these Spc72–Stu2–γ-TuSC complexes required the action of the TOG domains. The reason could be that the TOG domains of Stu2 facilitate binding of the first α/β-tubulin subunits to the γ-tubulin template. Complementary in vivo studies supported the role of Stu2 in MT nucleation. The depletion of γ-tubulin Tub4 did not inhibit cytoplasmic MT (cMT) nucleation, but these MTs assembled in the cytoplasm away from the SPB and were strictly dependent on Stu2. Together, this study illustrates specific roles for Stu2 and γ-TuSC in MT nucleation and in the maintenance of the γ-TuSC oligomer at the cMT minus end.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>The CM1 of Spc72 mediates binding to γ-TuSC</title><p>The CM1 motif of Spc110 interacts with γ-TuSC and is essential for its oligomerization into an active nucleation template (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Lin et al., 2014</xref>). Sequence alignments indicate that the N-terminus of Spc72 carries a CM1 motif (63–88 aa) that is, however, shorter (25 amino acids in Spc72 versus 78 in Spc110) than the canonical CM1 motifs in budding yeast Spc110, <italic>Drosophila</italic> CNN and human CDK5RAP2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Lin et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Lin et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Usui et al., 2003</xref>).

To test for the interaction of Spc72 with the γ-TuSC,we designed constructs expressing the N-terminal portion from amino acids (aa) 1–267 (Spc72N), a mutant CM1 version (Spc72N<sup>CM1</sup>; aa 1–267 with K75A, K77A, E83A) and a Stu2-binding deficient mutant (Spc72N<sup>∆Stu2</sup>; Spc72N with deletion of aa 116–230). In pulldown experiments, γ-TuSC showed reduced binding to Spc72N<sup>CM1</sup> in comparison to Spc72N or Spc72N<sup>∆Stu2</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1c</xref>, Spc97-blot). Quantification of the interaction affinities by microscale thermophoresis (MST) determined the dissociation constant (K<sub>d</sub>) of the Spc72N–γ-TuSC interaction with the high value of 1.1 µM, which reflects a relatively low binding affinity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1d</xref>).

Also in case of Spc110, a mutant CM1 version (Spc110N<sup>CM1</sup>, K120Q; E121A) showed reduced binding affinity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1e</xref>). In conclusion, Spc72 can bind the γ-TuSC dependent on the CM1, but with a 20-fold lower affinity than Spc110.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Stu2 binding to Spc72 enhances interaction with γ-TuSC</title><p>The relatively low affinity (high K<sub>d</sub>) of Spc72 for γ-TuSC raises the question of how this receptor recruits the γ-TuSC to the SPB efficiently. Stu2, which interacts with Spc72, could mediate the binding of γ-TuSC to Spc72. To test this notion, we quantified the interactions between Spc72 and Stu2, as well as the Spc72–Stu2 complex and the interaction with γ-TuSC. The requirement for the last 33 aa of Stu2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2a</xref>) and for aa 116 to 230 of Spc72 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref>) for the Spc72–Stu2 interaction was confirmed in pulldown experiments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1a and b</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Usui et al., 2003</xref>). Quantitative MST measurements determined the K<sub>d</sub> of the Spc72N and Stu2 interaction as 115 nM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2b</xref>). This high-affinity binding was dependent on the Stu2-binding site of Spc72 and the C-terminus of Stu2, as Spc72N<sup>∆Stu2</sup> showed 23-fold reduced binding to Stu2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2b</xref>) and because a Stu2 construct that lacks the 33 C-terminal aa (Stu2<sup>∆C</sup>) did not interact with Spc72N (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2b</xref>). Surprisingly, Spc72N<sup>CM1</sup>also reduced the binding affinity to Stu2 in the quantitative MST assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2b</xref>). Thus, mutations in the CM1 motif of Spc72 not only affect the interaction of Spc72 with γ-TuSC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1d</xref>) but also Spc72 binding to Stu2, indicating an unexpected interdependency between both binding sites in Spc72.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.39932.003</object-id><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>High-affinity binding of the Spc72N–Stu2 complex to γ-TuSC.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) Scheme of the Stu2 substructure.

Indeed, MST measurements indicated high-affinity binding of Stu2 to the γ-TuSC with a K<sub>d</sub> of 63.4 nM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2d</xref>). To understand which domain of Stu2 was responsible for this interaction with γ-TuSC, we used pulldown assays with the recombinant TOG domains of Stu2 (Stu2<sup>TOG</sup>; described in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Widlund et al., 2012</xref>]) and the fragment spanning the MT binding region of Stu2 (Stu2<sup>MT</sup>; aa 451–684).

By contrast, Stu2<sup>MT</sup> pulled down the γ-TuSC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1f</xref>; Spc97-blot) but failed to interact with α/β-tubulin.

We were interested in whether Spc72 with the shorter CM1 had a similar impact on γ-TuSC. In comparison to Spc110N, Spc72N had only weak γ-TuSC oligomerization activity (compare <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2e</xref> with <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2a and b</xref>).

The MT polymerase Stu2 occasionally nucleated MT asters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3a and b</xref>), but the overall MT nucleation activity of Stu2<sup>WT</sup> was low (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1b</xref>).

Stu2<sup>TOGAA</sup>, Stu2<sup>∆MT</sup> and Stu2<sup>∆CC</sup> in combination with α/β-tubulin lacked the weak MT aster-forming ability of the Stu2<sup>WT</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1a and c</xref>). In addition, Stu2<sup>∆MT</sup> and Stu2<sup>∆CC</sup> in complex with Spc72N did not assemble MT asters, as was the case for Spc72N–Stu2<sup>WT</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3b and d</xref>). Interestingly, Spc72N–Stu2<sup>TOGAA</sup> assembled asters with the same frequency as Spc72N–Stu2<sup>WT</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3b and d</xref>) that had a similar MT intensity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3e and f</xref>). However, the overall MT nucleation activity of Spc72N–Stu2<sup>WT</sup> was slightly higher than that of Spc72–Stu2<sup>TOGAA</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4b</xref>). Thus, Stu2 in complex with Spc72 assembles MT asters dependent on its MT-binding site and the dimerizing coiled-coil region. In this assay, mutations in the TOG domains of Stu2 did not affect the density of the MTs in the asters but the overall MT nucleation activity was slightly reduced.</p><p>As next a step, we measured the impact of γ-TuSC combined with Spc72N, Stu2 and Spc72N–Stu2 for MT nucleation. Incubation of α/β-tubulin with γ-TuSC led to the formation of single MTs. However, the nucleation activity was low (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4a and b</xref>). The addition of Spc72N to γ-TuSC produced a similarly low MT nucleation activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4a and b</xref>), probably reflecting the poor oligomerization of γ-TuSC by Spc72N (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2e</xref>). Interestingly, γ-TuSC enhanced the MT nucleation and aster-forming activities of Stu2–Spc72N by factors of 3.1 and 1.5, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4a,b and c</xref>). For this enhancement, Stu2 had to be in complex with Spc72N as the MT nucleation and aster-formation activity of Stu2 alone was not changed upon the addition of γ-TuSC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1a</xref> to c). Thus, γ-TuSC increases the ability of the Spc72–Stu2 complex to nucleate MTs and to form asters.</p><p>Subsequently, we tested the domains of Stu2 that were needed for MT nucleation together with γ-TuSC. Aster formation by Spc72N–Stu2–γ-TuSC complex was dependent on the dimerizing coiled-coil region and the MT-binding domain of Stu2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4a and b</xref>). The two TOG domains of Stu2 did not influence the number of MT asters formed by Spc72N–Stu2–γ-TuSC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4a and c</xref>). However, MT asters, which assembled in the presence of Spc72N–Stu2–γ-TuSC, were denser than those formed by Spc72N–Stu2<sup>TOGAA</sup>-γ-TuSC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3f</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4d</xref>). This reduction in aster density was reflected in a lower overall MT nucleation activity of Spc72N–Stu2<sup>TOGAA</sup>-γ-TuSC compared to that of Spc72N–Stu2<sup>WT</sup>-γ-TuSC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4b</xref>). As Spc72N–Stu2<sup>TOGAA</sup> efficiently assembled γ-TuSC oligomers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2d</xref>), it is likely that the reduction of the MT density in the Spc72N–Stu2<sup>TOGAA</sup>-γ-TuSC asters is caused by a decrease in the MT polymerization activity of Stu2<sup>TOGAA</sup>.</p><p>This analysis indicates that Spc72N–Stu2 efficiently assembles MTs in cooperation with γ-TuSC. The TOG domains, the MT-binding site and the dimerizing coiled-coil region of Stu2 are required for the full MT nucleation activity of the Spc72N–Stu2–γ-TuSC complex.</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>Spc72 and Kar9 target Stu2 to the cMT minus end</title><p>We next used a series of in vivo experiments to test the role of Stu2 in maintaining γ-TuSC at the minus end of detached cMTs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>) and the function of Stu2 and Tub4 in cMT nucleation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>).

In the presence of α-factor, it is the Kar1–Spc72 interaction that anchors cMTs to the bridge structure of the SPB (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Pereira et al., 1999</xref>). The mutated Kar1∆15 protein lacks the region that mediates Spc72 binding. Therefore, in around 40% of <italic>kar1∆15</italic> cells, cMTs detach from the SPB into the cytoplasm in response to α-factor treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5a</xref>). Previously, we have shown by electron tomography that detached cMTs are single MTs with a Spc72–γ-TuSC cap at their minus end (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Erlemann et al., 2012</xref>). We noticed that in around 70% of cells, the minus end of detached cMTs (as marked by Spc72 or Tub4) localized within the schmoo tip region (2 µm radius). This orientation is probably a reflection of the association of the minus end motor Kar3 with the schmoo tip (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Maddox et al., 2003</xref>), pulling the detached cMT minus ends into the schmoo.</p><p>We first used this system of detached cMTs to study the localisation of Stu2 at the cMT minus end. In 85% of <italic>SPC72 kar1∆15</italic> cells with detached cMTs, Stu2–yeGFP was enriched together with Spc72–mCherry at the minus end of cMTs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5b</xref>, top). About 15% of detached cMTs did not carry a Stu2 peak signal that overlapped with Spc72 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5b</xref>, bottom). Stu2–yeGFP weakly decorated the MT wall of both detached cMT types (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5b</xref>). Surprisingly, Stu2–yeGFP also associated with the minus end marker Tub4–mCherry in the majority (61%) of <italic>spc72<sup>∆Stu2</sup> kar1∆15</italic> cells with detached cMTs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5c</xref>, top), whereas 39% of detached cMTs did not show Stu2 enrichment with Tub4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5c</xref>, bottom). Spc72<sup>∆Stu2</sup> still localized to the end of detached cMT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1a</xref>). The Spc72–yeGFP and Stu2–yeGFP signals at the minus end of detached cMTs were quantified in order to gain a better understanding of their recruitment to this site. The normalized signal intensity at the cMT minus end was 0.19 for Spc72–yeGFP and 0.95 for Stu2–yeGFP in WT <italic>kar1∆15</italic> cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5d and e</xref>). In <italic>spc72<sup>∆Stu2</sup> kar1∆15</italic> cells, the normalized intensity was 0.17 for Spc72<sup>∆Stu2</sup>-yeGFP and 1.25 for Stu2–yeGFP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5d and e</xref>). Together, this evidence indicates a five-fold excess of Stu2 over Spc72 at cMT nucleation sites, as well as Spc72-independent recruitment of Stu2 to the cMT minus end.</p><p>The existence of another Stu2 interaction partner at the cMT minus end was further supported by fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP) experiments. Spc72–yeGFP at detached cMTs showed no recovery after bleaching. By contrast, 58% of Stu2–yeGFP recovered with a half time of 3.3 s, indicating a dynamic and stable Stu2 pool (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5f</xref>). In <italic>spc72<sup>∆Stu2</sup> kar1∆15</italic> cells, Stu2–yeGFP at cMTs ends almost completely recovered with a half time of 5.6 s. The complete recovery in the latter experiment also ruled out the possibility of the limitation of freely available Stu2–yeGFP, as the analyzed <italic>spc72<sup>∆Stu2</sup> kar1∆15</italic> cells showed higher Stu2–yeGFP signal intensity at the cMT minus end before bleaching in comparison to <italic>SPC72 kar1∆15</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5f</xref>). In conclusion, a stable fraction of Stu2 binds to the minus end of cMTs via Spc72 and a dynamic fraction binds via an additional factor.</p></sec><sec id="s2-6"><title>Stu2 stabilizes γ-tubulin at cMT ends</title><p>We wanted to identify the second recruitment factor for Stu2 at the minus end of cMTs. A possible candidate was the MT-associated protein Kar9, which localises to the SPB in a process that is dependent on the C-terminus of γ-tubulin Tub4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cuschieri et al., 2006</xref>). In addition, Kar9 is a known interaction partner of Stu2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Miller et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Moore and Miller, 2007</xref>). Consistent with these interactions, Kar9 co-localized dot-like with Spc72–mCherry at 81% of detached cMTs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6a</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1b</xref>). Quantification of the Kar9–yeGFP single intensity at the minus end of detached cMTs indicated a high relative abundance of 1.79 in <italic>SPC72 kar1∆15</italic> cells (normalized to Cse4–yeGFP) that was even further increased to 3.27 in <italic>spc72<sup>∆Stu2</sup> kar1∆15</italic> cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1c</xref>). Thus, the lack of the Stu2-binding site in Spc72 increases Kar9 recruitment to the cMT minus end. Considering Stu2 binding to Kar9 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Miller et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Moore and Miller, 2007</xref>), this result provides an explanation for the enhanced binding of Stu2 to the cMT minus end in <italic>spc72<sup>∆Stu2</sup></italic> cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5e</xref>).</p><p>To show that a fraction of Stu2 is indeed recruited to the cMT minus end via Kar9, we constructed endogenous <italic>KAR9</italic> gene fusions with the auxin-induced degron (AID)-tag (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Nishimura et al., 2009</xref>). Addition of the auxin homologue IAA to <italic>KAR9–AID kar1∆15</italic> cells promoted the degradation of Kar9–AID (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1d</xref>) and decreased Stu2–yeGFP intensity at cMT minus ends from 0.95 to 0.44 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6b</xref>). By contrast, Spc72 was not affected by the depletion of Kar9 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6c</xref>). These data support the notion that Kar9 is the second Stu2-binding factor at the cMT minus end. Therefore, the depletion of Kar9 in <italic>spc72<sup>∆Stu2</sup></italic> cells should further decrease Stu2–yeGFP intensity at the minus end of detached cMTs. However, as outlined below, these measurements were complicated by the instability of cMTs in <italic>spc72<sup>∆Stu2</sup> KAR9–AID kar1∆15</italic> cells and by the observation that of the surviving detached cMTs only half carried Tub4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6f and g</xref>). The normalized Stu2–yeGFP signal intensity at these rare Tub4-positive cMT minus ends was measured with ~0.82, which is clearly higher than the signal in <italic>KAR9–AID</italic> cells (0.44; compare <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5e</xref> with <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6b</xref>). This suggests that Kar9–AID was not fully degraded in these <italic>spc72<sup>∆Stu2</sup> KAR9–AID</italic> cells with detached cMTs. Indeed, variations between yeast cells in the efficiency of the auxin-induced degradation of proteins have been reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Papagiannakis et al., 2017</xref>). This residual amount of Kar9–AID in the small number of <italic>spc72<sup>∆Stu2</sup> KAR9–AID</italic> cells with cMTs was, however, below the detection limit of the immunoblot in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1d</xref>. Taken together, this evidence suggests that Kar9 and Spc72 recruit Stu2 to the minus end of cMTs.</p><p>Subsequently, we aimed to analyse the function of Stu2 at the minus end of detached cMTs. We used <italic>KAR9–AID</italic> in combination with the <italic>spc72<sup>∆Stu2</sup></italic> mutation in order to reduce Stu2 specifically at the minus end of cMTs. <italic>kar1∆15</italic> cells were incubated with α-factor for 60 min simultaneously with the addition of IAA or the solvent control. <italic>spc72<sup>∆Stu2</sup> KAR9–AID kar1∆15</italic> cells that were exposed to IAA showed a reduction in cMT numbers (33%; attached and detached) in comparison to the <italic>SPC72 KAR9–AID kar1∆15</italic> cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6d</xref>), indicating a function for Stu2 in the nucleation or stability of cMTs.</p><p>The C-terminal 33 aa of Stu2 mediate binding with Spc72 and Kar9 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Moore and Miller, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Usui et al., 2003</xref>). Therefore, we would expect that <italic>stu2<sup>∆C</sup> kar1∆15</italic> cells would show a reduction in cMT number similar to that shown by <italic>spc72<sup>∆Stu2</sup> KAR9–AID kar1∆15</italic> cells that have been exposed to IAA. This was indeed the case (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1e</xref>). Using immunoblotting, we confirmed that Stu2<sup>∆C</sup> was expressed similarly to WT Stu2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1f</xref>). Together, these experiments led us to conclude that the impairment of both Stu2-binding sites at the cMT minus end affects cMT stability or nucleation.</p><p>To further clarify the role of Stu2 in cMT function, we performed a time course experiment with <italic>spc72<sup>∆Stu2</sup> KAR9 kar1∆15</italic> cells and <italic>spc72<sup>∆Stu2</sup> KAR9–AID kar1∆15</italic> cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6e</xref>). In this experiment, Kar9 was depleted after detachment of cMTs from the SPB, meaning that we analysed the function of Stu2 on the preassembled γ-TuSC oligomere. We observed that the number of detached cMTs in <italic>spc72<sup>∆Stu2</sup> KAR9–AID kar1∆15</italic> cells gradually decreased from 50% (t = 0) to 25% within 60 min after the addition of IAA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6f</xref>). This decrease coincided with a general decline in cMT-number in <italic>spc72<sup>∆Stu2</sup> KAR9–AID kar1∆15</italic> cells in the presence of IAA from 83% to 27%. Thus, Stu2 at the minus end of detached cMTs is probably needed for their stability.</p><p>One possible interpretation of the outcome of the experiment in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6f</xref> is the detachment of the γ-TuSC cap, followed by MT depolymerisation when Stu2 is removed from the cMT minus end. Indeed, IAA addition to <italic>spc72<sup>∆Stu2</sup> KAR9–AID kar1∆15</italic> cells reduced not only the number of cMTs but also the percentage of detached cMTs with a Tub4 signal from close to 100% to 54% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6g</xref>). This analysis suggests that Stu2 removal from the cMT minus end triggers the disassembly of γ-TuSC cap followed by cMT depolymerisation. It is in agreement with the in vitro data illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>, indicating a stabilizing role for Stu2 in the Spc72–γ-TuSC interaction.</p></sec><sec id="s2-7"><title>MT nucleation with reduced γ-tubulin Tub4</title><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref> has shown a function of Stu2 in maintaining the γ-TuSC oligomer at the minus end of assembled cMTs.

However, we noticed that ~10% of Tub4–AID resisted degradation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1b</xref>). Next, <italic>TUB4</italic> and <italic>TUB4–AID</italic> cells were arrested with α-factor in G<sub>1</sub> followed by the addition of nocodazole to depolymerize MTs and of IAA to induce degradation of Tub4–AID. Finally, nocodazole was washed out to promote MT re-nucleation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7a</xref>). In all strain backgrounds, close to 100% of the cells invariably lacked MTs upon nocodazole treatment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Adams and Pringle, 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Gombos et al., 2013</xref>). In response to nocodazole wash out, MTs re-polymerized in WT <italic>TUB4</italic> cells as analysed after 30 min (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7b</xref>). Only the nuclear MTs overlapped with the NLS–BFP (the nuclear localization signal fused to a blue fluorescence protein) staining region, whereas cMTs did not (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7b</xref>), so we were able to distinguish the two MT-types clearly. About 97% of WT cells carried cMTs after 30 min of nocodazole wash out (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7b</xref>). Most (86%) of these cMTs were associated with the Spc42–mCherry-marked SPB. Surprisingly, IAA-induced depletion of Tub4 only mildly affected cMT nucleation efficiency as 90% of the cells carried cMTs after 30 min (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7b</xref>). Strikingly, about 45% of these cMTs were not associated with the SPB but resided in the cytoplasm away from the NLS–BFP-marked nucleus. Analysis of the localization of the γ-TuSC receptor Spc72–mCherry, and of the γ-TuSC complex components Spc97–mCherry and Spc98–mCherry in <italic>TUB4–AID</italic> cells after nocodazole wash out, indicated that the free cMTs did not contain Spc72, Spc97 or Spc98 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7c</xref>, left). In a control experiment, we established that these proteins were detected at the minus end of detached cMTs of <italic>kar1∆15</italic> cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7c</xref>, right) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Erlemann et al., 2012</xref>). Thus, our detection system was sensitive enough to visualize Spc72, Spc97 and Spc98 at the minus end of single cMTs. These data suggest γ-TuSC-independent cMT nucleation in <italic>TUB4–AID</italic> cells.</p><p>The nuclear MTs at the SPB of <italic>TUB4–AID</italic> cells were, however, associated with Spc97 and Spc98 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7c</xref>). The residual Tub4 in these cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1b</xref>) was probably sufficient to assemble γ-TuSC, which then became concentrated in the nucleus by the nuclear localization signal in Spc98 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Pereira et al., 1998</xref>).</p><p>It was important to exclude the possibility that detached cMTs of <italic>TUB4–AID</italic> cells nucleate first at the SPB and then detach from this localization.

Frequently, this was the end in the schmoo tip region. The other detached cMTs (49%) were decorated with Stu2–mCherry. This evidence raises the possibility of a function of Stu2 in the assembly of cMTs when Tub4 levels are low.</p><p>We then asked whether Stu2 is also important for cMT nucleation in cooperation with γ-TuSC. To test this notion, we analysed the impact of Stu2–AID depletion on the nucleation of cMTs in <italic>TUB4</italic> cells using the assay described in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7a</xref>. IAA depleted the Stu2–AID protein below the critical threshold that is needed for viability (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1a and b</xref>). Stu2 depletion dramatically impaired the formation of cMTs without affecting the assembly of nuclear MTs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7b</xref>). This phenotype was complemented by an integrated WT <italic>STU2</italic> construct (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7e</xref>). Thus, Stu2 is important for cMT nucleation in vivo in the presence of γ-TuSC.</p><p>Finally, we tested the role of Stu2 domains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2a</xref>) on cMT assembly in vivo. STU2 WT and mutant versions were expressed in <italic>STU2–AID</italic> cells. Upon Stu2–AID depletion, <italic>stu2<sup>TOGAA</sup></italic> was expressed as WT <italic>STU2</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1c</xref>). The expression of <italic>stu2<sup>∆MT</sup></italic> and <italic>stu2<sup>∆C</sup></italic> was, in fact, slightly higher than that of WT <italic>STU2. stu2<sup>∆CC</sup></italic> showed lower expression levels compared to <italic>STU2. STU2–AID STU2</italic> cells nucleated SPB-associated cMTs after nocodazole wash out (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7e</xref>) as efficiently as WT <italic>STU2</italic> cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7b</xref>, WT). These cMTs were ~1.8 µm long and connected the SPB with the schmoo tip (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7e and f</xref>). By contrast, most <italic>stu2<sup>TOGAA</sup></italic> and <italic>stu2<sup>∆CC</sup></italic> cells were impaired in cMT formation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7e</xref>). Only about 20% of <italic>stu2<sup>TOGAA</sup></italic> and <italic>stu2<sup>∆CC</sup></italic> cells re-assembled cMTs, which were shorter and much less robust than cMTs in <italic>STU2–AID STU2</italic> cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7e and f</xref>). About half of the <italic>stu2<sup>∆MT</sup></italic> and <italic>stu2<sup>∆C</sup></italic> cells assembled cMTs that were shorter than those of <italic>STU2</italic> WT cells. The other half of <italic>stu2<sup>∆MT</sup></italic> and <italic>stu2<sup>∆C</sup></italic> cells was devoid of cMTs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7e</xref>, quantification). Whenever <italic>STU2</italic> mutant cells assembled cMTs, these were associated with the SPB (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7e</xref>, top). Thus, the TOG domains and the dimerizing coiled-coil domain of Stu2 were most important for cMT formation in the presence of γ-TuSC. Stu2<sup>MT</sup> had an important impact on cMT formation.</p><p>Taken together, our experiments indicate two in vivo functions for Stu2. (1) Stu2 is important for stabilization of the γ-TuSC oligomer at the minus end of detached cMTs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). (2) Stu2 is crucial for the nucleation of cMTs independently of the presence of γ-TuSC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>The functions of TOG domain proteins at the MT minus end could be structural or enzymatic, of general importance or context-specific. The ability to measure the binding affinities and MT nucleation activity of purified Spc72, Stu2 and γ-TuSC in vitro, in combination with the analysis of the function of these proteins in vivo, has now shed light on the role of Stu2 and its cooperation with the γ-TuSC during cMT nucleation.</p><p>Here, we show that the purified Spc72N–Stu2 complex assembles MTs from α/β-tubulin subunits in the form of asters in the absence of γ-TuSC. This aster-forming activity was strongly dependent on the MT-binding region in Stu2. Mutations in the two TOG domains did not affect MT aster numbers or MT density in the asters, while overall MT nucleation activity was only slightly reduced by these mutations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3b,f</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4b</xref>). γ-tubulin-independent MT nucleation reactions that involve TOG-domain proteins have been observed before (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Roostalu et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Woodruff et al., 2017</xref>). We propose that a Stu2 scaffold that is organized by Spc72N stabilizes a first α/β-tubulin seed through its MT-binding site, in accordance with the strict requirement for this domain in Spc72N–Stu2-dependent MT nucleation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3b</xref>). Dimerization of Stu2 is probably important for this nucleation reaction as the Spc72N–Stu2<sup>∆CC</sup> complex lacked MT nucleation activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>).</p><p>γ-TuSC-independent MT nucleation by Stu2 from unattached kinetochores has been reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Gandhi et al., 2011</xref>). Our data now suggest that nucleation of cMTs in the cytoplasm away from the SPB in Tub4-depleted cells is critically dependent on Stu2. These cMTs lacked Spc72, Spc97 and Spc98 but were associated with Stu2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). The absence of Spc72 suggests that another scaffold assembles Stu2 into a MT nucleation competent state for the ectopic cMT nucleation reaction. In WT cells, γ-tubulin-independent cMT nucleation events away from the SPB were rare, so we have to assume that the Spc72–γ-TuSC system at the SPB is dominant over the Stu2-driven ectopic cMT nucleation. This ensures that cMTs are anchored to the SPB with a defined polar orientation. Such an orientation is essential for the function of cMTs in nuclear positioning and for orientation of the mitotic spindle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Hwang et al., 2003</xref>).</p><p>Our in vitro data indicate that Stu2 binds to γ-TuSC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2d</xref>) via its MT-binding site (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Wang and Huffaker, 1997</xref>). This is in line with the recent observation that human γ-tubulin binds to the MT-binding site of XMAP215 in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Thawani et al., 2018</xref>). We suggest that the interaction of the C-terminus of Stu2 with Spc72 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Usui et al., 2003</xref>), the binding of Stu2<sup>MT</sup> to γ-tubulin and the binding of the CM1 of Spc72 to Spc97/Spc98 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Knop and Schiebel, 1997</xref>) jointly promote the high-affinity interaction of Spc72–Stu2 and γ-TuSC that we have observed in MST measurements. We propose that Stu2 functions structurally as a clamp that joins Spc72 together with γ-TuSC.</p><p>Spc72N–Stu2 assembles the γ-TuSC into circular oligomers. Spc72N–Stu2<sup>TOGAA</sup> showed γ-TuSC oligomerization activity comparable to that of Spc72N–Stu2<sup>WT</sup>, suggesting that the MT polymerization activity of Stu2 is not required for γ-TuSC oligomerization. The addition of γ-TuSC increased the in vitro MT nucleation activity of Spc72N–Stu2 by a factor of about 3. This increase is explained by the ability of the γ-tubulin ring to sustain less favoured lateral interactions of α/β-tubulin subunits. The two TOG domains in Stu2 probably promote the recruitment of the first α/β-tubulin subunits to the γ-TuSC template. As the orientation of Stu2 in such a complex is predetermined by the interaction of its C-terminus with the N-terminally located binding site in Spc72 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Usui et al., 2003</xref>), each TOG domain orients the α-tubulin subunit of tubulin towards a γ-tubulin molecule in the γ-TuSC oligomer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Ayaz et al., 2012</xref>). Structural studies are needed to reveal the precise mechanism of the Spc72–Stu2–γ-TuSC cMT assembly machinery.</p><p>The in vivo situation is even more complex because at least two proteins, Spc72 and Kar9, recruit Stu2 to the minus end of cMTs. The recruitment role of Kar9 is consistent with the reported interactions of Kar9 with Stu2 and γ-tubulin Tub4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chen et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cuschieri et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Moore and Miller, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Usui et al., 2003</xref>) (illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>). Stu2 probably binds to Kar9 in the Tub4–Kar9 complex via its C-terminal 33 aa of Stu2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Moore and Miller, 2007</xref>).</p><fig id="fig8" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.39932.017</object-id><label>Figure 8.</label><caption><title>Model of Stu2-assisted cMT nucleation.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) Right: initiation of cMTs assembly through stabilisation of the Spc72–γ-TuSC interaction and the oriented recruitment of the first α/β-tubulin molecules.

Our data suggest that cMTs with a detached γ-TuSC cap disassemble, probably because factors that protect the MT minus end in the absence of the γ-tubulin cap in higher eukaryotes, such as the protein CAMSAP2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Jiang et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Wiese and Zheng, 2000</xref>), are not encoded by the yeast genome.</p><p>The TOG domains in the Kar9–Stu2 layer are most probably positioned more distantly away from the cMT minus end than those within Spc72–Stu2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>). The two Stu2 layers likely function in a sequential order: Spc72–Stu2 functions to add the first α/β-tubulin subunits and then Kar9–Stu2adds the next α/β-tubulin molecules (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>). A single XMAP215 molecule that is bound via its MT-binding site to γ-tubulin has, with five TOG domains, a greater reach to add α/β-tubulin subunits to the growing MT than a single Stu2 layer with only two TOG domains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Widlund et al., 2011</xref>). Binding of Stu2 to Spc72 and Kar9 probably compensates for the smaller number of TOG domains in Stu2.</p><p>The ratio of Spc72:Tub4:Spc97:Spc98 molecules at the cMT minus end is comparable to that of Spc110:Tub4:Spc97:Spc98 at the minus end of nuclear MTs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Erlemann et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Kollman et al., 2010</xref>). Green fluorescent protein (GFP) counting suggests that 70 to 90 Stu2 molecules are associated with the cMT minus end. Thus, the molar Stu2:Tub4 ratio is at least 5:1 at a cMT nucleation site (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Erlemann et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Kollman et al., 2010</xref>). By contrast, Stu2 does not bind to the nuclear Spc110 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Usui et al., 2003</xref>) and Stu2 depletion did not strongly impact the nucleation of nMTs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). Furthermore, Kar9 is a cytoplasmic protein without a nuclear function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Miller and Rose, 1998</xref>). Whether Stu2 binds directly to a nuclear γ-TuSC ring via its MT-binding site remains to be analysed. In any case, the much higher affinity of Spc110 for γ-TuSC makes a clamp-like function of Stu2 unnecessary. Thus, the functions of Stu2 at MT nucleation sites are at least in part context-specific.</p><p>In summary, γ-TuSC assembles into a functional cMT nucleation site with the assistance of the Spc72–Stu2 complex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>). The CM1 of Spc72 and the binding of Stu2 to Spc72 are important for this γ-TuSC oligomerization. After the oligomerization of Spc72–Stu2–γ-TuSC, the TOG domains in Stu2 probably assist in the oriented recruitment of the first α/β-tubulin subunits to the γ-TuSC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8a</xref>, right). A second α/β-tubulin recruitment phase is organized by the Kar9–Stu2 interface (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8a</xref>, left). This γ-TuSC-dependent cMT nucleation system at the SPB is dominant over an alternative cMT assembly pathway that we observed upon Tub4 depletion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8b</xref>). The nucleation of nMT by Spc110 and γ-TuSC is not Stu2-dependent, or is Stu2-dependent to a lesser degree, suggesting that the role of Stu2 in MT nucleation is context-specific.</p><p>TOG domain proteins function in MT nucleation in a number of organisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chen et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Flor-Parra et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Thawani et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Usui et al., 2003</xref>).

Cells were lysed with the Polytron, 0.25% Brij35 was added for 10 min and the lysate was centrifuged as mentioned in Stu2 purification. The GST–Spc72N beads were washed five times with HB200 and the 6His–Stu2 lysate was added after dilution with HB200 containing 0.125% Brij35. After incubation overnight at 4°C, the beads were washed five times with HB200 containing 0.125% Brij35 and proteins were eluted with 50 mM L-glutathione in HB200 with 0.125% Brij35. The elutions were loaded on an ÄKTA system (GE Healthcare) with an HiLoad 16/60 Superdex 200 column (GE Healthcare), which was equilibrated with HB200 at 4°C. Gel filtration fractions were analysed by SDS-PAGE and those containing GST–Spc72N and 6His–Stu2 were pooled. The purified complexes were stored at −80°C with 0.125% Brij and 5% glycerol.</p></sec><sec id="s4-11"><title>Purification of Spc110N</title><p>Purification of the N-terminal version of Spc110N (GST–Spc110N<sup>1-220</sup>) and its mutant version Spc110N<sup>CM1</sup> (GST–Spc110<sup>1-220-QA</sup>) were performed as described by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Lin et al.

An assay volume of 50 μl was added just underneath the liquid cushion and spun at 25,530 g, at 4°C for 1 hr in a HB6 rotor. Coverslips were fixed with ice-cold methanol and washed twice with cold PBS. Drops of Citifluor fixed the coverslips on objective slides, which were finally sealed with nail polish. Twenty images were acquired for the asters with a 63x objective and for the MTs with a 100x objective on a Zeiss Axiovert 200M equipped with a Cascade 1 k EMCCD camera (Cascade Photometrics, Roper Scientific, Inc.) and with a 63 × 1.4 NA Plan Apochromat oil objective (Zeiss) and a 100 × 1.46 NA Plan Apochromat oil objective (Zeiss), a HBO100 lamp and a Ludl MAC 5000 (Ludl Electronic Products Ltd.) with FWSHCDC controlling a DIC/488/555/647 filter wheel. The system was managed with the software VisiView (Version 2.1.4, Visitron Systems GmbH). Analysis was performed with ImageJ and the aster number was corrected by the mean number of nucleated MTs in 20 fields of the tubulin-only control taken with a 100x objective. The MT formation activity was derived by a measurement of the mean intensity of the maximum projection of 20 acquired images. The tubulin-only control intensity was subtracted from other values to correct for the background.</p></sec><sec id="s4-16"><title>In vitro reconstitution of γ-TuSC–Spc72N and γ-TuSC–Spc72N–Stu2 oligomers</title><p>Purified γ-TuSC was mixed with GST–Spc72N<sup>CM1</sup> or GST–Spc110N complex in 1:4 molar ratio (4.6 µM:18.6 µM) in HB100-50 buffer (50 mM Hepes, pH7.5, 100 mM KCl, 1 mM EGTA, 1 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>) with salt as indicated in the figure legends.

Each titration curve consisted of 16 points prepared from a serial dilution of analytes and a constant concentration of the fluorescein-labelled ligand. Purified γ-TuSC and Stu2 were fluorescently labelled with GREEN-NHS (NanoTemper, Munich, Germany). To measure the affinity between γ-TuSC and its binding partners, 2X serial diluted recombinant Spc110N, Spc72N, Stu2 or Spc72N-Stu2 complexes were titrated against 50 nM of labelled γ-TuSC. To measure the binding affinity between Stu2 and Spc72N, increasing concentrations of recombinant Spc72N were titrated against 150 nM of labelled Stu2. Experiments were carried out in HB100-50 buffer supplemented with 0.05% (w/v) Tween-20. The samples were loaded into standard glass capillaries (Monolith NT capillaries, NanoTemper, Munich, Germany). MST assays were performed with 60% and 80% LED power using a green filter and 40%, 60% and 80% MST power. The normalized fluorescence readings (Thermophoresis + T jump or T-jump only) were plotted as a function of analyte concentration and the curve fitting and dissociation constant K<sub>d</sub> calculation were performed with Nanotemper software. In all cases, MST data were fitted on the based of a single-site model.</p></sec><sec id="s4-18"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>Statistical analysis of the data was carried out with GraphPad Prism and performed as two-tailed unpaired t-tests with a confidence interval of 95%. For MST measurements, the statistical analysis was done in Excel. The number of repeated experiments is indicated in the figure legend together with the sample size and the P-values. In the MST measurements, when the data points of a single concentration value were deviated from normal intensity range, they were considered as outliers and excluded from the analysis. Otherwise no data points were excluded. Experiments are technical replicates if not stated differently. The experiments were not randomized and the investigators were not blinded to allocation during the experiments and outcome assessment.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>The authors thank Dr. M Mayer (ZMBH) for the use of the MST equipment.

Together, this led them to a decision that this paper should be rejected.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic> </p><p>Gunzelmann et al., present a study on Stu2, a member of the TOG domain-containing microtubule (MT) polymerase family. Stu2 is well characterized as acting at MT plus ends. In this work the authors explore the role of Stu2 at the centrosome/ yeast spindle pole body (SPB), where Stu2 localizes in yeast cells. On the nuclear side of the nuclear membrane Spc110 serves as the Ɣ-TuSC receptor, while on the cytoplasmic face Spc72 is the Ɣ-TuSC receptor. This work presents the novel finding that Stu2 facilitates Spc72 binding to Ɣ-TuSC and possibly promotes Ɣ-TuSC oligomerization in vitro. The authors then look at Stu2 localization in vivo using mutants with detached MT minus ends. They find that Stu2 localizes to MT minus ends in the absence of the Stu2 binding site in Spc72 and that Kar9 plays a role in this recruitment. The authors then present additional in vitro experiments to look at microtubule aster formation. They suggest that Stu2 can promote MT aster formation in the absence of functional TOG domains in the presence of Spc72.</p><p>While this work contains several interesting observations, many experiments are lacking important controls to support the conclusions made. In addition, in its current form I do not see that it dramatically advances our understanding of TOG domain-containing proteins nor is it of sufficient quality for <italic>eLife</italic>. I recommend that the authors revise their work based on the following comments to submit elsewhere.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Does Stu2 directly interact with Ɣ-TuSC? This should be addressed.</p><p>2) The gel filtration experiment in Figure 2D is missing standards and the void volume is not labeled. How many times was this experiment repeated? This should be listed in the legend. What concentrations of proteins were used?</p><p>3) Ɣ-TuSC oligomerization appears to be enhanced in the presence of Spc72N-Stu2TOGAA (defective in tubulin binding). This experiment should also be done with Spc72 and wildtype Stu2.</p><p>3) The authors should quantify Stu2 fluorescence at the cMT minus end in the spc72Δstu2/Kar9-depletion conditions. Is Stu2 completely absent or are factors beyond Spc72/Kar9 also recruiting Stu2 to the minus end?</p><p>4) As the authors currently present it, the mechanism of Stu2-dependent MT assembly is unclear. The experiments in Figures 6 and 7 are difficult to interpret because controls are lacking. For example, the Stu2 mutants alone were not analyzed in Figure 6. Is there any affect of Stu2 or the Stu2 mutants in the presence of Ɣ-TuSC, but in the absence of Spc72 (Figure 7)?</p><p>5) The concentrations of tubulin, and all other proteins used in Figures 6 and 7 are not listed in the methods or legends. This is critical to include. Also, were different concentrations tested? How were the concentrations that were used chosen?</p><p>6) It is unclear what distinct roles the authors propose for the MT-binding and TOG-binding domains of Stu2 to have in enhanced MT nucleation at the centrosome/ SPB. Are cells with Stu2 MT-binding and TOGAA mutations viable?</p><p>7) The authors reference two &quot;nucleation activities&quot; of Stu2, but then posit that the TOG domains may be required for extending Ɣ-TuSC-nucleated seeds. This seems contradictory.</p><p>8) The manuscript could benefit greatly from additional editing for clarity and conciseness. There are many grammatical errors as well. The Figure Legends need to be improved for clarity and completeness.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic> </p><p>This is a review of the article titled &quot;TOG domain independent microtubule nucleation activity of Stu2 protein at centrosomes&quot; by Gunzelmann et al., submitted to <italic>eLife</italic>. The Dis1/Stu2/XMAP215 family of microtubule polymerases are complex, multi-domain proteins that play roles at microtubule plus ends as well as at microtubule organizing centers (MTOCs). While the family's conserved N-terminal tubulin-binding TOG domains play critical roles in microtubule polymerization, less is known about the C-terminal regions that engage MTOC components. Yeast members have significantly diverged from non-yeast members across their C-terminal region. In this manuscript, the authors focus on elucidating the role of Stu2 (the <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> XMAP215 member) on microtubule nucleation and stability at the spindle pole body (SPB), and how it uses specific determinants to engage other factors and drive microtubule formation/stabilization. The authors show that Stu2 potentiates the interaction between Spc72 and γ-TuSC and in turn promotes γ-TuSC oligomerization which serves to template and nucleate microtubules. While Spc72 recruits Stu2 to the microtubule minus end, the authors identify Kar9 as another factor capable of recruiting Stu2 to the microtubule minus end. The authors probe the role of the Spc72-Stu2 and Kar9-Stu2 interactions on spindle morphology and microtubule stability and length in vivo and find that both sets of interactions play key roles. The authors then analyze the in vitro effects of Spc72 and Stu2 on microtubule nucleation in vitro with and without addition of the γ-TuSC complex and map key regions within Stu2 that are required for microtubule nucleation. The manuscript adds to our understanding of Stu2 and its role in yeast mitosis using a nice blend of in vitro and in vivo analyses. In its current state it lacks some critical experiments that, if present, would best unite disparate pieces in the paper, and help the authors arrive at some of their conclusions.</p><p>1) Gel filtration is used to determine whether Spc72 (plus or minus Stu2) causes oligomerization of γ-TuSC, as does Spc110. The results show that Spc72 does shift γ-TuSC to the void volume, and that Stu2 enhances this shift. However, Stu2 also causes a new peak to arise at fraction A11 that could be accounted for by Stu2-mediated dimerization of a γ-TuSC-Spc72 complex. This then calls into question the increase of the γ-TuSC fraction in the void volume: is this really oligomerization as seen with Spc110 which generated γ-TuSC filaments, or is it due to cross-linking mediated by dimers of Spc72 and dimers of Stu2? To resolve this, the authors should determine if the Spc72-Stu2 complex does drive γ-TuSC oligomerization – this could be achieved using negative stain EM analysis, similar to work done by Kollman et al., 2010, DIC microscopy, or fluorescence microscopy.</p><p>2) Figure 7, the authors should conduct a Stu2 WT +/- γ-TuSC control to best determine how much Spc72-Stu2 augments the MT nucleation activity in vitro.</p><p>3) The authors delineated independent roles for Spc72 and Kar9 on Stu2 recruitment to the MT minus end, analyzed the effects of these respective complexes on cMT nucleation, number, and length in cells. However, when the authors then move to in vitro analyses, they concentrated exclusively on the Spc72-Stu2 interaction (plus and minus γ-TuSC) and its effects on microtubule nucleation in vitro. To be comprehensive, it would greatly strengthen the paper to conduct a comparative analysis of the effects of Kar9 and Kar9-Stu2 (plus and minus γ-TuSC) on MT nucleation in vitro with that of Spc72-Stu2.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic> </p><p>Review of Gunzelmann et al., TOG domain independent microtubule nucleation activity….</p><p>This paper describes a novel nucleation activity within the spindle pole component, Spc72 that recruits Stu2 (TOG domain protein) to the cytoplasmic face of the spindle pole body, where it increases MT density and plays a role in nucleating MT asters.</p><p>The binding data in Figure 1 and Figure 2 was very convincing. The data in Figure 3 were problematic. Firstly, they state that incubation in a kar1 mutant results in detached cMTS (Pereira et al., 1993; Erlemann, 2012). I looked at both of these papers and was unable to find the percent of detached vs attached cytoplasmic microtubules in the mutant. It is important to quantitate what fraction of the microtubules are detached to differentiate pole binding from minus-end binding. An alternative interpretation for Figure 3c is that observation of Stu2 in the absence of the stu2 binding site in Spc72 is that these microtubules are not detached from the pole.</p><p>The FRAP recovery are nicely done and convincing that there are multiple binding sites. It is interesting that in this and panel b the mt minus ends seem to be in the shmoo tip. Since there are known plus-end binding complexes in the shmoo tip, is there concern that the co-localization reflects the juxtaposition of the minus-end to the shmoo tip. This is easily addressed by quantitating the fraction of spc72 or stu2 spots in the tip vs. the presence or absence of mt minus ends.</p><p>Figure 4D is a critical panel for interpretation of aforementioned experiments. It is stated that a-g are kar1Δ15. Approximately 50% of the cMT are attached in these mutants. Thus, the reviewer needs to redraw Figure 3a to reflect the fact that 50% are detached and 50% are released. In addition, the reviewer needs to include the attachment/detachment state of the microtubules for the co-localization. Are they only examining detached microtubules, if so, what is the metric for the data in Figure 3? The metric in Figure 4 is clear, mCherry-Tub1, but if 50% are attached, the data without Tub1 become significantly ambiguous.</p><p>In summary, this paper documents an important second TOG-independent mechanism in Stu2 for MT formation. Stu2 has critical roles in spindle orientation and kinetochore function, and thus this second site is important to understand. The authors should ensure that for all reports of minus-end binding, that these are indeed detached cytoplasmic microtubules.</p><p>[Editors’ note: what now follows is the decision letter after the authors submitted for further consideration.]</p><p>Thank you for resubmitting your work entitled &quot;The TOG domain protein Stu2 promotes γ-TuSC oligomerization in cytoplasmic microtubule nucleation&quot; for further consideration at <italic>eLife</italic>. Your revised article has been favorably evaluated by Anna Akhmanova (Senior Editor), a Reviewing Editor, and three reviewers. The manuscript has been improved but there are some remaining issues that need to be addressed before acceptance, as outlined below.</p><p>Gunzelmann et al., present a study on Stu2, a member of the TOG domain-containing microtubule (MT) polymerase family. Stu2 is well characterized as acting at MT plus ends. Here the authors explore the role of Stu2 at MT minus ends and its interactions with Ɣ-TuSC. On the nuclear side of the nuclear membrane Spc110 serves as the Ɣ-TuSC receptor, while on the cytoplasmic face Spc72 is the Ɣ-TuSC receptor. Using a combination of in vitro characterization and in vivo work the experiments presented here strongly suggests a role for Stu2 in both the stabilization of the Ɣ-TuSC-Spc72 interaction as well as in assembling detached MTs in the cytoplasm. The study expands our understanding of MT nucleation in yeast. It adds to the field in a unique way and complements the recently published XMAP215/γ-tubulin work from the Petry lab.</p><p>However, before the paper can be published, we would like to ask you to address some remaining issues which concern data analysis, paper organization and writing.</p><p>Data analysis and interpretation:</p><p>1) The authors state that the aster density is lower in Spc72N-Stu2TOGAAA asters than in Spc72N-Stu2 asters. However, the quantification used to determine aster density is 'MT formation activity', or the mean intensity fluorescence of the entire field. That type of measurement encompasses the entirety of MT assembly. Therefore, a better quantification of aster density is required.</p><p>Also, it appears that the example images shown in Figure 3E are saturated, making aster density difficult to assess.</p><p>2) Is there a suspected reason for the increase in Stu2 fluorescence in spc72Stu2Δ versus Spc72 WT cells (Figure 5E)? If you remove the CM1 region of Spc72 in yeast, is there a decrease in Stu2 fluorescence at the cMT minus end?</p><p>3) The authors state that the Stu2 signal in spc72Stu2Δ KAR9-AID +IAA cells is similar to spc72Stu2Δ. The value stated (~0.9) is actually even more similar to the Stu2 fluorescence in Spc72 WT cells (Figure 5E). This quantification, even if it is for a small number of cMTs, should be shown in the figure.</p><p>Additionally, it is suggested that the KAR9-AID was not fully degraded under these conditions, and that is why Stu2 is still recruited to the cMT minus end. However, a complete knockdown of KAR9-AID in another yeast strain (Figure 6—figure supplement 1C) is shown. The authors should demonstrate the extent of KAR9-AID degradation in spc72Stu2Δ KAR9-AID +IAA cells. Alternatively, the authors should fluorescently tag the KAR9-AID protein to determine if the few numbers of cMTs that still maintain Stu2 also have Kar9 at the cMT minus ends. A possible interpretation is that there may be an additional factor recruiting Stu2 to cMT minus ends.</p><p>4) Comments on the FRAP analysis: The authors claim that there are two pools, a stable and unstable fraction of Stu2 at the minus-ends of microtubules. There is concern that there is a limited pool of soluble Stu2, and the recovery curves (Figure 5F) potentially misleading. The lack of recovery in one sample could be due to limited protein pool (so there is not enough unlabeled protein around to populate the FRAP zone. The authors could report the average fluorescence intensity of the spots (in arbitrary units) to examine whether spots of the same fluorescence are being targeted in each sample.</p><p>Improving the organization and writing of the paper:</p><p>1) The authors have a lot of interesting data, but because of the complex nature of Stu2's multiple roles as well as the complexity of some of the experiments, a lot of the intricacies are lost upon first reading. It would be specifically helpful to have a section in the introduction that clearly outlines each putative role and interaction of Stu2 that will be tested, and the general strategy used to test each of these roles/interactions.</p><p>2) Before each set of experiments, the authors should clearly explain why they are performing the experiment and what they expect to occur (a hypothesis/model). In many areas this information is lacking or vague. For example, subsection “Stu2 stabilizes γ-tubulin at cMT ends” &quot;To further elevate the role of Stu2 at the cMT minus end…&quot;. It's unclear what the authors mean by that and it is difficult to follow their line of logic. As much as possible, the authors should reference back to their original models so that the reader can more easily follow.</p><p>3) It appears that the authors fit their MST data to a single-site model, but this should be clearly stated in the Materials and methods section.</p><p>4) The grammar, primarily in the Introduction, needs some additional work.</p><p>5) The authors frequently use the uncommon term: &quot;in dependence of&quot; referring to an effect that is &quot;dependent&quot;. Given the wide international readership of <italic>eLife</italic>, we suggest that this phrase be rewritten in a more active form so that people, who do not speak English as a first language, do not confuse the statement with &quot;independent of..&quot;</p><p>6) Subsection “Purified Stu2 in complex with Spc72 assembles MT aster” fifth paragraph is confusing and should be rewritten.</p><p>7) Discussion section, ninth paragraph, the authors probably mean &quot;ratios&quot; rather than &quot;rations&quot;.</p><p>8) Figure 7—figure supplement 1D and E are important and should probably be included in a main figure.</p><p>9) Figure 8 needs a figure legend and the objects within the figure need to be clearly labeled.</p><p>10) Figure 7A, B need labels indicating what is fluorescently tagged.</p><p>11) Several times protein constructs or yeast strain acronyms aren't described upon first mention. Upon the first introduction of a new protein construct that is given an abbreviation, a description and the amino acid modifications (if applicable) should be stated.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.39932.023</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p>[Editors’ note: the author responses to the first round of peer review follow.]</p><p>We would like to thank the three reviewers for their helpful and constructive comments.

I recommend that the authors revise their work based on the following comments to submit elsewhere.</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewer acknowledges that the work contains interesting observations. However, he/she also points out that controls are missing. We followed the suggestion of reviewer 1 and have revised our manuscript addressing the points raised by this reviewer. We also included new data (e.g. new Figure 7) to increase the impact of our manuscript.</p><p>This manuscript for the first time compares in vitro and in vivo activities of TOG domain proteins with and without Ɣ-tubulin complexes. Our manuscript shows that Stu2 has a structural role in the oligomerization of Ɣ-TuSC and the attachment of Ɣ-TuSC to the MT minus end. It explains why proteins such as Spc72 with an imperfect CM1 can function in the oligomerization of Ɣ-TuSC and how Stu2 bound to Spc72 facilitates MT nucleation. In addition, we provide evidences that the MT binding site in Stu2 interacts with the Ɣ-TuSC. This probably promotes the assembly of the Spc72-Ɣ-TuSC-Stu2 complex on the cytoplasmic side of the SPB. We further show that the Ɣ-tubulin Tub4 is mainly important to restrict cMT nucleation to the SPB but not for cMT nucleation per se. In contrast, Stu2 is essential for Tub4-dependent and independent cMT nucleation. Taken this together, our manuscript will have a significant impact on the MT nucleation field in general.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Does Stu2 directly interact with Ɣ-TuSC? This should be addressed.</p></disp-quote><p>We have addresses this point by MST measurements (Figure 2D) and in vitro binding experiments with Stu2<sup>TOG</sup> and Stu2<sup>MT</sup> (Figure 2—figure supplement 1E and F and Figure 2—figure supplement 2F). Indeed, Ɣ-TuSC binds to Stu2 via Stu2<sup>MT</sup>. These data are consistent with the recent publication by Petry and co-workers in Nat Cell Biol indicating that human Ɣ-tubulin interacts with the MT binding site of XMAP215 in gel filtration experiments.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) The gel filtration experiment in Figure 2D is missing standards and the void volume is not labeled. How many times was this experiment repeated? This should be listed in the legend. What concentrations of proteins were used?</p></disp-quote><p>We have added the size markers to Figure 2D (now Figure 2E) (and Dextan blue to other runs to indicate the void). Dextran blue marks the void volume. As outlined in the figure legend to Figure 2D, we show one representative experiment of three independent experiments. All of them showed a much higher oligomerization activity for Ɣ-TuSC + Spc72N-Stu2 comapred to Ɣ-TuSC + Spc72N or only Ɣ-TuSC. The concentration of proteins is described in Materials and methods section: “For Figure 2E and Figure 2—figure supplement 2D, purified γ-TuSC was mixed with GST-Spc72N, GST-Spc72N-6His-Stu2<sup>WT</sup> or GST-Spc72N-6HisStu2<sup>TOGAA</sup> to a final concentration of 4.6 µM for γ-TuSC and 2.3 µM for the other proteins in HB100 buffer with 10% glycerol.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Ɣ-TuSC oligomerization appears to be enhanced in the presence of Spc72N-Stu2TOGAA (defective in tubulin binding). This experiment should also be done with Spc72 and wildtype Stu2.</p></disp-quote><p>We now have performed this experiment with WT Stu2 (Figure 2E; 3 independent experiments) as requested by reviewer 1. The Stu2<sup>TOGAA</sup> experiment is shown in Figure 2—figure supplement 2D. In all three experiments Stu2<sup>TOGAA</sup> behaved as Stu2.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) The authors should quantify Stu2 fluorescence at the cMT minus end in the spc72Δstu2/Kar9-depletion conditions. Is Stu2 completely absent or are factors beyond Spc72/Kar9 also recruiting Stu2 to the minus end?</p></disp-quote><p>We have addressed this point in subsection “Stu2 stabilizes γ-tubulin at cMT ends”:</p><p>“Depletion of Kar9 in <italic>spc72<sup>∆Stu2</sup></italic>cells should further decrease Stu2-yeGFP intensity at the minus end of detached cMTs. However, as outlined below, these measurements were complicated by the instability of cMTs in <italic>spc72<sup>∆Stu2</sup> KAR9-AID kar1∆15</italic> cells and the observation that of the surviving detached cMTs only half carried Tub4 (Figure 6F and G). The normalized Stu2-yeGFP signal intensity at these rare Tub4-positive cMT minus ends was measured with ~0.9, which is similar to what we determined in <italic>spc72<sup>∆Stu2</sup></italic>cells but clearly higher than the signal in <italic>KAR9-AID</italic> cells (Figure 6B). This suggests that Kar9-AID was not fully degraded in these <italic>spc72<sup>∆Stu2</sup> KAR9-AID</italic> cells with detached cMTs. Indeed, variations in the efficiency of the auxin-induced degradation of proteins between yeast cells have been reported (Papagiannakis, de Jonge et al., 2017). “</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) As the authors currently present it, the mechanism of Stu2-dependent MT assembly is unclear. The experiments in Figures 6 and 7 are difficult to interpret because controls are lacking. For example, the Stu2 mutants alone were not analyzed in Figure 6. Is there any affect of Stu2 or the Stu2 mutants in the presence of Ɣ-TuSC, but in the absence of Spc72 (Figure 7)?</p></disp-quote><p>We have now analysed the Stu2 mutants alone (Figure 3—figure supplement 1). In addition, besides aster formation ability, we have quantified MT formation ability as was done by Roostalu and Surrey in Nat Cell Biol. In response to reviewer 1’s suggestion, we also combined Ɣ-TuSC with Stu2 (Figure 3—figure supplement 1A-CFigure; Ɣ-TuSC+Stu2). In this combination, we see the activity of Stu2. Moreover, we show that Stu2 has to be in the preformed Spc72N-Stu2 complex since addition of individual Spc72N and Stu2 into the reaction mix (which dilutes the proteins and disfavours complex formation) did not show the activity of the Spc72N-Stu2 complex.</p><p>Thus, we hope that the data clarify the mechanisms of Stu2 in cMT nucleation. We intensively discuss the function of Stu2 in cMT in the Discussion section.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) The concentrations of tubulin, and all other proteins used in Figures 6 and 7 are not listed in the methods or legends. This is critical to include. Also, were different concentrations tested? How were the concentrations that were used chosen?</p></disp-quote><p>The concentration of tubulin was described in the Materials and methods section (not the legends – I am sorry for this). The final concentration was 12 µM. This concentration was chosen because the Spc110-Ɣ-TuSC rings are able to nucleate MTs at this tubulin concentration. Our tubulin concentration is similar to what Roostalu and Surrey have used in NatCell Biol.</p><p>To clarify this point, we write in subsection “Purified Stu2 in complex with Spc72 assembles MT asters”:</p><p>“The α/β-tubulin concentration of 12 µM was chosen because it enables the oligomerized Spc110N-γ-TuSC to nucleate microtubules (Kollman et al., 2010, Lin et al., 2014). A similar α/β-tubulin concentration has been used in MT nucleation assays with purified TPX2 and chTOG (Roostalu et al., 2015). Assembled MTs were spun onto cover slips and analysed by fluorescence microscopy. “</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) It is unclear what distinct roles the authors propose for the MT-binding and TOG-binding domains of Stu2 to have in enhanced MT nucleation at the centrosome/ SPB. Are cells with Stu2 MT-binding and TOGAA mutations viable?</p></disp-quote><p>This is a good point and we should have added this already in the first submission. Now we show in Figure 3—figure supplement 3F the growth test of the different <italic>STU2</italic> mutants. Moreover, we have heavily modified the Discussion section addressing the role of the TOG domains in Stu2. I agree that the title of the first manuscript version was misleading. TOG domains of Stu2 have an important role in cMT nucleation as indicated by our experiments and outlined in the text.</p><p>For example, in the Discussion section we write:</p><p>“The TOG domains in the Kar9-Stu2 layer are most likely positioned more distantly away from the cMT minus end than those within Spc72-Stu2 (Figure 8). The two Stu2 layers probably function in a sequential order: Spc72-Stu2 for the addition of the first α/β-tubulin subunits followed by Kar9-Stu2 that adds the next α/β-tubulin molecules. A single XMAP215 molecule bound via its MT binding site to γ-tubulin has with five TOG domains a greater reach to add α/β-tubulin subunits to the growing MT than a single Stu2 layer with only two TOG domains (Widlund et al., 2011). Binding of Stu2 to Spc72 and Kar91 probably compensates for the smaller number of TOG domains in Stu2.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7) The authors reference two &quot;nucleation activities&quot; of Stu2, but then posit that the TOG domains may be required for extending Ɣ-TuSC-nucleated seeds. This seems contradictory.</p></disp-quote><p>As outlined above, we have modified the Discussion section and now better explain the role of Stu2 in MT nucleation.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>8) The manuscript could benefit greatly from additional editing for clarity and conciseness. There are many grammatical errors as well. The Figure Legends need to be improved for clarity and completeness.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you very much for this suggestion.

The results show that Spc72 does shift γ-TuSC to the void volume, and that Stu2 enhances this shift. However, Stu2 also causes a new peak to arise at fraction A11 that could be accounted for by Stu2-mediated dimerization of a γ-TuSC-Spc72 complex. This then calls into question the increase of the γ-TuSC fraction in the void volume: is this really oligomerization as seen with Spc110 which generated γ-TuSC filaments, or is it due to cross-linking mediated by dimers of Spc72 and dimers of Stu2? To resolve this, the authors should determine if the Spc72-Stu2 complex does drive γ-TuSC oligomerization – this could be achieved using negative stain EM analysis, similar to work done by Kollman et al., 2010, DIC microscopy, or fluorescence microscopy.</p></disp-quote><p>We have performed the negative staining EM as suggest by reviewer 2. These data are in Figure 2—figure supplement 2E. They clearly show that Spc72-Stu2 oligomerizes Spc72Stu2 into rings that are different in structure compared to the Spc72-Ɣ-TuSC rings. Additional high-resolution EM analysis is needed to understand the structural differences between the Spc72-Stu2-Ɣ-TuSC and Spc72-Ɣ-TuSC rings.

Adding Kar9 in addition to Stu2, Spc72 and γ-TuSC bears the challenge of purifying Kar9 (as Kar9 or Kar9-Bim1 complex – ?) in a native functional state and find buffer conditions that are compatible with all components. This was already challenging enough for the three-component system. I guess, reviewer 2 is suggesting this because we did not explain too well the function of the second Kar9-Stu2 layer in comparison to Spc72-Stu2. We have done this for the new submission in the Discussion section:</p><p>“The situation in cells is even more complex since two proteins, Spc72 and Kar9, recruit Stu2 to the minus end of cMTs. The recruitment role of Kar9 is consistent with the reported interactions of Kar9 with Stu2 and γ-tubulin Tub4 (Chen et al., 1998, Cuschieri et al., 2006, Moore and Miller, 2007, Usui et al., 2003) (illustrated in Figure 8).”</p><p>“The TOG domains in the Kar9-Stu2 layer are most likely positioned more distantly away from the cMT minus end than those within Spc72-Stu2 (Figure 8).

The data in Figure 3 were problematic. Firstly, they state that incubation in a kar1 mutant results in detached cMTS (Pereira et al., 1993; Erlemann, 2012). I looked at both of these papers and was unable to find the percent of detached vs attached cytoplasmic microtubules in the mutant. It is important to quantitate what fraction of the microtubules are detached to differentiate pole binding from minus-end binding. An alternative interpretation for Figure 3c is that observation of Stu2 in the absence of the stu2 binding site in Spc72 is that these microtubules are not detached from the pole.</p></disp-quote><p>40% of cMTs detach from the SPB in <italic>kar1∆15</italic> cells as outlined in Figure 5A.

Kar9 decorates in part the detached cMT. Figure 6—figure supplement 4B confirms Kar9-GFP at a detached cMT labelled with mCherry-Tub1. The quantification in Figure 6B was done in <italic>TUB4-mCherry STU2-GFP</italic> cells. The Tub4-mCherry signal gives the position of Stu2 at the cMT minus end.

As we have shown in Figure 1B this mutation is lethal. Instead, we tested the possibility that enhanced recruitment of Kar9 could be responsible for the increased recruitment of Stu2 in <italic>spc72<sup>Δstu2</sup></italic> mutant cells. Indeed, it turned out that there is a higher availability of Kar9 at the minus end of detached cMTs in <italic>Spc72<sup>Δstu2</sup></italic> cells compared to <italic>SPC72</italic> cells as it is now shown in the new Figure 6—figure supplement 1C.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) The authors state that the Stu2 signal in spc72Stu2Δ KAR9-AID +IAA cells is similar to spc72Stu2Δ. The value stated (~0.9) is actually even more similar to the Stu2 fluorescence in Spc72 WT cells (Figure 5E). This quantification, even if it is for a small number of cMTs, should be shown in the figure.</p></disp-quote><p>We now included the quantification as Figure 5E. However, as the number of quantified cells is so low we did not performed a statistic analysis.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Additionally, it is suggested that the KAR9-AID was not fully degraded under these conditions, and that is why Stu2 is still recruited to the cMT minus end. However, a complete knockdown of KAR9-AID in another yeast strain (Figure 6—figure supplement 1C) is shown. The authors should demonstrate the extent of KAR9-AID degradation in spc72Stu2Δ KAR9-AID +IAA cells. Alternatively, the authors should fluorescently tag the KAR9-AID protein to determine if the few numbers of cMTs that still maintain Stu2 also have Kar9 at the cMT minus ends. A possible interpretation is that there may be an additional factor recruiting Stu2 to cMT minus ends.</p></disp-quote><p>Depletion of a human centrosomal protein by siRNA appears very efficient based on an immunoblot analysis of cell extracts. However, in IF quite often a residual signal is observed at the centrosome. Γ-Tubulin siRNA is a good example for such behaviour. According to our analysis about 5% of cells carry some residual amount of Kar9-AID at the minus end of cMTs. We do not know how much Kar9 is needed for the recruitment of functional levels of Stu2. In any case, Kar9-AID levels are reduced by at least 95% compared to <italic>KAR9</italic> cells, probably even more. This reduction will be below the detection limit of the immunoblot. To address this point of the reviewers, we added in subsection “Stu2 stabilizes γ-tubulin at cMT ends” following sentence.</p><p>“This residual amount of Kar9-AID in the small number of <italic>spc72<sup>∆Stu2</sup> KAR9-AID</italic> cells with cMTs was, however, below the detection limit of the immunoblot in the new Figure 6—figure supplement 1D.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) Comments on the FRAP analysis: The authors claim that there are two pools, a stable and unstable fraction of Stu2 at the minus-ends of microtubules. There is concern that there is a limited pool of soluble Stu2, and the recovery curves (Figure 5F) potentially misleading. The lack of recovery in one sample could be due to limited protein pool (so there is not enough unlabeled protein around to populate the FRAP zone. The authors could report the average fluorescence intensity of the spots (in arbritrary units) to examine whether spots of the same fluorescence are being targeted in each sample.</p></disp-quote><p>To rule out the possibility that a limitation of freely available cytoplasmic Stu2-yeGFP is the reason for incomplete recovery, we quantified the fluorescence signal intensity of the examples shown in Figure 5F before bleaching. It should be noted, that the examples shown and that have been used for the analysis have a higher intensity in Stu2-yeGFP for <italic>Spc72<sup>Δstu2</sup></italic> compared to <italic>SPC72</italic> cells in the beginning of the experiment.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Improving the organization and writing of the paper:</p><p>1) The authors have a lot of interesting data, but because of the complex nature of Stu2's multiple roles as well as the complexity of some of the experiments, a lot of the intricacies are lost upon first reading. It would be specifically helpful to have a section in the introduction that clearly outlines each putative role and interaction of Stu2 that will be tested, and the general strategy used to test each of these roles/interactions.</p></disp-quote><p>We are grateful for the suggestion of the reviewer to improve the overall comprehensibility of the paper. We now included a section at the beginning of each result paragraph that refines the question that we wanted to address and the strategy how to test for possible roles/interactions.</p><p>In the Introduction we write: “However, there are still the following open questions: (1) Do TOG domain proteins have the ability to nucleate MTs in vivo independently of γ-tubulin complexes? (2) Do TOG domain proteins have structural functions at the MT minus end? (3) Is the role of TOG domain proteins in MT nucleation context specific (Roostalu and Surrey, 2017)?“</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Before each set of experiments, the authors should clearly explain why they are performing the experiment and what they expect to occur (a hypothesis/model). In many areas this information is lacking or vague. For example, subsection “Stu2 stabilizes γ-tubulin at cMT ends” &quot;To further elevate the role of Stu2 at the cMT minus end…&quot;. It's unclear what the authors mean by that and it is difficult to follow their line of logic. As much as possible, the authors should reference back to their original models so that the reader can more easily follow.</p></disp-quote><p>This goes in line with the first point and as suggested we tried to improve the understandability by rephrasing/rewriting the mentioned paragraph and the results section in general.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) It appears that the authors fit their MST data to a single-site model, but this should be clearly stated in the Materials and methods section.</p></disp-quote><p>Indeed, we used a single-site model for fitting our MST data and we now sate this in the Materials and methods section.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) The grammar, primarily in the Introduction, needs some additional work.</p></disp-quote><p>We tried to improve this point as suggested and modified the Introduction.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) The authors frequently use the uncommon term: &quot;in dependence of&quot; referring to an effect that is &quot;dependent&quot;.
