HSV-specific antibodies were detected in serum (titer 1:800,000) following immunization and in vaginal washes after intravaginal challenge. The antibodies elicited cell-mediated cytotoxicity, but little neutralizing activity. Passive transfer of immune serum completely protected wild-type, but not Fcγ-receptor or neonatal Fc-receptor knock-out mice. These studies demonstrate that non-neutralizing Fc-mediated humoral responses confer protection and support advancement of this attenuated vaccine.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.06054.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.06054.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.06054.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Herpes simplex virus 2 (or HSV-2) infects millions of people worldwide and is the leading cause of genital diseases. The virus initially infects skin cells, but then spreads to nerve cells where it persists for life. Often, the virus remains in a dormant state for long periods of time and does not cause any symptoms. However, HSV-2 can periodically re-activate, leading to repeated infections; this can be life-threatening in patients who suffer from a weak immune system. There is no cure for Herpes simplex virus infection, and there are currently no vaccines that would prevent the virus from infecting humans.</p><p>HSV-2 contains a protein on its surface known as ‘glycoprotein D’ which it needs to enter host cells. The interaction between glycoprotein D and the host is also essential for cell-to-cell spread of the virus. Vaccines that contain glycoprotein D trigger the production of antibodies that bind to this viral protein. These vaccines have been tested in several large clinical trials, but the results have so far been disappointing. As such, new vaccines that provide effective protection against HSV-2 are urgently needed.</p><p>Live attenuated vaccines are commonly used to prevent diseases such as measles mumps and chicken pox or shingles. These vaccines contain a harmless or weakened version of the disease-causing virus. Petro, González et al. have now developed a new potential vaccine that contains live attenuated HSV-2, which completely lacks glycoprotein D and thus cannot spread from cell-to-cell. When this weakened virus was administered to mice that have a poor immune system, the mice remained healthy. On the other hand, when Petro, González et al. treated similar mice with the wild-type HSV-2 virus instead, many mice died within a few days.</p><p>Petro, González et al. then went on to show that mice that had been treated with the weakened virus as a vaccine were completely protected from a later infection with wild-type HSV-2 and did not develop any symptoms of the disease. Furthermore, no virus was detected in the nerve cells of these mice—which is where the virus would normally persist in its dormant state. Finally, Petro, González et al. showed that blood serum from immunized mice could be used to completely protect other mice from exposure to wild-type virus. These results demonstrate that a live attenuated HSV-2 virus that lacks glycoprotein D (the main component of other failed vaccines) elicits a different type of immune response and is a safe and effective vaccine in mouse models of virus infection. With further work, these findings may eventually lead to a preventative treatment to combat HSV-2 infections in humans.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.06054.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.06054.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author keywords</title><kwd>vaccine</kwd><kwd>HSV-2</kwd><kwd>virology</kwd><kwd>antibody</kwd><kwd>immunity</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health (NIH)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>AI065309</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Petro</surname><given-names>Christopher</given-names></name><name><surname>Jandl</surname><given-names>Thomas</given-names></name><name><surname>Khajoueinejad</surname><given-names>Nazanin</given-names></name><name><surname>Herold</surname><given-names>Betsy C</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health (NIH)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>AI03461</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Cheshenko</surname><given-names>Natalia</given-names></name><name><surname>Herold</surname><given-names>Betsy C</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health (NIH)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>AI084225</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Jandl</surname><given-names>Thomas</given-names></name><name><surname>Khajoueinejad</surname><given-names>Nazanin</given-names></name><name><surname>Herold</surname><given-names>Betsy C</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health (NIH)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>AI063537</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Petro</surname><given-names>Christopher</given-names></name><name><surname>Bénard</surname><given-names>Angèle</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000011</institution-id><institution>Howard Hughes Medical Institute (HHMI)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Investigator</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>William</surname><given-names>Jacobs R</given-names><suffix>Jr</suffix></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000011</institution-id><institution>Howard Hughes Medical Institute (HHMI)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Research Fellow</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>González</surname><given-names>Pablo A</given-names></name><name><surname>Sengupta</surname><given-names>Mayami</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>An attenuated Herpes simplex type 2 virus deleted in glycoprotein D can be used as an effective vaccine to provide robust transferable humoral immunity and complete protection in murine intravaginal and skin infection models.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Herpes simplex viruses (HSV) are major global health problems. HSV serotype 1 (HSV-1) is associated primarily with oral mucocutaneous disease, sporadic encephalitis, and is a leading cause of corneal blindness worldwide, whereas HSV serotype 2 (HSV-2) is the leading cause of genital ulcerative disease and a major cofactor in fueling the HIV epidemic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Gray et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Wald and Link, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Freeman et al., 2006</xref>). The World Health Organization estimated that over 500 million people are infected with HSV-2 worldwide with approximately 20 million new cases annually (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Looker et al., 2008</xref>). The extremely high prevalence of HSV-2 in sub-Saharan Africa (∼70%) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Looker et al., 2008</xref>) may contribute more to the spread of HIV-1 than number of sex partners or other sexually transmitted infections (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Freeman et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Chen et al., 2007</xref>). Moreover, as HSV establishes latency in neurons with frequent subclinical or clinical reactivations, there is a lifelong impact of infection. Notably, HSV-1 has emerged as a predominant cause of genital disease in the developed world (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Roberts et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Xu et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Horowitz et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bernstein et al., 2013</xref>). These epidemiological findings highlight the urgency to develop a safe and effective vaccine that protects against both serotypes.</p><p>Subunit vaccines comprised of the HSV-2 viral envelope glycoprotein D (gD-2) alone or combined with other envelope glycoproteins and with different adjuvants have predominated the HSV vaccine field for nearly 20 years (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Mertz et al., 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Corey et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Stanberry et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bernstein et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Belshe et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Leroux-Roels et al., 2013</xref>). The rationale for gD-2 subunit vaccines included their safety and ability to elicit neutralizing antibody (Ab) responses in vitro. However, the clinical trial outcomes have been disappointing. For example, in the most recent efficacy trial, an HSV-2 gD adjuvanted subunit vaccine provided no protection against HSV-2 genital disease, but surprisingly provided 35% cross-protection against HSV-1 infection and 58% cross-protection against HSV-1 disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Belshe et al., 2012</xref>). Neutralizing Abs (1:422 against HSV-1 and 1:97 against HSV-2) were detected in the serum, but were not measured in mucosal sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Awasthi et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Belshe et al., 2014</xref>). The gD-2 subunit vaccine also elicited CD4<sup>+</sup>, but not CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell responses; however, the cellular responses did not correlate with HSV-1 protection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Belshe et al., 2014</xref>). These findings suggest the need for more complex immunogens to elicit protective immune responses against both serotypes.</p><p>The efficacy of the live attenuated varicella zoster virus (VZV) (a related herpes virus) vaccine suggests that a similar approach for HSV may prove effective. However, preclinical studies with attenuated HSV vaccine candidates have yielded variable but incomplete protection against primary infection and latency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Boursnell et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Spector et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Hoshino et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Shin and Iwasaki, 2012</xref>). For example, <italic>Shin</italic> and <italic>Iwasaki</italic> found that a ‘prime-pull’ strategy, in which mice were first primed subcutaneously with an attenuated HSV deleted in thymidine kinase and then treated intravaginally with chemokines to recruit protective CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells into the genital tract, was required for protection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Shin and Iwasaki, 2012</xref>). We adopted a different attenuated vaccine strategy based on an HSV-2 virus genetically deleted for the gene that encodes gD-2 (<italic>U</italic><sub><italic>S</italic></sub><italic>6</italic>) and complemented the virus to allow a first round of replication by growing it on Vero cells encoding HSV-1 <italic>U</italic><sub><italic>S</italic></sub><italic>6</italic> (gD-1, VD60 cells) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Cheshenko et al., 2013</xref>). The HSV-1 gD complemented HSV-2 mutant virus (designated HSV-2 Δ<italic>gD</italic><sup>−/+gD−1</sup>) replicates in VD60 cells to high titers, but a single passage through non-complementing cells yields non-infectious progeny, reflecting the requirement for gD in entry and cell-to-cell spread. We evaluated this virus for safety, immunogenicity, and vaccine efficacy against intravaginal challenge and in a skin scarification model in different strains of mice. Subcutaneous prime and boost of mice with HSV-2 Δ<italic>gD</italic><sup>−/+gD−1</sup> protected against lethal challenge in both models and prevented the establishment of latency. Adoptive transfer experiments showed that protection was mediated by antibodies (Abs) and required both the Fcγ receptor and neonatal Fc receptor (FcRn).</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Immunization with HSV-2 Δ<italic>gD</italic><sup><italic>−/+gD−1</italic></sup> is safe and protects mice from intravaginal lethal challenge</title><p>We reasoned that deletion of gD-2, an envelope glycoprotein required for viral entry and cell-to-cell spread, would restrict infection to a single round of viral replication and thus provide a safe, highly attenuated candidate vaccine.

No plaques were observed when three independent plaque-purified isolates were grown to 10<sup>8</sup> pfu on VD60 cells and then plated on non-complementing Vero cells. Moreover, no recombinants were detected by PCR, most likely reflecting differences in the regions flanking gD in VD60 cells and in HSV-2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>).

The current study challenges this paradigm. We found that a live attenuated virus deleted in HSV-2 gD protects mice from vaginal, skin, and neuronal disease. Specifically, we observed no evidence of neurological disease in any model and could not detect virus in DRG of vaccinated mice by ex vivo plaque assays or by qPCR with a lower limit of detection of three viral genomes. The vaccine was effective in C57BL/6 and BALB/c mice and elicited high titers of HSV Abs (1:800,000) that were capable of passively protecting mice from both intravaginal and skin challenges. Notably, the Abs had low levels of neutralizing activity but did elicit ADCC and were able to passively transfer protection with a single dose of immune serum. The HSV-specific Abs could not be detected in vaginal washes of vaccinated mice, but were rapidly recruited into the vaginal lumen following intravaginal challenge and were associated with rapid clearance of the virus. Notably, the vaginal wash Abs were predominantly IgG, not IgA (data not shown), which is consistent with prior studies that have shown that while the predominant immunoglobulin by weight in the vaginal mucus of immune mice is secretory IgA, HSV-specific Abs are almost entirely IgG (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Parr and Parr, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Parr et al., 1998</xref>). The HSV-specific Abs were likely critical for protection as evidenced by the studies with FcRn knockout mice. Passive protection was also lost in FcγR knockout mice highlighting the role of Fc-mediated effector mechanisms.</p><p>These findings differ from those obtained with other subunit or attenuated vaccine candidates. The first attenuated vaccine to be evaluated clinically was a virus deleted in glycoprotein H (gH, <italic>U</italic><sub><italic>L</italic></sub><italic>22</italic>). Unlike the data presented here with the HSV-2 Δ<italic>gD</italic> virus<italic>,</italic> the gH deletion viral vaccine did not prevent the establishment of latency in mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Speck et al., 1996</xref>), was not shown to passively transfer protection and failed to reduce recurrences when evaluated as a therapeutic vaccine in a clinical trial (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">de Bruyn et al., 2006</xref>). More recently, a virus deleted in HSV-2 <italic>U</italic><sub><italic>L</italic></sub><italic>5</italic> and <italic>U</italic><sub><italic>L</italic></sub><italic>29</italic>, which is defective in HSV DNA replication, has been advanced to a Phase 1 study. This deletion virus also differs from the HSV-2 Δ<italic>gD</italic><sup>−/+gD−1</sup> vaccine candidate described here in that it does not induce as high an Ab response, has not been shown to passively protect, and did not prevent the establishment of latency as low levels of viral DNA were detected in the DRG following both immunization and viral challenge (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Hoshino et al., 2005</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">2008</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Dudek et al., 2008</xref>). Notably, the <italic>U</italic><sub><italic>L</italic></sub><italic>5</italic>/<italic>U</italic><sub><italic>L</italic></sub><italic>29</italic> deletion virus expresses gD at levels similar to that of wild-type virus, but lower levels of gB (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Da Costa et al., 2000</xref>). Thymidine kinase (tk) deletion viruses, which have been used to study HSV immunogenicity because they are attenuated in mice (but not humans), express the full repertoire of viral proteins including gD. Protection following immunization with tk-deletion viruses requires anti-HSV-2 T cells in the genital tract (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Milligan et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Shin and Iwasaki, 2012</xref>) and serum from mice immunized with this tk-deletion virus has not been shown to passively transfer protection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Morrison et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Milligan et al., 2004</xref>).</p><p>Possibly, deletion of gD, which is immunodominant as evidenced by the immune response in control, HSV-2 challenged mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6F</xref>) and by clinical data showing that the majority of HSV-infected individuals have neutralizing Abs to gD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Cairns et al., 2014</xref>), unmasks viral antigens important in generating a protective humoral response. Additionally, gD may modulate immune responses through its interactions with herpesvirus entry mediator (HVEM) on immune cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">La et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Aubert et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Stiles et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Kopp et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Grauwet et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Sharma et al., 2014</xref>). Interactions between gD and HVEM may skew the immune response towards neutralizing Abs whereas in the absence of the gD-HVEM interaction or yet undiscovered immunosuppressive functions of gD, the host may mount a polyantigenic IgG2 dominant response capable of eliciting FcR-mediated protection. This hypothesis will be tested in future studies by: (1) comparing, for example, the immune response to virus in mice deficient for HVEM, (2) examining the immune response to the HSV-2 Δ<italic>gD</italic><sup>−/+gD−1</sup> vaccine when combined with the gD subunit vaccine, or (3) isolating mutant forms of gD that have lost immunosuppressive functions.</p><p>The inability of gD to elicit protective immunity against HSV-2 is highlighted by the results of the clinical trials with an adjuvanted gD subunit vaccine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Mertz et al., 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Corey et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Kohl et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bernstein et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Belshe et al., 2012</xref>). An additional mechanism that may contribute to the protection observed with the HSV-2 Δ<italic>gD</italic><sup>−/+gD−1</sup> vaccine and to the observation that it induces Abs to multiple viral proteins is that by deleting the gene for gD, which is required for cell-to-cell spread, the cells initially infected by the complemented virus may function as a ‘factory’ generating viral proteins and ‘defective’ particles that are immunogenic. Consistent with this is the observation that heat-killed HSV-2 Δ<italic>gD</italic><sup>−/+<italic>gD−1</italic></sup> failed to protect mice from vaginal challenge (data not shown).</p><p>In addition to its unique ability to generate high levels of Abs capable of translocating to mucosal sites and to prevent virus from reaching neuronal tissue following intravaginal or skin challenge, the HSV-2 Δ<italic>gD</italic><sup>−/+gD−1</sup> virus is also an attractive vaccine because of its safety. The virus induced no disease in SCID mice inoculated with 1000 times the lethal dose of wild-type virus and to date we have observed no recombinants either by plaque assay or PCR. This likely reflects that the virus is propagated on an HSV-1 and not an HSV-2 complementing cell line. The flanking regions of gD in HSV-1 and HSV-2 share approximately 54% and 73% identity within the 5′ and 3′ region of the <italic>U</italic><sub><italic>S</italic></sub><italic>6</italic> gene, respectively (HSV-1(KOS) vs HSV-2(HG52), NCBI genome, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). This level of homology makes recombination highly unlikely.</p><p>It remains to be determined whether pre-existing immunity to HSV-1 will impact the immunogenicity of the HSV-2 Δ<italic>gD</italic><sup>−/+gD−1</sup> vaccine as was shown with the gD subunit vaccine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Stanberry et al., 2002</xref>) This may be less of a problem with HSV-2 Δ<italic>gD</italic><sup>−/+gD−1</sup> as it elicits a polyantigenic response whereas infection primarily elicits Abs to gD as evidenced by the immunoblots. If future studies suggest this is a problem, an alternative strategy is to complement the HSV-2 Δ<italic>gD<sup>−/+gD−1 </sup></italic>virus with gD from a nonhuman herpes virus or a chimeric gD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Zago et al., 2004</xref>). Ideally the development of new mouse models of HSV latency and reactivation will allow us to explore the efficacy of HSV-2 Δ<italic>gD</italic><sup>−/+<italic>gD−1</italic></sup> as a therapeutic vaccine.</p><p>The demonstration that this vaccine strain confers protective Abs against skin and intravaginal challenge that function through the Fc receptor highlights the importance of ADCC and antibody-mediated phagocytosis. Consistent with this concept are the results of the HIV RV144 vaccine trial, which found that non-neutralizing antibodies that mediate ADCC and antibody-mediated phagocytosis contributed to protection against HIV (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bonsignori et al., 2012</xref>). Similar findings have been observed in nonhuman primate studies of SHIV (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Florese et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bialuk et al., 2011</xref>). Moreover, recent studies suggest that Ab–FcγR interactions are required to mediate protection against influenza (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Dilillo et al., 2014</xref>). Together these findings suggest that the HSV-2 Δ<italic>gD<sup>−/+gD−1 </sup></italic>vaccine provides a model to elicit such protective responses and indicate that it may be an ideal vaccine vector for other pathogens that enter through these sites.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Mice</title><p>Experiments were carried out with approval from the Albert Einstein College of Medicine Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee, Protocol #20130913.

Effector/target and target cells were then stained with Live/Dead Red fixable dye (Invitrogen) for 15 min and subsequently washed and resuspended in FACs buffer (2% heat-inactivated FBS, 2 mM EDTA in PBS). The percentage of dead HSV-2-infected target cells was determined on a 5-laser LSRII flow cytometer (Becton Dickenson, San Diego, CA) at the Einstein Flow Cytometry Core Facility. Final analysis was carried out using FlowJo software version 10 (Tree Star, Inc., Ashland, OR).</p></sec><sec id="s4-10"><title>Western blots</title><p>Stocks of HSV-2 Δ<italic>gD</italic><sup><italic>−/+gD−</italic>1</sup> and Δ<italic>gD</italic><sup><italic>−/−</italic></sup> were propagated on VD60 or Vero cells and purified using dextran or sucrose gradients as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Cheshenko et al., 2013</xref>) and then analyzed for viral protein expression by performing Western blots. Equivalent numbers of viral particles (based on Western blot probing with antibody to the viral capsid protein, VP5 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Cheshenko et al., 2007</xref>]) were loaded on gels, proteins separated by SDS-PAGE, transferred to nitrocellulose and immunoblotted with anti-HSV-2; gC (H1196), anti-gE (101), anti-VP16 (VA16), anti-VP5 (3B6), anti-gB (10B7), anti-gD (0191) from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA) and anti-gH-gL (CH31, gift from R Eisenberg and G Cohen, University of Pennsylvania) as previously reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Cheshenko et al., 2014</xref>). Serum immune-target profiling was done by performing Western blots with 10 µg of HSV-2(4674) infected Vero cell lysates per lane or equivalent particle numbers (based on Western blots for VP5) of HSV-2 Δ<italic>gD</italic><sup><italic>−/+gD−</italic>1</sup> and Δ<italic>gD</italic><sup><italic>−/−</italic></sup> purified virus, and probing with serial dilutions of immune or control serum obtained 1 week post-boost or 8 days post-intravaginal challenge, respectively. Alternatively, Western blots were performed using 2 µg of recombinant glycoprotein B-1 produced in baculovirus and purified on a CL-68 sepharose column (17-0467-01, GE Healthcare, Sweden) as previously reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Cheshenko et al., 2004</xref>). The anti-gB-1/gB-2 monoclonal antibody 10B7 and the anti-gD-1 monoclonal antibody 0191 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) were used as positive controls. Blots were incubated with immune and control serum for 16 hr at 4°C. After repetitive washes, bound antibodies were detected using goat anti-mouse-HRP secondary antibody (Bio Rad, Hercules, CA).</p></sec><sec id="s4-11"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>Results were compared by two-way analysis of variance (two-way ANOVA) with multiple comparisons or unpaired <italic>t</italic> tests using GraphPad Prism version 6 (San Diego, CA).

Your article has been favorably evaluated by Randy Schekman (Senior editor) and 3 reviewers, one of whom served as a guest Reviewing Editor.</p><p>Two of the three reviewers, Susan Pierce and Andrew McMichael, have agreed to reveal their identity.</p><p>The Reviewing editor and the other reviewers discussed their comments before we reached this decision, and the Reviewing editor has assembled the following comments to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>The three reviewers were very positive regarding this manuscript. The six (major) points raised by reviewer #1 should be addressed by the authors. This need not involve additional experimentation. Finally, please discuss the points brought up by reviewers #2 and #3. No new experiments are required.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1</italic></p><p>In their manuscript, Petro and colleagues describe a novel HSV-2 vaccine concept based on a gD deletion mutant. The authors show that the vaccine strain is only able to undergo a single cycle of replication in non-complementing cells and is safe in SCID mice at high doses. Furthermore, the construct protects from HSV-2 induced neurological and epithelial disease in mice and cross-protection in a skin scarification mouse model against HSV-1 is demonstrated as well. Interestingly, the authors identify ADCC as mechanism of protection. The study is important, innovative and certainly well done. However, there are some issues that require the authors’ attention.</p><p>Major points:</p><p>1) A live attenuated VZV vaccine (Varivax/Zostervax) is currently used in the US. Although this vaccine is highly efficacious the immune response is short-lived and re-immunization is required. The authors show protection after a relatively short time interval (3 weeks post boost). Do the authors foresee the same problem with their HSV-2 vaccine? How long lasting is the immune response?</p><p>2) The vaccine construct carries a HSV-1 gD protein. Approximately 54% of the US population has pre-existing immunity against HSV-1 (Bradley et al., JID, 2013). This could strongly impact on vaccine efficacy in humans. Would a complementing gD from a non-human herpesvirus be a better choice? The authors should discuss this.</p><p>3) The authors show crossprotection/crossneutralization against HSV-1. Is this crossprotection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>) induced by the HSV-1 gD on the virus surface or not? No quantitative data is provided in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref> for the HSV-1 challenge. The authors should add disease scores and virus titers.</p><p>4) The authors measure IgG in vaginal washes and use a neonatal FcR KO model to show that mucosal antibody is important. However, mucosal IgA is not discussed. Was that measured? Which role does it play?</p><p>5) In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>, the authors show that passive transfer of sera from vaccinated mice protects naive mice from challenge. The authors include a group of mice that receive 'Ig' depleted serum. Animals in this group survive three days longer than mice in the other control groups and this result is likely statistically significant. Is this a technical issue with Ig depletion?</p><p>6) The authors show that the deletion of the immunodominant gD from their virus re-directs the immune response towards the less immunogenic gB, a concept that has also been proposed for HA stalk-based influenza virus vaccines. Despite high titers of antibodies against gB, the neutralization titers are very low, which is in contrast to findings with gB subunit vaccines which usually induce robust neutralization titers. The authors should discuss this.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>In this manuscript, the authors explore the efficacy of using a novel mechanism to attenuate Herpes simplex virus (HSV) 2 for use as a vaccine. HSV infections are an enormous global health problem and at present there is no HSV vaccine. Consequently new approaches to vaccine design are badly needed. The authors attenuate HSV-2 by deleting glycoprotein D (gD-2) and complementing the loss by a single round of replication of the virus on cells expressing HSV-1 gD (ΔgD<sup>-/+gD-1</sup>). The ΔgD<sup>-/+gD-1</sup> virus when used as a vaccine should only replicate once in the host. To my mind the results presented here are remarkable. Subcutaneous immunization with ΔgD<sup>-/+gD-1</sup> completely protected against intravaginal or skin challenge and prevented the establishment of latency. These data are convincing. Concerning the immune mechanisms underlying protection the authors provide evidence that protection can be transferred by Ig from immunized mice and requires that the recipient mouse express FcgammaR (presumably to mediate antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity as the Ig is poorly neutralizing but has ADCC activity) and FcRn (presumably to mediate transfer of Ig into the vaginal lumen).</p><p>The puzzling result in terms of immune mechanism is the dramatic effect of the presence of gD-1 on the Ab response. When gD is expressed the Ab response is almost entirely gD-specific and the Abs are neutralizing. In the absence of gD antibodies specific for many HSV proteins are made. This may simply be due to an extreme immunodominance of gD. It would seem that achieving such dominance would require that gD-specific B cells have a strong advantage over B cells recognizing other HSV antigens in germinal center reactions. Perhaps immune cells, for example, T follicular helper cells that have receptors for gD, synergize with gD-specific B cells. One way to approach the question would be to determine if gD expressing HSV induces only gD-specific response in mice deficient for the known gD receptors, i.e. CD155, CD112. Such experiments, while of interest, are certainly not required to support the conclusions drawn here.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic></p><p>This manuscript describes a novel approach to HSV2 vaccination in mice. They find that deletion of the immunodominat gD protein in the virus elicits non-neutralizing antibodies which protect against challenge very impressively. They use a variety of readouts, all giving the same answer.</p><p>They show that the protection is mediated by antibody, because passive transfer protects though not if Ig depleted. They show that the protection is Fc dependent and go on to show that it is likely to act through ADCC. Whether this is the direct mechanism responsible is less clear but there is at least a good correlation between this assay in vitro and protection.</p><p>There are important general messages here. Neutralizing antibody is not essential for protection. That is known, though often ignored, in other virus infections; here it is very well illustrated and shown that such antibodies can be harnessed by vaccination to give protection. Secondly the immunodominant antigen may not elicit protective antibody but subdominant immunogens might; genetically manipulated vaccines offer a way to address that, though what determines immunodominance often remains a mystery.</p><p>Can the findings be generalized to other infections? They make a reference to the RV144 HV vaccine trial where some protection was given by non-neutralizing antibodies. It would be good to cite other more convincing examples, if they exist.</p><p>A small point that is relevant to human vaccinology. BALB/c and C57B6 mice are often used to test immunogens and for challenges. However in human terms these are just two individuals and may well be immunologically atypical compared to outbred mice or outbred humans. It would be good to test this protection in an outbred mouse model, if the same level of protection is seen that be very encouraging for a human vaccine. However this is not essential for acceptance of this manuscript.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.06054.016</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p>Reviewer #1:</p><p><italic>1) A live attenuated VZV vaccine (Varivax/Zostervax) is currently used in the US.

We recognize that as we advance into clinical trials, additional booster doses may be needed. It should be noted however, that the HSV vaccine candidate proposed in these studies was engineered with a specific defined deletion of the gene encoding the glycoprotein D. In contrast, the Varivx/Zostervax vaccine was attenuated through serial passages in human and guinea pig cells and was sequenced after introduction into the clinic. The specific determinants of attenuation are still uncertain. The open reading frame with the most single nucleotide polymorphisms encodes the regulatory protein IE62, but IE62 studies have failed to define a specific polymorphism associated with attenuation. A more recent next-generation sequencing study of an unrelated highly attenuated VZV strain identified a stop codon mutation in ORF0 (herpes simplex virus UL56 homolog) identical to one found in vOka, suggesting that this may be one of the determinants of the attenuation genotype of live VZV vaccines (J Virol, 2012, 86(19): 10695-703). This will be addressed in future studies.</p><p><italic>2) The vaccine construct carries a HSV-1 gD protein. Approximately 54% of the US population has pre-existing immunity against HSV-1 (Bradley et al., JID, 2013). This could strongly impact on vaccine efficacy in humans. Would a complementing gD from a non-human herpesvirus be a better choice? The authors should discuss this</italic>.</p><p>Future studies will address whether HSV-1 seropositivity limits the immunogenicity of the vaccine strain or whether the vaccine would be optimal in younger children who are seronegative for both HSV-1 and HSV-2. To experimentally explore this, mice infected via the skin scarification model with HSV-1 and confirmed to be seropositive will be vaccinated and challenged intravaginally with HSV-2 or vice versa. This concern will also be addressed early in the clinical development by testing the safety and immunogenicity of the vaccine in HSV-2 seronegative subjects who are either HSV-1 seropositive or seronegative. If preexisting immunity to HSV-1 interferes with the vaccine immunogenicity, we will explore complementing the vaccine strain with a gD homologue from a non-human herpesvirus as suggested by the reviewer. Other non-human herpesviruses share partial homology with HSV gD. For example, pseudorabies virus (PrV), which also binds to nectin-1 as an entry receptor, shares 30% amino acid identity and did not substitute for HSV gD in a fusion assay. However, chimeric gD molecules composed of HSV and PRV sequences did substitute, provided the first 285 amino acids were from HSV-1 (PNAS, 2004, 101(50): 17498–17503). If needed, we will explore these alternative strategies. We have added a comment in the Discussion section indicating the need to explore the impact of preexisting HSV-1 seropositivity on the immunogenicity of this vaccine strain.</p><p><italic>3) The authors show crossprotection/crossneutralization against HSV-1. Is this crossprotection (</italic><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4"><italic>Figure 4B</italic></xref> <italic>and</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6"><italic>Figure 6C</italic></xref><italic>) induced by the HSV-1 gD on the virus surface or not? No quantitative data is provided in</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4"><italic>Figure 4</italic></xref> <italic>for the HSV-1 challenge. The authors should add disease scores and virus titers</italic>.</p><p>It is unlikely that the cross-protection against HSV-1 in the intravaginal and skin scarification models is mediated by antibodies to gD-1 as the immunoblots indicate only low levels of anti-gD antibodies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6F</xref>). We speculate that antibodies targeting other viral antigens such as glycoprotein B contribute to the cross protection. This notion is supported by the observation that a humanized antibody to gB provided cross protection against HSV-1 and HSV-2 (PNAS, 2013, 110(17), 6760–5). Identification of the antigenic targets and subsequent depletion of antigen specific antibodies from the immune serum will enable us to identify the correlates of protection against both HSV-1 (cross-protection) and HSV-2. These studies will be conducted in the future. In addition, we plan to extend studies and test vaccine efficacy against clinical isolates of both HSV-1 and HSV-2. As suggested by the Reviewer, we have added the HSV-1 disease scores and skin viral loads to the manuscript (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4–figure supplement 1</xref>).</p><p><italic>4) The authors measure IgG in vaginal washes and use a neonatal FcR KO model to show that mucosal antibody is important. However, mucosal IgA is not discussed. Was that measured? Which role does it play?</italic></p><p>We previously measured HSV specific IgA in vaginal washes but found low abundance in our ELISA assay. Although the predominant immunoglobulin by weight in the vaginal mucus of immune mice has been shown to be secretory IgA, prior studies (consistent with our work) indicate that virus specific antibody is almost entirely IgG (Parr, J Reproductive Immunology, 1998, 38; 15-3; and Parr, M., 1998, Journal of Virology, 72(6), 5137–45). Thus, we focused on IgG. It should also be noted that in humans, the primary vaginal antibody is IgG, not IgA. We have added a sentence and these references to the revised Discussion.</p><p><italic>5) In</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5"><italic>Figure 5</italic></xref> <italic>the authors show that passive transfer of sera from vaccinated mice protects naive mice from challenge.

Is this a technical issue with Ig depletion?</italic></p><p>We thank the reviewer for noting this as it reflected an error in the uploading of the figure between different programs. There is no significant difference between the ‘Ig’ depleted group and the control groups and the figure has been corrected.</p><p><italic>6) The authors show that the deletion of the immunodominant gD from their virus re-directs the immune response towards the less immunogenic gB, a concept that has also been proposed for HA stalk-based influenza virus vaccines.

This may reflect the isotype and other characteristics and may be linked to the absence of the immunomodulating effects of the gD-HVEM interaction. We have expanded the Discussion to address this.</p><p>Reviewer #2:</p><p><italic>In this manuscript, the authors explore the efficacy of using a novel mechanism to attenuate Herpes simplex virus (HSV) 2 for use as a vaccine.

That is known, though often ignored, in other virus infections; here it is very well illustrated and shown that such antibodies can be harnessed by vaccination to give protection. Secondly the immunodominant antigen may not elicit protective antibody but subdominant immunogens might; genetically manipulated vaccines offer a way to address that, though what determines immunodominance often remains a mystery</italic>.</p><p><italic>Can the findings be generalized to other infections? They make a reference to the RV144 HV vaccine trial where some protection was given by non-neutralizing antibodies. It would be good to cite other more convincing examples, if they exist</italic>.</p><p>We do not yet know if these findings can be generalized to other infections. There are few examples in the literature that demonstrate the role of non-neutralizing antibodies and most of the studies are in NHP models of SIV/SHIV and one study in influenza. We have added a few of these additional references as suggested.</p><p><italic>A small point that is relevant to human vaccinology. BALB/c and C57B6 mice are often used to test immunogens and for challenges. However in human terms these are just two individuals and may well be immunologically atypical compared to outbred mice or outbred humans. It would be good to test this protection in an outbred mouse model, if the same level of protection is seen that be very encouraging for a human vaccine. However this is not essential for acceptance of this manuscript</italic>.</p><p>We agree with the reviewer and are planning future experiments looking at efficacy with outbred strains of mice (such as Swiss Webster).</p></body></sub-article></article>
