However, little is known about the processing of taste pheromones in higher order brain centers. Here, we describe a male-specific gustatory circuit in <italic>Drosophila</italic> that underlies the detection of the anti-aphrodisiac pheromone (3<italic>R</italic>,11<italic>Z</italic>,19<italic>Z</italic>)-3-acetoxy-11,19-octacosadien-1-ol (CH503). Using behavioral analysis, genetic manipulation, and live calcium imaging, we show that Gr68a-expressing neurons on the forelegs of male flies exhibit a sexually dimorphic physiological response to the pheromone and relay information to the central brain via peptidergic neurons. The release of tachykinin from 8 to 10 cells within the subesophageal zone is required for the pheromone-triggered courtship suppression. Taken together, this work describes a neuropeptide-modulated central brain circuit that underlies the programmed behavioral response to a gustatory sex pheromone. These results will allow further examination of the molecular basis by which innate behaviors are modulated by gustatory cues and physiological state.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.06914.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.06914.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.06914.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>In many species of animals, the male decides to pursue a potential female mate based on how she smells and tastes. Powerful chemical signals known as pheromones control this decision. When a male fruit fly mates with a female fruit fly, he often leaves behind an anti-aphrodisiac pheromone that, when males taste it, deters them from mating with the female. Until recently, however, little was known about how the brain processes information from such taste pheromones.</p><p>Now, Shankar et al. have investigated this problem in a series of experiments with normal and genetically modified flies. In the first experiment normal male flies were exposed to the chemical on its own, to the chemical on a sample of female skin, and to the chemical on actual female flies. The male flies did not respond to the pheromone on its own, but they did respond to it in the other two scenarios.</p><p>Next, Shankar et al. used genetic techniques to eliminate individual neurons in the male flies and then observed how the loss of specific neurons influenced the response of the fly to the pheromone. These experiments showed that male flies have a special group of sensory neurons in their legs that detect the chemical and then send an electrical signal to the brain. Shankar et al. then went on to identify a brain circuit consisting of 8–10 neurons that responds to this signal and to show that the release of a neurochemical called Tachykinin is essential in communicating the signal.</p><p>In a final set of experiments, Shankar et al. introduced two sensors—one in the sensory neurons in the legs, the other in the 8–10 neurons in the brain—that light up when the neurons in that region are close enough to each other to form connections. The results suggest that the sensory neurons in the legs form connections with the 8–10 neurons in the brain.</p><p>A challenge for the future is to understand how the nervous system combines different social cues and information about the physiological state of the animal, and how this influences the decision to mate.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.06914.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.06914.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author keywords</title><kwd>CH503</kwd><kwd>courtship</kwd><kwd>behavior</kwd><kwd>anti-aphrodisiac</kwd><kwd>NPF</kwd><kwd>calcium imaging</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>D. melanogaster</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001381</institution-id><institution>National Research Foundation-Prime Minister's office, Republic of Singapore</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>NRF-RF2010-06</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Yew</surname><given-names>Joanne Y</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100005156</institution-id><institution>Alexander von Humboldt-Stiftung</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Yew</surname><given-names>Joanne Y</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.3</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The cellular and molecular substrates that underlie the programmed behavioral response to a gustatory sex pheromone have been identified.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>For many animals, exogenously released chemical cues known as pheromones heavily influence social behaviors that are crucial to survival and reproduction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Karlson and Luscher, 1959</xref>). Elucidating the neural basis of pheromone detection provides a means for understanding how information from sensory stimuli is encoded and used to modulate complex behaviors such as mating (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Pavlou and Goodwin, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Haga-Yamanaka et al., 2014</xref>) and aggression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chamero et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Wang et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Fernández and Kravitz, 2013</xref>).</p><p>The neural circuits underlying olfactory pheromone detection are well described in the silkmoth <italic>Bombyx mori</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Sakurai et al., 2014</xref>) and honey bee (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Roussel et al., 2014</xref>). In <italic>Drosophila</italic>, the pathways mediating detection of the sex pheromone 11-<italic>cis</italic>-vaccenyl acetate (cVA) have been refined down to 4 neurons connected by 3 synapses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Ruta et al., 2010</xref>). In addition, the projection patterns for several other olfactory receptor neurons that likely detect sex pheromones have been mapped from the antennal lobe to the ventral lateral horn, implicating this region in the central brain as a specialized site for processing pheromone odors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Jefferis et al., 2007</xref>).</p><p>In contrast to the olfactory system, the higher order pathways for the processing of gustatory pheromones are largely unknown despite their importance in behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Wang et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Fernández and Kravitz, 2013</xref>). Several pheromone receptors located in the primary gustatory organs (proboscis, labellum, forelegs) have been identified. Gr32a (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Miyamoto and Amrein, 2008</xref>) is thought to respond to the male pheromone (7<italic>Z</italic>)-tricosene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Wang et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Fan et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Andrews et al., 2014</xref>). Furthermore, Gr33a (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Moon et al., 2009</xref>), Gr39a (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Watanabe et al., 2011</xref>), and a member of the class of ionotropic receptors (IRs), Ir20a (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Koh et al., 2014</xref>), contribute to courtship behavior, though the ligands remain unidentified. Lastly, a recently discovered class of ion channels belonging to the pickpocket family of proteins (ppk23, ppk25, and ppk29) responds to both female pheromones and male anti-aphrodisiacs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Thistle et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Toda et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Mast et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Vijayan et al., 2014</xref>). Without exception, processes from all Gr-expressing neurons map to the ventral cord and the subesophageal zone (SEZ) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Wang et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Kwon et al., 2014</xref>). However, little is known about the post-synaptic targets of the SEZ as well as the neurotransmitter systems used to mediate pheromone-related behaviors in the central brain.</p><p>In this work, we describe a central neural circuit that mediates the detection and behavioral response to a gustatory sex pheromone, (3<italic>R</italic>,11<italic>Z</italic>,19<italic>Z</italic>)-3-acetoxy-11,19-octacosadien-1-ol (CH503). CH503 is transferred from males to females during mating and inhibits courtship from other males (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Yew et al., 2009</xref>). The pheromone also functions as a potent suppressor of male courtship behavior in other drosophilids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Ng et al., 2014</xref>). We show that CH503 is detected by Gr68a-expressing gustatory neurons on the male foreleg and that information is transduced via peptidergic cells to the central brain. Specifically, a cluster of 8–10 neurons within the SEZ mediates the pheromone-triggered courtship-avoidance response through the release of the neuropeptide tachykinin.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>CH503 inhibits male courtship behavior in a dose-dependent manner</title><p>Courtship in <italic>Drosophila</italic> consists of a stereotyped sequence of behaviors including orientation, wing vibration, tapping with the forelegs, abdomen curling, and copulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Spieth, 1974</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). To determine the sensitivity of males to CH503 and to examine the courtship features that are suppressed by the pheromone, wild-type CantonS male flies were placed with virgin females perfumed with doses of synthetic CH503 ranging from 0 to 2667 ng. Males exhibited a dose-dependent response to the pheromone. A dose of 167 ng/fly was sufficient to suppress courtship in approximately 50% of the behavioral trials (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). The latency to courtship initiation (as measured by the first instance of wing vibration) was similar across all doses, ranging from 350 to 400 s (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). However, the overall courtship vigor was significantly suppressed by the pheromone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). Taken together, these findings indicate that CH503 inhibits later stages of the courtship sequence and sustained courtship behavior.<fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.06914.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Functional properties of the male sex pheromone CH503.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) The typical courtship sequence of <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> is comprised of wing vibration performed by the male towards the female, tapping and tasting of the female abdomen with the forelegs, and abdomen curling followed by copulation.

Since the latency to wing extension did not appear to be affected by CH503, we hypothesized that the pheromone is detected only at close proximity. To determine whether tactile contact with CH503 is necessary for courtship suppression, we positioned a pheromone source separated from the female target at various distances. To prevent contact with the pheromone, a mesh barrier was placed between the courtship chamber and a second chamber containing a piece of filter paper soaked with 64 μg of CH503. Despite the high dose of pheromone, male courtship was uninhibited when the filter paper was placed 6 or 3 mm away, or on the floor of the courtship chamber (allowing for direct contact). In each case, 100% of male flies initiated courtship towards females (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). Potentially, female pheromones act in synergy with CH503 and both cues are needed to inhibit courtship. However, a mixture of female cuticular extract and CH503 applied to filter paper that was placed on the floor of the chamber was ineffective (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). We further tested for synergistic effects from female pheromones by using transgenic female flies in which oenocytes, the pheromone-producing cells in <italic>Drosophila</italic>, were genetically ablated. In the presence of oenocyte-less flies perfumed with CH503, male courtship was still significantly inhibited (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). In sum, these results indicate that female-specific pheromones synthesized in the oenocytes do not mediate the detection of CH503. Furthermore, CH503 is effective as an anti-aphrodisiac only when placed on the cuticular surface of females, indicating that sensory cues other than cuticular lipids are required.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>CH503 is detected by taste, not smell</title><p>Based on the relatively high molecular weight of CH503 and its low volatility, we hypothesized that CH503 is likely to be perceived as a tastant. We performed a proboscis extension reflex (PER) assay to test whether CH503 is detected by foreleg gustatory receptors. Stimulation of the foreleg with rewarding stimulants such as a sugar solution induces extension of the proboscis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Kimura et al., 1986</xref>) while aversive, bitter substances suppress the PER (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Lacaille et al., 2007</xref>). Exposure of the forelegs to 0.5–2.0 µg of CH503 together with 4% sucrose reduced the frequency of the PER (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). Similarly, caffeine, a bitter stimulus, also suppressed the PER. In contrast, females did not exhibit a change in the PER when exposed to CH503, indicating that either the pheromone was not detected or that it does not carry a negative valence for females (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). To further examine whether CH503 is detected as an odorant or tastant, we tested the responses of transgenic males defective in smell or taste perception. Flies lacking the olfactory co-receptor Or83b (<italic>Orco</italic>) exhibit significant defects in olfactory pheromone detection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Larsson et al., 2004</xref>).

Males continued to respond to CH503 though the courtship suppression effect is partially mitigated compared to other gustatory receptors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>).

Sensory neurons in the male foreleg that house the gustatory receptor Gr68a detect the sex pheromone CH503 and relay information to higher order neural centers via peptidergic neurons in the SEZ. The release of TK from a cluster of 8–10 cells found within the <italic>c929-</italic>labeled SEZ region is essential for mediating the courtship suppression response.</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>A dual sensory role for Gr68a in courtship initiation</title><p>Previous characterization of Gr68a indicated that female pheromones are likely to serve as ligands and that Gr68a-impaired males are defective in their courtship of females (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bray and Amrein, 2003</xref>). In contrast, our study shows that Gr68a-impaired males courted females at similar levels to control males and that one ligand for the receptor is the male sex pheromone CH503. Several factors can account for these discrepancies. First, the courtship defect of Gr68a-impaired males is only evident in larger-sized behavioral chambers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Ejima and Griffith, 2008</xref>). Our study used smaller chambers (∅ = 10 mm) compared to the previous study (30 mm; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bray and Amrein, 2003</xref>) hence masking the courtship defect. Second, Ejima and Griffith previously showed that Gr68a is needed to relay motion-related cues that stimulate courtship initiation. The dual sensory role of Gr68a is consistent with its expression pattern in males in separate mechanosensory and gustatory neuron populations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Ejima and Griffith, 2008</xref>) and afferent projections to the SEZ and AMMC, a relay center for auditory information. Thus, males' inability to detect motion rather than female pheromones may underlie the previously reported Gr68a-related courtship initiation defects. Taken together with the results of our current study, we propose that excitatory mechanosensory information is integrated with inhibitory CH503 detection via Gr68a neurons and both types of sensory cues shape the decision to initiate and sustain courtship. This model is consistent with our findings that activation of Gr68a-neurons using TrpA1 did not promote courtship suppression. Simultaneous activation of both courtship-promoting and suppressing channels likely resulted in an overall null response. Similar dual functioning neurons integrating chemical information with touch have been described in nematodes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Kaplan and Horvitz, 1993</xref>), mammalian olfactory receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Grosmaitre et al., 2007</xref>), and vertebrate nociceptor systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Besson and Chaouch, 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Woolf and Walters, 1991</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Interaction of CH503 with Gr68a</title><p>The nature of the ligand–receptor interaction is an open question in the absence of data from heterologous expression studies or structure–function analysis. Our observation that CH503 induces courtship inhibition only when detected on female cuticles has several implications for the underlying mechanisms. Potentially, activation of Gr68a receptors found on other parts of the male body (e.g., other regions of the legs or wings) is needed and occurs only when males assume courtship postures. Alternatively, concurrent detection of a co-factor residing on female cuticles might be required. Though our results show that hexane-soluble molecules on the cuticle are not needed, the possibility remains that cuticular peptides or proteins may help transduce pheromone detection. Previous work indicated that a pheromone binding protein, CheB42a, is found in the lumen surrounding Gr68a-neurons and is needed for detection of female pheromones (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Park et al., 2006</xref>). While CheB42a mutants are still sensitive to CH503, other families of binding proteins may be used to detect female-specific signals that facilitate the activity of CH503. Lastly, tactile contact might be needed together with chemosensory stimulation. Previously, Kohatsu et al. showed that in <italic>Drosophila</italic>, contact between the male foreleg and female abdomen was necessary to initiate courtship (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kohatsu et al., 2011</xref>). Abdomen contact induced transient activity in the transmidline interneurons of the P1 neuron cluster, a designated ‘command center’ for courtship behavior that integrates input from multiple sensory modalities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Kimura et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kohatsu et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">von Philipsborn et al., 2011</xref>). Information relayed from the upstream targets of Gr68a-expressing neurons could contribute to the silencing of P1 neurons and in this way, lower the probability of sustained courtship behavior. Whether both chemical and tactile cues are mediated by the same receptor or the same cell remains to be determined.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Relevance of Gr68a neuron physiological responses to mating behavior</title><p>The majority of Gr68a neurons responded to CH503 at a 500 ng dose, an amount consistent with the behaviorally active dose. However, the quantity that is transferred to the female during courtship is approximately 60–100 ng based on semi-quantitative mass spectral analysis of recently mated females. Why is there a discrepancy between the amount that is needed for biological activity and the amount that is transferred? It could be that the presence of cVA, another anti-aphrodisiac, reduces the necessity for a large amount of CH503 or that each molecule synergizes the efficacy of the other. Additionally, recent findings indicate that male <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> have adapted to become less sensitive to CH503 to circumvent the courtship inhibitory response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Ng et al., 2014</xref>). While ∼80 ng is sufficient to inhibit male courtship in other non-CH503 producing drosophilid species, <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> males (and males of other species that express CH503) have become less sensitive to the molecule in order to avoid chemical coercion from other males (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Ng et al., 2014</xref>). Thus, it is not surprising that males are not sensitive to the amount of CH503 transferred to females.</p></sec><sec id="s3-4"><title>Gr68a and pickpocket neurons represent two different populations of gustatory pheromone-sensing neurons</title><p>The ion channels ppk23 and ppk25 are expressed in a specialized class of gustatory neurons that were recently shown to be involved in the detection of non-volatile, male- and female-specific cuticular hydrocarbons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Lu et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Thistle et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Toda et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Vijayan et al., 2014</xref>). Though we were able to measure CH503-induced physiological activity from ppk23-expressing neurons on the proboscis and the male foreleg, the responses in the foreleg are not likely to be specific to the natural pheromone since behaviorally inert chemical analogs also caused a change in Ca<sup>2+</sup> flux. It is unclear as well whether the activity of ppk23 and ppk25-expressing neurons contributes to CH503-mediated courtship avoidance since males continue to respond to the pheromone (albeit more weakly) when expression of either channel is suppressed. Since ppk23 neurons co-localize with <italic>fruitless</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Thistle et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Toda et al., 2012</xref>), a master gene that regulates many aspects of courtship behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Yamamoto and Koganezawa, 2013</xref>), whereas Gr68a neurons do not (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s6">Figure 3—figure supplement 6</xref>), it is clear that Gr68a and ppk23 expression will also be in distinct populations of neurons. Based on previous observations that ppk23 neurons respond to both attractive and aversive sex pheromones, we speculate that they function as general detectors for a subset of chemosensory cues rather than encode information about valence.</p></sec><sec id="s3-5"><title>Comparison of the CH503 gustatory circuit to circuits for other tastants and pheromones</title><p>Afferent inputs from Gr-expressing sensory neurons extend to the neuromeres of the TAG and the SEZ in distinct projection patterns (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Kwon et al., 2014</xref>). Are there distinct loci within the SEZ that differentially process food and pheromonal cues? In the olfactory system of the fly, information from fruit and pheromones appears to segregate into distinct regions of the lateral horn of the protocerebrum (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Jefferis et al., 2007</xref>) (though some exceptions have been found, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Ronderos et al., 2014</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Grosjean et al., 2011</xref>). In the SEZ, the distinctions are less clear. The Gr32a, Gr33a, and Gr39a receptors, which are predicted to detect courtship-inhibitory pheromones, overlap with bitter-sensing neurons in the labellum (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Wang et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Weiss et al., 2011</xref>) and have very similar SEZ projection patterns (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Kwon et al., 2014</xref>). In addition, no obvious differences in receptor expression at the periphery have been found between males and females. In contrast, Gr68a expression is specialized for male forelegs, appearing in both gustatory and mechanosensory neuron populations. Expression in females is largely restricted to cells located next to chordotonal organs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Ejima and Griffith, 2008</xref>). Moreover, the Gr68a neuron projection pattern to the TAG appears unique amongst the gustatory receptors, perhaps reflecting its dual role in mechanosensation and chemical detection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Kwon et al., 2014</xref>). Refined analysis of individual afferent processes in the SEZ will allow us to better understand whether the quality and valence of a tastant is encoded at the level of the sensory receptor or transformed within the SEZ and higher order regions. Intriguingly, the AMMC was recently identified as a higher-order processing target for gustatory projection neurons from the SEZ which convey sweet information (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kain and Dahanukar, 2015</xref>). Perhaps some AMMC-projecting neurons may exist for bitter or pheromone-specific information.</p></sec><sec id="s3-6"><title>Central processing of pheromone detection by peptidergic circuits</title><p>The decision to mate involves considerable investment of resources and risk of predation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Daly, 1978</xref>).

TK has been implicated in numerous systemic functions including lipid metabolism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Song et al., 2014</xref>), stress resistance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Kahsai et al., 2010</xref>), and modulation of aggression levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Asahina et al., 2014</xref>).

A single fly from each vial was tested using direct analysis in real time mass spectrometry (DART MS; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Yew et al., 2008</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">2009</xref>]) to check the abundance of the CH503 signal relative to other cuticular hydrocarbons.</p><p>For the tests of CH503 volatility, a 2-layer courtship chamber was constructed with the top layer containing a male and an unperfumed decapitated virgin female and the bottom layer containing filter paper overlaid with 64 μg of (<italic>R</italic>, <italic>Z</italic>, <italic>Z</italic>)-CH503. To prepare female fly extract, 1 or 2 flies were submerged in hexane for 10 min at room temperature, after which the solvent was removed and added to the filter paper.</p><p>The courting pairs % refers to the number of trials in which courtship was observed for longer than one minute divided by the total number of trials. Behavioral assays for perfumed and solvent-perfumed animals were performed in parallel. The courting pairs % was compared between pheromone and solvent-perfumed flies bearing the identical genetic background. Statistical analysis was performed using a Fisher's exact probability test with Yates correction (VassarStats, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.vassarstats.net">www.vassarstats.net</ext-link>). Courtship vigor and latency were calculated for the 30 min observation period and compared using a one-way ANOVA with a Tukey's post-hoc test (SPSS Statistics, IBM, USA).</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Screen for receptor and neural circuits associated with CH503 detection</title><p>Behavioral screens were performed using female targets perfumed with 83 ng/fly of (<italic>S</italic>, <italic>Z</italic>, <italic>Z</italic>)-CH503 or 333 ng/fly dose of (<italic>R</italic>, <italic>Z</italic>, <italic>Z</italic>)-CH503. Both doses were previously established as the minimum necessary for each stereoisomer to elicit significant courtship suppression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Mori et al., 2010</xref>). Transgenic flies were generated using the <italic>Gal4–UAS</italic> system to drive expression of toxin or pro-apoptotic transgenes (<italic>UAS</italic>-<italic>Reaper</italic>, <italic>UAS</italic>-<italic>DTI</italic>, and <italic>UAS-hid</italic>, <italic>stinger</italic>) or transgenes that interfere with synaptic transmission (<italic>UAS</italic>-<italic>Shibire</italic><sup><italic>ts1</italic></sup> and <italic>UAS</italic>–<italic>dORKΔC</italic>). For <italic>Gr-Gal4</italic> lines, <italic>UAS-Reaper</italic> was used since <italic>UAS-DTI</italic> expression led to low basal courtship activity. For central circuit screening, <italic>UAS</italic>-<italic>Shibire</italic><sup><italic>ts1</italic></sup> was used to avoid developmental lethality. For <italic>Gal4</italic> lines in which <italic>UAS</italic>-<italic>Shibir</italic>e<sup><italic>ts1</italic></sup> expression led to paralysis, seizures, or low courtship activity, <italic>UAS</italic>–<italic>dORKΔC</italic> was used as a milder form of neural inhibition. Knockdown of <italic>Gr68a</italic> expression was performed using an RNAi line since the use of other transgenes resulted in larval lethality. Manipulation of neurotransmitter levels was performed using RNAi to target the respective transporters, receptors, or biosynthetic enzymes. See <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl2">Table 2</xref> for a complete list of <italic>Gal4</italic> and <italic>UAS-RNAi</italic> lines used for screening.</p><p>For experiments involving temperature-sensitive transgenes (<italic>UAS-Shibire</italic><sup><italic>ts1</italic></sup> and <italic>UAS-dTrpA1</italic>), flies were placed in a humidity-controlled incubator at 29°C for 2 hr prior to the assay to activate the transgene. Courtship chambers were placed on a hotplate pre-warmed to 29°C, during which time the flies were introduced into each chamber. The chamber was placed in an incubator at 29°C and the temperature was monitored throughout the assay. Control experiments were carried out in parallel at 23°C (for assays using <italic>UAS-Shibire</italic><sup><italic>ts1</italic></sup>) or 19°C (for assays using <italic>UAS-dTrpA1</italic>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Proboscis extension reflex assay</title><p>The proboscis extension reflex (PER) assay was performed as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Lacaille et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Shiraiwa and Carlson, 2007</xref>). Virgin 1-day-old male and female flies were starved for 36 hr in a vial containing tissue soaked with water. Flies were mounted with nail polish on the dorsal side onto glass slides and placed in a humidified Petri dish for at least 2 hr prior to the assay. Paper wicks coated in 20 μl of a test solution were used for bilateral stimulation of the tarsi of mounted flies. One leg was touched with a paper wick soaked in 4% sucrose (in distilled H<sub>2</sub>O, wt/vol) while the second leg was simultaneously stimulated with one of the following solutions: (i) 4% sucrose, (ii) 25–100 μg/ml (<italic>R</italic>, <italic>Z</italic>, <italic>Z</italic>)-CH503 in hexane, (iii) 0.25–25 μg/ml (<italic>S</italic>, <italic>Z</italic>, <italic>Z</italic>)-CH503 in hexane, and (iv) 100 mM caffeine in dH<sub>2</sub>O. Each substance was tested three times with a 2 min rest between stimulations. A response was counted as positive when the fly extended its proboscis for at least 2 of 3 stimulations. The response to each substance was compared to the response induced by 4% sucrose alone using a Fisher's exact probability test. The assays were carried out at the same time each day, and the experimenter was blind to the identity and concentration of stimulants tested in the assay.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Immunohistochemistry</title><p>Adult <italic>Drosophila</italic> brains and thoracic ganglia from 6- to 10-day-old virgin flies were dissected in phosphate buffered-saline with 0.3% Triton X-100, pH 7.2 (PBST) and fixed in ice-cold 4% paraformaldehyde for 25 min. Samples were washed three times, for 15 min each in PBST, treated in a blocking solution containing PBST and 10% normal goal serum for 30 min at room temperature, and incubated in primary antibody solution. After three washes in PBST, the tissues were incubated overnight at 4°C in secondary antibody solution. Following three washes in PBST, the brains were mounted on glass slides with Vectashield mounting medium (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA). Images were acquired on a Zeiss LSM 510 Meta inverted microscope equipped with 488, 543, and 633 nm lasers. For all tissues, 132 frames with a z step size of 0.46 μm were acquired.

A live fly was immobilized on a 0.17-mm coverslip with nail polish (Sally Hansen, USA). 10 µl of PBST were placed onto the tarsal segments using a pipette, after which three pre-stimulation images were acquired for a total duration of 2.4 s. For each measurement, 117 post stimulation images were acquired for a total duration of 93.6 s immediately after the addition of 10 µl of the natural stereoisomer of CH503, (<italic>R</italic>, <italic>Z</italic>, <italic>Z</italic>)-CH503 (final concentrations of 50 or 500 ng in PBST). Identical conditions were used for measurements using (<italic>S</italic>, <italic>Z</italic>, <italic>Z</italic>)-CH503. No reflux flow is used in the sample preparation. Control stimulants consisted of 10 µl of solvent or an analog of CH503: (<italic>S</italic>)-3-Acetoxy-19-octacosen-1-ol (50 ng, final concentration) or (<italic>R</italic>)-3-Acetoxy-11, 19-octacosadiyn-1-ol (500 ng, final concentration). The analogs were previously established to be behaviorally inert (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Shikichi et al., 2013</xref>). Images were acquired on a spinning disk confocal microscope (Ti-E; Nikon Instruments, Melville, USA) equipped with a CSU-X1 scan head (Yokogawa Electric, Tokyo, JA) and either a digital sCMOS camera (ORCA-Flash4.0; Hamamatsu Photonics, Shizuoka, JA) or a cooled CCD camera (CoolSNAP HQ2; Photometrics, Tucson, USA) using a 60×/1.4 N.A. oil objective lens. A 491 nm laser was used to excite the GCaMP5 reporter. Four Z-slices with a thickness of 0.5 µm each were acquired every 800 ms, for a total of 120 frames.</p><p>To calculate the maximum change in fluorescence signal (∆F/F), the signal density over the whole cell body was divided by the signal from an equivalent volume of an adjacent region (background). Confocal Z-stacks were analyzed using ImageJ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Schneider et al., 2012</xref>). For <italic>Gr68a-Gal4</italic>-labeled neurons, ∆F/F was calculated from single neurons. For <italic>ppk23-Gal4</italic>-labeled neurons on the foreleg, ∆F/F was calculated from the total signal from either two adjacent cell bodies or the base of the axon projections. Due to their close proximity to each other, some individual cell bodies could not be differentiated. In some experiments, the maximum ∆F/F occurred in projections though it could not be discerned from which cell body the projection originated. For proboscis measurements, ∆F/F represents the averaged values from 14 cells (for CH503 stimulation) or 20 cells (for PBST stimulation), measured from 5–6 flies. For all measurements, the averaged, normalized response to the stimulant vs the averaged, normalized response to control solvent was compared using a Student's <italic>t</italic>-test for equal or unequal variances (Vassar Stats). Comparison of variance was determined with an F-Test (Vassar Stats). Statistical power analysis was performed using G*Power 3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Faul et al., 2007</xref>).</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We thank O Alekseenko, S Certel, YB Chan, YN Chiang, J Chin, A Claridge-Chang, E Dion, TW Koh, P Rothemund, and SH Ng for helpful suggestions and critical comments on the manuscript.

Your article has been favorably evaluated by a Senior editor and three reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors.</p><p>The following individuals responsible for the peer review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Leslie Griffith (Reviewing editor); Aki Ejima (peer reviewer). A further reviewer remains anonymous.</p><p>The Reviewing editor and the other two reviewers discussed their comments before we reached this decision, and the Reviewing editor has assembled the following comments to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>This paper describes a receptor and a neuronal circuit for the detection of the male contact pheromone CH503 and provides an important advance for our understanding of the influence of gustatory pheromones on courtship behavior. For the most part the experiments are clear and the data are convincing. Several issues need to be addressed before this paper is suitable for publication.</p><p>1) Calcium imaging data. N is too low to give the reader any confidence that the conclusions drawn are robust. Simply looking at the high variability in these measurements makes it clear that N must be quite a bit higher to have the statistical power to make a conclusion. For instance, the data on the female foreleg in 3D look qualitatively similar to the male foreleg. The lack of statistical significance is likely due to low and N and it is disingenuous to suggest that this means females “do not detect” CH503. They clearly have responses that are equal in magnitude to males in T2. N has to be substantially increased and an a priori power test should be done to determine what N needs to be. Additionally, the doses/sources of pheromone used on males and females absolutely must be the same. It is completely inappropriate to conclude females do not respond if you do not use an effective dose of CH503.</p><p>2) RNAi experiments. There are a lot of RNAi lines used and their effectiveness needs to be demonstrated or references to studies that validate them provided. This is especially crucial with regard to negative results such as those shown for NPF-RNAi. Concluding that this peptide is not required based on a line that is not shown to reduce NPF immunoreactivity is not a very strong argument without the appropriate control experiment. An additional independent NPF-RNAi would also strengthen the case.</p><p>3) Circuit. The actual nature of the circuit is not clear. The authors posit a direct connection between Gr68a neurons and NFP-positive cells. Are these also TK-positive cells? Are there synaptic connections between Gr68a neurons and TK neurons? Are there functional connections?

The authors need to acknowledge the potential complexity of the interaction if they cannot provide this type of evidence.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.06914.035</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>1) Calcium imaging data. N is too low to give the reader any confidence that the conclusions drawn are robust</italic>.</p><p>We thank the reviewers for raising the important issue of statistical power and sample size. For male imaging experiments with CH503, the sample size has been increased, and now ranges from 4-17 cells for each cell and each dose (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). Sample size for each cell is indicated in the figure. In addition, we have performed statistical power tests for the experiments using 50 and 500 ng CH503. For the male trials, the sample size was sufficient to reach the commonly accepted power level of 0.8 (Cohen, 1988) for a significance level of 0.05 for almost all of the cells. There were 2 exceptions: For Cell h, 500 ng dose and Cell c, 50 ng dose. For the former, a sample size of 201 is needed. For the latter, a sample size of 47 is needed. We have added statistical power to the figure legend and note the two instances which are underpowered.</p><p><italic>Simply looking at the high variability in these measurements makes it clear that N must be quite a bit higher to have the statistical power to make a conclusion. For instance, the data on the female foreleg in 3D look qualitatively similar to the male foreleg. The lack of statistical significance is likely due to low and N and it is disingenuous to suggest that this means females “do not detect” CH503. They clearly have responses that are equal in magnitude to males in T2. N has to be substantially increased and an a priori power test should be done to determine what N needs to be. Additionally, the doses/sources of pheromone used on males and females absolutely must be the same. It is completely inappropriate to conclude females do not respond if you do not use an effective dose of CH503</italic>.</p><p>In the original figure, the more potent (<italic>S,Z,Z</italic>)-CH503 stereoisomer was used to stimulate the female leg (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>) whereas the figure for the male leg (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>) showed response to the (<italic>R,Z,Z</italic>)-CH503 stereoisomer. The proper comparison should have been between <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3–figure supplement 2</xref> in the original manuscript. When the responses of males and females to (<italic>S,Z,Z</italic>)-CH503 are compared, it is evident that response from males is 3-5X higher than that of females.</p><p>Nevertheless, we acknowledge that the data are presented in a confusing way and that it is more appropriate to compare male to female response with the natural (<italic>R,Z,Z</italic>)-CH503 isomer. We have now replaced the previous <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref> with data from female imaging experiments using 2 doses of (<italic>R,Z,Z</italic>)-CH503 at 50 and 500 ng. The sample size for each cell from both male and female experiments has been increased. Statistical power of at least 0.8 is achieved for most of the cells. For Cells j and s, we would have needed at least n=100. We acknowledge that the findings for cells j and s are underpowered in the figure legend.</p><p>With respect to the female response to the pheromone, nowhere in the manuscript do we state that females “do not detect CH503”. Indeed, we fully concur that it would be disingenuous to make such a strong statement given the limited sensitivity of the PER and physiological assays. Rather, we are careful to state that females “do not exhibit a change in PER” and that it is possible females “do not perceive CH503 as an aversive tastant”. With respect to calcium imaging, we state that “In females, the responses to the pheromone from the forelegs were indistinguishable from that of the solvent control”. We note that in the text and figure legend that in the case of Cells j and s, this might be due to lack of adequate sample size. Given that females do not exhibit significant responses using both a behavioral and physiological assay, we can conclude that females do not respond robustly to CH503 in the context of these experiments and within the limits of these assays.</p><p><italic>2) RNAi experiments. There are a lot of RNAi lines used and their effectiveness needs to be demonstrated or references to studies that validate them provided. This is especially crucial with regard to negative results such as those shown for NPF-RNAi. Concluding that this peptide is not required based on a line that is not shown to reduce NPF immunoreactivity is not a very strong argument without the appropriate control experiment. An additional independent NPF-RNAi would also strengthen the case</italic>.</p><p>We have measured <italic>NPF</italic> transcript levels in controls and RNAi knockdown animals (<italic>elav&gt;NPF</italic><sup><italic>RNAi</italic></sup><italic>)</italic> using quantitative PCR and find a 5.3-fold decrease of transcript levels in the knockdown animals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s4">Figure 4–figure supplement 4</xref>). We cannot exclude the possibility that a stronger knockdown might be needed to elicit a phenotype. However, since a 1.5 – 2 fold change of mRNA levels is considered well-repressed in the literature, it appears that the RNAi line is effective in inhibiting <italic>NPF</italic> transcription. Taken together with our findings that knockdown of the NPF receptor also had no effect on CH503 sensitivity, it is not likely that the NPF peptide is a major contributor to processing of CH503 information.</p><p>We thank the reviewers for indicating that a reduction in immunoreactivity might not be observable. It is interesting and helpful to learn this. We performed qPCR rather than immunostaining to characterize the RNAi effect. While mRNA levels may not necessarily correlate with peptide levels, quantification by qPCR provides greater target specificity than an antibody. In addition, by quantifying transcript from whole brain tissue, we avoid potential artifacts and inaccuracies that can result from the method of counting immunopositive cells (e.g., different numbers are obtained depending on whether whole brain or slices are used). Immunostaining may also not be sensitive enough to allow slight but significant differences in signal intensity to be detected.</p><p>With respect to the efficacy of Gr68a and TK RNAi lines, we use multiple genetic methods to confirm the phenotype initially observed with RNAi. For Gr68a, we regenerated a mutant by homologous recombination and show that the mutant phenocopies the Gr68a&gt;RNAi flies in courtship behavior (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>), PER assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>), and physiological measures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). Furthermore, the behavioral phenotype is rescued upon replacement of the <italic>Gr68a</italic> gene in the mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). Regarding tachykinin, the TK&gt;RNAi phenotype is phenocopied with TK&gt;hid flies (in which TK-expressing cells are ablated), and 2 TK mutant alleles and the transheterozygote (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>). The phenotype is rescued in the TK mutant alleles upon ectopic expression of the <italic>TK</italic> gene.</p><p>With respect to small neurotransmitter RNAi lines used in the <italic>c929</italic> screen (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4–figure supplement 3</xref>), we now include data showing results from behavioral assays using a second RNAi line or other RNAi lines that target the recycling, transport, or receptor of each small neurotransmitter system:</p><p><underline>A)</underline> <italic>Octopamine</italic>: 2 TbH-RNAi lines and 3 octopamine mushroom body receptor (OAMB-RNAi lines).</p><p>B)<italic>Acetylcholine</italic>: vesicular acetylcholine transporter (VAChT-RNAi) and choline acetyltransferase (Cha-RNAi).</p><p>C) <italic>Serotonin</italic>: neural-specific tyrosine decarboxylase (Tdc2-RNAi) and serotonin transporter (SERT-RNAi).</p><p>D) <italic>GABA</italic>: metabotropic GABA receptor subtype 1, 2, and 3-RNAi (2 lines used for subtype 3), vesicular GABA transporter (VGAT-RNAi, 2 different lines) and glutamate decarboxylase (Gad1-RNAi).</p><p>E) <italic>Dopamine</italic>: 2 Dopamine 1-like receptor-RNAi (Dop1R1- and Dop1R2-RNAi), dopamine transporter (DAT-RNAi) and tyrosine hydroxylase (TH-RNAi).</p><p>By using multiple RNAi lines, overlapping cell populations relevant to each neurotransmitter system are targeted. All results were consistently negative. We cannot eliminate the possibility that some of these neurotransmitters may play a role in CH503 detection. It is well known that co-expression of peptides and aminergic transmitters within the same cells play an important role in many circuits. However, within the scope of the paper, we focused on two peptidergic systems whose manipulation yielded the most robust phenotype. Synergistic actions between small molecules and peptides within behavioral circuits is an important and fascinating topic for future studies.</p><p><italic>3) Circuit. The actual nature of the circuit is not clear. The authors posit a direct connection between Gr68a neurons and NFP-positive cells. Are these also TK-positive cells? Are there synaptic connections between Gr68a neurons and TK neurons? Are there functional connections? GRASP and/or functional imaging or even some better immunohistochemistry with anti-TK to show where those cells are with respect to the Gr68a terminals would be helpful along with a more precise and clear explanation of the model</italic>.</p><p>Thank you for these suggestions. We have attempted to clarify the nature of the circuit by adding the following data:</p><p>A) Immunocytochemistry showing TK expression in close proximity to Gr68a synaptic terminals in the SEZ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>).</p><p>B) GRASP experiments using <italic>TK-LexA</italic> and <italic>Gr68a-Gal4</italic> show reconstituted GFP (and hence, synaptic connectivity) in the SEZ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>).</p><p>C) Triple-labeling experiments showing the overlap of NPF, TK, and the <italic>c929-Gal4</italic> circuit in the SEZ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). We examined 15 brains and noted fly-to-fly variation. 3-5 triple labeled cells were most commonly found. We provide images and histograms depicting the variation in labeling.</p><p>D) Behavioral experiments showing that rescue of TK using the <italic>c929</italic> driver in a TK mutant background is sufficient to rescue the pheromone response. TK and <italic>c929</italic> overlap in 8-10 cells in the SEZ, several of which are also NPF-positive. (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>).</p><p>Taken together, TK appears to be the primary circuit through which information from Gr68a is relayed to the central brain. Interestingly, the TK circuit overlaps with <italic>NPF-Gal4</italic> in the SEZ and protocerebrum. This overlap would explain why inhibition of the NPF circuit (but not NPF peptide) also interferes with CH503 pheromone perception.</p><p><italic>4) In vivo relevance of dosages of CH503.There needs to be at least a discussion of the levels of CH503 present on females during normal courtship and how this relates to dosages used in this study</italic>.</p><p>The CH503 dose that is behaviorally active matches the dose that activates 6/9 of the Gr68a neurons. However, the amount that is transferred to the female during courtship is approx. 60-100 ng based on semi-quantitative mass spectral analysis of recently mated females. Why is there a discrepancy between the amount that is needed for biological activity and the amount that is transferred? It could be that the presence of cVA, another anti-aphrodisiac, reduces the necessity for a large amount of 503 or that each molecule synergizes the efficacy of the other. Additionally, recent work has shown that male <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> have adapted to become less sensitive to CH503 to circumvent the courtship inhibitory response (Ng et al., 2014a). In this paper, it was shown that ∼80 ng of CH503 was sufficient for inhibition in other non-503 producing drosophilid species. However, <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> males (and males of other species that express CH503) have become less sensitive to the molecule, probably as a strategy to avoid chemical coercion by rival males. Thus, it is not surprising that males are not sensitive to the amount of CH503 found on females. We have added a discussion on the relevance of the dosages (in the subsection headed “Interaction of CH503 with Gr68a”).</p><p><italic>5) Exact nature of the CH503/Gr68a interaction. The behavioral and genetic results are consistent with a direct receptor/ligand interaction, but without heterologous expression of Gr68a and demonstration of direct effects of CH503, it is still possible that the interaction is more complex (especially in light of the requirement for it to be presented on a female to be effective). The authors need to acknowledge the potential complexity of the interaction if they cannot provide this type of evidence</italic>.</p><p>We add a brief discussion that addresses the necessity of a secondary cue derived from female cuticles or a lipid binding protein, which has been shown for other pheromone receptors (in the subsection headed “A dual sensory role for Gr68a in courtship initiation”). We speculate also that mechano- and chemosensory cues are detected by the same Gr68a cells. Exploring the nature of the ligand-receptor interaction and assessing the response of Gr68 neurons to mechanosensory stimulation will be an important future direction. However, given that no crystal structure is available for gustatory receptors nor successful heterologous expression (to our knowledge), our speculation on the nature of the ligand-receptor interaction is limited.</p></body></sub-article></article>
