These structures are essential for development of many tissues and organs; however, their function in adult tissues, particularly neurons in the brain, remains largely unknown. Tau tubulin kinase 2 (TTBK2) is a critical regulator of ciliogenesis, and is also mutated in a hereditary neurodegenerative disorder, spinocerebellar ataxia type 11 (SCA11). Here, we show that conditional knockout of <italic>Ttbk2</italic> in adult mice results in degenerative cerebellar phenotypes that recapitulate aspects of SCA11 including motor coordination deficits and defects to Purkinje cell (PC) integrity. We also find that the <italic>Ttbk2</italic> conditional mutant mice quickly lose cilia throughout the brain. We show that conditional knockout of the key ciliary trafficking gene <italic>Ift88</italic> in adult mice results in nearly identical cerebellar phenotypes to those of the <italic>Ttbk2</italic> knockout, indicating that disruption of ciliary signaling is a key driver of these phenotypes. Our data suggest that primary cilia play an integral role in maintaining the function of PCs in the adult cerebellum and reveal novel insights into mechanisms involved in neurodegeneration.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><title>eLife digest</title><p>Many mammalian cells have a single hair-like structure, known as the primary cilium that projects away from the surface of the cell. This small projection from the membrane regulates many signaling pathways, particularly during embryonic development. However, most of the neurons in the adult brain also have primary cilia, and it is not yet understood what the role of the primary cilium has in maintaining most adult tissues.</p><p>The primary cilium needs the protein TTBK2 to assemble, and mutations in the gene that codes for this protein cause a neurodegenerative disorder that first appears in adulthood known as spinocerebral ataxia type 11 (SCA11). People with this disease have a movement disorder caused by the loss of neurons called Purkinje cells in the cerebellum. In 2018, researchers showed that mutated versions of TTBK2 associated with SCA11 interfere with the role of normal TTBK2 in assembling the cilium. But it was unclear whether primary cilia are required for the survival of Purkinje cells in the cerebellum.</p><p>Now, Bowie and Goetz (who are two of the researchers that conducted the 2018 study) have found that deleting the gene that codes for TTBK2 in the brain of adult mice leads to the loss of cilia, followed by impaired movement. Additionally, the connections between Purkinje cells and other neurons are lost, and Purkinje cells eventually degenerate and die. If the cilia are removed using a different mechanism, the results are the same, showing for the first time that primary cilia are important to keep Purkinje cells alive and connected to other neurons.</p><p>These results shed light on the roles of primary cilia within adult tissues, and provide insight into the mechanisms underlying SCA11, a neurodegenerative disease for which no treatment currently exists. In the future, it will be important to extend the results of this study to other types of neurons affected in different neurodegenerative conditions. Ultimately, this line of research could lead to uncovering the causes of certain neurodegenerative disorders and provide new paths to treatment.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>primary cilia</kwd><kwd>neurodegeneration</kwd><kwd>cerebellum</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R00 HD076444</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Goetz</surname><given-names>Sarah C</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100002243</institution-id><institution>National Ataxia Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Young Investigator award</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Goetz</surname><given-names>Sarah C</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Signaling at the primary cilium is important to sustain the morphology, connectivity, and survival of a key neural population within the brain.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Primary cilia are organelles that serve as compartments that mediate and integrate essential signaling pathways, including Hedgehog (HH) signaling. Because of their critical roles in developmental signaling pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Goetz and Anderson, 2010</xref>), disruptions to cilium assembly, structure, or function are associated with a number of hereditary developmental syndromes, collectively termed ciliopathies. Among the more common pathologies associated with ciliopathy are a variety of neurological deficits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Reiter and Leroux, 2017</xref>). During development, ciliary signals drive proliferation and patterning of neural progenitor populations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Guemez-Gamboa et al., 2014</xref>). Cilia then persist on post-mitotic neurons through adulthood (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Sterpka and Chen, 2018</xref>). However, we have only a limited understanding of the roles for primary cilia on differentiated, post-mitotic neurons, particularly within the adult brain.</p><p>Newly emerging evidence suggests that cilia and ciliary signaling are important in adult neurons: Cilia are required for the establishment of synaptic connectivity in hippocampal dentate granule neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Kumamoto et al., 2012</xref>) and in striatal interneurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Guo et al., 2017</xref>). Neuronal cilia also concentrate a wide array of G-protein coupled receptorsÂ (GPCRs) and other neuropeptide and neurotrophin receptors that are important for complex neurological functions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Berbari et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Domire et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Green et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Guadiana et al., 2016</xref>). Defects in cilia structure have also been observed in patient samples and animal models of several neurodegenerative and neuropsychiatric conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chakravarthy et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Dhekne et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Keryer et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">MuÃ±oz-Estrada et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>We previously showed that Tau tubulin kinase 2 (TTBK2), a kinase causally mutated in the hereditary neurodegenerative disorder spinocerebellar ataxia type 11 (SCA11) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Houlden et al., 2007</xref>), is an essential regulator of ciliogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Goetz et al., 2012</xref>). These mutations are frameshift-causing indels that result in premature truncation of TTBK2 atÂ ~AA 450. SCA11 is characterized by aÂ loss of Purkinje cells (PC) in the cerebellum, causing ataxia and other motor coordination deficits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Houlden et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Seidel et al., 2012</xref>). Recently, we demonstrated that SCA11-associated alleles of <italic>Ttbk2</italic> act as dominant negatives, causing defects in cilium assembly, stability, and function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bowie et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>Given the association between the SCA11-associated truncations of TTBK2 and ciliary dysfunction, we set out to test whether loss of TTBK2 function within the adult brain is associated with degeneration of cerebellar neurons. The cerebellum is the region of the brain responsible for controlling motor coordination, learning, and other cognitive functions. The development and morphogenesis of the cerebellum depends on primary cilia, which are critical for expansion of granule neuron progenitors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chizhikov et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Spassky et al., 2008</xref>). PCs, granule neurons, and interneurons, as well as Bergmann glia (BG), are ciliated in the adult cerebellum as well as during development. However, the roles of cilia and ciliary signaling in the adult cerebellum are unknown.</p><p>In this study, we show that global conditional knockout of <italic>Ttbk2</italic> during adulthood as well as genetic targeting of cilia using <italic>Ift88</italic> conditional knockout mice, cause similar degenerative changes to cerebellar connectivity. These cellular changes are accompanied by motor coordination phenotypes in the mice. We demonstrate that loss of <italic>Ttbk2</italic> and cilia leads to altered intracellular Ca<sup>++</sup> in PCs, loss of VGLUT2+ synapses on PC dendrites, and general dysfunction of these cells. We provide strong evidence that primary cilia and ciliary signals are important for maintaining connectivity of specific neurons within the brain, and we demonstrate that dysfunction of primary cilia can cause or contribute to neurodegeneration within the mammalian brain.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Loss of <italic>Ttbk2</italic> from the adult brain causes SCA-like cerebellar phenotypes</title><p>Mutations within <italic>TTBK2</italic> cause the adult-onset, neurodegenerative disease SCA11. However, the etiology of SCA11 is poorly defined. SCA11 is somewhat unusual among SCAs, in part because the reported causal mutations are base pair insertions or deletions within the coding region of <italic>TTBK2</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Houlden et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Johnson et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Lindquist et al., 2017</xref>), rather than the expansion of CAG repeats, which is the genetic cause of most SCA subtypes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Hersheson et al., 2012</xref>).

Using this model, we induce recombination of <italic>Ttbk2</italic> in all tissues of the mouse, including the brain, upon injection with tamoxifen (TMX). Because morphogenesis of the mouse cerebellum is complete by P21Â (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Marzban et al., 2014</xref>), we chose this time to begin our TMX injections. For all of our experiments, Control animals are either siblings with the same genotype (<italic>Ttbk2<sup>fl/fl</sup>;Ubc-Cre-ERT2</italic><sup>+</sup>) injected with oil vehicle only, or <italic>Ttbk2<sup>fl/fl</sup>;Ubc-Cre-ERT2<sup>-</sup></italic> sibling mice injected with the same dose of TMX.

SCA11 pathology is associated with degeneration of the cerebellar neurons. We therefore examined the architecture and connectivity of neurons within the cerebellum to assess whether the Ttbk2<sup>c.mut</sup> animals exhibited phenotypes similar to those described for mouse models of other subtypes of SCA. Within the cerebellum, PCs are the major source of functional neuronal output, and receive excitatory inputs primarily from parallel fibers and climbing fibers. Parallel fibers extend from the granule neurons, a population of densely packed neurons found directly beneath PCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Ichikawa et al., 2016</xref>). Climbing fibers extend from neurons of the Inferior Olivary Nuclei (ION) in the medulla (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Kano et al., 2018</xref>). These connections are essential for PC function, and dysfunction or loss of these connections, particularly the VGLUT2+ excitatory synapses from the climbing fibers, has been shown in various mouse models of SCA to be linked to pathology and disease progression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Duvick et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Ebner et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Furrer et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Smeets and Verbeek, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Smeets et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>To assess the changes throughout Ttbk2<sup>c.mut</sup> cerebella, we looked at the different layers of the cerebellar folia.

Additionally, Ttbk2<sup>c.mut</sup> animals injected with tamoxifen beginning at P45 exhibit the same loss of VGLUT2+ synapses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1âfigure supplement 3A-B</xref>), showing that loss of TTBK2 after all connections and development of the cerebellum are complete, leads to degeneration of these synapses. We confirmed that this loss of VGLUT2 synapses was not caused by loss of dendritic spines, withÂ useÂ of a Golgi stain to view individual dendrites and spines on Ttbk2<sup>c.mut</sup> PCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F,G</xref>; 1.236 Â±Â 0.22 spines per Î¼m for Control vs. 1.368 Â±Â 0.32 spines per Î¼m for Ttbk2<sup>c.mut</sup>).</p><p>To further explore the role of TTBK2 in PC function, we examined calcium receptor abundance in these neurons.

Within this network inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptors (IP3Rs) are key calcium channel regulators needed for calcium release from the surroundingÂ endoplasmic reticulumÂ (ER) throughout the PC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Sarkisov and Wang, 2008</xref>). Precise regulation of IP3R activity is critical, and a balance of calcium channel release is imperative to the overall function of the cerebellum. Mutations in the IP3R1 gene have been linked to SCA15 and SCA29, while overexpression of IP3R1 underlies phenotypes within SCA2 and SCA3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Tada et al., 2016</xref>). BecauseÂ of these links to other SCA-related phenotypes, we therefore examined IP3R expression throughout the Ttbk2<sup>c.mut</sup> animals. We found that levels of IP3R in PCs are reduced in Ttbk2<sup>c.mut</sup> compared to Controls starting at P45, with expression strongly reduced throughout the PCs 3 months after TMX (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1H</xref>). Thus, like mouse models of other SCA subtypes, the PCs of Ttbk2<sup>c.mut</sup> animals exhibit defects in calcium modulation consistent with dysfunction of these cells.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Loss of <italic>Ttbk2</italic> causes changes to ION neurons and BG</title><p>Next, we tested whether loss of <italic>Ttbk2</italic> affects other cell types linked to the pathology of SCA, in addition to the PCs. Climbing fibers extend from neurons of the inferior olivary nucleus (ION) in the medulla. These fibers traverse the brain stem, enter the cerebellar cortex, and innervate the PC dendrites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Watanabe and Kano, 2011</xref>). AsÂ we saw a reduction of the VGLUT2+ synaptic terminals between these climbing fibers and PC dendrites, we examined the soma of the ION neurons from which these climbing fibers extend. In several subtypes of SCA, including SCA1, 2, 3, 6, and 7 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Seidel et al., 2012</xref>), the pathology of the disorder is characterized in part by the loss of ION soma; a characteristic also observed in mouse models of these diseases. Neurons within the ION can be identified by dual expression of Calbindin and NeuN in the medial ventral region of the medulla (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2âfigure supplement 1A,B</xref>). When we looked at this population of neurons, we did not notice a loss of these cells. However, we did find that the perikarya of the neurons within the ION were smaller in Ttbk2<sup>c.mut</sup> animals compared to Controls. We therefore used NeuN to label the perikarya of neurons within the ION and measured the area of the somata of ION neurons, and found a significant reduction in the area of ION neuron soma in Ttbk2<sup>c.mut</sup> mice at 4 months of age compared to Controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A,B</xref>; 180.4 Î¼m<sup>2</sup> Â±Â 1.93 for Control vs. 109 Î¼m<sup>2</sup> Â±Â 1.01 for Ttbk2<sup>c.mut</sup>).

Our previous work shows that IFT88 functions downstream of TTBK2 in cilium initiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Goetz et al., 2012</xref>), with TTBK2 being required for IFT recruitment. In the developing and postnatal brain, IFT88 is important for cilia structure in the hippocampus and cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Willaredt et al., 2008</xref>) and when knocked out in these specific neuron populations results in memory deficits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Berbari et al., 2014</xref>). Additionally, <italic>Ift88</italic> null mutants exhibit nearly identical embryonic phenotypes to those of <italic>Ttbk2</italic> null mutants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Murcia et al., 2000</xref>). When we knocked out <italic>Ift88</italic> using the same approach described for Ttbk2<sup>c.mut</sup> animals, we observed that the numbers of cilia were significantly reduced in Ift88<sup>c.mut</sup> cerebella at 3 months post TMX treatment, although more cilia remain in Ift88<sup>c.mut</sup> cerebella compared to the Ttbk2<sup>c.mut</sup> animals with the same treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A,C</xref>; 17.31 cilia per 32 mm<sup>2</sup> field Â±Â 0.65 for Control vs. 12.13 cilia per 32 mm<sup>2</sup> field Â±Â 0.50 for Ift88<sup>c.mut</sup>). Western blot analysis of cerebellar tissue from Ift88<sup>c.mut</sup> mice reveals that a small amount of IFT88 protein perdures in brain tissue (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>). This could, in part, help to explain why we do not see a full loss of cilia throughout the cerebellum similar to that observed in the Ttbk2<sup>c.mut</sup> mice. Regardless, the cilia that do remain in Ift88<sup>c.mut</sup> animals are shorter in length than Controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>; 2.31 Î¼m Â±Â 0.10 for Control vs. 1.70 Î¼m Â±Â 0.08 for Ift88<sup>c.mut</sup>).</p><fig id="fig6" position="float"><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><title>Ift88<sup>c.mut</sup> have fewer, shorter cilia throughout the cerebellum and mislocalization of ciliary membrane markers.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Representative images illustrating cilia loss in the cerebellum of Ift88<sup>c.mut</sup> animals, immunostained for ARL13B to label cilia (red), PericentrinÂ (PCNT) to label centrosomes (green) and nuclei (blue) Scale barÂ =Â 20 Î¼m.

We observed that within the WT cerebellum, there exist cilia that are AC3+ as well as AC3+/ARL13B+ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E</xref>, arrowhead, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6F</xref>).

This analysis suggests that IFT88 is required forlocalization of specific signaling molecules such as AC3 to neuronal primary cilia throughout the cerebellum.</p><p>We then examined cerebellar structure and circuitry in Ift88<sup>c.mut</sup> animals. Similar to our findings in Ttbk2<sup>c.mut</sup> animals, no changes to PC number were evident at 3 months post TMX treatment. Molecular layer thickness was reduced in Ift88<sup>c.mut</sup> animals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A,B</xref>; 182.3 Î¼m Â±Â 2.5 in Control vs. 169.3 Î¼m Â±Â 3.04 in Ift88<sup>c.mut</sup>).

We also tested Ift88<sup>c.mut</sup> animals on the rotarod performance test to uncover any motor coordination deficits, given that these mice exhibit similar cellular changes to those of the Ttbk2<sup>c.mut</sup> animals. These tests revealed that Ift88<sup>c.mut</sup> animals also have a shorter latency to fall time on the steady speed rotarod performance test, but not on the accelerating rotarod performance test (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D,E</xref>), while Ttbk2<sup>c.mut</sup> animals have a shorter latency to fall time on both accelerating and steady speed rotarod performance tests (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A,B</xref>). Steady speed rotarod analysis is thought to more accurately detect motor coordination deficits, while the accelerating rotarod test can also be affected by mouse fatigue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Monville et al., 2006</xref>). Taken together, these data show that loss of IFT88 from the adult brain results in impaired ciliary structure and similar defects in cerebellar architecture and locomotor behavior to those observed in the animals lacking TTBK2.</p><fig id="fig7" position="float"><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><title>Loss of IFT88 recapitulates neurodegenerative phenotypes of Ttbk2<sup>c.mut</sup> animals.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Cerebellar tissue from Control and Ift88<sup>c.mut</sup> mice at 3Â months after loss of <italic>Ift88</italic>, immunostained for Calbindin to label Purkinje cells (red) and VGLUT2 to show climbing fiber synapses (green).

We showed that TTBK2 is essential for maintaining the connectivity and viability of PCs in the adult cerebellum. These phenotypes are similar to those reported for mouse models of other subtypes of SCA as well as consistent with many aspects of SCA11 in human patients, suggesting that the Ttbk2<sup>c.mut</sup> mice model the human condition. We further demonstratedÂ that mice conditionally lacking the ciliary protein IFT88 in adult tissues exhibit highly similar neurodegenerative phenotypes to those observed in the Ttbk2<sup>c.mut</sup> mice, including loss of excitatory synapses from the climbing fibers and the eventual loss of PCs. The high degree of convergence of these phenotypes suggests that the neural degenerative phenotypes of the Ttbk2<sup>c.mut</sup> mice are driven primarily by the requirement for TTBK2 in mediating cilium assembly, and points to a critical role for these organelles in maintaining neuronal function during adulthood.</p><p>Cilia and ciliary signals play a variety of important roles during embryonic and postnatal development of the brain and central nervous system. Cilia are linked to processes including the expansion and patterning of neural progenitors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Guemez-Gamboa et al., 2014</xref>), the migration and laminar placement of interneurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Higginbotham et al., 2012</xref>), and in the establishment of neuronal morphology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Guadiana et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Sarkisian and Guadiana, 2015</xref>). Consistent with the varied roles of cilia in neural development, an array of neurological deficits are among the most common hallmarks of ciliopathies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Lee and Gleeson, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Youn and Han, 2018</xref>), highlighting the importance of these organelles in human health. In addition to their critical developmental functions, mounting evidence supports an important role for ciliary signaling in tissue regeneration and homeostasis in adult organs, including the kidneys (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Davenport et al., 2007</xref>), skin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Croyle et al., 2011</xref>), skeletal muscle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Kopinke et al., 2017</xref>), and bone (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Moore et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>Within the adult CNS, dysfunction of ciliary trafficking is linked to retinal degeneration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Wheway et al., 2014</xref>). Degeneration of photoreceptors is a feature of many human ciliopathies as well as mouse models of these disorders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Braun and Hildebrandt, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bujakowska et al., 2017</xref>), and occurs as trafficking within the photoreceptor outer segments (the modified cilium) fails. This results in accumulation of rhodopsin within the cell body and leads to death of the photoreceptor neurons through mechanisms that are not completely understood (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Seo and Datta, 2017</xref>). Within the brain, conditional loss of the ciliary protein ARL13B from mouse striatal interneurons, both during their development and following maturation, results in changes in their morphology and connectivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Guo et al., 2017</xref>). Our work extends these findings and provides strong genetic evidence that primary cilia and signals mediated by these organelles are important to maintain the morphology and function of a specific type of neuron within the brain, cerebellar PCs. Of substantial interest for future studies in our laboratory is the question of whether additional types of neurons in other regions of the brain require primary cilia to maintain their connectivity or viability. These include neurons that are affected by other more common neurodegenerative conditions, such as hippocampal neurons affected by Alzheimerâs disease, midbrain dopaminergic neurons lost in Parkinsonâs disease, or medium spiny neurons affected in Huntingtonâs disease. In each of these cases, links have been made between cilia dysfunction and these disorders, although functional and mechanistic studies have yet to be performed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chakravarthy et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Dhekne et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Keryer et al., 2011</xref>).</p><p>Our data show that conditional mutants of <italic>Ttbk2</italic> and <italic>Ift88</italic> have similar phenotypes with respect to loss of excitatory synapses to PCs from the climbing fibers, motor coordination deficits, and eventually loss of PCs. This evidence suggests that these defects are the result of ciliary loss or dysfunction. We note, however, that the ciliary phenotypes that result from loss of <italic>Ttbk2</italic> differ from those observed in the <italic>Ift88</italic> conditional mutants in the context of the adult brain. <italic>Ttbk2</italic> conditional mutant mice rapidly lose cilia following administration with TMX, with nearly all cilia within the cerebellum being absent within 20 days. In contrast, the numbers of cilia in the <italic>Ift88</italic> conditional mutants are only slightly reduced 3 months following TMX. However, these cilia exhibit significant abnormalities, including reduced length, and a near-complete loss of AC3 from the remaining cilia. This suggests that the degenerative phenotypes observed in both conditional mutants are driven by the loss of a specific ciliary signal.</p><p>While the precise nature of the ciliary signals that maintain the connectivity and viability of PC neurons remains unknown, there are a number of candidates. Many different GPCRs and associated signaling cascades and second messengers have been shown to concentrate in primary cilia or to be enriched predominantly at the primary cilium (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Mykytyn and Askwith, 2017</xref>). In particular, cAMP and Ca++ are highly concentrated within the cilium (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Moore et al., 2016</xref>). Misregulation of these concentrations through either ciliary loss or dysfunction could therefore result in perturbed signaling outputs to the cell bodies of these neurons. Provocatively, we found that AC3, a molecule important for the production of cAMP, is largely absent from the cilia that remain in the brains of Ift88<sup>c.mut</sup> animals, suggesting that its loss from the cilium may be a contributing signaling mechanism to the cellular changes in the cerebellum. Additionally, primary cilia play a well-known role as essential mediators of Hedgehog (HH) signaling. Sonic Hedgehog (SHH) is secreted by PCs during development well into adulthood (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Lewis et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Traiffort et al., 1998</xref>), although the precise role and functional significance of SHH within the adult cerebellum is largely unclear. Ultimately, it will be important to investigate the regulation and molecular composition of neuronal cilia in a comprehensive and unbiased manner.</p><p>Our observations also have interesting implications for regulation of cilium assembly and stability both generally, and in post-mitotic adult cells and neurons in particular. We found, for example, that most IFT88 protein is lost in <italic>Ift88</italic> conditional mutants as expected. However, the cilia persist on adult neurons within the brain in the absence of IFT88, suggesting that fully functional IFT is not required for these cilia. In contrast, in the absence of TTBK2, cilia are rapidly lost. This suggests that, in this context, TTBK2 could be playing a more central role than the IFT machinery in maintaining the stability of cilia. The exact mechanisms by which TTBK2 regulates the stability of cilia and the degree to which this role may be specifically important in neurons will be the subject of future investigations within our lab. In particular, the dynamics of cilium assembly and disassembly in post-mitotic cells in vivo have not been characterized. For example, a recent study found that the proteins that makeÂ upÂ the basal body of adult neurons in the mouse are very long-lived whereas those of the ciliary axoneme turn over more quickly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Arrojo E Drigo et al., 2019</xref>). This might imply that the cilia of these adult neurons turn over at some interval, or simply that their protein components are replacedÂ - a topic that merits further investigation.</p><p>In addition to being required for the biogenesis of cilia, TTBK2 also localizes to the + tips of microtubules, via interactionÂ with the + end binding protein EB1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Jiang et al., 2012</xref>). TTBK2 has also been shown to phosphorylate Î²-Tubulin as well as microtubule associated proteins TAU and MAP2 through in vitro assays (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Takahashi et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Tomizawa et al., 2001</xref>), pointing to roles for TTBK2 in regulation of the microtubule cytoskeleton beyond the cilium. In addition, TTBK2 and the closely related kinase TTBK1 both phosphorylate SV2A in vitro, a component of synaptic vesicles important for retrieval of the membrane trafficking protein Synaptotagmin one during the endocytosis of synaptic vesicles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Zhang et al., 2015</xref>). AlthoughÂ our data show that the <italic>Ttbk2</italic> mutant phenotypes strongly overlap with those of other ciliary genes, such as <italic>Ift88</italic>, we cannot exclude the possibility that other roles of TTBK2 specifically within the brain also contribute to the degenerative phenotypes. Importantly, these two possibilities are not mutually exclusive, and indeed, one exciting possibility is that TTBK2 is important for relaying signals from the cilium to the neuronal cell body.</p><p>In this work, we present evidence that loss or impaired function of TTBK2 within the brain results in degeneration of PCs largely becauseÂ of the requirement for TTBK2 in mediating the assembly and stability of primary cilia. This points to ciliary dysfunction as being a major mechanism underlying the pathology of SCA11, which is caused by truncating mutations to <italic>TTBK2</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Houlden et al., 2007</xref>) that act as dominant negatives (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bowie et al., 2018</xref>). In addition, our work raises the possibility that cilia play an important, largely unappreciated role in maintaining neuronal connectivity within the brain, and may also be required for the viability of some types of neurons. From a clinical perspective, our findings suggest that neurodegeneration, in addition to other neurological impairments with developmental origins, may emerge in some patients with ciliopathies such as Joubert and Bardet Biedl syndromes, particularly as patients age.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource"

Mice were given five consecutive 100 Î¼L intraperitoneal injections of 20 mg/mL tamoxifen starting at P21. Control mice were given corn oil vehicle only.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Mouse dissections</title><p>To harvest tissues from adult mice, animals were deeply anesthetized with 12.5 mg/mL avertin and transcardially perfused with 10 mL of phosphate buffered saline (PBS) followed by 20 mL of 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA). Whole brains were dissected out and left to incubate for 24 h in 4% PFA at 4Â°C. For cryosectioning, tissue was cryoprotected in 30% sucrose overnight and embedded in Tissue Freezing Medium (General Data TFM-5). Cerebella were then cut sagittally down the middle, and embedded in Tissue Freezing Medium (General Data TFM-5). Tissue was sectioned at 20â30 Î¼m thickness on a Leica Cyrostat (model CM3050S).</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Western blotting</title><p>Western blot methods were done as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bouskila et al., 2011</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bowie et al., 2018</xref>). Briefly, for tissue which was being used to quantify levels of TTBK2, a buffer containing 50 mM Tris/HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mM EGTA, 1 mM EDTA, 1 mM sodium orthovanadate, 10 mM sodium-2-glycerophosphate, 50 mM sodium fluoride, 5 mM sodium pyrophosphate, 0.27 M sucrose, 1 mM benzamidine and 2 mM PMSF, supplemented with 0.5% NP-40 and 150 mM NaCl was used. For other tissue samples a buffer containing 10 mM Tris/Cl pHÂ 7.5, 150 mM NaCl, 0.5 mM EDTA, 1% Triton, 1 mM protease inhibitors (Sigma #11836170001) and 25 mM Î²-glycerol phosphate (Sigma 50020) was used. Total protein concentration was determined using a BSA Protein Assay Kit (Thermo Fisher #23227). For western blots, 15 Î¼g of protein lysate was used for detection.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Cilia quantification</title><p>All quantification of cerebellar tissue was done using ImageJ software. Images taken for quantification of cilia abundance were 10 Î¼m z-stacks taken at 63x in four distinct folia regions of the cerebellum, two rostral and two caudal (specifically, the outer edge of folia I/II, the internal zone between folia III and IV, the tip of folia VI, and the outer edge of folia IX on a sagittal section were imaged for cilia quantification). The Purkinje cell layer was placed into the middle of the image with equal distance above and below for quantification. Per animal, four sections were scored each and three animals were included in all quantifications. These cilia were the same population taken for cilia length measurements as well.</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>Molecular layer thickness and VGLUT2 puncta quantification</title><p>For the molecular layer thickness, images were taken at 20x along the entirety of a primary fissure. A line was drawn from the base of the molecular layer to the pial surface, and a measurement was recorded. For this same line, the top of the line measurement was then brought down to the distal extent of the VGLUT2 synapse area, and a measurement recorded. For consistency, only the caudal side of the folia was measured. For the VGLUT2 puncta analysis, the âAnalyze Particlesâ function in ImageJ was used. Each image for the VGLUT2 puncta analysis was taken at 63x on the caudal side of the primary fissure, a 10 Î¼m z-stack was made, and the image quantified. For the quantification, each stack was made into a black and white image, where the VGLUT2 puncta were black against a white background. Thresholding was performed, and the Analyze Particle function used. These measurements were routinely tested against user ROI counting to confirm accuracy. Four cerebellar slices were imaged per animal, and three animals were included in the analysis.</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>Inferior olivary nuclei quantification</title><p>For the area measurements of the ION nuclei, the ION was identified by cells that were positive for both NeuN and Calbindin as well as location within ventral medulla in which these cells reside. Images used for the NeuN area analysis were taken at 20x. A 10 Î¼m z-stack image was made, and using the line tool, outlines were carefully drawn around the NeuN positive neuron and the area recorded. Per animal, over 150 cells were measured and three animals were included in the quantification.</p></sec><sec id="s4-10"><title>Glial fiber quantification</title><p>Glial fibers were assessed as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Furrer et al., 2011</xref>). Briefly, a 100 Î¼m horizontal line was drawn 50 Î¼m below the pial surface of the primary fissure folia. Glial fibers which crossed this 100 Î¼m were scored. Per animal, 36 measurements were made and three animals were included in the quantification.</p></sec><sec id="s4-11"><title>Immunostaining</title><p>The following antibodies and dilutions were used in this study: mouse anti-ARL13B (NeuroMabs N295B/66, 1:500), rabbit anti-ARL13B (gift from Tamara Caspary, 1:500, and Proteintech 17711â1-AP, 1:500), mouse anti-gamma-Tubulin (Sigma T6557, 1:1000), rabbit anti-Calbindin D28K (Cell Signaling Technologies 13176S, 1:250), guinea pig anti-Calbindin D28K (Synaptic Systems 214â004, 1:200), guinea pig anti-VGLUT2 (EMD Millipore AB2251, 1:2500), rabbit anti-NeuN (Abcam ab177487, 1:1000), DAPI (Sigma D9542, 1x), rabbit anti-AC3 (Santa Cruz SC-588, 1:10 - discontinued), rabbit anti-AC3 (Abeomics 34â1003, 1:100), chicken anti-GFAP (EMD Millipore AB5541, 1:500), rabbit anti-FoxP2 (Abcam, ab106046, 1:400), rabbit anti-IP3 (Abcam, ab108517, 1:200), andÂ mouse anti-AT8 (Thermo Scientific MN1020, 1:100).</p><p>For immunostaining cerebellar tissue, sections were rinsed in 1xPBS to remove OCT and permeabilized in 0.2% PBS-T (PBS + 0.2% Triton X-100) for 10 min, and then rinsed 3 Ã 5 min in PBS beforeÂ the blocking step. Blocking solution contained 5% serum, 1% BSA made up in 0.1% PBS-T, and sections were incubated at room temperature in blocking solution for 1 h. Primary antibodies were used at indicated dilutions and incubated at 4Â°C overnight. Following primary antibody incubation, slides were rinsed 3 Ã 5 min in 1xPBS and secondary antibodies were used to detect epitopes. All secondary antibodies were supplied from Life Technologies. Secondary antibodies incubated for 1â3 h at room temperature. Following secondary antibody incubation, slides were rinsed 3 Ã 5 min in 1xPBS and mounted with either ProLong Gold antifade reagent (Invitrogen P23930).</p></sec><sec id="s4-12"><title>Golgi staining</title><p>For Golgi staining of cerebellar tissue, FD Rapid Golgistain kit (FD Neurotechnologies) was used, according to manufacturerâs instructions. 100 Î¼m sections were made after staining. Imaging of Golgi stained PCs was completed using a Zeiss Axio Imager with a 40x objective. Z-stacks containing entire PCs were used for quantification, and proximal dendrites were chosen that did not intersect with other dendrites for clear quantification. Using ImageJ software, spines were counted per length of measurement and reported as number of spines per micron.</p></sec><sec id="s4-13"><title>Behavioral testing</title><p>AÂ rotarod performance test was completed with help from the Duke University Mouse Behavioral and Neuroendocrine Core Facility. Testers were blind to mouse genotype before beginning any experiments. The accelerating rotarod testing was performed the day before steady state rotarod testing. All accelerating tests were conducted at a speed that increased from 4 RPM to 40 RPM over 5Â min. All steady speed tests were conducted at 32 RPM. Four trials were conducted per test. A trial was stopped after 300 s maximum time had elapsed for mice that did not fall off the rotarod during testing. Mice were aborted from the trial run if they held onto the rotarod for three full rotations. Mice were given 30 min between trials to rest, and four trials were completed per test.</p></sec><sec id="s4-14"><title>Statistics</title><p>Statistical analyses, p-values, and experimental numbers for all experiments are outlined in respective figure legends.

neurodegeneration and cilia has been mysterious, and this work provides some of the first solid advances in this area. A particular strength is the use of mouse genetics to address the cell types at the origin of SCA11. This work will be of interest to a broad swath of cerebellar researchers, cell biologists, developmental biologists, and clinicians interested in the mechanistic basis of neurodevelopmental and neurodegenerative diseases.</p><p><bold>Decision letter after peer review:</bold></p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;TTBK2 and primary cilia are essential for the connectivity and survival of cerebellar Purkinje neurons&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Marianne Bronner as the Senior Editor. The following individuals involved in review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Roy V Sillitoe (Reviewer #1); Sylvie Schneider-Maunoury (Reviewer #2); Brian Kraemer (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>The manuscript by Bowie and Goetz addresses the role of <italic>Ttbk2</italic> and cilia in the adult mouse cerebellum using the tamoxifen-inducible mutant (<italic>Ttbk2</italic><sup>c.mut</sup>). <italic>Ttbk2</italic> (Tau tubulin kinase 2) is required for ciliogenesis in mice and TTBK2 dominant mutations in humans cause spinocerebellar ataxia type 11 (SCA11), a neural degenerative disease affecting the cerebellum. The study of <italic>Ttbk2</italic> function in the adult cerebellum is thus important to understand the origin of SCA11. The authors more particularly address the cell types at the origin of the disease as well as the involvement of cilia in adult cerebellum homeostasis.</p><p>Conditional ablation of <italic>Ttbk2</italic> using a global CreER as well as Purkinje cell specific Cre mice provided evidence that cilia are required for maintaining synapses in adult brain. Moreover, they report that Purkinje cells eventually die after genetic deletion. They confirm the phenotype by showing that loss of the ciliary trafficking gene <italic>Ift88</italic> results in a similar phenotype to the <italic>Ttbk2</italic> mice. They conclude that in the adult, cilia are required for maintaining neuronal function.</p><p>A key part of the manuscript is the use of a conditional KO of <italic>Ttbk2</italic> in the PCs (Ttbk2<sup>PCP2</sup>), since the global inducible KO <italic>Ttbk2</italic><sup>c.mut</sup> could lead to indirect effects on locomotor coordination and on cerebellum homeostasis. Strikingly, Ttbk2<sup>PCP2</sup> animals shows similar, although milder defects than <italic>Ttbk2</italic><sup>c.mut</sup> animals.</p><p>This is an interesting study that uses a powerful and precise genetic strategy. The paper is generally well written. The topic is of interest to cerebellar researchers, cell biologists, developmental biologists, and clinicians interested in the mechanistic basis of neurodevelopmental and neurodegenerative diseases.</p><p>Major concerns:</p><p>1) The finding of different types of cilia in the cerebellum is interesting and raises a question as to whether different cilia present on different cell types. Unfortunately, different markers were used in the different mutants: ARL13B for <italic>Ttbk2</italic><sup>c.mut</sup> and ACIII and ARL13B for Ttbk2<sup>PCP2</sup> (but surprisingly the quantification is not given for ARL13B +ACIII- cilia). Moreover, it would be very interesting to test for cilia loss in the PCs of Ttbk2<sup>PCP2</sup> animals. Indeed, the milder VGLUT2 density and behavioural phenotypes found in Ttbk2<sup>PCP2</sup> compared to <italic>Ttbk2</italic><sup>c.mut</sup> mice suggest that either cilia are not as affected in the PCP2 mutant or that other cell types are involved in the <italic>Ttbk2</italic><sup>c.mut</sup> phenotype.</p><p>2) The quantification of VGLUT2 puncta raises the question of the complexity and extent of the PC dendritic tree. Is the total number of VGLUT2 puncta reduced due to the reduction of the dendritic tree or is the density of puncta reduced on the dendrites? The question is important because it changes the interpretation of the role of cilia in PCs. It is important to better visualize the PC dendritic tree as the quantification of the thickness of the molecular layer is not sufficient.</p><p>3) The authors repeatedly make reference to the pathology of SCA11. In addition to exhibiting loss of cilia and PCs, SCA11 exhibits significant accumulation of pathological tau in brain regions outside the cerebellum. This key neuropathological feature of SCA11 is not addressed in the manuscript and should be mentioned in the Introduction and Discussion sections because pathological tau is a prominent feature of SCA11 and the other disease related phenotypes in humans are discussed extensively. It would be extremely significant from a disease modelling standpoint to assess whether or not TTBK2 conditional mice exhibit similar pathological tau accumulation outside the cerebellum vis-Ã -vis SCA11.</p><p>4) The main concern is that the analyses are based exclusively on the general architecture of the cerebellum. The cerebellum is heterogenous in its molecular, anatomical, and functional composition. It was unclear what regions of the cerebellum lose PCs. Degeneration often occurs in a pattern, and lobule X seems to have neuroprotective properties. For examples, refer to the SCA1 data from Zoghbi lab, and Sarna and Hawkes, 2003. Where within the cerebellum does the degeneration take place? Are all domains affected equally?</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.51166.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Major concerns:</p><p>1) The finding of different types of cilia in the cerebellum is interesting and raises a question as to whether different cilia present on different cell types.

We did not find any difference of spine density between Controls and Ttbk2â<sup>c.mutâ</sup> PCs by counting amount of spines per unit length of the proximal dendrites.

We have performed immunostaining for AT8+ (pathologically phosphorylated) Tau in our 4 month and 6 month old Ttbk2â<sup>c.mutâ</sup> brains (both cortex and cerebellum) and do not see any pathological Tau accumulation in 4 month old Ttbk2â<sup>c.mutâ</sup>, but do see a few cells positive for mild tau accumulation in the 6 month old â<italic>Ttbk2â</italic><sup>c.mutâ</sup> cortex (reported in Figure 4âfigure supplement 2). As a positive control, we stained â<italic>JNPL3(P301L)â</italic> âsamples characterized by extensive Tau accumulation at the same time as our conditional mutants. We note that evidence for accumulation of pathological Tau playing a substantial role in SCA11 pathology is somewhat limited. The observation of Tau accumulation in the cerebral cortex and other brain regions in SCA11- affected individuals is based upon a single post mortem examination of a 77 year old individual.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) The main concern is that the analyses are based exclusively on the general architecture of the cerebellum.
