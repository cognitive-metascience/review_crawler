osteichthyan anatomy, but its phylogenetic position has remained uncertain. We herein describe a second skull of ‘<italic>Ligulalepis</italic>’ and present micro-CT data on both specimens to reveal novel anatomical features, including cranial endocasts. Several features previously considered to link ‘<italic>Ligulalepis’</italic> with actinopterygians are now considered generalized osteichthyan characters or of uncertain polarity. The presence of a lateral cranial canal is shown to be variable in its development between specimens. Other notable new features include the presence of a pineal foramen, the some detail of skull roof sutures, the shape of the nasal capsules, a placoderm-like hypophysial vein, and a chondrichthyan-like labyrinth system. New phylogenetic analyses place ‘<italic>Ligulalepis</italic>’ as a stem osteichthyan, specifically as the sister taxon to ‘psarolepids’ plus crown osteichthyans. The precise position of ‘psarolepids’ differs between parsimony and Bayesian analyses.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.34349.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>All animals can be classified as either vertebrate (those that have a spine) or invertebrate (those that do not). About 98% of all living vertebrate species belong to a group called Osteichthyes, otherwise known as bony fish. Despite the name, this group also includes all four-limbed vertebrates – amphibians, reptiles, birds and mammals – since they evolved from prehistoric bony fish millions of years ago.</p><p>The oldest known bony fish can be traced back to around 425 million years. These ancient bony fish are all part of a sub-group called lobe-finned fish. Most modern bony fish, however, are part of a different sub-group called ray-finned fish, which can only be confidently traced back about 390 million years. A species called <italic>Ligulalepis</italic> was once thought to represent the oldest ray-finned fish. Scientists worked this out by examining a single <italic>Ligulalepis</italic> skull fossil from around 400 million years ago. However, subsequent studies have disputed its position in the evolutionary tree. So, the early evolution of bony fish remains poorly understood.</p><p>To address this, Clement, King, Giles et al. re-examined the original <italic>Ligulalepis</italic> skull fossil, alongside a newly discovered second skull fossil of the same species. Modern x-ray scanning techniques were used to produce detailed 3D models of both skulls and compare them to other prehistoric bony fish. This allowed Clement, King, Giles et al. to find <italic>Ligulalepis’s</italic> exact place in the evolutionary family tree.</p><p>The experiments identified many previously unknown features of the <italic>Ligulalepis</italic> skull. These features suggest that this species was not a ray-finned fish; rather, it existed just before bony fish split into two sub-groups (lobe-finned and ray-finned). The analysis also suggests that <italic>Ligulalepis</italic> was the species most closely related to another group of fish called psarolepids. Overall, these findings clarify our understanding of the evolutionary tree of all vertebrates, including humans. Future research should continue using modern scanning techniques to uncover new information from old fossils and give further insights into the early evolution of vertebrates.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>Ligulalepis</kwd><kwd>Devonian</kwd><kwd>Osteichthyes</kwd><kwd>Phylogeny</kwd><kwd>Computed Tomography</kwd><kwd>Braincase</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Other</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000923</institution-id><institution>Australian Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>DP 140101461</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Clement</surname><given-names>Alice M</given-names></name><name><surname>King</surname><given-names>Benedict</given-names></name><name><surname>Young</surname><given-names>Gavin C</given-names></name><name><surname>Long</surname><given-names>John A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000288</institution-id><institution>Royal Society</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Dorothy Hodgkin Research Fellowship</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Giles</surname><given-names>Sam</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000923</institution-id><institution>Australian Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>DE 160100247</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Choo</surname><given-names>Brian</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Stunning new scan data of an enigmatic fish from the Early Devonian of Australia, Ligulalepis, is identified as a stem osteichthyan, specifically, as the sister taxon to the 'psarolepids' plus crown osteichthyans.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Some 98% of living vertebrate species belong to Osteichthyes, the ‘bony fishes’. Osteichthyans are distinct from living jawless fishes (lampreys and hagfishes) and Chondrichthyes (the ‘cartilaginous fishes’: sharks, rays and chimaeras), and comprise Actinopterygii, or ‘ray-finned’ fishes (such as teleosts, bichirs and gars), and Sarcopterygii, or ‘lobe-finned’ fishes (lungfishes, coelacanths and tetrapods). The earliest osteichthyans are late Silurian (~425 million years ago), and from first appearance included large forms sometimes considered to be sarcopterygians (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Choo et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Zhu et al., 2009</xref>), but the interrelationships of the earliest members remain contentious (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Friedman and Brazeau, 2010</xref>).</p><p>Despite a lack of clarity with respect to relationships, a number of significant discoveries in recent years has resulted in a clearer view of early osteichthyan anatomy. In particular, taxa such as <italic>Youngolepis</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Chang, 1982</xref>)<italic>, Diabolepis</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chang and Yu, 1984</xref>), <italic>Kenichthys</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chang and Zhu, 1993</xref>), <italic>Psarolepis</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Yu, 1998</xref>)<italic>, Achoania</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Zhu et al., 2001</xref>)<italic>, Styloichthys</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Zhu and Yu, 2002</xref>)<italic>, Guiyu</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Zhu et al., 2009</xref>), <italic>Tungsenia</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Lu et al., 2012a2012</xref>), <italic>Megamastax</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Choo et al., 2014</xref>), <italic>Sparalepis</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Choo et al., 2017</xref>), and <italic>Ptyctolepis</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Lu et al., 2017</xref>) have provided new morphological information regarding the pattern of character acquisition in osteichthyans, in particular sarcopterygians. In contrast, the Silurian–Early Devonian record of actinopterygian evolution is poorly understood, confounded by fewer identified specimens known from typically fragmentary material. Despite the identification of Silurian sarcopterygians (but see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Lu et al., 2017</xref>) necessitating the presence of contemporaneous actinopterygians (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Coates, 2009</xref>), the oldest putative actinopterygian is the Lochkovian (~415 Ma) <italic>Meemannia</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Lu et al., 2016a</xref>), with unequivocal ray-finned fishes such as <italic>Cheirolepis</italic> known only from the Eifelian-Givetian (~393 Ma) and younger deposits. This paucity of specimens may be a reflection of lower abundance and diversity of early actinopterygians compared to sarcopterygians (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Cloutier and Arratia, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Friedman and Brazeau, 2010</xref>).</p><p>Phylogenetic relationships among stem osteichthyans are also poorly resolved. Several taxa have been proposed to branch from the stem, but there is little consensus as to the membership or branching order. Indeed, it has been suggested that ‘stem-group osteichthyans might not be recognized, even when their remains are discovered’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Friedman and Brazeau, 2010</xref>, pg. 38). <italic>Dialipina</italic> was originally diagnosed as a actinopterygian based on scale morphology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Schultze, 1968</xref>), but more recent analyses have resolved it either as an stem actinopterygian (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Giles et al., 2015b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Schultze and Cumbaa, 2001</xref>) or stem osteichthyan (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Choo et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Friedman and Brazeau, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Giles et al., 2015c</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Lu et al., 2016a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Qiao et al., 2016</xref>). Taxa referred to as ‘psarolepids’ (sensu <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Choo et al., 2017</xref>) were originally placed as sarcopterygians: <italic>Psarolepis</italic> was initially described as a ‘porolepiform-like’ crown sarcopterygian (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Yu, 1998</xref>) or either a stem osteichthyan or stem sarcopterygian (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Zhu et al., 1999</xref>), with most subsequent analyses corroborating a stem sarcopterygian position (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Brazeau, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Choo et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Lu et al., 2016a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Qiao et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Zhu et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Zhu et al., 2009</xref>); and <italic>Guiyu</italic> was deemed a stem sarcopterygian when first described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Zhu et al., 2009</xref>), a position subsequently supported in other analyses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Choo et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Lu et al., 2016a</xref>). More recent analyses have recovered a stem osteichthyan position for ‘psarolepids’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Lu et al., 2017</xref>: supported under parsimony, but not Bayesian, analyses), corroborating previous suggestions by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Zhu et al. (1999)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Choo et al. (2017)</xref>, as well as evidence from palaeohistological data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Qu et al., 2015</xref>). A Bayesian tip-dating approach provides no resolution regarding the phylogenetic position of <italic>Guiyu, Achoania</italic> and <italic>Psarolepis</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">King et al., 2017</xref>). The uncertainty regarding early osteichthyan relationships may be related to the dual problems of missing palaeontological data and difficulty in polarising osteichthyan characters, exacerbated by the discovery of osteichthyan-like anatomy in stem gnathostomes (e.g. <italic>Janusiscus</italic>: <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Giles et al., 2015c</xref>; <italic>Entelognathus</italic>: <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Zhu et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>One taxon that may help to elucidate osteichthyan stem group phylogeny is the enigmatic <italic>Ligulalepis. Ligulalepis toombsi</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Schultze, 1968</xref>) was erected and attributed to Actinopterygii byon the basis of isolated scales from the Early Devonian (Emsian) Taemas Limestones of the Burrinjuck area of New South Wales, Australia. A second species, <italic>Ligulalepis yunnanensis</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Wang and Dong, 1989</xref>, was erected on the basis of isolated scales from the Silurian (Ludlow) Miaokao Formation of Yunnan, China. Subsequently, other occurrences of isolated scales from Australia were attributed to the genus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Burrow, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Burrow, 1997</xref>), including throughout the Bloomfield Limestone member to the Warroo Limestone member at Burrinjuck (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Basden and Young, 2001</xref>); scales from at least the latter locality appear to belong to a single taxon (C. Burrow pers. comm to GCY). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Schultze (2016)</xref> referred a jaw from the Early Devonian Trundle Beds of New South Wales to <italic>Ligulalepis</italic>, although no justification for this is given by Schultze. Histological sections through the jaw show teeth bearing acrodin, a hypermineralised tissue forming a tooth cap that is currently known only in actinopterygians (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Ørvig, 1973</xref>).</p><p>An incomplete braincase and skull roof, AM-F101607, from the same Burrinjuck limestones, was described by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Basden et al. (2000)</xref> as perhaps the ‘most primitive osteichthyan braincase’ known, emphasizing its unusual combination of morphological characters. These authors used the phylogenetic analysis of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Zhu et al. (1999)</xref> to consider alternative placements of AM-F101607 as either a stem gnathostome, stem actinopterygian, or stem osteichthyan, the last option being the most parsimonious. Later, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Basden and Young (2001)</xref> published a more detailed morphological description of this specimen, which they considered might rather represent a member of the actinopterygian stem. Consequently, the specimen was moved to ‘<italic>Ligulalepis</italic>’ sp., and tentatively referred to <italic>Ligulalepis toombsi</italic>, on the basis that this was the only actinopterygian taxon known from the Emsian of southeastern Australia.</p><p>In addition to characters considered actinopterygian-like (dermal ornament, skull roof pattern and overall endocranial proportions; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Basden and Young, 2001</xref>), the skull of ‘<italic>Ligulalepis</italic>’ displayed characters found scattered across the gnathostome tree. ‘Primitive’ features included the presence of an eye stalk, myodomes for the attachment of oculomotor-innervated eye muscles, and an opening for the orbital artery (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Basden et al., 2000</xref>). However, certain features were noted to bear resemblance to sarcopterygians, including the proportions of the (short and broad) telencephalic region, ‘<italic>Psarolepis</italic>-like’ pit lines on the skull roof, shape of the basisphenoid and the shallow depth of the oticoccipital area (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Basden and Young, 2001</xref>). The position of the hyomandibular attachment along the anteroposterior axis of the otic capsule was considered intermediate between the posterior placement in chondrichthyans and the anterior placement in osteichthyans, similar to that in <italic>Acanthodes</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Basden and Young, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Basden et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Brazeau and de Winter, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Davis et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>Subsequent phylogenetic analyses have recovered contrasting placements for ‘<italic>Ligulalepis</italic>’. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Zhu et al. (2001)</xref>, in describing the primitive sarcopterygian <italic>Achoania</italic> from the Early Devonian of China, resolved ‘<italic>Ligulalepis</italic>’ as a basally-branching actinopterygian. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Friedman, 2007</xref> (pg. 311) determined ‘<italic>Ligulalepis</italic>’ to be a stem osteichthyan, arguing that the ‘actinopterygian affinities of <italic>Ligulalepis</italic> … have relied upon characters of uncertain polarity.’ Following the discovery of <italic>Guiyu</italic> from the late Silurian of China, ‘<italic>Ligulalepis</italic>’ was recovered as a stem sarcopterygian (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Zhu et al., 2009</xref>), whilst <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Brazeau (2009)</xref>, resolved ‘<italic>Ligulalepis</italic>’ as a stem osteichthyan. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Friedman and Brazeau (2010)</xref> examined the early osteichthyan radiation and presented a more detailed argument for stem osteichthyan affinity of ‘<italic>Ligulalepis</italic>’. Since then, ‘<italic>Ligulalepis</italic>’ has been recovered as a stem osteichthyan in most analyses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Davis et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Giles et al., 2015b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Giles et al., 2015c</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Giles et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Long et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Lu et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Zhu et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Zhu et al., 2013</xref>). However, tip dated analyses employed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">King et al., 2017</xref> place ‘<italic>Ligulalepis</italic>’ within Actinopterygii with quite strong support.</p><p>Uncertainty surrounding the phylogenetic placement of ‘<italic>Ligulalepis</italic>’ clearly warrants further investigation. Here, we use micro-CT scanning to reinvestigate the anatomy of the original cranium (AM-F101607), augmented by description of a second, recently-discovered specimen (ANU V3628). The main goals of this work are: (1) to provide a revised account of the anatomy of ‘<italic>Ligulalepis</italic>’, including the previously unknown anterior region of the skull roof (preserved in ANU V3628); (2) to test the anatomical interpretations produced on the basis of external investigation only (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Basden and Young, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Basden et al., 2000</xref>); (3) to examine the effect, if any, of this new anatomical data on the phylogenetic position of ‘<italic>Ligulalepis</italic>’ and understanding of early osteichthyan evolution, based on a revised version of a recent phylogenetic analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Lu et al., 2017</xref>); and (4) to investigate the implications of our phylogenetic placement of AM-F101607 and ANU V3628 for the taxonomic referral of the skulls to <italic>Ligulalepis</italic>.</p><sec id="s1-1"><title>Skull roof</title><p>Scans of AM-F101607 reveal for the first time some of the sutures between the skull roofing bones (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>) showing a pattern different in important respects to the previous interpretation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Basden and Young, 2001</xref>). Viewing the scan in Drishti reveals a set of parallel bands tracing what we assume to be bone sutures in the posterior part of the skull (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). Closer inspection of the scan data reveals these bands to be high-density thickenings in the basal layer of the dermal skull roof bones (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). These show the outline of the postparietals (of sarcopterygians; parietals of actinopterygians) and the posterior edges of the parietals (of sarcopterygians; frontals of actinopterygians) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B,C</xref>). No midline suture is evident between the postparietals, but a very faint suture between the parietals is suggested. The lateral margin of the postparietal is scalloped in such a way as to provide contact faces for a series of three bones, with faint lines visible demarcating them. The most posterior bone presumably corresponds to the tabular (of sarcopterygians; supratemporal of actinopterygians). Anterior to this is a supratemporal (of sarcopterygians; intertemporal of actinopterygians), and a broad and elongate intertemporal (of sarcopterygians; dermosphenotic of actinopterygians) borders the orbit. Unfortunately, sutures cannot be visualized in the same way in ANU V3628, despite the higher scan resolution, because no high density growth bands are evident. Instead the basal layer of the skull roof dermal bone is of uniform density and thickness. This suggests that they may vary between individuals or growth phases. Further specimens of ‘<italic>Ligulalepis</italic>’ are required to unambiguously determine the pattern of skull roof bones in this taxon. The presence of middle and posterior pitlines, and the supraorbital canals extending to the posterior edge of the postparietals, is confirmed in ANU V3628.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.34349.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Skull roof of ‘<italic>Ligulalepis</italic>’ AM-F101607 in dorsal view.</title><p>Artificial colouration added in Drishti to highlight (<bold>A</bold>) sensory canals; and (<bold>B</bold>) bone sutures.

A nostril confluent with the orbit is typically considered an actinopterygian character, but without preservation of the premaxilla and cheek bones in ‘<italic>Ligulalepis’</italic> we cannot rule out the possibility that dermal bone separated the external opening of the nostril from the orbit – for example a postero-dorsal process of the premaxilla as in <italic>Psarolepis</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Yu, 1998</xref>), and perhaps <italic>Cheirolepis</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Gardiner, 1984</xref>, Fig. 49).

The posterior and ventral portion of the braincase, comprising the occiput and basioccipital, is absent in both specimens. The loss of this region, which is rarely preserved in early osteichthyans (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Yu, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Zhu et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Lu et al., 2012a2012</xref>), presumably corresponds to the presence of well-developed otoccipital and ventral otic fissures, possibly in conjunction with a vestibular fontanelle.

In some early diverging arthrodire placoderms (e.g. <italic>Kujdanowiaspis, Dicksonosteus</italic>), the pituitary vein is continuous, but exits the floor of the braincase via the subpituitary fossa.

The canal originally identified for the trochlear (IV) nerve (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Basden and Young, 2001</xref>) in fact houses the anterior cerebral vein. This revised position of the trochlear (IV) nerve (i.e. posterodorsal to the eyestalk) reflects the general gnathostome condition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Chang, 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Gardiner, 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Maisey, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Young, 1979</xref>), but the position of the myodome anterior to the orbit is more similar to that of osteichthyans.</p><p>A large opening on the postorbital process was previously identified (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Basden and Young, 2001</xref>) as housing the orbital artery, in line with the position of this feature in placoderms. Segmentation of the internal course of this canal shows there is no communication with the profundus nerve canal, contrary to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Basden and Young (2001)</xref> description. The canal connects with a large opening beneath the cerebellar portion of the cranial cavity, most parsimoniously identified as the root of the trigeminal (V) nerve. As such, the large foramen in the orbit most likely transmitted the mandibular branch of the trigeminal nerve (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figures 4C–E</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">5A,C</xref>, Vmd). This canal also aligns with a notch in the postorbital process, along which the mandibular nerve would have travelled. This morphology is similar to that seen in chondrichthyans (e.g. <italic>Cladodoides</italic>: <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Maisey, 2005</xref>; ‘<italic>Cobelodus’</italic>: <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Maisey, 2007</xref>). Small branches are given off the trigeminal nerve within the braincase. One branch (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B–C</xref>, br.buc.1) enters the posterodorsal part of the orbit at a steep angle and likely carried lateralis fibres to small canals in the roof of the orbit that lead to the dorsal part of the infraorbital canal. A second branch (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B–C</xref>, br.buc.2), previously suggested as carrying the posterior branch of the oculomotor (III) nerve (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Basden and Young, 2001</xref>), opens onto the postorbital process just dorsal to the opening for the mandibular branch. This may also have carried lateralis fibres to the infraorbital canal.</p><p>Posterior to the root of the trigeminal nerve, a canal (r.lat) leaves the anterior face of the utricular region and enters the &quot;trigemino-facialis chamber&quot; (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>). This is interpreted as the root of the anterior lateral line nerves, in a similar position as in other early osteichthyans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Jarvik, 1980</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Chang, 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Giles and Friedman, 2014</xref>). An additional canal (mcv) exits the cranial cavity from the midpoint of the cerebellum and enters the &quot;trigemino-facialis chamber&quot; at a steep angle (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>). Due to its position and orientation, this is interpretated as the middle cerebral vein.

However, the placement of ‘<italic>Ligulalepis</italic>’ as the earliest diverging stem actinopterygian requires only a single additional step, and evidence for an actinopterygian affinity must be considered. Cranial features previously suggested as linking ‘<italic>Ligulalepis</italic>’ with actinopterygians (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Basden and Young, 2001</xref>) are now better considered to be general osteichthyan characters (e.g. dermal ornament) or of uncertain polarity (skull roof pattern and overall structure). Of the three characters proposed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Lu et al., 2017</xref> as uniting ray-finned fishes inclusive of <italic>Meemannia</italic>, ‘<italic>Ligulalepis’</italic> lacks two: posteriorly expanded tabulars (supratemporals of actinopterygians) and a spiracular canal. The remaining character, presence of a lateral cranial canal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Coates, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Gardiner, 1984</xref>), is harder to assess. Primitively, the lateral cranial canal connects with the endocavity through the loop of the posterior semicircular canal, but in neopterygians it may connect with the cranial cavity anteriorly (e.g. ‘<italic>Caturus</italic>’, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Rayner, 1948</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Giles et al., 2018</xref>), communicate with the fossa bridgei (e.g <italic>Pteronisculus</italic>, <italic>Boreosomus</italic>: <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Nielsen, 1942</xref>; <italic>Polyodon</italic>: <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bridge, 1878</xref>) or form an independent pocket (e.g. <italic>Acipenser</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Gardiner 1984</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Patterson (1975)</xref> claimed that the symmetry and even the presence of this character can vary between individuals of the same species – although investigation of several of Patterson’s specimens via CT scanning has identified only symmetrical lateral cranial canals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Giles et al., 2018</xref>). In <italic>Mimipiscis</italic> the lateral cranial canal in some specimens can occupy the whole area between the posterior and anterior semicircular canals, while in others be ‘little more than a pocket in front of the posterior semicircular canal’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Gardiner, 1984</xref>, pg. 242). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Gardiner (1984)</xref> suggested that the lateral cranial canal can be expressed simply in terms of the degree of ossification of the dorsal otic region. The two specimens of ‘<italic>Ligulalepis</italic>’ seem to confirm this idea, with the development of a lateral cranial canal variable between specimens, and the extent of the canal and perichondral lining also variable within a specimen. The endocranium of <italic>Meemannia</italic> is known only from a single skull specimen, so variability in development of the lateral cranial canal cannot be studied in this taxon. Mechanical preparation of <italic>Meemannia</italic> may also have obscured aspects of lateral cranial canal anatomy. Moreover, an actinopterygian identification for ‘<italic>Ligulalepis’</italic> is also at odds with the lack of pore canal network.</p><p>Topology tests reveal that the relationships of these early osteichthyans are somewhat interdependent, as constraining ‘<italic>Ligulalepis</italic>’ to the actinopterygian stem also leads to ‘psarolepids’ branching from the sarcopterygian stem, necessitating independant origins of a number of characters in 'psarolepids' and non-osteichthyan gnathostomes (cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Lu et al., 2017</xref>), and of tooth enamel in actinopterygians and sarcopterygians. This is because characters that support a stem osteichthyan position for ‘<italic>Ligulalepis</italic>’ (i.e. the presence of an eyestalk and short olfactory tracts) are also found in <italic>Psarolepis</italic> and <italic>Achoania</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Zhu et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Zhu et al., 2013</xref>) and only support a stem osteichthyan position if all these taxa are recovered on the stem. Evidence for a stem osteichthyan position for ‘psarolepids’ is now accumulating, with characters such as dorsal fin spines, a median dorsal plate and absence of tooth enamel supporting this relationship (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Qu et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Zhu et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Lu et al., 2017</xref>). This in turn provides additional support for a stem osteichthyan position for ‘<italic>Ligulalepis</italic>’.</p><p>In summary, our current phylogenetic hypothesis is that ‘<italic>Ligulalepis</italic>’ is a stem osteichthyan. While an actinopterygian affinity requires only one extra step, this position seems to be at odds with the distribution of anatomical features amongst early osteichthyans.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>‘<italic>Ligulalepis</italic>’, histology and the problem of associated material</title><p>The skulls investigated herein are not necessarily disqualified from belonging to the same animal as the scales described for <italic>Ligulalepis</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Schultze, 1968</xref>). However, we follow <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Giles et al., 2015c</xref> in maintaining the position that disassociated material cannot be unequivocally attributed to the same taxon. Scale material of <italic>Ligulalepis</italic> was described as actinopterygian on the basis of an anterodorsal process on the scale, ‘ganoine’ ridges, and a narrow scale peg (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Schultze, 1968</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Schultze, 2016</xref>). However, the distribution of these characters amongst osteichthyans has subsequently been comprehensively addressed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Friedman and Brazeau (2010)</xref>. An anterodorsal process is primitive for osteichthyans, and as the presence (and therefore relative width) of a peg cannot be assessed in outgroups the polarity of this character is ambiguous. While ‘ganoine’ encompasses multiple character states, some of which are general for osteichthyans (e.g. the presence of enamel, multiple layers of enamel) the presence of superimposed layers of enamel applied directly to each other is known only in actinopterygians. This indicates that <italic>Ligulalepis</italic>—that is the scale-based taxon—is an actinopterygian, at odds with the osteichthyan identification of ‘<italic>Ligulalepis’</italic>—that is the cranium-based taxon. A scale-based <italic>Ligulalepis</italic> is still problematic, however, as constituent species are erected on the basis of widespread (and often plesiomorphic characters) and span from the Ludlow of China (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Wang and Dong, 1989</xref>) to the Emsian of Australia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Schultze, 1968</xref>).</p><p>The tooth and jaw fragment attributed to <italic>Ligulalepis</italic> recently figured by (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Schultze, 2016</xref>, fig. 13) presents an additional problem. A vertical thin section through the tooth clearly shows an acrodin tip. Acrodin is a highly mineralized capping tissue restricted to actinopterygians crownward of <italic>Cheirolepis</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Friedman and Brazeau, 2010</xref>). It is unclear which characters were used to identify this specimen as <italic>Ligulalepis</italic>, but it most likely does not belong to the same taxon as the skulls investigated herein. Furthermore, this tooth comes from a different fossil site (Troffs Formation, Trundle Group, Mid-Pragian-Lower Emsian of New South Wales) than the skulls described in this study. As both the scales and jaw possess actinopterygian characters, it is possible that they belonged to the same taxon. However, in keeping with our protocol of not referring unassociated specimens (at least in the absence of clear apomorphic characters), we hesitate to support a <italic>Ligulalepis</italic> identity for the jaw specimen.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s3-1"><title>Materials</title><p>This study involves the incomplete skull of <italic>‘Ligulalepis</italic>’ AM-F101607, which was previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Basden and Young, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Basden et al., 2000</xref>), and a new specimen, ANU V3628, discovered by Ben King in late 2015. Both specimens came from the limestone outcrops on private land (Cathles' ‘Cooradigbee’ property) at the southern end of Goodradigbee Inlet, Wee Jasper, New South Wales, Australia. ANU V3628 was found in the Bloomfield Limestone Member of the Taemas Formation near Rocky Flat, and AM-F101607 was probably from a similar horizon, possibly at Caravan Point about 300 m to the north, although precise locality and horizon were not recorded for this specimen (although most likely from the Emsian <italic>pireneae-serotinus</italic> condont zone). ANU V3628 was found in a large limestone block which was trimmed with an angle grinder. The specimen was then bathed for approximately 2 hr in 5% acetic acid. The exposed bone was embedded in resin, and the block was trimmed further with an angle grinder. The specimen was then given a number of acid baths in 5% acetic acid whilst suspended upside down from a retort stand. After the skull roof became visible, further baths at progressively lower acid concentration were performed with the specimen fully immersed. Later acid baths were buffered using spent acid.

A new character was introduced to reflect the different conditions of the endoskeleton around the posterior nostril.

Parsimony analysis was performed in TNT v1.5 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Goloboff and Catalano, 2016</xref>). Analyses initially used new technology search for 1000 replications, using ratchet, tree fusing, sectorial search and drift search algorithms with default settings. TBR branch swapping was then performed on the resulting trees to explore the tree islands more thoroughly. A total of 1936 trees (using collapsing rule 1) of length 818 were found, and the strict consensus tree was saved. Gnathostomes (i.e. all taxa except Galeaspida and Osteostraci) were constrained to be monophyletic, and trees were rooted on Galeaspida. Bremer support values were calculated through a series of tree searches each with a negative constraint on a node in the strict consensus tree. Each of these constrained searches used the same new technology search settings as for the main analysis, for 200 replications. Bootstrap values were calculated using 1000 bootstrap replications. Within each bootstrap replication, the same new technology search settings as above were used, for 100 random addition sequence replications. A list of apomorphies was produced using ACCTRAN for one of the shortest trees using PAUP* (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Swofford, 2003</xref>).

Four independent analyses were run (each with four chains) for 10 million generations.

Your article has been favorably evaluated by Diethard Tautz (Senior Editor), Min Zhu (Reviewing Editor and Reviewer #1), and two additional reviewers.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>This is a keenly awaited manuscript to provide fresh and solid anatomical data on a critical but phylogenetically controversial taxon &quot;<italic>Ligulalepis</italic>&quot; via HXCT scanning and virtual restorations. A wealth of new neurocranial data will help to illuminate early character acquisitions of osteichthyans or bony vertebrates, which comprise some 98% of extant vertebrate species.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>For the better part of 20 years, a tiny osteichthyan braincase from the Early Devonian of Australia, which was attributed to <italic>Ligulalepis</italic> or &quot;<italic>Ligulalepis</italic>&quot;, has proven a tantalizing enigma. Despite exceptional preservation, the specimen has been something of an 'also ran' in debates on early bony fish evolution relative to a flood of Chinese discoveries. This has little do with the importance of the Australian specimen, but instead reflects limitations in the detail/reliability of past accounts arising from the tiny size of the fossil. This contribution by Clement and colleagues, which provides detailed models of the external and internal anatomy of this original fossil plus a newly discovered specimen, is therefore a welcome addition to the body of knowledge on early bony fishes.</p><p>Overall, the anatomical results of this contribution are very useful in terms of description and figures. However, the descriptive and phylogenetic parts of the text can be greatly improved for the readability, and some issues need to be addressed (e.g. inconsistency in format, variable quality of renderings, a tendency to refer to regions of the endocast as if they were regions of the brain, and so on.). As such, we have the following suggestions and comments to improve the manuscript.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) How to name AM-F101607 and ANU V3629 is a tricky issue. Either <italic>Ligulalepis</italic> or &quot;<italic>Ligulalepis</italic>&quot; is acceptable according to one reviewer, however, the authors had better use one term consistently throughout the text. The author discussed the term issue in the Introduction (sixth paragraph) and the Discussion (subsection “<italic>Ligulalepis</italic>, histology and the problem of associated material”) parts, which can be combined into one section.</p><p>According to the authors, <italic>Ligulalepis</italic> can only apply to the isolated scales if we have not found the skull specimens articulating with the scales (&quot;we adopt the premise that dissociated skulls and scales cannot strictly be attributed to the same taxon […] with respect to <italic>Ligulalepis</italic>, we followed the method of Giles et al. (2015), and coded any characters relating to scale or tooth morphology as unknown).” In the meanwhile, the authors &quot;concede it is possible that the scales do belong with the skulls as only one type of actinopterygian&quot;.</p><p>If the authors code &quot;any characters relating to scale morphology as unknown&quot; in the matrix, they had better use &quot;<italic>Ligulalepis</italic>&quot; to represent AM-F101607 and ANU V3629, because <italic>Ligulalepis</italic> was erected based on these scales. If the authors adopt the premise that the dissociated skulls and scales can be attributed to the same taxon, which is most likely based on all the available data, they can use <italic>Ligulalepis</italic> and code the scale morphology for this taxon. Do the histological data of AM-F101607 and ANU V3629 provide the further information to clarify the association of the skull and scale material?</p><p>2) Taxonomy and attribution: <italic>Ligulalepis</italic> had been considered an early actinopterygian based on isolated scales from the same and other localities, assuming it is the same taxon. This is not a solid assumption at all, as the authors explain in the Introduction; co-occurrence with isolated scales does not make the possessor of this braincase automatically the scale-bearer. This uncertainty is admitted in the manuscript – the braincases are only attributed '<italic>Ligulalepis</italic>' sp. In the Introduction, Materials and methods and previous work – as is the uncertainty about the relationship between different scale-based species of <italic>Ligulalepis</italic> from China and Australia separated by some tens of millions of years. After all, scale traits are highly functional and highly convergent in fishes; indeed, if <italic>Ligulalepis</italic> (scale-form) is a stem-osteichthyan, its scales would be convergent on actinopterygians. I note that the authors dismiss the attribution of a jawbone with acrodin-caped teeth (subsection “<italic>Ligulalepis</italic>, histology and the problem of associated material”, last paragraph) to <italic>Ligulalepis</italic> based on the fact that it comes from an &quot;earlier site&quot; without examination, but do not go that far in considering a relationship between braincase and ganoine-bearing scales which might support &quot;ancestor&quot; status (see below). This is inconsistent.</p><p>Yet, despite their demonstrated uncertainty about the attribution of the braincase to <italic>Ligulalepis</italic>, the authors suddenly drop the quotation marks around the genus name after the Introduction. The description details the neurocranial features of <italic>Ligulalepis</italic> full stop, and does not cover scale morphology. Their phylogenetic analysis is meant to place <italic>Ligulalepis</italic> as a genus but did not include scale traits. Did some of the authors conclude it is attributable after all (beyond &quot;it cannot be disqualified&quot; in the first paragraph of the aforementioned subsection)?</p><p>3) Phylogenetic part (subsection “Phylogenetic analyses”). There are many errors in this part. It looks that the matrix in Supplementary Information 3 (available via Dryad) was expanded from an intermediate version between Lu et al. (2016a) and Lu et al. (2017). The matrix in Lu et al. (2016a) has 269 characters (rather than 273 in the text) and 90 taxa, whiles the matrix in Lu et al. (2017) has 278 characters and 94 taxa. The matrix in Supplementary Information 3 (available via Dryad) has 280 characters (rather than 275 in the text) and 93 taxa (rather than some 90). As two analyses expanded from Lu et al. (2016a) and Lu et al. (2017) yield the same tree topology, one reviewer strongly recommend the authors to use the matrix expanded from Lu et al. (2017), which will avoid the confusions in the text.</p><p>4) Interpretation: Despite the uncertainties, the authors assert in the Abstract their main finding is that <italic>Ligulalepis</italic> (containing both the uncoded scale taxa from China and Australia and the braincases) is the last common ancestor of the node subtending psarolepids and osteichthyans. Leaving aside the taxonomic problems, and that this assertion is not made in the text, it is entirely unsupported and improbable. First, no ancestor sampling Bayesian analysis is presented here. A polytomy does not render one of the three clades ancestral to the others.</p><p>Second, such a result would be very unlikely given realistic priors, and basic logic, that a Devonian species from Australia is the sampled ancestor of a specific clade of Silurian osteichthyans. This would necessitate absolute stasis within <italic>Ligulalepis</italic> for over 20 million years, at odds with demonstrated faunal and lineage-specific changes both on a global scale and in South China during this same interval and the absence of psarolepids in the latter time. Indeed, it is even more improbable considering that the amount of morphological change observed within psarolepids over a shorter time period, and the fact that <italic>Ligulalepis</italic> scales changed enough over 20 million years to be identified as two different species.</p><p>This assertion also leaves aside the fact that a stem-osteichthyan position for '<italic>Ligulalepis</italic>' was poorly supported in parsimony analysis (&quot;alternative placements cannot yet be ruled out&quot;), and that its position is unresolved in the Bayesian analysis (although Figure 11 shows a branch with 44% node support separating <italic>Ligulalepis</italic> from crown osteichthyes, it avoids showing a polytomy as in the parsimony analysis). Therefore, it is not even clear whether '<italic>Ligulalepis</italic>' is a stem-osteichthyan, let alone the ur-osteichthyan. Indeed, considering that <italic>Dialipina</italic> was recovered as the sister group to all Osteichthyans in all parsimony analyses and the Bayesian analysis, it is more likely to be the &quot;the ancestor&quot; (but see above)! (Figure 10).</p><p>In summary, the Abstract and main conclusions gloss over large taxonomic uncertainty about the many forms attributed to <italic>Ligulalepis</italic> in order to make an unsupported point about sampled ancestry and artificially raise the impact of the manuscript. Until the authors sort out these taxonomic issues, re-evaluate support for their claims, and explain their choices more fully, it is not clear what the main result of this study is beyond the straight description and inconclusive phylogenetic analysis of a pair of braincases of uncertain affinity.</p><p>5) The 'bookends' of this paper will need some more work. Some of this, it seems, stems from <italic>eLife</italic>'s format of placing Materials and methods at the end of papers. Because of this, there is an abrupt transition from a semi-historical review of the fossil to gory anatomical detail to a mention of a second specimen and unspecified 'scan data'. One reviewer would strongly encourage the authors to smuggle at least some clues of what they did (not in the detail required for Materials and methods, obviously) into a rewritten final paragraph(s) of the Introduction. This will provide readers with enough of a sense of what was done to move on to the description. It would also benefit this manuscript if the authors more explicitly outlined the goals of their contribution. This is implicit in the winding narrative of past interpretations of the specimen, but it would be better to make this clear. At the other end of the paper, the Discussion seems limited. Some more nuanced comparison with past interpretations would be useful, as would some sense of the degree to which any of the new data provided for the fossils described here changes our perception of early bony fish evolution. This is touched on, but we feel like there is more here.</p><p>Finally, the Abstract needs to be substantially revised/rewritten. It is largely introductory material, and contains little of the principal results (i.e. new anatomical information) presented in the manuscript.</p><p>6) The authors described the sensory canals in two sections (subsections “Skull roof” and “Sensory canals”), which can be combined for readability.</p><p>Subsection “Skull roof”, second paragraph: where is the preopercular sensory line in Figure 1A and 1C? To be illustrated.</p><p>Subsection “Skull roof”, second paragraph: postotic canal (postotic branch of main lateral line), otic canal (otic branch of infraorbital canal), e.g. see Jarvik (1980, Figure.127). Accordingly, the otic canal is a part of the infraorbital canal. The infraorbital canal labelled by the authors is the postorbital branch of the infraorbital canal.</p><p>Subsection “Skull roof”, fourth paragraph: The author should be very careful of the nature of grooves in <italic>Achoania</italic> and <italic>Psarolepis</italic>.

Either Ligulalepis or &quot;Ligulalepis&quot; is acceptable according to one reviewer, however, the authors had better use one term consistently throughout the text. The author discussed the term issue in the Introduction (sixth paragraph) and the Discussion (subsection “Ligulalepis, histology and the problem of associated material”) parts, which can be combined into one section.</p><p>According to the authors, Ligulalepis can only apply to the isolated scales if we have not found the skull specimens articulating with the scales (&quot;we adopt the premise that dissociated skulls and scales cannot strictly be attributed to the same taxon […] with respect to Ligulalepis, we followed the method of Giles et al. (2015), and coded any characters relating to scale or tooth morphology as unknown).” In the meanwhile, the authors &quot;concede it is possible that the scales do belong with the skulls as only one type of actinopterygian&quot;.</p><p>If the authors code &quot;any characters relating to scale morphology as unknown&quot; in the matrix, they had better use &quot;Ligulalepis&quot; to represent AM-F101607 and ANU V3629, because Ligulalepis was erected based on these scales. If the authors adopt the premise that the dissociated skulls and scales can be attributed to the same taxon, which is most likely based on all the available data, they can use Ligulalepis and code the scale morphology for this taxon. Do the histological data of AM-F101607 and ANU V3629 provide the further information to clarify the association of the skull and scale material?</p></disp-quote><p>We stand by the premise that we cannot attribute the skulls to the scale taxon without firm evidence of association, and thus refer to the two skulls investigated in this paper as “<italic>Ligulalepis</italic>.” This has now been consistently corrected throughout the text. We retain the considerations of this as two separate sections, but have rewritten them so that the section in the Introduction sets up the problem, and the section in the Discussion considers the problem in light of new data. The resolution of the scans is not high enough to enable detailed palaeohistological information in regards to the skull material. However, we note that dermal bone and scale histology may be radically different even within the same taxon (c.f. Cheirolepis in Lu et al., 2016).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Taxonomy and attribution: Ligulalepis had been considered an early actinopterygian based on isolated scales from the same and other localities, assuming it is the same taxon. This is not a solid assumption at all, as the authors explain in the Introduction; co-occurrence with isolated scales does not make the possessor of this braincase automatically the scale-bearer. This uncertainty is admitted in the manuscript – the braincases are only attributed 'Ligulalepis' sp. In the Introduction, Materials and methods and previous work – as is the uncertainty about the relationship between different scale-based species of Ligulalepis from China and Australia separated by some tens of millions of years. After all, scale traits are highly functional and highly convergent in fishes; indeed, if Ligulalepis (scale-form) is a stem-osteichthyan, its scales would be convergent on actinopterygians. I note that the authors dismiss the attribution of a jawbone with acrodin-caped teeth (subsection “Ligulalepis, histology and the problem of associated material”, last paragraph) to Ligulalepis based on the fact that it comes from an &quot;earlier site&quot; without examination, but do not go that far in considering a relationship between braincase and ganoine-bearing scales which might support &quot;ancestor&quot; status (see below). This is inconsistent.</p><p>Yet, despite their demonstrated uncertainty about the attribution of the braincase to Ligulalepis, the authors suddenly drop the quotation marks around the genus name after the Introduction. The description details the neurocranial features of Ligulalepis full stop, and does not cover scale morphology. Their phylogenetic analysis is meant to place Ligulalepis as a genus but did not include scale traits. Did some of the authors conclude it is attributable after all (beyond &quot;it cannot be disqualified&quot; in the first paragraph of the aforementioned subsection)?</p></disp-quote><p>As per our response to 1), we stand by the premise that we cannot attribute the skulls to the scale taxon without evidence of association, and thus refer to the two skulls investigated in this paper as “<italic>Ligulalepis</italic>”. We have edited the text so that this usage is consistent throughout. <italic>Ligulalepis</italic> thus remains a scale-based taxon, albeit one that is highly problematic. We have added more detailed consideration of potential relationships between the scales, jaw and skulls to the Discussion, noting that given the osteichthyan-like characters of the skulls and the actinopterygian-like characters indicate that the scales and skulls do not belong to the same taxon (although the scales and jaw may well do).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Phylogenetic part (subsection “Phylogenetic analyses”). There are many errors in this part. It looks that the matrix in Supplementary Information 3 (available via Dryad) was expanded from an intermediate version between Lu et al. (2016a) and Lu et al. (2017). The matrix in Lu et al. (2016a) has 269 characters (rather than 273 in the text) and 90 taxa, whiles the matrix in Lu et al. (2017) has 278 characters and 94 taxa. The matrix in Supplementary Information 3 (available via Dryad) has 280 characters (rather than 275 in the text) and 93 taxa (rather than some 90). As two analyses expanded from Lu et al. (2016a) and Lu et al. (2017) yield the same tree topology, one reviewer strongly recommend the authors to use the matrix expanded from Lu et al. (2017), which will avoid the confusions in the text.</p></disp-quote><p>We have now run all the analyses on a single matrix, an updated version of Lu et al. 2017 (for <italic>Ptyctolepis</italic>). Confusion regarding number of characters etc. has been fixed.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) Interpretation: Despite the uncertainties, the authors assert in the Abstract their main finding is that Ligulalepis (containing both the uncoded scale taxa from China and Australia and the braincases) is the last common ancestor of the node subtending psarolepids and osteichthyans. Leaving aside the taxonomic problems, and that this assertion is not made in the text, it is entirely unsupported and improbable. First, no ancestor sampling Bayesian analysis is presented here. A polytomy does not render one of the three clades ancestral to the others.</p><p>Second, such a result would be very unlikely given realistic priors, and basic logic, that a Devonian species from Australia is the sampled ancestor of a specific clade of Silurian osteichthyans. This would necessitate absolute stasis within Ligulalepis for over 20 million years, at odds with demonstrated faunal and lineage-specific changes both on a global scale and in South China during this same interval and the absence of psarolepids in the latter time. Indeed, it is even more improbable considering that the amount of morphological change observed within psarolepids over a shorter time period, and the fact that Ligulalepis scales changed enough over 20 million years to be identified as two different species.</p><p>This assertion also leaves aside the fact that a stem-osteichthyan position for 'Ligulalepis' was poorly supported in parsimony analysis (&quot;alternative placements cannot yet be ruled out&quot;), and that its position unresolved in the Bayesian analysis (although Figure 11 shows a branch with 44% node support separating Lingulalepis from crown osteichthyes, it avoids showing a polytomy as in the parsimony analysis). Therefore, it is not even clear whether 'Ligulalepis' is a stem-osteichthyan, let alone the ur-osteichthyan. Indeed, considering that Dialipina was recovered as the sister group to all Osteichthyans in all parsimony analyses and the Bayesian analysis, it is more likely to be the &quot;the ancestor&quot; (but see above)! (Figure 10).</p><p>In summary, the Abstract and main conclusions gloss over large taxonomic uncertainty about the many forms attributed to Ligulalepis in order to make an unsupported point about sampled ancestry and artificially raise the impact of the manuscript. Until the authors sort out these taxonomic issues, re-evaluate support for their claims, and explain their choices more fully, it is not clear what the main result of this study is beyond the straight description and inconclusive phylogenetic analysis of a pair of braincases of uncertain affinity.</p></disp-quote><p>This was a simple oversight, and we apologise for the confusion. We meant that “<italic>Ligulalepis</italic>” was resolved as a stem osteichthyan, specifically as the sister taxon to the ‘psarolepids’ plus crown osteichthyans.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) The 'bookends' of this paper will need some more work. Some of this, it seems, stems from eLife's format of placing Materials and methods at the end of papers. Because of this, there is an abrupt transition from a semi-historical review of the fossil to gory anatomical detail to a mention of a second specimen and unspecified 'scan data'. One reviewer would strongly encourage the authors to smuggle at least some clues of what they did (not in the detail required for Materials and methods, obviously) into a rewritten final paragraph(s) of the Introduction. This will provide readers with enough of a sense of what was done to move on to the description. It would also benefit this manuscript if the authors more explicitly outlined the goals of their contribution. This is implicit in the winding narrative of past interpretations of the specimen, but it would be better to make this clear. At the other end of the paper, the Discussion seems limited. Some more nuanced comparison with past interpretations would be useful, as would some sense of the degree to which any of the new data provided for the fossils described here changes our perception of early bony fish evolution. This is touched on, but we feel like there is more here.</p><p>Finally, the Abstract needs to be substantially revised/rewritten. It is largely introductory material, and contains little of the principal results (i.e. new anatomical information) presented in the manuscript.</p></disp-quote><p>We have substantially rewritten the Introduction and Discussion to address these problems. In particular, we have amended the final paragraph of the Introduction to include more detail of the methods and an explicit stamen of the goals of the manuscript. The Discussion has been re-organised to reflect this, and has also been expanded. We have also heavily revised the Abstract to include more details of new anatomical information and how interpretations have changed.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) The authors described the sensory canals in two sections (subsections “Skull roof” and “Sensory canals”), which can be combined for readability.</p><p>Subsection “Skull roof”, second paragraph: where is the preopercular sensory line in Figure 1A and 1C? To be illustrated.</p><p>Subsection “Skull roof”, second paragraph: postotic canal (postotic branch of main lateral line), otic canal (otic branch of infraorbital canal), e.g. see Jarvik (1980, Figure 127). Accordingly, the otic canal is a part of the infraorbital canal. The infraorbital canal labelled by the authors is the postorbital branch of the infraorbital canal.</p><p>Subsection “Skull roof”, fourth paragraph: The author should be very careful of the nature of grooves in Achoania and Psarolepis. In both genera, the supraorbital canals run within the dermal skeleton, although the groove might have connection with the trajectory of the canal (e.g. more superficial position of the canal). CT scan of ANU V3628 should reveal whether the supraorbital canal of this segment runs as a canal or a groove on the skull roof.</p></disp-quote><p>The two sections describing the sensory canals have now been combined. The reviewers suggest using the convention of referring to the otic and infraorbital canals as branches of the infraorbital, following Jarvik 1980. However, we note that other conventions are possible including the one we followed e.g. Northcutt 1989, ZFIN anatomy database etc. Arguably, it is something of an arbitrary choice. However, the otic canal develops from a separate placode from the infraorbital and supraorbital canals (e.g. Northcutt 1997 Brain Behav Evol 50:25-37). It is better for naming conventions to follow the underlying development in our opinion. It also has the advantage of shorter, clearer names, and avoids the anomaly of referring to a canal on top of the head posterior to the orbit as “infraorbital”. There is no notch for the preopercular sensory line, and this is now reflected in the manuscript text. We have re-examined the supraorbital canals in our specimens and compared them to <italic>Achoania</italic> and <italic>Psarolepis</italic> and are confident the structure is the same: the canals are carried in a canal on the visceral surface of the skull roof in ‘<italic>Ligulalepis</italic>’, but the canal is open dorsally to the skull roof. This appears to be identical to the condition in <italic>Psarolepis</italic> and <italic>Achoania</italic>, as far as can be judged form published descriptions.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7) There are many figure citation errors (e.g. subsections “Ethmoid region”, end of first paragraph; “Orbitotemporal region”, fourth and fifth paragraphs; “Ventral Surface”; “Cranial Endocast”, last paragraph; “Forebrain”, last paragraph; “Hindbrain”, third paragraph), which should be double-checked and revised. To improve the readability, one reviewer suggests the authors to cite more anatomical structures (figure abbreviations in the text).</p></disp-quote><p>All figure citations have been double-checked and anatomical structures of discussion are now listed within the figure citation.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>8) Life Reconstruction: What is Figure 12 based on considering that available material consists only of isolated scales and potentially a pair of isolated braincases? The jaw material previously attributed to Ligulalepis was rejected in text. This image gives the false impression that the form of this fish, down to the scales and dentition, is known and characters abundant, and is therefore inappropriate. It is unlikely that this is what Ligulalepis looked like given the evidence at hand.</p></disp-quote><p>Figure 12 is based on the morphology of the two skulls investigated within the manuscript. The other features are hypothetical reconstructions. The figure label has been updated to “Life reconstruction of <italic>Ligulalepis</italic> based on the skull morphology of AM-F101607 and ANU V3628, other features remain hypothetical” to more clearly express this.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>9) This contribution should be accompanied by the data files indicated in the text.
