This is also the case for odor signals, that are used as cues for both source identification and localization. Whereas a brief exposure to the stimulus can be sufficient for an animal to identify the odor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bhandawat et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Rinberg et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Szyszka et al., 2012</xref>), changes in stimulus intensity or in higher order statistics, such as variance or temporal correlations, can be used to infer stimulus location (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Baker et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Celani et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Murlis et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Vergassola et al., 2007</xref>). One key challenge of sensory systems is to keep the object identity invariantly represented in terms of neural activity as the animal moves around, the object moves, or the overall environment changes. This is not a trivial problem for two reasons. First, sensory stimuli are typically multidimensional and their features are represented by combinations of neurons with different receptive fields. Therefore, the same stimulus might be represented by different subsets of neurons at different times/locations. Second, the sensitivity of a single neuron is usually not sufficient to encode the full range of natural stimuli, and intracellular or circuit mechanisms may adapt its dynamic range on different timescales to match the concurrent stimulus statistics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Wark et al., 2007</xref>). In olfaction adaptation to localization cues (as stimulus intensity and variance) could potentially compromise the encoding of identification cues (combinatorial activity).</p><p>Here, we use the olfactory system of the fruit fly <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic>, a key model for studying olfactory circuits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Galizia, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Su et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Vosshall and Stocker, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Wilson, 2013</xref>) to investigate how adaptive features of distinct neuron types modify the stimulus representation at the population level. Odor stimuli activate olfactory receptor neurons (ORNs) that usually express a single chemosensory receptor out of a large family of genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Su et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Vosshall and Stocker, 2007</xref>). Each receptor has different affinities to different odorants, such that a given odor will drive a specific activity pattern across the entire population of ORNs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">de Bruyne et al., 2001</xref>). ORNs expressing the same receptor innervate the same glomerulus of the antennal lobe (AL) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Couto et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Fishilevich and Vosshall, 2005</xref>), within which they synapse onto mostly uniglomerular projection neurons (PNs, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Marin et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Wong et al., 2002</xref>). In the AL, odor stimuli induce specific patterns of activity across glomeruli (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Fiala et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Wang et al., 2003</xref>). The PN responses are shaped by properties of ORN-to-PN synapses, such as short-term presynaptic depression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Kazama and Wilson, 2008</xref>) and postsynaptic receptor dynamics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Nagel et al., 2015</xref>). Moreover, a network of local interneurons (LNs) reorganizes the responses of the glomeruli based on the overall activity of the AL by means of both excitatory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Olsen et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Yaksi and Wilson, 2010</xref>) and inhibitory lateral connection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Olsen and Wilson, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Root et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Silbering and Galizia, 2007</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.43735.002</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Cell-specific calcium dynamics in neurons of the antennal lobe.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Schematics of the olfactory pathway in <italic>Drosophila</italic>.

However, it is less clear how these adaptive firing rates convert into glomerular activity of populations of neurons downstream of the antenna and further in second-order neurons within the brain. Previous studies in locusts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Geffen et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Stopfer et al., 2003</xref>), moths (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Jacob et al., 2017</xref>) and rats (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Gupta et al., 2015</xref>) have reported complex and diverse response dynamics in second-order olfactory neurons. In <italic>Drosophila,</italic> short-term depression, different receptor currents, and lateral inhibition have been identified as mechanisms underlying complex PN response dynamics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Nagel et al., 2015</xref>).

Our analysis of pre- and postsynaptic calcium activity is consistent with a model that describes most of the adaptation observed in PNs to occur at the ORN-PN synapses. We identify a slow change in PN activity that occurs on a timescale of 10–20 s and correlates with depression of vesicle release at the ORN terminals. As a consequence of these different properties, the combinatorial representation of an odor in ORNs does not change over prolonged repeated stimulations, while the combinatorial representation in PNs adjusts over a timescale of tens of seconds. We show that this adjustment preserves information about the odor stimulus and allows the PNs to encode stimulus fluctuations on a larger range of intensities than the population of ORNs.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Cell-specific calcium dynamics in the antennal lobe</title><p>Adaptation of the responses of ORNs to odor stimuli has been reported in several insect species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Ito et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Kaissling et al., 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Lemon and Getz, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Nagel and Wilson, 2011</xref>) and in vertebrates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Kurahashi and Menini, 1997</xref>). In <italic>Drosophila</italic>, ORNs show phasic firing rate responses on timescales of ~100 ms when stimulated with a step increase in odor and adapt their gain to the mean stimulus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Gorur-Shandilya et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Martelli et al., 2013</xref>). Here, we used calcium imaging to investigate adaptation properties downstream of the receptor site, that is in the glomeruli. Following an approach previously adopted to quantify firing rates of sensory neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Chichilnisky, 2001</xref>), including olfactory neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Geffen et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Martelli et al., 2013</xref>), we designed a pseudorandom stimulus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>) that allowed us to quantify the dynamics of calcium response. From previous analysis of ORNs spiking activity, we expected that calcium signals measured at the ORN axon terminals would decrease over time when a sustained flickering stimulus is applied (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Martelli et al., 2013</xref>). Instead calcium response, reported by GCaMP3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Tian et al., 2009</xref>) or GCaMP6f (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chen et al., 2013</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>), is sustained, as shown for the ORNs that innervate glomerulus DM1 in response to methyl acetate (10<sup>−6</sup> dilution, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A–B</xref>, cyan). On the contrary, PNs and LNs that innervate the same glomerulus show a decrease in calcium response over time (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A–B</xref>). The calcium dynamics of ORNs, PNs and LNs are different also on shorter timescales (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). Calcium onset is faster in PNs than ORNs, as previously shown in measurements of the firing rate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bhandawat et al., 2007</xref>), and LNs show even more transient dynamics with a larger decrease in activity during a single odor pulse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Nagel and Wilson, 2016</xref>). This demonstrates that the fluorescence calcium reporter, although slower than an electrophysiological measurement, can report cell-specific response dynamics.</p><p>Calcium dynamics in ORNs reported by the cytosolic calcium sensor CGaMP3 are similar to the dynamics of the presynaptically targeted calcium sensor Syp-GCaMP3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Pech et al., 2015</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D–E</xref>) and considerably different from the calcium signals measured from synaptic boutons of PNs in the calyx of the mushroom body (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D–E</xref>). These results indicate that the calcium dynamics characterized in ORNs terminals reflect cell-specific synaptic activity.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Dynamic properties of ORN calcium responses to binary stimuli</title><p>One common approach to characterize neural response to stimuli is that of using reverse correlation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Chichilnisky, 2001</xref>) to extract the linear filter of the response. The linear filter describes how the response depends on current and past stimuli in a system that is not an instantaneous translator of the stimulus into a response but has a ‘memory’ for previous stimulations. This approach can be applied to calcium responses to capture cell specific dynamics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Si et al., 2019</xref>). For example, different linear filters predict the calcium transients elicited by the random stimulus in ORNs and PNs of the glomerulus DM1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1</xref>). In ORNs, the linear filter is monophasic and can be accurately described by a single exponential function. In PNs, the filter is biphasic with a lagging negative component that indicates adaptation, in the sense that stimuli in the past suppress calcium signals in response to present stimuli. These dynamics are certainly cell specific, but cannot be directly interpreted as calcium dynamics in absolute terms, as they could be affected by and depend on the kinetics of the calcium reporter. For example, when using the faster fluorescence sensor GCaMP6f, the reverse correlation analysis results also in a monophasic filter, but with a faster timescale (~100 ms, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). This suggests that the real presynaptic calcium dynamics are likely faster than the sensor kinetics. Following the approach of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Schnell et al. (2014)</xref>, we have used an exponential filter to model the sensor kinetics and deconvolved it from the ORN calcium response reported by two different sensors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). The deconvolved signal shows fast transients, in accordance with the phasic firing rates of these neurons. The deconvolution does not affect the response on longer timescales, which remains sustained for the duration of the 2 min stimulation. This approach does not take into account possible non-linearities of the sensors, which could hide other features of the real calcium response. Importantly, we assume the same model for the sensor kinetics in different neuron types. This implies that cell- as well as stimulus-specific differences reported by a given sensor are preserved through the deconvolution of the sensor kinetics (see below).</p><fig id="fig2" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.43735.005</object-id><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Calcium dynamics in ORNs axon terminals.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Linear filter (black) of the DM1 ORNs and PNs response (methyl acetate at C<sub>04</sub>, <italic>n</italic> = 11) and fitted exponential decay (cyan <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf1"><mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mi>k</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mn>1</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mfenced separators="|"><mml:mrow><mml:mi>t</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:mfenced><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mi>A</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mn>1</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:msup><mml:mrow><mml:mi>e</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mo>-</mml:mo><mml:mfrac bevelled="true"><mml:mrow><mml:mi>t</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mi>τ</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mn>1</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:msub></mml:mrow></mml:mfrac></mml:mrow></mml:msup></mml:math></inline-formula>) or double exponential (purple: <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf2"><mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mi>k</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mn>3</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mfenced separators="|"><mml:mrow><mml:mi>t</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:mfenced><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mi>A</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mn>1</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:msup><mml:mrow><mml:mi>e</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mo>-</mml:mo><mml:mfrac bevelled="true"><mml:mrow><mml:mi>t</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mi>τ</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mn>1</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:msub></mml:mrow></mml:mfrac></mml:mrow></mml:msup><mml:mo>+</mml:mo><mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mi>A</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mn>2</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:msup><mml:mrow><mml:mi>e</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mo>-</mml:mo><mml:mfrac bevelled="true"><mml:mrow><mml:mi>t</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mi>τ</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mn>2</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:msub></mml:mrow></mml:mfrac></mml:mrow></mml:msup></mml:math></inline-formula>). <italic>Left:</italic> measured response (black) and response predicted by a LN model (cyan/purple) for DM1 ORNs and PNs.

Therefore, we tested the response in glomerulus DM1 to six concentrations of methyl acetate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>) and compared response dynamics as well as changes in gain or other non-linearities of the response. Odor-evoked responses to higher stimulus concentrations can be fitted with similar monophasic linear filters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>). Linear filters can also be extracted after deconvolution of the sensor kinetics. In this case, they are faster and with a small negative lobe (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2I</xref>) but are consistently similar at all concentrations.</p><p>In order to quantify possible non-linearities in the response, we plotted the measured calcium signals against the convolution of the linear filter with the stimulus (See Materials and methods, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>, gray dots). This relationship could be fitted by a linear function at low concentrations and by a sigmoidal function at higher concentrations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>, colored lines). This so-called Linear Non-linear (LN) model (linear filter and static non-linear function) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Chichilnisky, 2001</xref>) predicts well the calcium response of the glomerulus at all concentrations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>, colored lines). Interestingly, the slope of the static function decreases with higher stimulus concentrations (note log scale in the x-axis), indicating a decreased response gain. We asked whether this different gain is a result of adaptation to the different concentrations or whether it reflects a front-end non-linearity in the receptor response. It has been shown before that the response to stimuli that shut to zero (plume-like or binary stimuli) are indeed affected by the receptor non-linearity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Gorur-Shandilya et al., 2017</xref>). This is due to the fact that the neuron firing rate in response to isolated odor pulses does not grow linearly with stimulus concentration, but rather shows a sigmoidal dose response curve (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">de Bruyne et al., 2001</xref>). Therefore, we estimated a front-end non-linearity by fitting a Hill function to the mean peak response estimated at each stimulus intensity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G</xref>). When using this non-linearity in front of the LN model (see Materials and methods, NLN model), the static functions overlap onto a similar shape (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2H</xref>), also when using the sensor-deconvolved calcium response (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2J</xref>). The response gain shows only a small dependency on stimulus mean (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2J</xref>, inset), demonstrating that a single model of the calcium signals is sufficient to describe the neurons’ responses at all stimulus intensities. These results suggest that, apart from a fast transient in the response, little stimulus-driven adaptation occurs in the pre-synaptic calcium at the ORN axon terminals in response to binary stimuli when front-end non-linearities are taken in account.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Background adaptation in ORN firing rate and presynaptic calcium response</title><p>It has been previously shown that the response sensitivity of ORNs decreases when they have adapted to an odor background (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Martelli et al., 2013</xref>) and that the ORN firing rate follows the Weber-Fechner law (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Cafaro, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Gorur-Shandilya et al., 2017</xref>). If calcium dynamics in the ORNs axon terminals were just a proxy for the neurons’ firing activity, then similar properties should be observed in the calcium responses. Therefore, we measured how firing rate and calcium are affected by adaptation to an odor background (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). Single sensillum recordings (SSR) from ab2A show that the firing rate elicited by a pulse of methyl acetate is lower when the pulse is presented on a background of the same odor (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B,D,E</xref>). On the contrary, the calcium response from the axon terminals of the same ORN type (innervating DM4) is not decreased by an adapting background; rather it is slightly increased (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C,D,E</xref>). Similar results were obtained with GCaMP6f (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>). To demonstrate that this property of the calcium dynamics cannot be explained by the sensor kinetics, we have convolved the firing rate with a linear filter modeling the kinetics of the sensors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Schnell et al., 2014</xref>)(<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref>). For both GCaMP3 and GCaMP6f, the model predicts a decrease in activity during background presentation and a lower response to the odor pulse. Rather, the actual calcium response is sustained on long timescales and remains always approximately constant (or slightly higher) in response to a pulse independent of background concentration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3G</xref>). We could conclude that calcium in axonal terminals encodes the actual stimulus concentration rather than the change in concentration. However, this is not the case when the test pulse is lower than the background: in this case the calcium response becomes lower than in the non-adapted condition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3G</xref>, orange). To make sure that in our experiment we did not saturate the receptor response, the calcium signal or the calcium sensor, we have measured both the firing rate and the calcium response for increasing concentrations of the odor (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3H</xref>). We found that the same stimuli elicit a similar range of responses in firing rate and presynaptic calcium. Firing rate adaptation occurs for all tested pulse concentrations, even for those close to saturation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3I</xref>, top). On the contrary, glomerular calcium responses do not decrease upon adaptation, unless the adapting background is higher than the test pulse (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3I</xref>, bottom). Similar results were obtained for glomerulus DM1 (ab1B) and using the calcium reporter GCaMP6f (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>). It seems unlikely that non-linearities in the sensor kinetics can explain these results. On one end, saturation of the sensor would not allow the increase in fluorescence observed for the pulses on a background. On the other end, it could be that when the basal calcium is elevated the sensor kinetics enter a regime of larger gain. However, similar results were obtained also for responses in the low range of the firing-to-calcium calibration curve (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3H</xref>), suggesting that the calcium sensor is in a linear regime of responsiveness. We conclude that glomerular calcium responses do not reflect adaptation observed in firing rate and encode increases and decreases in concentration differently.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig3" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.43735.006</object-id><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>Background adaptation in ORN firing rate and calcium responses.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Stimulus protocol: a pulse of methyl acetate (10<sup>-8.5</sup> dilution) was presented first isolated and on top of a background of the same odor at lower concentration (10<sup>−9</sup>) delivered for 15 s.

We have noted already that whereas the ORNs followed the odorant dynamics in a sustained way, the responses of PNs slowly decreased (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). It reproducibly took approximately 20 s until the calcium dynamics reached a steady state. A slow change in the electrophysiological activity of PNs has been observed upon the onset of a flickering stimulus in flies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Nagel et al., 2015</xref>) and moths (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Jacob et al., 2017</xref>). We quantified this slow decrease by taking the peak response to individual pulses in the pseudorandom sequence and fitting an exponential function to it (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A-B</xref>). The PN responses in DM1 decreased to ~50% of the initial response (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>, purple). The decay timescales extracted by the exponential fit ranged between 3 and 10 s for DM1 and showed no dependency on the initial response (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>). The activity recovered from this slow adaptation within a minute (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>) and it is therefore of a different nature than what was previously observed in the locust (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Stopfer and Laurent, 1999</xref>) or in the fly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Das et al., 2011</xref>).

By contrast, the PN responses in all glomeruli were adaptive, with a mean degree of adaptation across glomeruli equal to 0.57 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref>). The adaptation timescale had no clear relation to the amount of initial activity of the glomerulus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4G</xref>).

The effect of this inhibition should already be observable in the presynaptic calcium signals that we measured in ORNs. However, since the presynaptic calcium does not adapt, it makes it an unlikely mechanism. To rule this out, we expressed a previously described GABA-B receptor RNAi construct (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Root et al., 2008</xref>) in ORNs and measured responses from PNs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>). This manipulation affected the initial response of DM4 PNs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figures 5E-F</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>), but not the degree and timescale of adaptation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F</xref>). It is possible that the RNAi has an incomplete effect. Therefore, we have tested the GABA-B antagonist CGP54626 and the agonist SKF97541, which have been shown to increase or decrease the calcium response in ORNs axon terminals, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Root et al., 2008</xref>). CGP54626 application increased the response of glomerulus VM2 to ethyl butyrate and slightly increased the response of DM4, but did not affect DM1 response to methyl acetate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5G</xref>), in agreement with the results obtained with the RNAi line. Accordingly, the response of both DM1 ORNs and PNs remained unchanged after CGP54626 application. Therefore, even though GABA-B mediate inhibition can affect presynaptic activity, the timescales and degree of the stimulus driven depression are not directly controlled by GABA-B (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5I</xref>). Treatment with the GABA-B agonist SKF97541 decreased the ORN response in all three glomeruli measured (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5H</xref>), demonstrating that also DM1 response can be reduced via GABA-B. Interestingly, tonic inhibition of the GABA-B receptors strongly affected the response to a fluctuating stimulus. In DM1 ORNs, the response to the first odor pulse was lower after application of SKF97541 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5J</xref>, top), similarly to the response to the isolated puff, but it increased over the following odor pulses. In PNs, on the contrary, the response slowly decreased and almost disappeared (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5J</xref>, bottom). This suggests that the effect of lateral inhibition is activity dependent and tightly tuned to the stimulus input through complex interactions in the AL network, as also shown in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Nagel et al. (2015)</xref>. Since the PNs' slow adaptation was observed also in conditions of reduced lateral input, we conclude that GABA-mediated lateral inhibition does not constitute the main mechanisms of the adaptation.</p></sec><sec id="s2-6"><title>The slow adaptation of PNs correlates with a decrease in presynaptic vesicle release</title><p>The slow adaptation in PNs was also observed at low stimulus concentrations that activated only a single glomerulus, suggesting that the mechanism could be intrinsic to the single glomeruli and not due to computation across glomeruli. In order to more directly test synaptic activity, we used a post-synaptically targeted calcium sensors (<italic>d</italic>Homer-GCaMP) and a red fluorescent sensor for synaptic vesicle release (Syp-pHTomato) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Pech et al., 2015</xref>). The dynamics of postsynaptic calcium in PNs resembled that measured with the cytosolic calcium reporters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>). Interestingly, we observed that vesicle release from ORNs monitored using Syp-pHTomato showed a slow decrease equivalent to the dynamics of the postsynaptic calcium (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>). To properly characterize these dynamics, we fitted a LN model to the steady-state Syp-pHTomato signal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>) that accurately predicted the synaptic activity of glomerulus DM1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E</xref>). Because the Syp-pHTomato sensor had weaker baseline fluorescence intensity than the GCaMP-based calcium reporters, fewer glomeruli gave measurable responses. We monitored unambiguous and robust responses from five glomeruli (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplements 1</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">2</xref>). Then, we used the Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC) to select which of three models (a single exponential, an exponential plus a constant, or a double exponential function) best fits each linear filter (see Materials and methods). In all cases, the linear filter of the Syp-pHTomato signal could be fitted by a double exponential with a positive (A<sub>1</sub> &gt;0) and negative (A<sub>2</sub> &lt;0) component (BIC &lt;0, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D and F</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>). The positive component had a relatively fast timescale (τ<sub>1</sub>~300–400 ms, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6G</xref>), similar to the calcium dynamics reported by GCaMP3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>). The negative component instead had a much slower timescale (<italic>τ</italic><sub>2</sub>) of the order of ~10 s (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6G</xref>). We reasoned that this slow negative component could be responsible for the slow adaptation observed in PNs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). If this was the case, the slow timescale of the Syp-pHTomato should be glomerulus and concentration dependent, similar to what we observed for the calcium dynamics (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>). Indeed, it correlates significantly with the corresponding timescales fitted to the decay in cytosolic calcium in PNs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6H</xref>).

The linear filter of the PNs is not monophasic, as for the corresponding ORNs, but shows a negative component (see DM2 in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A and E</xref>). This biphasic filter is consistent with short-term depression at the ORN-PN synapses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Kazama and Wilson, 2008</xref>) and indicates that PNs further differentiate incoming odor signals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Cafaro, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Kim et al., 2015</xref>). Importantly, the PNs linear filters gradually shifted from biphasic to monophasic as the concentration increased (e.g. DM1 in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7E</xref>). These concentration dependent differences were observed also after deconvolution of the sensor kinetics (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7F</xref>).</p><p>The LN model captured most of the variance in the data equally well at low and high concentrations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1</xref>), although it failed to capture a drop in the calcium signal induced by longer pulses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s2">Figure 7—figure supplement 2A–C</xref>). Again, we used BIC to select the most parsimonious model that fits the linear filters. For several glomeruli, the best-fitted function was a double exponential with a slow negative component (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7G,H</xref>, τ<sub>2</sub> ~1.2 s). However, we found a significant dependence of the model selected on the response amplitude: the filter shape was usually monophasic at very low responses, biphasic at intermediate responses, and then again monophasic at high responses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s2">Figure 7—figure supplement 2D</xref>, Kruskal-Wallis test, p&lt;0.02).

One possible interpretation of our results is that at low responses there is little synaptic depression between ORNs and PNs, which becomes stronger at intermediate stimulus intensity, making the PN response more biphasic and differentiating. Stronger responses probably engage additional mechanisms (lateral inputs or postsynaptic modulation) with their own dynamics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Geffen et al., 2009</xref>) and also drive the response towards saturation. Summing feedforward ORN inputs through depressing synapses with stimulus-specific lateral inputs certainly induce strong non-linearities in the PN output dynamics across concentrations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s2">Figure 7—figure supplement 2A–C</xref>), similarly to what found in mitral/tufted cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Gupta et al., 2015</xref>). In conclusion, the LN model confirms that PNs calcium responses are more adaptive than ORNs, and the specific dynamics (filter shape) of different glomeruli are concentration dependent.</p></sec><sec id="s2-8"><title>Slow adaptation linearly rescales the combinatorial odor representation in PNs</title><p>We then asked what the slow adaptation of PN activity implies for the combinatorial odor representation in the population of PNs. For each glomerulus and concentration, we quantified the peak response to each of the odor pulses in the random sequence (as in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>) and used it to compare the combinatorial odor representations in ORNs and PNs using principal component analysis (PCA). Combinatorial ORN responses were stationary over a time period of 2 min and, consequently, the population responses to the first odor pulse were very similar to the responses to a pulse 2 min later (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8A</xref>). On the contrary, the combinatorial representation of the stimulus changed over time in PNs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8B</xref>). Since the calcium signal from single glomeruli decreased proportionally to the peak response (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>), the combinatorial activity represented by the PC1 scaled linearly and resulted in a multiplicative rescaling of the ORN-to-PN transformation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8C</xref>).

Increasing the concentration of an odorant led to more active glomeruli by recruiting ORNs that express receptors with lower odorant affinities (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9A</xref>). As the concentration increased, the response of ORNs in individual glomeruli saturated and their dynamic range shrank, as shown by the large offset in the static nonlinearity for high concentrations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9B</xref>, top). However, responses of the corresponding PNs spanned a wider dynamic range (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9B</xref>, bottom). This suggests that, in ORNs, the coding of stimulus fluctuations might shift from one subset of glomeruli to another as the odorant concentration changes while being more distributed in the population of PNs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s1">Figure 8—figure supplement 1</xref>). As shown above (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>), the representation of a fluctuating stimulus was mainly unidimensional in the glomerular space. For increasing odorant concentrations in ORNs, the dynamic range of the combinatorial representation shifted along this single dimension (x-axis, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9C</xref>), whereas in PNs the dynamic range stretched (y-axis, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9C</xref>). Accordingly, the variance of the response scaled differently between PNs and ORNs (bars, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9C</xref>). In our experimental design, the standard deviation (<inline-formula><mml:math id="inf30"><mml:mi>σ</mml:mi></mml:math></inline-formula>) and the mean (<inline-formula><mml:math id="inf31"><mml:mi>m</mml:mi></mml:math></inline-formula>) of the random stimulus scaled linearly with the odorant concentration.

The CV of the neural response is expected to be lower because of the neuron integration time (CV = 0.45; see Materials and methods), but still independent of concentration if the coding of stimulus fluctuations was accurate. Interestingly, we found that although the CV dropped from 0.45 to 0.15 in ORNs as concentration increased, it stayed fairly constant in PNs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9D</xref>). These results were valid for a second odorant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9A'-9D'</xref>).

However, identifying the contribution of individual processes is challenging. Here, we used imaging of synaptic activity to isolate the mechanisms underlying adaptation along the olfactory pathway in <italic>Drosophila</italic>. Our experiments revealed that presynaptic calcium signals from the primary olfactory sensors, the ORNs, as reported by fluorescent indicators, do not show the same adaptation properties as the firing measured in the dendrites of the same neurons. How to explain these findings?</p><p>On short timescales (~100 ms), the true calcium dynamics are certainly affected by the sensor kinetics and a linear deconvolution (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>) recapitulates some of the phasic properties of the firing rate. This kind of approach is reasonable, but not exhaustive as it doesn’t take into account possible non-linearities in the sensor kinetics. However, a direct comparison between firing rate and calcium response to isolated odor pulses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>) demonstrates a striking correspondence in two neuron types, suggesting a similar working range of the sensor in these two cell types. This is in general an assumption when comparing calcium dynamics across neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Si et al., 2019</xref>). As it is difficult to make a cell-specific calibration of the sensor in vivo, the same model is assumed for all conditions and therefore deconvolution leaves cell- or stimulus-specific differences in kinetics unaffected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2E,I</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">7B,F</xref>).</p><p>Following the phasic response, adaptation should drive a change in response properties, usually a decreased responsiveness. Here, we have investigated changes in response gain using both a sustained flickering stimulus and a steady background stimulation. In both cases we do not observe the changes expected from firing rate activity. How could that be?</p><p>Inhibitory lateral inputs have their own transient dynamics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Nagel et al., 2015</xref>), therefore one possibility could be that inhibition suppresses the initial calcium response stronger than the later response. This later relief from inhibition could account for an overall sustained response. However, we observed sustained activity in ORNs even at very low concentrations that activate a single glomerulus and the sustained ORN response could not be altered by blocking GABA receptors.</p><p>Another possibility is that not all presynaptic calcium measured in our experiments is involved in vesicle release. For example, there could be two components, one that follows firing activity and allows the release of vesicles and a second one involved in vesicle recycling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Rizzoli, 2014</xref>). However, both should be driven by the odor stimulus and have perfectly balanced dynamics, one adaptive and one facilitating so that the summed calcium is tonic. The other possibility is that calcium at the ORNs presynapses is regulated in a way to extract certain features of the stimulus from firing activity, either by lateral inputs or cell autonomously, for example through expression of different voltage-gated calcium channels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Gu et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Iniguez et al., 2013</xref>), activity-dependent modulation of their expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Gratz et al., 2018</xref>) and function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Dason et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>These two possibilities do not only differ at a mechanistic level, but also at the functional level. While it remains certainly true that the firing rate follows the Weber-Fechner law and adapts to stimulus mean and variance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Gorur-Shandilya et al., 2017</xref>), the implications for coding are different depending on whether these properties are transmitted downstream from the antenna or whether they play a different function in calcium regulation at the presynapses. Further mechanistic insight should be gathered in the future by investigating the underlying molecular mechanisms, for example calcium channels expressed in these neurons and possible modulators of their activity.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Synaptic depression as a mechanism for adaptation</title><p>Previous studies have suggested that the PN adaptive capabilities rely mostly on properties of the ORN-PN synapses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Cafaro, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Kazama and Wilson, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Nagel et al., 2015</xref>). Here, we show that a combination of slow and fast dynamics occurs at these synapses that allows the population of PNs to maintain a neural representation of the stimulus identity and statistics (i.e. mean and variance). On short timescales, PNs calcium responses can be modeled by fast biphasic linear filters that underlie their capability to sense fast changes in concentration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bhandawat et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Kim et al., 2015</xref>). This biphasic response is consistent with the property and function of previously described short-term presynaptic depression, a mechanisms that enhances neural temporal coding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Tsodyks and Markram, 1997</xref>) as reported also in other insects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Huston et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>Here, using an optical imaging approach, we identified a slower component in the dynamics of the presynapses that would otherwise be difficult to isolate. pH-dependent sensors of synaptic vesicle release have been previously used in both vertebrates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Dreosti et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Miesenböck et al., 1998</xref>) and insects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Ng et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Pech et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Yu et al., 2004</xref>). In particular, they made it possible to characterize synaptic depression and facilitation that mediate adaptation in the visual system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Nikolaev et al., 2013</xref>). These forms of short-term plasticity result mostly from an interplay between calcium-dependent modulation of the probability of vesicle release and the depletion of available vesicles. The simplest model of synaptic depression consists of a finite pool of ready-releasable vesicles that is replenished from an infinite pool at a certain limiting rate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abbott, 1997</xref>). However, synaptic depression can be more complex than that. Synaptic depression at the neuromuscular junctions of <italic>Drosophila</italic> larva can be described by a model in which the supply pool is finite and is itself replenished at slower time-scales (~10 s) by a larger reservoir (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Hallermann et al., 2010</xref>). However, other models are also possible and our current understanding of ORN-to-PN synapses is insufficient to point to a specific one.</p><p>The interplay between feedforward depression and lateral inputs on slow timescales remains to be further investigated. Although our analysis excludes a direct role of inhibition on the PNs adaptation, inhibitory presynaptic inputs do play a role in modulating depression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Olsen and Wilson, 2008</xref>). However, in presence of a sustained stimulus that activates multiple glomeruli, tonic activation of the GABA-ergic pathway does not simply decrease presynaptic activity releasing depression, as one would expect, rather it disrupts the entraining of the network with the stimulus, resulting in a loss of temporal resolution and response in PNs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5J</xref>). It is likely that under sustained stimulation, changes in the activity of LNs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Nagel et al., 2015</xref>) as well as recurrent connections within the AL could affect the coupling between inhibition and depression at the ORN presynapses. Finally, it remains unclear whether the slow adaptation described here can be solely explained by presynaptic mechanisms or whether involves post-synaptic dynamics as well (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Cafaro, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Nagel et al., 2015</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Fast and slow adaptation across sensory modalities</title><p>In different sensory modalities across species, adaptation to stimulus statistics occurs not only at different levels along sensory pathways but also on different timescales. For example, retinal ganglion cells adapt their sensitivity to a change in the visual stimulus on both short (&lt;100 ms) and slow timescales (~10 s) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chander and Chichilnisky, 2001</xref>). Similarly, auditory neurons in songbirds slowly adapt their firing to stimulus variance, but instantaneously adapt their filter shape and gain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Nagel and Doupe, 2006</xref>). These two forms of adaptation play different roles in sensory coding. Fast adaptation acts as a gain control mechanism that prevents saturation by decreasing sensitivity, while slow adaptation allows adjustment to the overall variance of the stimulus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Baccus and Meister, 2002</xref>). Adaptation can, in principle, occur on a continuum of timescales, from milliseconds to minutes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Fairhall et al., 2001</xref>) and involve several mechanisms. It can rely on physiological mechanisms within a single cell (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Toib et al., 1998</xref>) or, alternatively, result from neuronal network dynamics. For example, potassium conductance mediates slow contrast adaptation in visual cortical neurons by a purely cellular mechanism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Sanchez-Vives et al., 2000</xref>). Network mechanisms can explain slow adaptation in ganglion cells as a result of reduced presynaptic glutamate release (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Manookin and Demb, 2006</xref>). Both depression and facilitation mediate adaptation to contrast in the zebrafish retina (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Nikolaev et al., 2013</xref>). Here, we report that not only fast, but also slow adaptation in the olfactory PNs of <italic>Drosophila</italic> can be attributed to depression of presynaptic activity. Our data, together with previously reported fast and slow postsynaptic currents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Nagel et al., 2015</xref>), support a major role of the synapse in adaptive coding. These findings do not exclude that additional network or cellular mechanisms are involved in adaptation on different timescales or under different stimulus conditions.</p></sec><sec id="s3-4"><title>Divisive normalization and variance coding</title><p>Previous studies have identified divisive normalization as a neural computation implemented in the antennal lobe by a network of inhibitory local interneurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Olsen et al., 2010</xref>), which scales the response of single neurons by the overall population activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Carandini and Heeger, 2011</xref>). It can serve a diversity of functions, but in the olfactory system it is believed to enhance the dynamic range of PNs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Galizia, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Wang, 2012</xref>). How do our results relate to these findings? <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Root et al. (2008)</xref> have shown that GABA and the expression of GABA-B receptors in ORNs mediate this lateral inhibition by modulating calcium responses in ORN terminals. Therefore, presynaptic lateral inhibition should not be the main determinant of the ORN-to-PN transformation described here, although it of course affects presynaptic activity. This is consistent with our finding that manipulations of GABAergic pathways do not interfere with the slow adaptation of PNs. We conclude that divisive normalization and slow depression are two complementary mechanisms that adjust the PNs dynamic range. While the lateral inhibition scales responses based on overall network activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Olsen et al., 2010</xref>), the slow depression described here adjusts the response gain to the statistics (mean and variance) of the incoming stimuli. Moreover, lateral inhibition depends on the connectivity of the AL network and, therefore, affects different glomeruli differently. On the contrary, the slow adaptation depends on feed-forward connectivity and proportionally scales combinatorial odor presentations. It remains unclear whether lateral inhibition contribute to this proportional scaling of the response through a stimulus-driven change in the LNs response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Nagel et al., 2015</xref>). Finally, lateral inhibition might also play an important role in the context of cross-adaptation between different odors and deserve further attention.</p></sec><sec id="s3-5"><title>Consequences for population coding and behavior</title><p>The perceptual effects of adaptation as a decreased sensitivity to the stimulus are usually more evident in presence of a sharp change in the stimulus properties. A recent work on odor driven walking behavior has shown that flies respond with an increase in upwind velocity to odor onset which adapts on a timescale of ~10 s (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Álvarez-Salvado et al., 2018</xref>). This adaptation timescale cannot be explained with ORN firing rate adaptation (that is much faster ~100 ms), but it is surprisingly in agreement with the slow presynaptic depression identified here. Animals that use olfaction to localize a source will likely implement different strategies depending on the statistics of the odor landscape (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Baker et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Gaudry et al., 2012</xref>) and the availability of different timescales for the sensory processing of the stimulus may allow them to flexibly adapt their search strategy.</p><p>On the other hand the identity of a stimulus must be maintained as neural activity when the stimulus statistics change or the sensory system adapts to sustained stimuli (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Dean et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Gutnisky and Dragoi, 2008</xref>). Here, we have demonstrated that a linear combination of glomeruli activity represents the stimulus identity during a highly dynamic stimulation and this combination scales proportionally for different mean values of this stimulus. This combinatorial representation is stationary over time in ORNs, but undergoes a slow rearrangement in the space of PNs. This rearrangement consists of a linear scaling of population activity that preserves information about both stimulus identity (same population of neurons) and intensity (same order of stimuli). Animals that navigate a turbulent odor landscape will experience increased stimulus variance and increased stimulus intensity as they approach the odor source (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Celani et al., 2014</xref>). The mechanisms described here can explain how odor perception is preserved while the animal moves toward an odor source and the sensory system dynamically adjusts its activity to better represent the statistical context of the odor signal.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Fly strains</title><p>Flies were raised on cornmeal food at 25°C and 60% humidity under controlled 12 hr light/dark cycles.

Therefore, we decided to have a minimum n = 5 across all experiments. For those experiments that required the identification of multiple glomeruli in the same animal, it was necessary to acquired data from about 9–11 animals: the final sample size varies depending on whether specific glomeruli were identifiable in the different preparations.

The odor stream was kept at equilibrium with the liquid phase and continuously removed through a large suction tube to keep the experimental chamber clean. We used four mass flow controllers (MFCs; Alicat Scientific) to create gas dilutions of the odorant. Solenoid valves and MFCs were remotely controlled in MATLAB (Mathworks) through an Arduino board. 20 mL of odorant were prepared in high concentration (10<sup>−2</sup> volumetric ratio in paraffin oil) in 150 mL glass bottles placed on a magnetic stirrer. Odor stream concentration was left to equilibrate for 20 min at the minimum flow (10<sup>−4</sup> mL/min). The ratio of the flow through the four MFCs was adjusted remotely to obtain the desired concentration. Once a ratio was set, the odor flow was left to equilibrate for 3 min. Then, a 2-min-long pseudorandom stimulus was applied. The stimulus was generated by randomly choosing the state of the valve (open/closed) every 300 ms. Different odor concentrations were presented to the same animal in random order with a 3 min interval between them. Final gas volumetric dilutions used in the experiment were as follows: C<sub>1</sub> = 10<sup>−5</sup>, C<sub>2</sub> = 10<sup>-4.3</sup>, C<sub>4</sub> = 10<sup>−4</sup>, C<sub>5</sub> = 10<sup>-3.7</sup>, C<sub>8</sub> = 10<sup>-3.3</sup>, C<sub>13</sub> = 10<sup>−3</sup>, and C<sub>22</sub> = 10<sup>-2.3</sup>.

To do this, fluorescence intensity was resampled by interpolation at exact multiples of the actual mean frame rate.

Your article has being evaluated by three peer reviewers, and the evaluation has being overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Ronald Calabrese as the Senior Editor.</p><p>Given the list of essential revisions, including new experiments, the editors and reviewers invite you to respond within the next two weeks with an action plan and timetable for the completion of the additional work.

They show that calcium signals in dendrites of second-order projection neurons (PNs) adapt to flickering stimuli whereas those in axons of presynaptic olfactory receptor neurons (ORNs) do not. Reporters of vesicular release expressed in ORNs exhibited adaptation at similar time scale as PN dendritic calcium signals suggesting that decrease in vesicular release is the mechanisms underlying adaptation. The reviewers agree that the strongest and most interesting result in the paper is the finding that the slow decay in PN response is likely due to changes in presynaptic release. The manuscript would be improved if it were re-organized to focus on the exciting PN results. The reviewers also raised two concerns that would need to be addressed experimentally as well as a number of textual clarifications, as outlined below.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The finding that ORNs show no evidence of adaptation at the level of calcium signals in ORN terminals is contrary to all previous studies of ORN sensory responses using electrophysiology. It is possible that all forms of ORN adaptation are undone by the spike-to-calcium transformation, however this needs to be explicitly demonstrated and explained, given the bold nature of the claim. Calibration/controls need to be performed to be sure that any form of adaptation is not simply lost to the nonlinearities and filtering properties of the indicator(s). Specifically, the authors should couple the imaging results in Figure 1L, where they compare the response to a pulse and the response to a pulse on an odor background, with electrophysiological recordings. They should (1) record ORN spikes with the same odor delivery conditions and show that spikes exhibit adaptation, and (2) deliver a series of odor pulses of different concentrations and record ORN spikes and also Ca<sup>2+</sup> responses to the same stimuli to figure out where the indicator saturates. If the authors showed that ORN spiking shows canonical adaptation and that the GCaMP signal is not saturated, this would strengthen the findings on ORN calcium signals. In addition, the authors should discuss potential nonlinearities in their calcium indicator and how that impacts and limits interpretations, placing them in context with previous electrophysiological results.</p><p>2) The claim that PN adaptation primarily reflects synaptic depression should be supported by additional evidence. RNAi effects can be incomplete; therefore the authors should block GABA-B signaling using pharmacology (CGP 54626) and examine its effects on PN decay. This manipulation was previously shown to increase the rate of decay in PNs, consistent with the idea that presynaptic GABA-B receptors regulate synaptic depression (Olsen, 2008; Root, 2008). They could also try to activate GABA-B receptors using SKF 97541 (Root, 2008) which should reduce synaptic depression. Application of low concentrations of Cd<sup>2+</sup> (Kazama, 2008) can also be used to manipulate synaptic depression. Combining these pharmacological manipulations with imaging of presynaptic release and PN decay would more firmly establish that synaptic depression is responsible for the observed decay.</p><p>3) The paper uses two conceptually distinct definitions for adaptation. In analyzing linear filters, the bilobed filters are called 'adaptation', since their step response returns towards baseline (Figure 1D). Later, in analyzing long timescale changes in PN responses, adaptation is a multiplicative gain change (Figure 3, and subsection “Slow Adaptation in Odor-Evoked Calcium Activity of PNs”). Still later, in the CV analysis (Figure 7), ORN calcium indicator responses appear to change gain multiplicatively. At a minimum, the authors should clarify and distinguish between these different response properties. Though previous analyses have called bilobed impulse responses 'adapting' (for instance Howard Berg's early measurements in bacteria), in my view a good operational definition of adaptation might be 'a change in the processing properties of a cell'. Under that definition, a linear filter shape alone would not be viewed as adapting.</p><p>4) The LN models that are central to this paper could be improved by choosing a good way to scale the filter. The x-axis in Figures 1G, 6B, 7BB' have arbitrary units, and can be scaled differently depending on filter and stimulus. I did not understand why this was labeled 'predicted linear response ΔF/F' throughout. If it was indeed the predicted linear response, then the best fit slope of f*s plotted against r should equal 1 (by definition). Previous work (Baccus and Meister) has scaled the filter so that the variance of f*s is equal to the variance of s. I believe this would provide a clearer view of things, but a consistent scaling must be chosen to make nonlinearity shapes comparable throughout. Without doing that, the nonlinearities are essentially not possible to compare.</p><p>In addition, the authors should make some attempt to deconvolve the contribution of the indicator to the linear filters as was done in Schnell, 2014. Otherwise the filter parameters they are reporting are mostly properties of the indicator (hence the difference between GCaMP3 and GCaMP6 filters).</p><p>5) The time constant of a negative component (τ<sub>2</sub>) of a linear filter fitted to PN calcium signals was very different between figures. About 1 s in Figure 1D (rather fast), about 10 s in Figure 4N (rather slow, and similar to ORN vesicular release), and about 1 s in Figure 6 (rather fast). Why is the time scale so different between experiments? In Figure 6, odor concentration was varied, but τ<sub>2</sub> never reached close to 10 s. Therefore, the difference in odor concentration used cannot be the explanation.</p><p>Related to this, because the shape of the filter is heavily dependent on odor concentration, I think it is useful to describe this earlier. My suggestion is to bring Figure 6 just after Figure 2 that describes the results of similar experiments but for ORNs.</p><p>In addition to these essential revisions, there are a number of text changes that are noted in the individual reviews below. These are straightforward to complete.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic> </p><p>Neurons are capable of adapting to stimuli that fluctuate over time. In this manuscript, Martelli and Fiala focus on olfactory neurons in <italic>Drosophila</italic> and characterize adaptation at multiple successive steps in the signal processing using imaging. They show that calcium signals in dendrites of second-order projection neurons (PNs) adapt to flickering stimuli whereas those in axons of presynaptic olfactory receptor neurons (ORNs) do not. Reporters of vesicular release expressed in ORNs exhibited adaptation at similar time scale as PN dendritic calcium signals suggesting that decrease in vesicular release is the mechanisms underlying adaptation. Perhaps the most notable finding is that while ORNs exhibit adaptation in terms of spikes, they do not in terms of presynaptic calcium (The reason behind it remains unknown). Although these results represent some contribution to the field, I have several major concerns and suggestions.</p><p>1) The title of the manuscript is &quot;Adaptation on multiple timescales&quot; and the text refers to both fast and slow adaptation. However, the study mainly focuses on the slow component and the distinction between fast and slow adaptation was not clear.</p><p>2) Inconsistency in the time scale of a negative component. The time constant of a negative component (τ<sub>2</sub>) of a linear filter fitted to PN calcium signals was very different between figures. About 1 s in Figure 1D (rather fast), about 10 s in Figure 4N (rather slow, and similar to ORN vesicular release), and about 1 s in Figure 6 (rather fast). Why is the time scale so different between experiments? In Figure 6, odor concentration was varied, but τ<sub>2</sub> never reached close to 10s. Therefore, the difference in odor concentration used cannot be the explanation.</p><p>Related to this, because the shape of the filter is heavily dependent on odor concentration, I think it is useful to describe this earlier. My suggestion is to bring Figure 6 just after Figure 2 that describes the results of similar experiments but for ORNs.</p><p>3) Although the authors use the term &quot;combinatorial/population activity/representation&quot; to describe the results in Figures 5 and 7, this is an overstatement. In Figure 5, for example, PC1 already captures 95 and 97% of response variance for methyl acetate and benzaldehyde, respectively. This reflects the fact that 3 out of 5 texted glomeruli show little response and the remaining two glomeruli show highly correlated activity. This means that the results of analyses won't change if PC1 was replaced with either DM1 or DM4. Similar argument applies to Figure 7. Because addition of multiple glomeruli does not add any information, text on population/combinatorial activity should be removed.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic> </p><p>Martelli and Fiala measured calcium signals in <italic>Drosophila</italic> ORNs, PNs, and LNs in response to time varying stochastic odorant signals. They fitted LN models to these stimulus-response traces to investigate the dynamics and adaptation of responses at the first olfactory synapse. Based on their analysis, they drew several conclusions: (1) ORN calcium dynamics are distinct from ORN firing rate properties (measured elsewhere), (2) PNs adapt on fast and slow timescales, and (3) the slow adaptation observed in PNs is due to presynaptic changes in vesicle release.</p><p>The analysis in support of point (3) is nicely done, but I believe there are some issues to be resolved with analysis supporting claims (1) and (2).</p><p>1) The paper uses two conceptually distinct definitions for adaptation. In analyzing linear filters, the bilobed filters are called 'adaptation', since their step response returns towards baseline (Figure 1D). Later, in analyzing long timescale changes in PN responses, adaptation is a multiplicative gain change (Figure 3, and subsection “Slow Adaptation in Odor-Evoked Calcium Activity of PNs”). Still later, in the CV analysis (Figure 7), ORN calcium indicator responses appear to change gain multiplicatively.

Though previous analyses have called bilobed impulse responses 'adapting' (for instance Howard Berg's early measurements in bacteria), in my view a good operational definition of adaptation might be 'a change in the processing properties of a cell'. Under that definition, a linear filter shape alone would not be viewed as adapting.</p><p>2) This paper makes several claims about ORN response properties in calcium that are quite different from those measured in ORN spikes or LFP. Given that the calcium indicator is a nonlinear read out of calcium concentration, the authors should do more to explain how these differences could arise, or explain what differences between experiments could account for them.</p><p>a) Recent papers have reported bi-phasic impulse responses in ORN firing rates and LFP measurements (Martelli et al., Gorur-Shandilya et al.). In Figure 1, the authors show that calcium signals are not biphasic. I found the discussion of this difference a little lacking – how could this difference come to be?</p><p>b) My reading of Figure 1L and related prose was that calcium in ORN axon terminals represents actual concentration and is not subject to the adaptation (or cross-adaptation) that has been reported in the spiking. This may well be true, but is there a proposed mechanism by which this could work? It seems hard to explain. This seems to conflict with ORN spiking measured in Martelli et al., Gorur-Shandilya et al., and Nagel et al., so some kind of proposal as to why seems required.</p><p>c) At least two recent papers have reported that ORNs show Weber-like gain scaling (Cao et al. and Gorur-Shandilya et al.). Here, Figures 2 and Figure 1—figure supplement 2 showed all filters normalized to the same scale, so it was hard to see any gain changes. Do these calcium filters support Weber-like gain scaling at the ORN axon? I could not tell. But based on Figure 7, it looks like not. Again, it's not clear to me how this could occur (i.e., undoing an upstream gain change seems mechanistically difficult), or whether I'm misunderstanding the results presented here.</p><p>3) In Figure 7, the authors report that the CV is conserved in PNs but not ORNs. Here, it also seems possible (or likely) that the calcium indicator is saturating, or that nonlinearities in the indicator are dominating the ORN results, especially given how different GC3 and GC6 look when directly compared with these stimuli. Overall, to draw strong conclusions, the authors should address issues related to potential nonlinearities in their calcium indicator and how that impacts and limits interpretations.</p><p>4) The LN models that are central to this paper could be improved by choosing a good way to scale the filter. The x-axis in Figures 1G, 6B, 7BB' have arbitrary units, and can be scaled differently depending on filter and stimulus. I did not understand why this was labeled 'predicted linear response ΔF/F' throughout. If it was indeed the predicted linear response, then the best fit slope of f*s plotted against r should equal 1 (by definition). Previous work (Baccus and Meister) has scaled the filter so that the variance of f*s is equal to the variance of s. I believe this would provide a clearer view of things, but a consistent scaling must be chosen to make nonlinearity shapes comparable throughout. Without doing that, the nonlinearities are essentially not possible to compare.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic> </p><p>This study uses calcium imaging to characterize changes in temporal encoding between olfactory receptor neurons and projection neurons of the <italic>Drosophila</italic> antennal lobe. Differences in encoding of both odor identity and timing between these two stages of olfactory processing have been extensively investigated using both electrophysiology (Kaissling, 1987; Bhandawat, 2007; Olsen, 2010; Kim, 2010, 2015; Nagel, 2011, 2015; Martelli, 2013; Cafaro, 2016; Gorur-Shandilya, 2017) and imaging (Root 2008) and have been summarized in several reviews (e.g. Wilson, 2013). Current data suggests that multiple stages of adaptation occur at the level of olfactory neuron transduction (Kaissling, Nagel), spike generation (Nagel, Martelli, Gorur-Shandilya), synaptic transmission between ORNs and PNs (Kazama, Nagel), and due to feedback from local interneurons (Olsen, Root, Nagel). The current study differs from previous ones in primarily using calcium imaging to explore questions of temporal encoding.</p><p>Contrary to previous findings, they find no evidence of adaptation in ORNs as measured (mostly) by GCaMP3 fluorescence in ORN terminals. This is surprising, as previous studies have found evidence for adaptation on both short (Martelli, Nagel) and long (Gorur-Shandilya, Nagel) timescales, as well as adaptation to the stimulus mean (Kaissling, Nagel, Gorur-Shandilya) and variance (Gorur-Shandilya). Some attempts are made to control for nonlinearities and temporal filtering by the calcium indicator, however, I think the authors still interpret their results too strongly given the limitations of these methods. The authors do not attempt to calibrate the indicators to determine their temporal resolution or dynamic range, nor do they correct for the contribution of the indicators to the observed filters and nonlinearities computationally. I think these concerns also apply to the conclusions about ORN vs. PN population encoding.</p><p>The study also looks at differences in encoding between ORNs and PNs. They find evidence for a slow decay timescale (~10s) in PNs that is not present in ORNs. A slow timescale of decay in PN responses has been observed previously by Nagel et al., 2015, and has been hypothesized to arise from vesicle depletion. Here the authors provide experimental evidence for this idea by recording both presynaptic calcium, presynaptic release, and postsynaptic calcium. They find that the decay is present in vesicle release measurements and postsynaptic calcium but not presynaptic calcium. This is a nice experiment and contributes to our understanding of adaptation processes in the olfactory system.</p><p>Finally, the authors find that dynamics are not altered by either pharmacological blockade of GABA-A receptors with picrotoxin or presynaptic expression of GABA-B RNAi, and conclude that inhibition plays no role in these dynamics. I think this conclusion is also a bit strong as RNAi blockade can be incomplete.</p><p>1) The finding that ORNs show no evidence of adaptation at the level of calcium signals in ORN terminals is contrary to all previous studies of ORN sensory responses using electrophysiology. It is possible that all forms of ORN adaptation are undone by the spike-to-calcium transformation, however I think this needs to be explicitly demonstrated and explained, given the bold nature of the claim. For example, the authors might use either odor or optogenetics to generate calibrated numbers of spikes in ORNS (as in Jeanne and Wilson, 2005) and then use indicators optimized for detecting single spikes (GCaMP7) to measure the spike-to-calcium transformation. Indicators can be calibrated and their dynamic range determined using the methods of Ryan and colleagues (e.g. Sankaranarayanan and Ryan, 2000). Temporal filtering by the indicator can be deconvolved as in Schnell, Fairhall, and Dickinson, 2014. Finally, a computational model showing how the spike-to-calcium transformation undoes ORN adaptation would put this finding in context and explain the paradoxical nature of the present result. In the absence of such approaches, I think the claims about ORN dynamics and population codes need to be tempered by strong caveats about the limits of the indicators.</p><p>2) The claim that PN adaptation primarily reflects synaptic depression should be supported by additional evidence. RNAi effects can be incomplete; therefore the authors should block GABA-B signaling using pharmacology (CGP 54626) and examine its effects on PN decay. This manipulation was previously shown to increase the rate of decay in PNs, consistent with the idea that presynaptic GABA-B receptors regulate synaptic depression (Olsen, 2008; Root, 2008). They could also try to activate GABA-B receptors using SKF 97541 (Root, 2008) which should reduce synaptic depression. Application of low concentrations of Cd<sup>2+</sup> (Kazama, 2008) can also be used to manipulate synaptic depression. Combining these pharmacological manipulations with imaging of presynaptic release and PN decay would more firmly establish that synaptic depression is responsible for the observed decay.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were requested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for resubmitting your work entitled &quot;Adaptation on multiple timescales in the olfactory pathway of <italic>Drosophila</italic>&quot; for further consideration at <italic>eLife</italic>. Your revised article has been favorably evaluated by Ronald Calabrese as the Senior Editor, a Kristin Scott as the Reviewing Editor, and two reviewers.</p><p>The manuscript has been improved but there are a few issues that need to be addressed before acceptance, as outlined below:</p><p>1) The analysis in Figure 2, in which the authors attempt to deconvolve the effects of the indicator are much improved. However, some points are not clear in the figure. For example, are the deconvolved traces in Figure 2C from ORN or PN data? What do the filters in A and B look like after deconvolution?</p><p>I wonder if this figure and text might be clearer for readers if the issues with analyzing these kinds of data were stated up front. Two important points made in this figure are that (1) in order to gauge temporal responses from Ca imaging data one must correct for indicator kinetics, and (2) when examining nonlinearities in an olfactory system one should take into account the front-end Hill nonlinearity present in odor-receptor interactions. I think these are important points for the field, so I would argue for putting the analyses incorporating these up top, rather than dwelling on the shape and predictive ability of the filters prior to deconvolution.</p><p>The authors have now done a much more thorough job of looking at the role of the indicator nonlinearities and filtering on their measurements of temporal processing. I think this deserves some mention in the Discussion, as the field often takes these at face value (e.g. Si et al., 2019).</p><p>2) The data comparing ORN firing rate responses and Ca responses to pulses on backgrounds are truly fascinating. In Figure 3F, I think it would be helpful to show an overlay of the actual Ca response on top of predicted Ca responses to see how far off these are. As a future direction, Ca influx into terminals is known to be highly nonlinear. It would be interesting to try to model this nonlinearity together with the sensor kinetics to see if the discrepancy between firing rate and Ca can be explained.</p><p>3) With regards to the inhibition pharmacology, I think the text could be clearer about the relationship between inhibition and depression proposed in prior literature. The work in Root, 2008 and Olsen, 2008, argues that synaptic depression is downstream of presynaptic inhibition: because presynaptic inhibition decreases presynaptic Ca<sup>2+</sup>, it should also decrease synaptic depression, leading to more facilitating synapses (this is shown in a supplement in the Olsen, 2008 paper). Overall the pharmacology shown in Figure 5 is rather at odds with that model. CGP should increase presynaptic calcium and increase PN depression, but the example shown shows no effect of CGP. (It might be helpful to show one of the glomeruli like VM2 where there was an increase in response with CGP). SFK should decrease presynaptic calcium and make PN responses more facilitating, but instead it seems to do the opposite! This is surprising and deserves some comment in the Discussion.</p><p>4) Authors clarified why old scaling looked as it did, and I think the new scaling of binary*dilution is more appropriate and gives sensible results. This also clarifies that the authors do see gain changes not too far from Weber scaling. However, in Figure 9 I think the authors went back to using the old scaling, without including the dilution. I think the authors should change this to binary*dilution for clarity and consistency.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.43735.024</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p>[Editors' note: the authors’ plan for revisions was approved and the authors made a formal revised submission.]</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The finding that ORNs show no evidence of adaptation at the level of calcium signals in ORN terminals is contrary to all previous studies of ORN sensory responses using electrophysiology.

Following the reviewers’ suggestions, we have performed single sensillum recordings and calcium imaging using the same odor stimuli. The results are presented in Figure 3 and Figure 3—figure supplement 1. We show a calibration curve for two ORNs, showing that the measured calcium responses fall in the exact same stimulus range as the firing rate response (Figure 3H and Figure 3—figure supplement 1C). Background experiments performed with different values of the background and test pulse, demonstrate the existence of a striking difference between presynaptic calcium and firing rate in the ORNs. The experiments were performed using GCaMP3 for consistency with the rest of the manuscript. However, in Figure 3—figure supplement 1D-E we also show results obtained with GCaMP6f. In this set of experiments, we have used a higher concentration of the odor to be able to measure the stimuli and to quantify the response of an additional glomerulus, VM7d. Moreover, we show that the calcium dynamics cannot be explained simply by the slow kinetics of the sensors (Figure 3F) and we discuss how non-linearities in the calcium indicator may affect the interpretation of the results.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) The claim that PN adaptation primarily reflects synaptic depression should be supported by additional evidence. RNAi effects can be incomplete; therefore the authors should block GABA-B signaling using pharmacology (CGP 54626) and examine its effects on PN decay. This manipulation was previously shown to increase the rate of decay in PNs, consistent with the idea that presynaptic GABA-B receptors regulate synaptic depression (Olsen, 2008; Root 2008). They could also try to activate GABA-B receptors using SKF 97541 (Root, 2008) which should reduce synaptic depression. Application of low concentrations of Cd<sup>2+</sup> (Kazama, 2008) can also be used to manipulate synaptic depression. Combining these pharmacological manipulations with imaging of presynaptic release and PN decay would more firmly establish that synaptic depression is responsible for the observed decay.</p></disp-quote><p>To address these concerns, we have performed additional pharmacology and present the results in Figure 5H-L. For this set of experiments, we decided to focus on glomerulus DM1, as this is the one we show in most figures. DM1 did not seem to receive much lateral inhibition with the odor stimulus used here, a fact that per se supports our hypothesis that lateral inhibition is not necessary for the slow PNs adaptation. Previous studies, mentioned above by the reviewer, used single odor pulses to test the effect of GABA-B agonist and antagonist. Therefore, in order to demonstrate that the pharmacology is working, we have conducted a control experiment where we present 3 odor pulses: methyl acetate, ethyl butyrate and the mixture of the two odors, and imaged the response of DM1 and DM4 (that only respond to methyl acetate) and VM2 (that only respond to ethyl butyrate). Presenting the mixture, we hoped to increase the lateral inhibition on DM1. Unfortunately, this was not the case and the response in all 3 glomeruli was the same with the corresponding single ligand or the mixture. Responses to the mixture were not reported in the manuscript as of marginal relevance for the paper, although they do constitute another evidence that lateral inputs are glomerulus and stimulus specific.</p><p>Tonic inhibition elicited by bath application of the GABA-B agonist, disrupts the calcium response of both ORNs and PNs. One important consequence of this approach is that forced inhibition is not stimulus dependent, as usually in normal conditions (also see Nagel et al., 2015). The expected outcome of this experiment was to decrease presynaptic activity and observe changes in postsynaptic response, however the results we obtained suggest a more complicated scenario that probably involves recursive activity in the AL network, understanding which is beyond the scope of the current manuscript. We have discussed these points in the subsection “The role of lateral inhibition in PN slow adaptation”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) The paper uses two conceptually distinct definitions for adaptation. In analyzing linear filters, the bilobed filters are called 'adaptation', since their step response returns towards baseline (Figure 1D). Later, in analyzing long timescale changes in PN responses, adaptation is a multiplicative gain change (Figure 3, and subsection “Slow Adaptation in Odor-Evoked Calcium Activity of PNs”). Still later, in the CV analysis (Figure 7), ORN calcium indicator responses appear to change gain multiplicatively. At a minimum, the authors should clarify and distinguish between these different response properties. Though previous analyses have called bilobed impulse responses 'adapting' (for instance Howard Berg's early measurements in bacteria), in my view a good operational definition of adaptation might be 'a change in the processing properties of a cell'. Under that definition, a linear filter shape alone would not be viewed as adapting.</p></disp-quote><p>We acknowledge the confounding use of the word ‘adaptation’ and we agree on making it clearer.</p><p>As the reviewer mentioned, the biphasic filter indicates that in presence of a step stimulus the response will have a phasic component, after which it comes back towards baseline and stays at an adapted value (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig1">Author response image 1A and 1B</xref> green). This happens at all intensities, although the decrease might not be the same for all stimulus intensities. If for example, the decrease is proportional to peak response (~50% in the example, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig1">Author response image 1B</xref>), then adaptation will result in what we have defined before as a “multiplicative gain adjustment” (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig1">Author response image 1C</xref>). This happens when the relative size of the two lobes of the filter is independent of stimulus intensity. However, no matter how the filter shape depends on concentration, there will be always a gain adjustment (not necessarily multiplicative). We agree that this naming is confusing because this is not in the strict sense a change of “response gain”, but rather a “linear rescaling of the representation”. We have clarified this in the subsection “Slow adaptation linearly rescales the combinatorial odor representation in PNs”.</p><fig id="respfig1"><label>Author response image 1.</label><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-43735-resp-fig1-v3.tif"/></fig><p>Importantly, this change (multiplicative or not) is associate to ‘a change in the processing properties of a cell’ and to what should be properly called ‘gain adjustment’. Adaptation drives the response to a lower value (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig1">Author response image 1D</xref>, stimulus 1). This means that the same stimulus induces a different response depending on whether the neuron is adapted to a background stimulus (cyan) or not (blue). We don’t know much about what happens if we apply a stimulus a little higher than the adapting one (stimulus 2). However, we can expect for continuity that there will be a response a little bit higher than the one to stimulus 1 (cyan), and certainly not as high as the response expected for stimulus 2 without a background (shaded blue). Therefore, adaptation has driven the response function in a new regime (dotted line), which we obtained, in this example, starting from the biphasic filter. The filter does not tell much about how the ‘response gain’ has changed (in the sense of Weber’s law), but its biphasic shape indicates that the neuron responds to <italic>changes</italic> in stimulus intensity, rather than the absolute stimulus intensity. The definition of adaptation we used in the paper are therefore not conceptually different, but related to each other: 1) a linear rescaling of the representation can result from a biphasic filter with specific concentration invariant properties, 2) a biphasic filter always induces a change of some kind in the representation and 3) for continuity, a change in the neuron response properties. We have connected a bit better these concepts in the text where appropriate.</p><p>Perhaps most of the confusion comes from the analysis conducted to capture the change in activity on long timescales, which cannot be explained by the fast filter obtained with the LN model. In order to provide a quantification of the slower adaptive component, we designed the analysis shown in Figure 4. This multiplicative rescaling can be likely reconducted to a biphasic filter with a much slower timescale, which we have extracted from the pH sensor measurements. We hope that the new arrangement of the paper makes these points clearer for the reader.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) The LN models that are central to this paper could be improved by choosing a good way to scale the filter. The x-axis in Figures 1G, 6B, 7BB' have arbitrary units, and can be scaled differently depending on filter and stimulus. I did not understand why this was labeled 'predicted linear response ΔF/F' throughout. If it was indeed the predicted linear response, then the best fit slope of f*s plotted against r should equal 1 (by definition). Previous work (Baccus and Meister) has scaled the filter so that the variance of f*s is equal to the variance of s. I believe this would provide a clearer view of things, but a consistent scaling must be chosen to make nonlinearity shapes comparable throughout. Without doing that, the nonlinearities are essentially not possible to compare.</p></disp-quote><p>We apologize for the confusing use of the “ΔF/F” units assigned to the x axis of the old Figure 1G, 6B, 7BB'. These plots do show the measured response r as a function of f*s, as this is by definition the way we use to quantify the non-linear static function (Figure 2 and 4 of Chichilnisky, 2001). We have called this ‘predicted linear response’ because, apart for a multiplicative factor, this is the response of a purely linear system described by the filter f. However, since we normalize the filters by its amplitude, it is more appropriate to assign arbitrary units to it. We have changed the name of the axis to ‘projected stimulus’, similarly to Figure 1C-D of Gorur-Shandilya, 2017 (but with arbitrary units given the normalization we made).</p><p>The reviewers are also correct that an appropriate way to scale the filters is that of equalizing the variance of f*s to the stimulus variance, so that changes in sensitivity would appear only in the shape of the nonlinearity. This was our goal as well. Please note that our LN model was built using the binary signal from the valve as input stimulus (<italic>same for all stimulus intensities</italic>). We did so because we don’t have an actual measure of the stimulus for most dilutions used (we chose these dilutions on a logarithmic scale from 10<sup>-6</sup> to 10<sup>-2</sup> to cover the dynamic range of the response and the PID is unfortunately not sensitive in this full range).</p><p>When using the binary stimulus, a normalization of the filter by amplitude is essentially equivalent to a normalization of the filter by the response variance and results in f*s having variance ~1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig2">Author response image 2A-B</xref>).</p><fig id="respfig2"><label>Author response image 2.</label><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-43735-resp-fig2-v3.tif"/></fig><p>In order to address the reviewers’ concern, we now estimate the stimulus as the binary valve state multiplied by the dilution. When doing so, the filters are the same as before, but the non-linear function shows a decrease of response gain for increasing concentrations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig2">Author response image 2C-D</xref> and main Figure 2F). In particular the gain scales with an exponent of ~ -0.75 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig2">Author response image 2E</xref>). In Gorur-Shandilya, 2017, this scaling factor was used to test whether the ORN response follows Weber’s law in response to gaussian stimuli with different mean (there the scaling exponent was ~ -1). The same paper has also shown that when using stimuli that shut down to zero (as binary stimuli or naturalistic plumes) an upfront non-linearity should be taken into account. The response is in fact spanning a largely non-linear regime and the gain change that we observe in the non-linear function is probably mostly related to the local gain of the dose response curve. To illustrate that, we have plotted the peak response (measured for each pulse in the random stimulus) as a function of the dilution (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig2">Author response image 2F</xref>) and fitted a Hill function (black line). From this fit we have calculated the local gain around the 7 dilutions and plotted it as a function of the dilution (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig2">Author response image 2G</xref>). This local gain decreases with an exponent of ~0.8 similarly to what found from the LN model analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig2">Author response image 2E</xref>). This suggest that the non-linear function obtained with a binary stimulus is capturing the nonlinearities of the dose-response curve.</p><p>Therefore, we have implemented an NLN model (Non-linear-Linear-Non-linear model) that takes this upfront non-linearity in account. The results are shown in Figure 2G and H.In addition to our previous observations (that response becomes non-linear and tends to saturate at higher concentrations), we now can nicely show that the response function at all stimulus intensities fall on a single curve. This demonstrate that the response properties are similar for a large range of concentrations. We thank the reviewers for pointing us this direction, that we have not initially considered.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In addition, the authors should make some attempt to deconvolve the contribution of the indicator to the linear filters as was done in Schnell, 2014. Otherwise the filter parameters they are reporting are mostly properties of the indicator (hence the difference between GCaMP3 and GCaMP6 filters).</p></disp-quote><p>As suggested by the reviewer, we have deconvolved the indicator kinetics from our measurements, as in Schnell, 2014. Doing so we could reveal a fast phasic component in the calcium response which is likely inherited from fast adaptation in the firing rate. We show in the manuscript how our conclusions drawn from the analysis of GCaMPs signal are or are not affected by the sensor kinetics. Thank you for pointing us to Schnell’s paper. It remains clear that there could be non-linearities in the sensor that are not taken in account by this approach.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) The time constant of a negative component (τ<sub>2</sub>) of a linear filter fitted to PN calcium signals was very different between figures. About 1 s in Figure 1D (rather fast), about 10 s in Figure 4N (rather slow, and similar to ORN vesicular release), and about 1 s in Figure 6 (rather fast).

In Figure 5, for example, PC1 already captures 95 and 97% of response variance for methyl acetate and benzaldehyde, respectively. This reflects the fact that 3 out of 5 texted glomeruli show little response and the remaining two glomeruli show highly correlated activity. This means that the results of analyses won't change if PC1 was replaced with either DM1 or DM4. Similar argument applies to Figure 7. Because addition of multiple glomeruli does not add any information, text on population/combinatorial activity should be removed.</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewer is right in saying that for methyl acetate the population response is dominated by 2 glomeruli, as quantified by the scores for PC1 that we have now reported in Figure 8—figure supplement 1. This odor induces responses in other glomeruli only at higher concentrations, but at these concentrations the new glomeruli do add information as DM4 and DM1 get saturated and do not follow the stimulus dynamics well. Moreover when using benzaldehyde, the contribution of the different glomeruli is more balanced, both in ORNs and even more in PNs. Since for both odors we obtained similar results, we decided to keep the population analysis.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2:</p><p>[…] 1) The paper uses two conceptually distinct definitions for adaptation.

Given that the calcium indicator is a nonlinear read out of calcium concentration, the authors should do more to explain how these differences could arise, or explain what differences between experiments could account for them.</p><p>a) Recent papers have reported bi-phasic impulse responses in ORN firing rates and LFP measurements (Martelli et al., Gorur-Shandilya et al.). In Figure 1, the authors show that calcium signals are not biphasic. I found the discussion of this difference a little lacking – how could this difference come to be?</p></disp-quote><p>We have now added an analysis of the calcium responses deconvolved of the sensor kinetics, showing a fast phasic transient and a biphasic filter in the calcium response (Figure 2).

This may well be true, but is there a proposed mechanism by which this could work? It seems hard to explain. This seems to conflict with ORN spiking measured in Martelli et al., Gorur-Shandilya et al., and Nagel et al., so some kind of proposal as to why seems required.</p></disp-quote><p>The new experiments presented in Figure 3 aim to clarify this point. We did not investigate the mechanisms underlying background adaptation in ORN presynapses, but we discuss several possibilities in the Discussion session (subsection “Firing versus calcium adaptation in ORNs”).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>c) At least two recent papers have reported that ORNs show Weber-like gain scaling (Cao et al. and Gorur-Shandilya et al.). Here, Figures 2 and Figure 1—figure supplement 2 showed all filters normalized to the same scale, so it was hard to see any gain changes. Do these calcium filters support Weber-like gain scaling at the ORN axon? I could not tell. But based on Figure 7, it looks like not. Again, it's not clear to me how this could occur (i.e., undoing an upstream gain change seems mechanistically difficult), or whether I'm misunderstanding the results presented here.</p></disp-quote><p>Please refer above to our answer to the major revisions.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) In Figure 7, the authors report that the CV is conserved in PNs but not ORNs. Here, it also seems possible (or likely) that the calcium indicator is saturating, or that nonlinearities in the indicator are dominating the ORN results, especially given how different GC3 and GC6 look when directly compared with these stimuli. Overall, to draw strong conclusions, the authors should address issues related to potential nonlinearities in their calcium indicator and how that impacts and limits interpretations.</p></disp-quote><p>Please refer to the major revisions above. Saturation of the sensor was tested in Figure 2.</p><p>Of course, it should be noted that the deconvolution we performed is not cell specific and therefore internal comparison between ORNs and PNs remained valid (Figure 7). One possible cell specific non-linearity could arise from the expression level of the sensor in ORNs and PNs. In control experiments we have tested heterozygous and homozygous orcoGAL4&gt;GCaMP6f flies (not in the manuscript). We found that the basal fluorescence was much lower in heterozygous flies, but the response dynamics were similar, suggesting that we are in a safe regime of the sensor concentration. Similarly, experiments on flies with one or two GCaMP3 constructs (e.g. Figure 5C and 5E), or with Syp/Homer-GCaMP3 (Figure 16) had different basal fluorescence but no differences in the response dynamics.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) The LN models that are central to this paper could be improved by choosing a good way to scale the filter. The x-axis in Figures 1G, 6B, 7BB' have arbitrary units, and can be scaled differently depending on filter and stimulus. I did not understand why this was labeled 'predicted linear response ΔF/F' throughout. If it was indeed the predicted linear response, then the best fit slope of f*s plotted against r should equal 1 (by definition). Previous work (Baccus and Meister) has scaled the filter so that the variance of f*s is equal to the variance of s.

It is possible that all forms of ORN adaptation are undone by the spike-to-calcium transformation, however I think this needs to be explicitly demonstrated and explained, given the bold nature of the claim. For example, the authors might use either odor or optogenetics to generate calibrated numbers of spikes in ORNS (as in Jeanne and Wilson, 2005) and then use indicators optimized for detecting single spikes (GCaMP7) to measure the spike-to-calcium transformation. Indicators can be calibrated and their dynamic range determined using the methods of Ryan and colleagues (e.g. Sankaranarayanan and Ryan, 2000). Temporal filtering by the indicator can be deconvolved as in Schnell, Fairhall, and Dickinson, 2014. Finally, a computational model showing how the spike-to-calcium transformation undoes ORN adaptation would put this finding in context and explain the paradoxical nature of the present result. In the absence of such approaches, I think the claims about ORN dynamics and population codes need to be tempered by strong caveats about the limits of the indicators.</p></disp-quote><p>Please find above an answer to this concern, that we have addressed using a deconvolution analysis. As a note, our current genetic approach and imaging set up do not allow for the single spike deconvolution suggested, which would require simultaneous imaging and electrophysiology in flies with single ORN labeled. For this paper we have used a driver line that expresses in orco positive neurons, and therefore, when we image from a single glomerulus, we are picking up signals from several ORNs expressing the same OR. We thank the reviewer for the suggested approach that could be used in the future, in combination with a refined labeling of single ORNs, to understand the mechanisms driving presynaptic calcium dynamics.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) The claim that PN adaptation primarily reflects synaptic depression should be supported by additional evidence.

However, some points are not clear in the figure. For example, are the deconvolved traces in Figure 2C from ORN or PN data? What do the filters in A and B look like after deconvolution?</p><p>I wonder if this figure and text might be clearer for readers if the issues with analyzing these kinds of data were stated up front. Two important points made in this figure are that (1) in order to gauge temporal responses from Ca imaging data one must correct for indicator kinetics, and (2) when examining nonlinearities in an olfactory system one should take into account the front end Hill nonlinearity present in odor-receptor interactions. I think these are important points for the field, so I would argue for putting the analyses incorporating these up top, rather than dwelling on the shape and predictive ability of the filters prior to deconvolution.</p><p>The authors have now done a much more thorough job of looking at the role of the indicator nonlinearities and filtering on their measurements of temporal processing. I think this deserves some mention in the Discussion, as the field often takes these at face value (e.g. Si…Samuel, 2019).</p></disp-quote><p>Following these suggestions, we have edited the corresponding paragraph (“Dynamic properties of ORN calcium responses to binary stimuli”) to make clearer what the limits and problems are in analyzing calcium dynamics and responses to binary stimuli and how they can be overcome. The reviewer suggested to bring the deconvolution analysis up top before dwelling on the predictive ability of the linear model. However, we hope that the reviewers will agree that a direct look at the raw calcium dynamics must come first, as the deconvolution approach relies on a <italic>model</italic> of the sensor kinetics. We hope that it is now clear from the text in this paragraph, that the deconvolved model is a single one for all conditions and cell types, and therefore stimulus- and cell-specific differences described in this paper are preserved upon deconvolution. This is made clear in Figure 2E and 2I and in Figure 7B and 7F. Please note that we compare ORNs and PNs dynamics in Figure 7, and that Figure 7F shows that differences observed in the calcium reporter are preserved after deconvolution (similar to Figure 2A). The filters obtained with different sensors in Figure 2B look the same after deconvolution of the sensor kinetics (nor shown), as the deconvolved responses are very similar to each other (Figure 2C).</p><p>Finally, we have added a paragraph in the Discussion (subsection “Firing versus calcium adaptation in ORNs”) to recapitulate the approach and the conclusion we can draw from it.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) The data comparing ORN firing rate responses and Ca responses to pulses on backgrounds are truly fascinating. In Figure 3F, I think it would be helpful to show an overlay of the actual Ca response on top of predicted Ca responses to see how far off these are. As a future direction, Ca influx into terminals is known to be highly nonlinear. It would be interesting to try to model this nonlinearity together with the sensor kinetics to see if the discrepancy between firing rate and Ca can be explained.</p></disp-quote><p>We have added the calcium trace in Figure 3F. We agree with the reviewer that non-linearities in the calcium influx could potentially explain the discrepancy. Further mechanistic insight should be gathered in the future by investigating the underlying molecular mechanisms, for example calcium channels expressed in these neurons and possible modulators of their activity. These points are mentioned in the last part of first paragraph of the Discussion (“Firing versus calcium adaptation in ORNs”).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) With regards to the inhibition pharmacology, I think the text could be clearer about the relationship between inhibition and depression proposed in prior literature. The work in Root, 2008 and Olsen, 2008 argues that synaptic depression is downstream of presynaptic inhibition: because presynaptic inhibition decreases presynaptic Ca<sup>2+</sup>, it should also decrease synaptic depression, leading to more facilitating synapses (this is shown in a supplement in the Olsen, 2008 paper). Overall the pharmacology shown in Figure 5 is rather at odds with that model. CGP should increase presynaptic calcium and increase PN depression, but the example shown shows no effect of CGP. (It might be helpful to show one of the glomeruli like VM2 where there was an increase in response with CGP). SFK should decrease presynaptic calcium and make PN responses more facilitating, but instead it seems to do the opposite! This is surprising and deserves some comment in the Discussion.</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewer is right in saying that the interplay between depression and inhibition remains unclear from our data. Our goal with the pharmacological and genetic approach was to show whether the decrease in activity is a <italic>direct</italic> consequence of inhibition. Our data support that this is not the case, as also noted by a comment of the reviewer below. The data we have collected are not sufficient to demonstrate how the interplay works – unfortunately glomerulus VM2 was measured only in a set of experiments with single pulses and we don’t have data on the on the response to a random stimulus.</p><p>We totally agree with the view that depression is downstream of inhibition, but further work is necessary to understand how these two mechanisms couple under sustained stimulation and longer timescales. Indeed, a major important difference in Olsen, 2008 is the use of a minimal stimulation protocol that allows to measure single EPSC on timescales &lt;100ms. In our experiments with SKF we are using relatively strong odor stimuli (they activate at least another glomerulus more strongly) delivered for a long time (&gt;10sec). Our results are not in disagreement with the previous findings as they explore a much different response range (in time and network involvement). It is plausible that the effects we observe are due to interference with the dynamics of inhibitory inputs onto ORNs and possibly PNs, as well as on LNs themselves.</p><p>We have added these considerations in the Discussion (subsection “Synaptic depression as a mechanism for adaptation”).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) Authors clarified why old scaling looked as it did, and I think the new scaling of binary*dilution is more appropriate and gives sensible results. This also clarifies that the authors do see gain changes not too far from Weber scaling. However, in Figure 9 I think the authors went back to using the old scaling, without including the dilution. I think the authors should change this to binary*dilution for clarity and consistency.</p></disp-quote><p>We have now replotted the non-linear functions in Figure 9B-B’ using the binary*dilution. Please note that these functions are not used for any of the analysis, but just show the stronger non-linear shape of PNs and their wider dynamic range.</p><p>Regarding Weber law, we would like to point out that the relationship between gain and stimulus in Figure 2J-inset is still quite far from Weber law, as Weber law would implicate an exponent of -1. As the results shown for the calcium in Figure 3 also don’t fit with Weber law, it cannot be excluded that the small dependency of response gain on stimulus amplitude (in Figure 2J-inset) could be due to a small error in the estimate of the front-end non-linearity. We hope that the reviewer agrees that a binary stimulus as the one used here is not appropriate to test for Weber law as done in Gorur-Shandilya et al., 2017, where stimulus mean and variance were separately controlled to measure response to small fluctuations around a varying mean concentration.</p></body></sub-article></article>
