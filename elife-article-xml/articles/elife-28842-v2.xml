To explore new habitats, many bacteria move towards favorable places or colonize liquid-surface interfaces. A powerful device facilitating such behavior is the flagellar motor, a complex rotary organelle used for cell dispersal and as sensory apparatus to communicate mechanical signals upon surface encounter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Berg, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Harshey and Partridge, 2015</xref>). Given their central role in bacterial cell behavior and virulence it is not surprising that bacteria tightly control assembly and activity of flagella (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Chevance and Hughes, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Hazelbauer et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Boehm et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Paul et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Mukherjee and Kearns, 2014</xref>). Modulating motor activity allows bacteria to change their swimming trajectories and by that respond to changes in chemical composition, light intensity or temperature and move towards more favorable regions. Flagellar motors rotate either clockwise (CW) or counterclockwise (CCW) and by adjusting reversal frequencies, bacteria travel along gradients of favored or repulsing conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Berg, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Hazelbauer et al., 2008</xref>).</p><p>The best-understood taxis system is the chemotaxis pathway of <italic>E. coli</italic>. This organism senses the external concentration of sugars or amino acids via large clusters of membrane-bound chemoreceptors. This information is relayed to a chemoreceptor coupled histidine kinase, CheA, which in turn phosphorylates a diffusible response regulator, CheY. CheY ~P interacts with the flagellar switch proteins FliM and FliN to redirect motor rotation from CCW to CW (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Welch et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Sarkar et al., 2010</xref>). This prompts cells to change from moving forward in straight runs to tumbling, thereby randomizing their courses. By adjusting the tumbling frequency to the external milieu, this simple signal transduction pathway directs cellular movement in chemical gradients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Krell et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Porter et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Scharf et al., 1998</xref>). Many bacteria harbor chemotaxis systems that far exceed the complexity of the canonical <italic>E. coli</italic> system. For example, <italic>Rhodobacter spheriodes</italic> has two distinct chemoreceptor clusters, one located in the membrane and one in the cytosol. Four different CheA kinases and six CheY proteins relay information from the two receptor clusters to two distinct flagellar motors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Porter et al., 2011</xref>). In this organism several CheYs operate in parallel and functionally interact to determine chemotactic behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Ferré et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Porter et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Porter et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Tindall et al., 2010</xref>). Moreover, the interaction between CheY and flagellar motors has diversified during evolution to generate different behavioral responses. Although most CheYs induce motor reversal, individual CheY components can act as a molecular break to provoke motor stop or slow down motor rotation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Porter et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Pilizota et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Attmannspacher et al., 2005</xref>).</p><p>Recently, the second messenger c-di-GMP was shown to interfere with motor function and bacterial cell motility. In <italic>E. coli</italic> increased c-di-GMP levels result in dynamic modulation of motor torque by the c-di-GMP effector protein YcgR, which in its c-di-GMP-bound form interacts with the flagellar rotor/stator interface (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Boehm et al., 2010</xref>). A similar mechanism was proposed to tune motility in <italic>Bacillus subtilis</italic> and in <italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Chen et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Baker et al., 2016</xref>). In the latter, the YcgR homolog FlgZ controls swarming motility by specifically interacting with the MotCD stator, which is required for swarming motility on surfaces. YcgR and its homologs adjust motor speed, a level of control that may promote the transition from a motile to a sessile lifestyle and help bacteria to colonize surfaces (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Boehm et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Chen et al., 2012</xref>). Additionally, c-di-GMP can interfere with chemotaxis. YcgR was proposed to also bind to the flagellar switch thereby imposing a CCW rotational bias in <italic>E. coli</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Paul et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Fang and Gomelsky, 2010</xref>). Likewise, c-di-GMP adjusts motor switching frequency by interfering with chemoreceptor signaling, either directly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Russell et al., 2013</xref>) or indirectly by adjusting the methylation state of MCPs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Xu et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>In addition to their prominent role in bacterial taxis, flagella serve as mechanosensitive devices to help planktonic bacteria to interact with surfaces (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Harshey and Partridge, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Belas, 2014</xref>). Upon surface contact, many bacteria rapidly adapt their behavior by secreting adhesins or by inducing surface motility and virulence mechanisms. In <italic>Vibrio parahaemolyticus</italic> slowing the rotation of the polar flagellum on surfaces triggers the synthesis of hundreds of lateral flagella used for surface swarming (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Kawagishi et al., 1996</xref>). Similarly, jamming the <italic>C. crescentus</italic> polar flagellum upon surface encounter was proposed to provoke instant production of holdfast, an exopolysaccharide glue, and to irreversibly anchor cells to the surface (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Li et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Hoffman et al., 2015</xref>). This was confirmed recently by a study demonstrating that motor interference during <italic>C. crescentus</italic> surface contact leads to the production of c-di-GMP and to subsequent allosteric activation of the holdfast machinery (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Hug et al., 2017</xref>). In some bacteria, components of the chemotaxis system contribute to surface adaptation by the flagellum (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Harshey, 2003</xref>). For instance, <italic>E. coli</italic> and <italic>Salmonella che</italic> mutants fail to swarm on surfaces, while mutations in the flagellar switch apparatus restore swarming (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Burkart et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Wang et al., 2005</xref>).</p><p>Here we analyze motility and surface behavior of <italic>Caulobacter crescentus</italic>, an aquatic α-proteobacterium with a dimorphic life cycle that produces a motile swarmer (SW) and a sessile stalked (ST) cell upon division (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref>). ST cells adhere to surfaces via an adhesive holdfast, which is located at the tip of an extension of their cell body, the stalk. When ST cells divide, they assemble a single flagellum, chemoreceptors and surface adherent pili at the pole opposite the stalk. Accordingly, SW offspring are motile, perform chemotaxis and can use their elongated pili to eventually re-attach to surfaces. One of the principal regulators of <italic>C. crescentus</italic> polarity and cell fate determination is c-di-GMP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Abel et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Jenal et al., 2017</xref>). Concentrations of c-di-GMP oscillate during the <italic>C. crescentus</italic> life cycle thereby promoting cell cycle progression and coordinating the assembly of cell type-specific polar organelles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Abel et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Lori et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Davis et al., 2013</xref>). In addition, c-di-GMP was shown to control flagellar motor activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Abel et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Christen et al., 2007</xref>), although the molecular mechanisms of this behavior are unclear.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.28842.002</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Cle proteins constitute a novel family of CheY like proteins in <italic>C. crescentus</italic>.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) Schematic of the <italic>C. crescentus</italic> cell cycle.

CleA (in its c-di-GMP bound form) and CheYI ~P compete with CheYII ~P for FliM binding sites thereby reducing the overall reversal rate of the flagellar motor. Accordingly, CleA may promote smooth forward or backward swimming through CheYII competition under conditions that boost c-di-GMP levels in motile <italic>C. crescentus</italic> SW cells. Enzymes regulating the internal concentration of c-di-GMP (green) (DGC, red; PDE, blue) are indicated. CleC, CleE and possibly CleD interfere with motor function to boost rapid surface attachment.

When rotating CW, the flagellum pushes the cell body forward tracing out a helical trajectory. Upon reversal to CCW rotation the flagellum pulls the cell backwards in a straight line (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Liu et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Koyasu and Shirakihara, 1984</xref>). A flick-like event re-orients cells when they change from CCW to CW, thereby randomizing cell movements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Liu et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Xie et al., 2011</xref>). <italic>C. crescentus</italic> reversal rates are controlled by the chemotaxis machinery but the exact wiring of the respective regulatory components is not well understood (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Ely et al., 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Skerker et al., 2005</xref>). <italic>C. crescentus</italic> has 19 chemoreceptors, two CheAs and 12 annotated CheYs.

Here we identify a novel class of CheY-like proteins in <italic>C. crescentus</italic> that do not receive signal input from chemoreceptor coupled CheA kinases but instead are activated by binding of c-di-GMP to short conserved C-terminal peptide sequences.

Unfortunately, only CleD was amenable to biochemical analyses while purification attempts with the other four members of this family produced insoluble protein. UV cross-linking experiments with purified Strep-tagged CleD and radiolabeled c-di-GMP revealed high affinity binding in the nanomolar range (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2a</xref>). High affinity binding was confirmed by isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) experiments revealing a K<sub>d</sub> of 86 nM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2b</xref>). CleD binds c-di-GMP specifically as unlabeled c-di-GMP but not related nucleotides were able to effectively compete with the labeled probe for binding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1a</xref>). Specific binding was confirmed when using a more sensitive NMR approach (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Habazettl et al., 2011</xref>). Because the imino protons H1 of free guanosines rapidly exchange with water but are involved in hydrogen bonds when bound to protein, their signal can only be observed when c-di-GMP is bound to the effector. When recording the difference spectrum of CleD with and without c-di-GMP, the four imino proton H1 resonances were found far downfield shifted (between 14ppm and 10.5ppm), indicating that two molecules of c-di-GMP are bound to one CleD protomer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1b</xref>). Finally, multi-angle light scattering (MALS) experiments indicated that the CleD protein is a monomer both in its apo- and ligand-bound forms (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1c</xref>).

When the highly conserved Ile/Asp motif at position 57/58 of FliM was replaced with a bulky Trp and an uncharged Ala residue, respectively, overall motility and swimming speed was maintained but cells failed to reverse their swimming direction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2c</xref>). This is in line with the expected failure of CheY to interact with the FliM motor switch to cause motor reversals. Importantly, CleA and CleD also failed to localize in the <italic>fliM_ID57WA</italic> mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4b</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1a</xref>). Moreover, bacterial two-hybrid assays (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Karimova et al., 1998</xref>) showed strong interaction of CleA with the N-terminal peptide of FliM (amino acid 2 to 65) but not with the FliMID57WA mutant peptide (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4c</xref>). Although bacterial two-hybrid experiments failed to show interaction between CleD and FliM, co-immunoprecipitation (co-IP) experiments showed co-purification of CleD-Flag with FliM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1b</xref>). Likewise, NMR experiments confirmed CleD binding to synthetic FliM peptides corresponding to residues 47 to 62 of FliM. A <sup>1</sup>H-<sup>15</sup>N HSQC spectrum of <sup>15</sup>N-CleD was recorded alone and in the presence of c-di-GMP and the FliM wild-type peptide in two-fold excess. The latter resulted in shift changes of CleD of approximately 10 resonances (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1c</xref>). In contrast, neither the addition of the FliMID57WA mutant peptide with c-di-GMP nor the FliM wild-type peptide without c-di-GMP gave an observable chemical shift.</p><p>Thus, CleA and CleD bind to the FliM switch protein in a way that is similar or identical to CheY docking to the flagellar motor. Based on this and on the data shown above, we conclude that this interaction is regulated by c-di-GMP binding to CleA and CleD.</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>CleA interferes with the <italic>C. crescentus</italic> chemotaxis response</title><p>The findings that the Cle proteins phylogenetically cluster with CheY chemotaxis proteins, that they interact with FliM, and that one of the <italic>cle</italic> genes, <italic>cleA</italic>, is part of a large chemotaxis operon in <italic>C. crescentus</italic> prompted us to analyze a potential role of Cle proteins in motility behavior.

CleA is encoded in chemotaxis cluster <italic>che1</italic> together with two CheY paralogs, CheYI and CheYII (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1b</xref>). Consistent with a major role in chemotaxis, a mutant lacking CheYII was unable to spread on semisolid agar plates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Skerker et al., 2005</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5a</xref>) and showed significantly reduced reversal rates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5c</xref>).

We thus hypothesized that some of the Cle proteins mediate physiological changes sparked by (agar) surface contact.

To test if the observed attachment defect of <italic>cle</italic> mutants resulted from a reduced capability to sense and respond to surface interactions, we used microfluidic-based assays that allow to directly score surface attachment of SW cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Persat et al., 2014</xref>).

These findings raise several questions. How does c-di-GMP activate the CheY-like receiver domain to interact with the motor switch? Second, what is the role of individual Cle proteins in modulating motor function and how do they integrate with the canonical CheY-driven chemotaxis response? And finally, how can individual Cle components elicit a specific response at the flagellar motor?</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>Mechanism of Cle activation by c-di-GMP</title><p>The c-di-GMP binding site of Cle proteins was confined to a 28-amino acid extension of their conserved CheY-like receiver domains. This sequence contains a tandem repeat of the motif [Y/F]XGPX[R/K]R (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3d</xref>). In many c-di-GMP effectors Arg residues are prominently involved in the coordination of the four guanine rings of an intercalated ligand dimer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Chou and Galperin, 2016</xref>). The tandem arrangement of the Arg-containing motifs together with the binding affinity and stoichiometry determined for CleD suggested that all Cle proteins bind a dimer of c-di-GMP and that conserved Arg residues play a central role in this process. Structural analysis will eventually reveal how exactly this novel binding motif intercalates c-di-GMP.</p><p>Although ARR peptides comprise high affinity binding sites for c-di-GMP that can be grafted onto other proteins, our data identified at least one conserved Arg residue positioned in helix α4 of the receiver domain that contributes to c-di-GMP binding and activation of the Cle proteins. Activation of canonical CheY receiver domains by phosphorylation results in subtle conformational changes of the α4-β5-α5 surface, which promote their interaction with the FliM switch (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Lee et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Gao and Stock, 2010</xref>). In analogy, it is plausible that the rearrangement of the ARR peptide via a specific c-di-GMP docking site in helix α4 remodels the α4-β5-α5 surface of Cle proteins to promote its interaction with the motor switch. Such a mechanism would abrogate the need for phosphorylation-mediated structural changes, explaining why Cle proteins no longer depend on conserved residues of the phospho-switch (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Gao and Stock, 2010</xref>). It was proposed recently that second messenger-based control may have expanded rapidly during bacterial evolution through the recruitment of additional cellular components into existing c-di-GMP networks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Jenal et al., 2017</xref>). The ease with which diverse cellular processes can be interconnected may have predisposed c-di-GMP for the coordination of complex behavioral transitions. Accordingly, regulatory proteins like CheY may have been captured during evolution by c-di-GMP to allow the second messenger to adopt flagellar motor control.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Role of cle proteins in <italic>Caulobacter</italic> cell behavior</title><p>The discovery of Cle proteins and their interaction with the <italic>C. crescentus</italic> motor adds to the growing evidence that c-di-GMP can modulate bacterial chemotaxis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Paul et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Fang and Gomelsky, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Russell et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Xu et al., 2016</xref>) and motor performance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Boehm et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Chen et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Baker et al., 2016</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1c</xref>). But how does this multi-component system interfere with the canonical CheY-mediated flagellar switch and what is it good for? Phenotypic analysis revealed that individual Cle proteins have distinct functions in motility and surface adaptation, suggesting that they represent discrete signaling pathways affecting motor activity. Individual Cle proteins may differ in their interaction with the motor or with conventional CheYs. The specific functions of Cle proteins may involve their distinct C-terminal extensions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1b</xref>), which could help sequester partner proteins with specific functionality to the motor. All five <italic>cle</italic> genes are expressed in PD cells, coincident with the transcription of flagellar and chemotaxis genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Schrader et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Zhou et al., 2015</xref>). The concentration of c-di-GMP fluctuates during the cell cycle with c-di-GMP being low in SW cells and reaching peak levels during the SW-to-ST cell transition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Abel et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Christen et al., 2010</xref>). Recent evidence suggested that c-di-GMP is not evenly distributed in dividing cells with a spatial trough being established at the pole where the flagellum is assembled (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Lori et al., 2015</xref>). Thus, the c-di-GMP distribution is highly dynamic making it difficult to predict the interaction of Cle proteins with the flagellar motor. Specific Cle proteins may be active only during very short time windows when cells enter or exit motility and when levels of c-di-GMP rapidly change. Accordingly, one or several of these proteins may coordinate flagellar rotation with flagellar assembly or motor dismantling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Abel et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Aldridge and Jenal, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Aldridge et al., 2003</xref>), a potentially short-lived state difficult to capture microscopically. In line with this, mutants unable to effectively increase c-di-GMP levels during the SW-to-ST transition fail to eject the rotary motor and retain motility for an extended period (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Aldridge and Jenal, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Aldridge et al., 2003</xref>).</p><p>CleA regulates reversal frequencies of swimming cells suggesting that it interferes with chemotaxis control. The <italic>cleA</italic> gene is part of the <italic>che1</italic> chemotaxis cluster, which also contains two <italic>cheY</italic> homologs, <italic>cheYI</italic> and <italic>cheYII</italic>. Because both CheYI and CheYII lack a c-di-GMP binding site and have conserved phospho-switch residues, they are likely regulated through chemoreceptor-mediated phosphorylation. Our experiments identified CheYII as a prototypical CheY-like component promoting motor reversals. In contrast, both CheYI and CleA favor smooth swimming. Epistasis experiments strongly suggested that CheYI and CleA antagonize CheYII activity possibly by competing for the same binding sites on the flagellar motor switch (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1c</xref>). While CheYII is essential for directional motility in gradients of nutrients, the role of CheYI and CleA is less clear. Based on our findings we propose that both proteins, in response to yet unknown cues, promote smooth swimming by competing with CheYII for motor binding sites.</p><p>CleA also influences motor speed. This is reminiscent of motor control in <italic>E. coli</italic>, where YcgR upon c-di-GMP binding influences both motor reversal and speed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Boehm et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Paul et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Fang and Gomelsky, 2010</xref>). How exactly this is accomplished and how these two proteins are controlled, remains to be investigated. We anticipate that c-di-GMP levels fluctuate in SW cells to dynamically activate CleA without reaching threshold concentrations required to fully induce the motile-sessile switch and to drive bacteria into permanent attachment, a scenario that was also proposed for other bacteria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Russell et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Kulasekara et al., 2013</xref>). Such a mechanism could for instance promote near-surface swimming, a phenomenon that can trap bacteria transiently near surfaces and facilitate surface ‘scanning’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Misselwitz et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Molaei et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Jones et al., 2015</xref>). In line with this, it was proposed recently that c-di-GMP can counteract CheY ~P in enteric bacteria, thereby promoting smooth swimming and helping bacteria to interact with surfaces (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Fang and Gomelsky, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Girgis et al., 2007</xref>).</p><p>But the role of the flagellar motor upon surface interaction is not merely a passive one. Several studies have inferred that flagella can serve as a mechanosensitive devices to assist surface adaptation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Harshey and Partridge, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Belas, 2014</xref>). Motile <italic>C. crescentus</italic> cells use their flagellum as a mechanosensitive device to instigate rapid production of the exopolysaccharide-based holdfast glue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Li et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Hoffman et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Hug et al., 2017</xref>). We have shown recently that a specific diguanylate cyclase, DgcB, is activated upon surface-induced motor interference. The c-di-GMP upshift in turn allosterically activates the holdfast synthesis machinery (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Hug et al., 2017</xref>). Here we show that a subset of the Cle proteins is involved in mediating this rapid <italic>C. crescentus</italic> surface response. Mutants lacking one or several of these Cle proteins performed much better when spreading through semisolid agar. This is probably not due to interference with swimming or chemotaxis, as with the exception of <italic>cleA</italic> all mutants showed normal reversal rates and running velocities. Rather, we propose that the improved motility observed for some of these mutants was caused by their inability to respond to agar surface in motility plates. In support of this, mutants lacking CleC and CleE, but not CleA, showed increased response times in synthesizing adhesive holdfast when challenged with surface. Accordingly, their ability to rapidly colonize surfaces under medium flow was strongly reduced. Together with the observation that a mutant lacking the motor binding sites for Cle proteins also underperformed in rapid surface attachment, these data proposed that some Cle proteins may be part of a regulatory loop controlling flagellar activity or conformation in response to a transient surface-mediated upshift of c-di-GMP. Cle proteins may be activated upon surface contact by an initial DgcB-mediated boost of c-di-GMP levels leading to altered motor behavior promoting surface colonization. Moreover, activated Cle proteins may form a positive feedback loop by interacting with the mechanosensing device itself to reinforce the c-di-GMP upshift and to robustly and rapidly activate holdfast biogenesis.</p><p>Altogether, our studies discover an additional layer of a highly complex interaction network between cellular signaling components and the flagellar motor switch. These interactions not only interfere with chemotaxis but also control additional motor behavior to optimize the interaction of motile cells with surfaces. Since c-di-GMP is a key regulatory component coordinating the behavior of bacterial cells on surfaces, we propose that during evolution this molecule has hijacked CheY-mediated motor control to appropriately tune this rotary device to optimally approach and colonize biotic or abiotic surfaces. Together, the Cle and CheY proteins may integrate information from mechanical and chemical stimuli to direct motor behavior.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Strains, plasmids, and growth conditions</title><p>The bacterial strains, plasmids and oligos used in this work are summarized in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1A, B and C</xref> respectively. <italic>E. coli</italic> was grown in Luria Broth (LB) media at 37°C and <italic>C. crescentus</italic> was grown in rich medium (peptone yeast extract; PYE) at 30°C (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Ely, 1991</xref>).

Fresh medium was fed from a 1 ml syringe driven by a pump (Type 871012, B-Braun Melsungen AG) adjusted to carry 1 ml syringes and applying flow rates of 0.002 µm/s in the flow channel. Flow channels were 1 cm in length, 40 µm in width and 15 µm in height. Bacteria were introduced through the outlet, slowly approaching the front of the sterile medium which was kept in place while the air separating the two liquid phases escaped through the PDMS. Medium flux was initiated immediately after the two liquid phases merged. Microchamber devices were designed as rows of microchambers connected to one of two main channels between inlet and outlet of the same dimensions as described above. Chambers were squares of 40 µm and 0.75 µm in height.</p></sec><sec id="s4-17"><title>Chemotaxis assay</title><p>This assay was performed basically as described recently (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Briegel et al., 2011</xref>) on M2 (no carbon source added) or P2 (no nitrogen or carbon source added) semi solid agar plates (0.25% agar). Small, round paper discs (Oxoid X3498) were placed on the agar plates and 10 μl of the C- or C- and N-source was dropped on the disc. A colony of NA1000 or mutants was stabbed in the agar around 1 cm away from the disc. The plates were incubated for 4 to 5 days at 30°C until the swarm was visible.</p></sec><sec id="s4-18"><title>Bioinformatics</title><p>The protein sequences of the <italic>C. crescentus</italic> RRs and <italic>E. coli</italic> CheY were retrieved from Uniprot server. Multiple sequence alignments were performed using the MAFFT program (scoring matrix BLOSUM62). For the phylogenetic tree construction, 46 C. crescentus RR sequences were aligned as described above and the non-conserved sequences at the N- and C-termini were manually trimmed, preserving the core RR sequences with the sequence numberings corresponding to residues 18–138 and 21–141 for CleA and CleD, respectively. The phylogenetic tree was constructed by PHYML program. All programs mentioned above were performed in Geneious Pro 7.1.7 (Biomatters, Auckland, New Zealand).</p><p>The homology models of CleD and CleA were generated in MODELLER using the <italic>E. coli</italic> CheY (PDB 1F4V) as template. The CleA and CleD models were superimposed onto <italic>E. coli</italic> CheY and the <italic>C. crescentus</italic> FliM model was built by mutating the <italic>E. coli</italic> FliM residues in silico using the program PyMOL (The PyMOL Molecular Graphics System, Version 1.7.4 Schrödinger, LLC on World Wide Web <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.pymol.org">http://www.pymol.org</ext-link>). To identify ARR domain proteins in silico, Jackhmmer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Finn et al., 2011</xref>) and PSI-Blast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Altschul et al., 1997</xref>) were queried with the ARR domain of CleD (aa 142–173) against the non-redundant database (NR) with default settings and until convergence. Results were merged and resulted in 302 hits. Proteins were then spotted on a simplified version of the genomic based bacterial phylogenic tree provided by Segata et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Segata et al., 2013</xref>). Taxa missing in the genomic tree were added according to 16S rRNA similarity. Sequence logo of the ARR was generated with WebLogo 3.4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Crooks et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Schneider and Stephens, 1990</xref>) based on the multiple sequence alignment generated by Jackhmmer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Finn et al., 2011</xref>) when queried with the region 142–173 of CleD against the rp75 with default settings with the exception of PAM30 as matrix, until convergence (i.e. seven iterations).</p><p>Sequence logos of the rec domain from proteins either with or without an ARR were generated on the Weblogo <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.twosamplelogo.org/cgi-bin/tsl/tsl.cgi">http://www.twosamplelogo.org/cgi-bin/tsl/tsl.cgi</ext-link> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Vacic et al., 2006</xref>). The 136 best blastP hits of the CleD rec domain (residues 21–141) found in the rp75 were separated in two groups according to the presence/absence of the ARR domain in the corresponding protein sequences. Both sequence datasets were aligned together against the PFAM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Sonnhammer et al., 1997</xref>) model corresponding to this region (PF00072) using hmmalign (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Finn et al., 2011</xref>). For the sake of readability, regions of the alignments covered by less than 90% of the sequences were discarded from the logo.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We thank Fabienne Hamburger for cloning and strain constructions, and Benoit-Joseph Laventie and Antje Hempel for help with data analysis.

Your article has been reviewed by two peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Gisela Storz as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal her identity: Fitnat H Yildiz (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>In this manuscript, Nesper et al. describe results from studies designed to identify and characterize novel c-di-GMP effectors in <italic>Caulobacter crescentus</italic>.</p><p>The manuscript can be divided in two sections:</p><p>In the first part, clear and complete, the authors carry out extensive characterization of Cle proteins, measuring c-di-GMP binding affinity and stoichiometry, and showing that the Arg-rich region (ARR) in all the Cle proteins is necessary and sufficient to bind c-di-GMP, with one more conserved R in the Rec domain contributing to binding. Motifs with Arg residues have been identified earlier and are present in every active site of solved effector proteins structures (PilZ, PgaC, Bld), where they are thought to play an important role in the stabilization of bound c-di-GMP. The ARR region in the Cle proteins identified in this study has a different motif. Like the first-identified PilZ effector, CleD is also monomer that binds a dimeric c-di-GMP. Using ARR sequence as a query, the authors identified over 300 proteins in other bacterial phyla, the majority being CheY homologs, suggesting perhaps a specific function for this motif in modulating flagellar motor behavior/chemotaxis.</p><p>The second part, on the other hand, is much more difficult to follow and digesting the massive amounts of data from experiments that often appear unconnected, is difficult. In general, multiple motility and adhesion assays that don't correlate easily are presented and the use of different Cle proteins for different assays makes the story confusing. Although it appears that some Cle proteins have a role in connecting Flagellum and adhesion via the stalk, the exact connection is not clear. Perhaps, the clearest result to emerge was that only one of five Cle proteins (CleA) controls flagellar motor reversals and hence chemotaxis, as well as motor speed. CleA apparently has an antagonistic action to that of the main chemotaxis regulator CheYII, and is thus likely to 'tune' motor behavior in response to c-di-GMP. The motor tuning mechanism observed for CleA is similar to other c-di-GMP effectors known to control chemotaxis in other bacteria at various points: YcgR, a PilZ-like c-di-GMP effector controls motor reversals and motor speed via interaction with the flagellar switch proteins FliM/FliG as well as with stators in <italic>E. coli/Salmonella</italic>. Thus, the CleA data presented constitute a variation on established themes.</p><p>In sum, for a broad audience, it is essential that the authors do a profound rewrite of the second part and clarify data presentation. Critically, the authors must resolve conflicting observations and conclusions (see below). Overall, the results show that Cle protein form a new family of CheY-like c-di-GMP effectors that regulate the flagellum directly in multiple but not redundant manner. The exact details of these functions are still missing.</p><p>Specific comments</p><p>1) In a previous work, the Jenal group undertook an extensive study of <italic>C. crescentus</italic> proteins with predicted diguanylate cyclase (DGC) and/or phosphodiesterase (PDE) activities (PLoS Genet 9(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">9</xref>)-e100374). It would be critical to determine if there is an interaction between these DGCs and the Cle system. For example, is the DGC DgcB, reported to be the main DGC dedicated to motility regulation, required for Cle function? Addressing this could position the Cle proteins in the DGC pathway.</p><p>2) Is there any information on the expression of Cle proteins? Is CleB likely to contribute to any of the phenotypes discussed?</p><p>3) Abstract: “We identified a novel family of CheY-like (Cle) proteins in <italic>Caulobacter crescentus</italic>, which tune flagellar activity in response to binding of the second messenger c-di-GMP to a short C-terminal extension.” This statement is not correct. Only one member of this family was shown to affect flagellar activity.</p><p>“In their c-di-GMP bound conformation Cle proteins interact with the flagellar switch to control motor activity.” This statement is also not quite correct. The requirement for c-di-GMP binding for promoting FliM interaction was implicated (by mutation of the R residues) for 2/5 proteins (CleA and CleD) in the data shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>. In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>, it does not appear the interaction between CleA/D and FliM was tested in the presence and absence of c-di-GMP in any of the three assays shown.</p><p>4) There are major concerns linked to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>.</p><p>Motility. What accounts for the different motility behavior of single deletions of Cle C, D, and E in (A) vs (B) where levels of c-di-GMP are different? In fact, one learns later (in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>) that the CleA mutant, which does nothing in (A) and (B) has a hyper-reversal behavior when monitored by other assays. In (B), where only the single deletion of CleD increases motility somewhat, why does deletion of all 5 increase motility over the WT? The PYE motility medium should reflect both speed and chemotaxis. Since only CleA affects either parameter, why are the multiple deletions doing so much better in (A)?</p><p>Adhesion. The other difficult aspect of assessing data in this figure is that when first introduced in the text, the adhesion assays are not discussed, and the reader has to wait until much later after the data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref> is presented. Like with the motility assays, the three different adhesion assays are also confusing. For example, why does deletion of CleC, D or E have no effect in the adhesion assay in (C) but has an effect in (E)? How is the polystyrene assay in (c) different from the holdfast assay in (E)?</p><p>Subsection “CleC and CleE promote surface recognition and rapid attachment”: “A mutant lacking all five Cle proteins showed severely reduced attachment to polystyrene (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>)”. Is a 50% reduction in polystyrene binding really 'severe'? If so some comparisons are not clear: In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E, a</xref> 50% reduction in attachment of mutants lacking CleC, D or E, as well as the CheYII mutant is observed. Yet, the former set is characterized as “severely impaired” and the latter as “not impaired”. The conclusion 'that interaction of one or several Cle proteins with the motor is required for the ability to rapidly synthesize an adhesive holdfast in response to surface exposure is not justified.</p><p>In (D) two cells are shown – ST cell that gives rise to the SW cell, which will then become an ST cell. Is the adhesion of both being monitored in (E)? Don't they have different c-di-GMP levels? Will that not impact the interpretation?</p><p>MotA or MotB data are missing in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4G</xref>.</p><p>“These results also imply that the role of Cle proteins in rapid surface attachment is mediated by their c-di-GMP dependent interaction with the motor switch.” Again this conclusion is questionable because <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4G</xref> merely shows that PilA mutants and all-Cle mutants each have a 3 minute delay in holdfast appearance, while a combination of these mutations has a 25 min delay i.e. no regulation. Neither of these observations implicate the motor. Perhaps CleB-E, which don't have a discernible effect on motor reversal (hence FliM binding), instead regulate the pilus?</p><p>In general, statistics are missing in this figure and other figures to test the significance of some effects (i.e. is the cleD mutant distinct from WT in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>?)</p><p>5) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>. Is it really necessary to test localization using so many variants of two different proteins? ARR was already established as binding c-di-GMP. Why were the localization experiments not done with <italic>ΔpdeA</italic> i.e. at elevated levels of c-di-GMP?</p><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref> shows localization of CleC, but this is not mentioned in the text. If CleB and E do not localize to the base of the flagellum, how does one interpret the effects of the various effects of deletions encompassing these two proteins in the assays shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>?</p><p>6) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>. CleD pulls down FliM, as well as shows binding to a FliM peptide by NMR. Is this interaction dependent on c-di-GMP. Similarly for the two-hybrid assay showing CleA-FliM interaction. Why not test the other Cle proteins in this assay?</p><p>7) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>. It is only when we get to this figure showing that CleA affects motor reversals, that it becomes clear why CleA was being used in the previous experiments (in addition to the soluble CleD). Again, however, the motility assays in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref> were indicating a role for Cle-CDE, not CleA. How is this resolved? In light of the fact that the Arg domains in all the Cle proteins bind c-di-GMP, but not all showed robust localization or flagellar reversal modulation, why were reversal frequencies and motor speeds of the various Cle mutants not measured in the <italic>ΔpdeA</italic> background?</p><p>Figure 7—figure supplement 2. Why is the assay shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref> not a chemotaxis assay?

The editors are convinced that this new data addresses the reviewer's concerns from a purely scientific point of view.</p><p>However, the manuscript remains a difficult read, largely because the number of specific assays, genetic backgrounds and combination make it very hard to derive a clear picture of the Cle protein network. In fact, the functions of the Cle proteins appear to be diverse and are only partially established by the study.

Critically, the authors must resolve conflicting observations and conclusions (see below). Overall, the results show that Cle protein form a new family of CheY-like c-di-GMP effectors that regulate the flagellum directly in multiple but not redundant manner. The exact details of these functions are still missing.</p></disp-quote><p>The manuscript was restructured and streamlined in order to make this part clearer and more accessible for a broad readership. We now integrate our results with the findings of Hug et al. and carefully explain the different motility and adhesion assays to clarify how these experiments are connected and how they contribute to the functional characterization of the Cle proteins.</p><p>We believe that part of the confusion has arisen from the fact that the general “motility” assay used in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figures 4A, B</xref> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figures 6A, B</xref> in the revised version, see below) and 8D does not represent a genuine motility readout, but rather measures spreading of bacteria on semisolid agar plates. Although this assay is often used to quantify swimming or chemotaxis, spreading is in fact a complex combination of growth, motility, chemotaxis and surface (agar) adherence. Thus, when referring to this assay we replaced the terms “swimming” or “motility” with the more neutral term “spreading”. This also refers to the labeling of the Y-axis in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figures 6A, B</xref> (formerly <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A, B</xref>) and 8D. Finally, we have changed the title of this particular chapter from “Cle proteins modulate <italic>C. crescentus</italic> motility” to “Cle proteins modulate <italic>C. crescentus</italic> spreading on semisolid agar plates”</p><p>In the revised version, we also make it clear to the reader that to follow up on the semisolid agar experiments more specific assays were used to further dissect the role of individual Cle proteins in any of these behavioral aspects (motility, chemotaxis, attachment), including single cell tracking for changes in speed or reversal rates and microfluidics for rapid surface adherence (as introduced by Hug et al., 2017). We are now emphasizing the differences of the individual assays in the text (see below). E.g. “Because the ability of cells to spread on semisolid agar mirrors a combination of different forms of behavior including motility, chemotaxis and surface adherence, the specific role of each Cle member in this process remained unclear.”</p><p>Finally, we realized that the order of the chapters (and figures) in the original version was not helpful for the understanding of the in vivo results. In particular, introducing the semisolid agar data (formerly <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>) and then switching to Cle-motor interaction data only to finally switch back to motility analysis, is indeed somewhat confusing. To make the flow of the story more coherent and logic, we have switched the order of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figures 4</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">5</xref>, and 6 (with the old <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref> now being <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>; old <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref> now <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>; and old <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref> now <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). This creates a more logic flow in the Results section, where the biochemistry experiments are now followed by the experiments demonstrating CleA/D-motor interaction and finally by experiments addressing the in vivo function of individual Cle proteins.</p><p>In sum, the principle finding of the in vivo part of the manuscript is that different Cle proteins are involved in distinct aspects of moving and adhering. Although the details of this control remain unclear, we propose that the primary role of the Cle proteins is to coordinate flagellar function with physical stimuli during surface encounter thereby influencing the motile/sessile decision making. Thus, while CheY proteins tune the flagellar motor in a changing chemical landscape, we postulate that the Cle proteins integrate physical information.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Specific comments</p><p>1) In a previous work, the Jenal group undertook an extensive study of C. crescentus proteins with predicted diguanylate cyclase (DGC) and/or phosphodiesterase (PDE) activities (PLoS Genet 9(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">9</xref>)-e100374). It would be critical to determine if there is an interaction between these DGCs and the Cle system. For example, is the DGC DgcB, reported to be the main DGC dedicated to motility regulation, required for Cle function?</p><p>Addressing this could position the Cle proteins in the DGC pathway.</p></disp-quote><p>Hug et al., 2017 showed that the diguanylate cyclase DgcB acts in a pathway with the flagellar motor to increase c-di-GMP levels in response to mechanical stimuli during <italic>C. crescentus</italic> surface contact. Based on the observation that a <italic>ΔcleA-E</italic> mutant phenocopies a D<italic>dgcB</italic> mutant (increased spreading on semisolid agar, strongly reduced ability to rapidly form holdfast and attach to surfaces) and based on the observation that Cle proteins are activated by c-di-GMP, we speculate that DgcB is positioned upstream of one or several of the Cle proteins. We have introduced additional data demonstrating that DgcB is indeed upstream of the Cle proteins in Figure 6—figure supplement 1A, B.</p><p>It is possible that additional diguanylate cyclases and phosphodiesterases are involved in regulating the activity of individual Cle proteins. However, since the manuscript is already heavy on data, covering an additional upstream level of the Cle components would overload the story completely.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Is there any information on the expression of Cle proteins? Is CleB likely to contribute to any of the phenotypes discussed?</p></disp-quote><p>Please note the following statement in the manuscript:</p><p>“All five <italic>cle</italic> genes are expressed in PD cells, coincident with the transcription of flagellar and chemotaxis genes [Schrader et al., 2014, Zhou et al., 2015].”</p><p>We were not able to find a phenotype or behavioral change for the <italic>ΔcleB</italic> mutant. We assume that this bears on the limited functional space covered by our assays.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Abstract:</p><p>“We identified a novel family of CheY-like (Cle) proteins in Caulobacter crescentus, which tune flagellar activity in response to binding of the second messenger c-di-GMP to a short C-terminal extension.” This statement is not correct. Only one member of this family was shown to affect flagellar activity.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer that the data arguing for functional interference with the motor are strongest for CleA. To strengthen the idea that the other Cle proteins also interfere with the flagellar motor, we have added the following experimental data to the revised manuscript:</p><p>1) Overexpression of all individual <italic>cle</italic> genes lead to reduced spreading of <italic>C. crescentus</italic> in semisolid agar. Effective interference by <italic>cleC, cleD</italic> and <italic>cleE</italic> was independent of pili but required a functional copy of <italic>dgcB</italic>, arguing that these Cle proteins are downstream components of the DgcB-mediated surface response (see: Hug et al., 2017). The observation that the spreading of <italic>cle</italic> overexpression is independent of pili, indirectly argued for an involvement of the flagellum. These data have been added as supplement 1 of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref> (formerly <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>).</p><p>2) Rapid attachment of a <italic>ΔcleA-E</italic> mutant is restored by expressing <italic>cleC, cleD</italic> or <italic>cleE</italic> from a plasmid <italic>in trans</italic>. Importantly, this effect was only observed in strains expressing a functional <italic>fliM</italic> allele, while attachment was not restored in a strain expressing the mutant <italic>fliMID57WA</italic> allele, the product of which lacks the binding site for Cle proteins (data added to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E</xref>). This strongly argued that CleC, CleD and CleE contribute to rapid surface attachment via their interaction with the flagellum.</p><p>3) We have added localization data for CleC to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>, demonstrating that CleC, similar to CleA and CleD, localizes to the flagellated pole in a FliM-dependent manner.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>“In their c-di-GMP bound conformation Cle proteins interact with the flagellar switch to control motor activity.” This statement is also not quite correct. The requirement for c-di-GMP binding for promoting FliM interaction was implicated (by mutation of the R residues) for 2/5 proteins (CleA and CleD) in the data shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>. In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>, it does not appear the interaction between CleA/D and FliM was tested in the presence and absence of c-di-GMP in any of the three assays shown.</p></disp-quote><p>The referee is correct, in that this conclusion was primarily based on indirect data (cell biology, biochemistry) with direct evidence arguing for c-di-GMP mediated interaction of Cle proteins with FliM being missing in the original version of the manuscript. Since CleD is the only member of the Cle family amenable to biochemical studies, we had shown by NMR spectroscopy that full-length CleD interacts with the FliM wild-type peptide but not with the FliM_ID57WA mutant peptide <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref> (formerly <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>) To strengthen this point and to gather direct evidence for a role of c-di-GMP in motor interaction, we have repeated NMR experiments with full-length CleD and FliM wild-type peptide in the absence of c-di-GMP. The spectrum recorded without c-di-GMP was indistinguishable from spectra with CleD alone or with CleD, c-di-GMP and the FliM_ID57WA mutant peptide. Thus, an intact N-terminal peptide of FliM together with c-di-GMP is required for the interaction observed by NMR.</p><p>We have added reference to this experiment in the manuscript text:</p><p>“Adding the FliM wild-type peptide in two-fold excess resulted in shift changes of CleD of approximately 10 resonances. In contrast, the addition of the FliM peptide containing the ID57WA substitutions gave no observable chemical shift (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>). Likewise, the addition of the FliM wild-type peptide without c-di-GMP gave no observable shift.”</p><p>and in the legend to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>:</p><p>“The spectrum of CleD with c-di-GMP and the FliM_ID57WA mutant peptide or with CleD and the wild-type FliM peptide was indistinguishable from the spectrum recorded for CleD alone.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) There are major concerns linked to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>.</p><p>Motility. What accounts for the different motility behavior of single deletions of Cle C, D, and E in (A) vs (B) where levels of c-di-GMP are different? In fact, one learns later (in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>) that the CleA mutant, which does nothing in (A) and (B) has a hyper-reversal behavior when monitored by other assays. In (B), where only the single deletion of CleD increases motility somewhat, why does deletion of all 5 increase motility over the WT? The PYE motility medium should reflect both speed and chemotaxis. Since only CleA affects either parameter, why are the multiple deletions doing so much better in (A)?</p></disp-quote><p>General point:</p><p>We realized that one reason for the apparent confusion relating to the motility and attachment data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref> (formerly <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>) refers to the term “motility”, which was used throughout the manuscript to describe these experiments. The semisolid agar plate assay measures a combination of several processes like growth, chemotaxis, cell motility, and surface adherence. As indicated above we are now referring to “spreading on semisolid agar” as opposed to “motility” when discussing these data. Also, we have introduced the following sentences to make it clear to the reader how the data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A, B</xref> relate to the attachment data:</p><p>“We thus hypothesized that some of the Cle proteins mediate physiological changes sparked by (agar) surface contact. This idea is based on the premise that cells moving through semisolid agar will be constantly challenged by (agar) surface and thus may respond to physical cues by reducing their motility and boosting their propensity to attach.”</p><p>Specific points:</p><p>As outlined in the manuscript it is indeed counterintuitive that a <italic>ΔcleA</italic> mutant, which in a homogenous environment (quasi 2-D chamber, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>) shows a hyperreversal phenotype, is completely unaffected in its ability to spread on semisolid agar (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>; formerly <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). We argued in the manuscript that CleA and CheYI compete with CheYII for motor binding and that “the strongly increased reversal rates observed for these mutants in a homogenous environment are adjusted in chemical gradients, possibly by adapting the activity of CheYII or additional functional CheY homologs.”</p><p>The referee is rightly pointing out that individual <italic>cle</italic> deletion mutants show different phenotypes in the assays outlined in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6 a and b</xref> (formerly <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). It is important to note that the genetic background of the assay strains in these two experiments is different. While experiments in 6a were carried out in a c-di-GMP wild-type background, experiments in 6b were done in a strain lacking PdeA, which has increased levels of c-diGMP and, as a consequence, shows poor spreading on semisolid agar (Abel et al. 2011 Mol. Cell). Thus, Cle proteins are likely more active in <italic>ΔpdeA</italic> mutant as compared to a <italic>pdeA</italic><sup>+</sup> background.</p><p>The observation that a <italic>ΔcleD</italic> mutant is the only single <italic>cle</italic> mutant that partially restored spreading in the <italic>ΔpdeA</italic> background indicates that in cells with increased c-di-GMP levels this protein makes the largest contribution towards sessility. However, it is important to note that the other Cle proteins also contribute to the observed anti-spreading phenomenon, since a mutant lacking all five <italic>cle</italic> genes showed much improved spreading as compared to the <italic>ΔcleD</italic> single mutant. It is certainly not unusual for biological processes that the phenotype of specific mutations is dependent on the genetic context.</p><p>Finally, why does the <italic>ΔpdeA</italic> D5 mutant lift the degree of spreading to a level that is above wild-type (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>)? Please note that deleting all five <italic>cle</italic> genes improves spreading in agar by a factor of 4 both in the wild-type background (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>) and in the <italic>ΔpdeA</italic> background (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>). And related to this: why are the multiple <italic>cle</italic> deletions doing so much better in the assay in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref> (wt background) as compared to 6B (<italic>ΔpdeA</italic> background)? This is because the c-di-GMP concentration is different. Or, in other words, our data argue that spreading in semisolid agar is inhibited by c-di-GMP but not only via the Cle proteins but also via some other, unknown pathways. If one would delete all factors blocking spreading at high c-di-GMP one would expect that the overall spreading in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A and B</xref> would be similar, irrespective of their c-di-GMP background/level.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Adhesion. The other difficult aspect of assessing data in this figure is that when first introduced in the text, the adhesion assays are not discussed, and the reader has to wait until much later after the data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref> is presented. Like with the motility assays, the three different adhesion assays are also confusing. For example, why does deletion of CleC, D or E have no effect in the adhesion assay in (C) but has an effect in (E)? How is the polystyrene assay in (C) different from the holdfast assay in (E)?</p></disp-quote><p>Whereas a generic 24 hrs attachment assay to polystyrene surface was used in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref> (formerly <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>), experiments in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figures 6D</xref>/E and F/G make use of more sophisticated microfluidic-based attachment assays that were pioneered by Hug et al. 2017 and allow measuring surface sensing and attachment of newborn swarmer cells within a timescale of seconds to minutes. For instance, in the assay shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>/E strong flow removes new offspring immediately after separating from their mothers, unless they are able to sense surface and produce an adhesive holdfast. Similarly, the assay in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6F</xref>/G uses very small chambers in which newborn swarmer cells are constantly challenged by surface during and after division, thus allowing to determine the minimal time required for holdfast synthesis in response to physical cues from the surrounding surface. The observed differences in behavior of individual <italic>cle</italic> mutants (e.g. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C and 6E</xref>) bear on these fundamental experimental differences and assay conditions. For instance, attachment to plastic after 24 hours is a relatively crude assay that can provide only very general information about a process that occurs on a timescale of minutes. Phenotypes that are discernible in microfluidic-based assays may be easily masked in a long-term assay like the one shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>. The fact that deletion of <italic>cle</italic> genes strongly affected rapid attachment under flow conditions but showed a more moderate defect in a 24h attachment assay, argues for a specific role of Cle proteins in mechanosensation and short-term attachment.</p><p>The revised version of the manuscript introduces the individual attachment assays and explains their specific differences. E.g. we now state:</p><p>“To test if the observed attachment defect of cle mutants results from a reduced capability to sense and respond to surface interactions, we used microfluidic-based assays that allow to directly score surface attachment of SW cells [Persat, Stone and Gitai, 2014]. When dividing cells are cultured under strong medium flow, the newborn swarmer progeny rapidly deploy an adhesive holdfast upon surface contact and thus are able to adhere before being washed out [Hoffman et al., 2015, Hug et al., 2017] (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>).”</p><p>and also:</p><p>“Finally, we made use of microfluidic devices with small, quasi-2D side chambers (0.75 µm in height) to enhance surface encounter of newborn swarmer cells [Hug et al., 2017]. This assay allows following SW progeny microscopically from the moment of birth at division to the onset of holdfast production (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6F</xref>). The tight geometry of such microchambers offers cells constant surface interaction opportunities without medium flow.”</p><p>Also, we omitted the following sentence that had made reference to attachment data prematurely in the chapter on motility:</p><p>“This effect was specific for motility since deleting cleD failed to re-establish normal surface attachment of the <italic>C. crescentus</italic> pdeA mutant (see below, Figure 6—figure supplement 1A).”</p><p>In the revised version of the manuscript, all attachment data are now merged in the chapter “CleC and CleE promote surface recognition and attachment”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Subsection “CleC and CleE promote surface recognition and rapid attachment”: “a mutant lacking all five Cle proteins showed severely reduced attachment to polystyrene (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>)”. Is a 50% reduction in polystyrene binding really 'severe'? If so some comparisons are not clear: In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E, a</xref> 50% reduction in attachment of mutants lacking CleC, D or E, as well as the CheYII mutant is observed. Yet, the former set is characterized as “severely impaired” and the latter as “not impaired”. The conclusion 'that interaction of one or several Cle proteins with the motor is required for the ability to rapidly synthesize an adhesive holdfast in response to surface exposure is not justified.</p></disp-quote><p>The referee correctly points to a few cases where the wording of our manuscript was ambiguous or misleading. Thank you.</p><p>We have rephrased the sentence to:</p><p>“In agreement with this idea, mutants lacking one or several Cle proteins showed reduced attachment to polystyrene during a 24 hrs attachment assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>).”</p><p>The referee is correct, in that the <italic>ΔcheYII</italic> mutant does show reduced attachment in the flow chamber assay similar to some of the <italic>cle</italic> single mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E</xref>). However, the reduction is considerably stronger for <italic>ΔcleA-E</italic> and for the <italic>ΔcleCE</italic> mutants. This, together with the observation that expression of <italic>cleC, cleD</italic> or <italic>cleE</italic> alone can restore rapid surface attachment of the <italic>ΔcleA-E</italic> strain (new data added to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E</xref>), argued that CleC and CleE contribute significantly to this process.</p><p>The following sentence:</p><p>“Similarly, mutants lacking all Cle proteins or mutants lacking CleC, CleD or CleE showed severely impaired attachment” was replaced with:</p><p>“Similarly, mutants lacking all Cle proteins or mutants lacking CleC and CleE showed severely impaired attachment.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In (D) two cells are shown – ST cell that gives rise to the SW cell, which will then become an ST cell. Is the adhesion of both being monitored in (E)? Don't they have different c-di-GMP levels? Will that not impact the interpretation?</p></disp-quote><p>In this microfluidics-based assay SW offspring of attached mother cells are exposed to surface because the medium flow pushes crescentoid cells down towards the surface and positions the flagellated and piliated pole in close proximity to the substratum (see: Persat et al. 2014. Nature Com 5, 3824). This results in rapid holdfast biogenesis at the flagellated pole (preceding the developmental program by 10-20 minutes) and adherence of the daughters to the surface. <italic>Caulobacter</italic> cells attach only once, as holdfast glues them irreversibly to surfaces. Therefore, this assay only monitors the attachment efficiency of newborn swarmer offspring. This is dependent on the capacity to sense and respond to the mechanical trigger of surface contact.</p><p>To better explain this, we have added information in the Results section describing the system and referring to the work by Hug et al., 2017.

In contrast, genetic evidence indicated that CleE is required for efficient surface attachment. A failure to observe localization of this protein in our assays does not necessarily mean that it does not localize to the flagellar base under specific conditions, e.g. conditions favoring surface recognition more strongly than on agar pads, which were used for localization experiments. Also, it is possible that the CleE fusion to the fluorescent reporter is simply not stable.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>. CleD pulls down FliM, as well as shows binding to a FliM peptide by NMR. Is this interaction dependent on c-di-GMP. Similarly for the two-hybrid assay showing CleA-FliM interaction. Why not test the other Cle proteins in this assay?</p></disp-quote><p>We have tried to show FliM interaction with CleB, CleC and CleE.

It is only when we get to this figure showing that CleA affects motor reversals, that it becomes clear why CleA was being used in the previous experiments (in addition to the soluble CleD). Again, however, the motility assays in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref> were indicating a role for Cle-CDE, not CleA. How is this resolved?</p></disp-quote><p>See comments to point 4 above.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In light of the fact that the Arg domains in all the Cle proteins bind c-di-GMP, but not all showed robust localization or flagellar reversal modulation, why were reversal frequencies and motor speeds of the various Cle mutants not measured in the ΔpdeA background?</p></disp-quote><p>We found that the fraction of cells with localized CleA, CleC, and CleD were similar in wild type and the <italic>ΔpdeA</italic> mutant.</p><p>Analyzing Cle protein function in strains with different c-di-GMP levels is indeed a great idea.
