This patterning exists ab initio, from the very beginning, and therefore has been considered an activity-independent process. However, here we report that, during circuit development, the subcellular segregation of the visual and mechanosensory inputs to specific regions of tectal neuron dendrites in the tadpole optic tectum requires NMDA receptor activity. Blocking NMDARs during the formation of these sensory circuits, or removing the visual set of inputs, leads to less defined segregation, and suggests a correlation-based mechanism in which correlated inputs wire to common regions of dendrites. This can account for how two sets of inputs form synapses onto different regions of the same dendrite. Blocking NMDA receptors during later stages of circuit development did not disrupt segregation, indicating a critical period for activity-dependent shaping of patterns of innervation.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.20502.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.20502.001</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>axon segregation</kwd><kwd>activity-dependent</kwd><kwd>multisensory</kwd><kwd>subcellular</kwd><kwd>NMDA receptor</kwd><kwd>optic tectum</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd><italic>Xenopus</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100005714</institution-id><institution>Office of Experimental Program to Stimulate Competitive Research</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>(Outside the Box) Grant number 4201-11951-1001498 G</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Liu</surname><given-names>Zhenyu</given-names></name><name><surname>Pratt</surname><given-names>Kara G</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000057</institution-id><institution>National Institute of General Medical Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>P30-GM-32128</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Hamodi</surname><given-names>Ali S</given-names></name><name><surname>Liu</surname><given-names>Zhenyu</given-names></name><name><surname>Pratt</surname><given-names>Kara G</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>An activity-dependent mechanism sculpts subcellular segregation of sensory inputs.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>In most regions of the vertebrate CNS, afferent axonal inputs form topographic maps within specific layers of their target region. This laminar patterning of maps allows for multiple sets of afferent inputs to coexist across the same two dimensional plane of a common target, conducive to integration. This patterning motif is found in many brain structures that receive multiple sets of afferent input. For example, the different sensory inputs that are received and processed by the optic tecta of birds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Acheson et al., 1980</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Yamagata et al., 1995</xref>), fish (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Xiao et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Xiao and Baier, 2007</xref>), and amphibians (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Harris, 1982</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Udin and Fawcett, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Deeg et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Hiramoto and Cline, 2009</xref>), and the superior colliculus of mammals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">May, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Wallace et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Cang and Feldheim, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Inayat et al., 2015</xref>), form distinct layers across the laminar axis of their target neuropil. In the lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN), retinal ganglion cell input is segregated into eye-specific layers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Rakic, 1976</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Linden et al., 1981</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Shatz, 1983</xref>), and in the hippocampus, entorhinal cortical input forms synaptic connections onto specifically the distal regions of hippocampal pyramidal neurons, while the commissural inputs from within the hippocampus synapse onto the proximal portions of the same dendrites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Supèr and Soriano, 1994</xref>). Lamination is also a means for precise targeting of axons to their specific subcellular synaptic targets because, by being restricted to a particular layer, presynaptic inputs form synapses with only the section of dendrite that is within that layer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Huberman et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Yamagata and Sanes, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Sanes and Yamagata, 1999</xref>). With the exception of the eye-dependent segregation of inputs to the LGN, which are initially overlapping with one another and then become segregated or refined into layers by activity-dependent mechanisms, most lamination of inputs appears to exist ab initio, from the beginning, before sensory-driven activity is present, and therefore is considered to be an activity-independent process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Huberman et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Xiao and Baier, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Xiao et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Takahashi et al., 1999</xref>). Nevertheless, the subcellular precision in which synapses form onto their postsynaptic targets suggests that, similar to the refinement of the topographic map, activity-dependent mechanisms may also be important, once activity is present.</p><p>Here we test if the subcellular targeting of synapses is achieved via a similar activity-dependent mechanism that underlies refinement of the topographic map. For this we use the <italic>Xenopus</italic> tadpole optic tectum as a model system, a relatively simple and well-studied multisensory integration center. The optic tectum receives direct visual input from the retinal ganglion cells in the eye and mechanosensory input that enters the tectum via the brainstem. Both sets of afferent sensory inputs form topographic maps parallel with the surface of the neuropil, (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Sperry, 1963</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Holt and Harris, 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Sakaguchi and Murphey, 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Udin and Fawcett, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Hiramoto and Cline, 2009</xref>). These maps are segregated from one another such that visual inputs innervate the distal-most neuropil and mechanosensory inputs innervate the proximal-most layer, the region closest to the somata of the tectal neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Hiramoto and Cline, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Hamodi and Pratt, 2015</xref>). Both sets of sensory inputs are glutamatergic and activate postsynaptic responses via AMPA and NMDA receptors expressed on tectal neuron dendrites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Wu et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Deeg et al., 2009</xref>).

Our results show that the normal segregation between the visual and mechanosensory inputs across the tectal neuron dendrites relies on NMDA receptor-dependent activity, and suggests that the subcellular targeting of axons to a particular region of dendrite is achieved via a correlation-based mechanism that leads to the congregation of the afferent inputs with correlated firing patterns and the elimination of local non-correlated inputs.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Visual and non-visual afferent inputs innervate distinct lamina of the optic tectum</title><p>It has been previously determined that, in the tadpole optic tectum, RGC afferent axons are targeted to the distal (lateral) region of the laminar axis while the non-visual mechanosensory inputs that enter the tectum via the hindbrain (HB), and so called ‘HB inputs’, target the proximal (medial) region (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Hiramoto and Cline, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Deeg et al., 2009</xref>); <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). First, we confirmed this finding by labeling the RGC axons of stage 48/49 tadpoles with DiD (green), HB inputs with DiI (red), and imaging their terminations in the tectum (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B–D</xref>). We observed that, as previously reported, the two different sensory inputs innervate distinct, non-overlapping lamina in the neuropil with RGC inputs confined to distal lamina, HB inputs to the proximal. On the postsynaptic side, deep-layer tectal neurons display monosynaptic responses to both RGC and HB input activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Hamodi and Pratt, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Deeg et al., 2009</xref>), indicating that the RGC and HB inputs are targeted to different regions of the same tectal neuron dendrite, and that dendrites span essentially the full length of the laminar axis of the neuropil. Both evoked responses include a temporally distinct monosynaptic response due to the direct synaptic activation by the afferent input, followed by the polysynaptic portion of the response due to the activation of local microcircuitry within the tectum. An example of a whole cell recording of typical RGC- and HB-evoked responses from a single deep-layer tectal neuron of a stage 49 tadpole is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>.<fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.20502.002</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Visual and non-visual afferent inputs innervate different layers of the optic tectum neuropil and form synapses onto specific regions of tectal neuron dendrites.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Schematic of the optic tectum neuropil showing RGC inputs innervating the more distal or region of the neuropil and mechanosensory (HB) inputs innervating the more proximal region.

To address this, we used a modified whole brain preparation that allows direct access to the entire distal-proximal axis of the neuropil while, like the traditional whole brain preparation, retaining both the RGC and HB inputs. It was previously established that the pattern and strength of RGC and HB-evoked responses recorded from tectal neurons of the modified preparation do not differ from that recorded in the traditional preparation, indicating that RGC and HB inputs are not severed in the modified brain preparation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Hamodi and Pratt, 2015</xref>). Hence, the modified brain preparation allows for the activation of both the RGC and HB inputs while recording resulting synaptic field potentials (FPs) at different points along the distal-proximal laminar axis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A,B</xref>). Peak FP amplitudes, which reflect the absolute strength of the postsynaptic response at that particular position in space, were measured and then normalized by setting the maximal peak FP amplitude to 1.0 for each tectum, allowing for the pattern of FP responses to be averaged across multiple tecta. In addition, current source densities (CSDs) were calculated from the spatial pattern of FPs. The CSDs, derived by calculating the second spatial derivative, subtracts the local background depolarization thus revealing the precise location of the sensory evoked response. Calculating CSDs from field potential recordings has been used to analyze the spatial organization of inputs in the adult frog optic tectum (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Chung et al., 1974</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Nakagawa et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Nakagawa and Matsumoto, 1998</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">2000</xref>). The CSDs are then converted to image plots. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> shows an example of RGC-evoked FPs recorded from different points along the laminar axis of the tectum of a stage 49 tadpole (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). From the FPs, CSDs are calculated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>), and the corresponding image plot is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>. The major sink appearing at the far distal end of the neuropil is a characteristic of the RGC-evoked image plot observed for normal tecta. The HB-evoked response is characterized by the maximum FP and CSD sink occurring at the proximal end of the laminar axis (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref> for an example of an HB-evoked FPs, CSDs, and resulting image plot). Throughout this study, the location of both the maximum FP amplitude and CSD sink are reported as the distance from distal edge. In addition to revealing the spatial pattern of synapses formed by the afferent sensory inputs, our data include the sensory-evoked spatial pattern of synaptic connections of the local microcircuity that generates the polysynaptic portion of the response (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). It is interesting to note that the microcircuitry also displays a spatially organized, stratified pattern that closely matches that of the monosynaptic pattern.<fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.20502.003</object-id><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>The spatial pattern of synaptic input is determined by recording RGC- and HB-evoked synaptic field potentials at equidistant points along the distal-proximal neuropil.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Simplified schematic of the tectal neuropil showing RGC (distal) and HB (proximal) axonal inputs onto tectal neuron dendrites.

If such an interaction exists, it would be expected that removing one of the two sets of inputs would affect the remaining input. To test this, we eliminated the RGC input to one of the two tectal lobes by surgically removing the contralateral eye at stage 34, the stage when RGC axons have just begun to exit the eyecup (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hocking and Mcfarlane, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">de La Torre et al., 1997</xref>). During the early larval stages of tadpole development which we focus on in this study, the major source of visual input received by the tectum is from the contralateral eye. Thus removing the contralateral eye is an effective method to eliminate the majority of RGC input received by that tectum. Occasionally, sparse ipsilateral RGC input has been observed in tadpoles at these stages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Munz et al., 2014</xref>); and we, too, have observed the presence of sparse ipsilateral input innervating control tecta and tecta whose contralateral input has been removed via enucleation (data not shown). Hence, removing the contralateral input removes either all or a vast majority of visual input received by the contralateral optic tectum. Once tadpoles reached stage 49, the stage when the two sensory circuits are normally well-established and functional, we recorded HB-evoked FPs from (1) the tectum that is devoid of contralateral RGC input (DCR) and, (2) as an internal control, the tectum (of the same brain) that receives normal, unaltered compliment of RGC input (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>), For each recorded tectum, the peak HB-evoked FP amplitudes were normalized and plotted as a function of the distance from the distal-most point of the axis. An average spatial FP profile was generated for control and DCR tecta by averaging the individual plots for control and DCR tecta. Compared to control, we found that the averaged spatial pattern of HB-evoked FPs in the tecta devoid of contralateral RGC input was shifted distally (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>; distance from distal edge of average HB-evoked FP maximum peak amplitude for control tecta: 110 μm, n = 10, for DCR tecta: 80 μm, n = 12). In addition, we also identified, for each tectum, the position across the axis where the absolute maximum HB-evoked FP amplitude occurred and found that it occurred at a significantly more distal location in the DCR tecta relative to control tecta (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>; average distance from distal edge where HB-evoked FP amplitude peaks for control tectum: 104 ± 6.7 μm, n = 10 tecta, 95% Confidence Interval (CI): upper limit = 117.13 μm, lower limit = 90.87 μm; DCR tectum: 84.17 ± 5.29 μm, n = 12 tecta; 95% CI: upper limit = 94.53 μm, lower limit = 73.6 μm p=0.028, unpaired t-test). This difference in the pattern of HB afferent innervation between the control and DCR tecta is reflected in the corresponding HB-evoked CSD image plots (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D,E</xref>). For controls, the major HB-evoked current sinks consistently appear in the proximal end of the laminar axis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>) as predicted by the axon imaging experiments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B–D</xref>). In the DCR tecta, however, the major HB-evoked current sinks appear at more distal locations along the laminar axis, and in some cases appeared to be widely spread out across the entire length of the laminar axis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>). Averaging the distances from the distal edge at which the major HB-evoked CSD sink occurred for both control and DCR tecta indicated, similar to the FP data, that absence of RGC input causes HB inputs to innervate more distal regions of the laminar axis compared to control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref>; for control tectum, the major HB-evoked CSD sink occurred, on average, at 85 ± 6.9 μm from the distal edge, n = 10 tecta, 95% Confidence Interval (CI) upper limit = 98.5 μm, lower limit = 71.48 μm; for DCR tectum: 69.2 ± 3.6 μm, n = 12 tecta; 95% CI: upper limit = 76.26 μm, lower limit = 62.14 μm p=0.04, unpaired t-test.) Thus, the absence of contralateral RGC input appears to cause the pattern of HB innervation to shift more distally, and to permit a portion of HB inputs to trespass into to distal territory and form functional synaptic connections with more distal regions of tectal dendrites.<fig id="fig3" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.20502.005</object-id><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>Monocular enucleation at stage 34 shifts HB inputs towards the distal neuropil.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>), <italic>top</italic>) Timeline of when enucleation and then recording was carried out, and schematic showing monocular enucleation resulting in one tectal lobe (left) devoid of contralateral RGC axons (DCR) and the other tectal lobe (right) receiving normal contralateral RGC input.

As predicted by the CSD and FP data, we observed that HB axonal inputs in the DCR tecta appeared less focused in space and extended into the vacant dendritic region that is normally occupied by RGC axons, whereas the control tectum showed a typical confined band of HB axons along the proximal part of the laminar axis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A–C</xref>). <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref> shows the fluorescent intensity profiles for the HB axons innervating the DCR and control tectal lobes shown in panel 4A. For the DCR lobe, the intensity of fluorescence, which corresponds to axon density, peaks at a more distal location compared to control. Peak fluorescence of control HB axons was found to occur, on average, at 88.6 ± 2.9 μm from the distal edge of the tectum (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>; n = 4 tecta, 95% CI upper limit = 97.9 μm, Cl lower limit = 79.2 μm), while the peak fluorescence observed for HB axons innervating a DCR tectum occurred at 65.8 ± 4.3 μm from the distal edge (n = 4 tecta, 95% Cl upper limit = 79.4 μm, Cl lower limit = 52.1 μm). The difference in locations of peak HB axon fluorescence between control and DCR tecta was statistically significant (p=0.004, unpaired t-test). Combined, these data establish that the absence of the contralateral RGC input does not appear to completely unleash the HB inputs, as these inputs are still targeted to, and form synapses within, their normal target lamina. We also observed that the absence of RGC input does not result in HB inputs taking over the entire distal lamina, but rather it induces them to take over a fraction of the synaptic sites beyond their distal border, sites that would normally be occupied by retinotectal synapses. This suggests a competition-based interaction at the border/interface between the distal and the proximal portion of the laminar axis. Normally, when both afferent inputs are present, this competition could focus the different sensory inputs on their respective lamina, similar to the way activity-driven competition between RGC axons refines the topographic map. Because refinement of the topographic map is known to be NMDA receptor (NMDAR)-dependent, we tested the role of NMDARs in the segregation of the RGC and HB afferent inputs to their respective laminae.<fig id="fig4" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.20502.006</object-id><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><title>Monocular enucleation at stage 34 results in extended innervation of tectal neuropil by HB axons.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Bilateral DiI (red) labeling of HB inputs shows extensive HB axon innervation of the region of neuropil normally occupied by RGC axons in the DCR tectum.

To determine whether NMDAR blockade disrupts the subcellular targeting of RGC and HB input to the distal and proximal regions, respectively, of tectal neuron dendrites, tadpoles were reared in the presence of the non-competitive NMDAR blocker, MK-801 (25 μM). Adding this drug to the rearing solution chronically inhibits NMDAR activity in tadpoles and it is well established that this drug at this concentration abolishes NMDAR-mediated visual responses in tectal neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Ruthazer et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Dong et al., 2009</xref>), but does not appear to significantly alter RGC- or HB-evoked transmission (data not shown), consistent with the observation that both RGC and HB-evoked input received by tectal neurons is mediated largely via AMPA receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Deeg et al., 2009</xref>) and that the presence of MK801 had negligible effects on RGC-evoked responses in tectal neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Ruthazer et al., 2003</xref>) Exposure to the blocker began at developmental stage 39, when RGC axons have just reached the tectum, through stage 49, when the retinotectal circuitry has formed and has undergone some degree of topographic refinement. Once MK-801-exposed and batch-matched controls (i.e. tadpoles generated from the same mating and reared in regular Steinberg’s solution) had reached stage 49, the spatial pattern of functional synapses formed by the two sensory inputs was measured by recording FPs from different points along the laminar axis in response to RGC and HB activation. The FPs and image plots from the MK-801-exposed tecta were compared to those of batch-matched controls. We found that the MK-801 treated tecta displayed a noticeably different spatial pattern of both RGC- and HB-evoked FP amplitudes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A,B</xref>). In control tecta, the distal part of the laminar axis receives the majority of RGC input while the proximal part receives the majority of HB input (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>). For MK-801 tecta however, the spatial distribution is much more disperse and without an obvious separation between the two inputs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>). Also for each tectum, the position across the axis where the absolute maximum RGC- and HB-evoked FP amplitude occurred was compared for controls and for MK-801 treated tecta. We found that for controls, the maximum RGC-evoked FP amplitudes occurred at 56.66 ± 7.41 μm from the distal edge, n = 15, 95% CI: upper limit = 72.6 μm, lower limit = 40.8 μm; and maximum HB-evoked amplitudes occurred at 102.73 ± 5.41 μm from the distal edge, n = 11, 95% CI: upper limit = 114.8 μm, lower limit = 90.7 μm; p=0.0007, non-parametric Mann-Whitney test (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>), thus a distance of approximately 45 μm separates the maximum responses of the two inputs. For MK-801-reared tecta, the maximum RGC-evoked FP amplitudes occurred at 80.48 ± 6.88 μm from the distal edge, n = 21, 95% CI: upper limit = 94.8 μm, lower limit = 66.1 μm; and maximum HB-evoked amplitudes occurred at 97.5 ± 7.4 μm from the distal edge, n = 12, 95% CI: upper limit = 113.8 μm, lower limit = 81.2 μm; p=0.122, unpaired t-test (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>), thus a distance of approximately 17 μm separating them. Moreover, blocking NMDARs produced an FP amplitude spatial profile that lacked an obvious peak. In other words, the absolute peak amplitude was surrounded by amplitudes of similar magnitude (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>). Because of this, we also measured the amount of overlap between the HB- and RGC- evoked FP spatial profiles and observed significantly more overlap between RGC and HB in the MK-801 exposed tecta compared to the control tecta (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>; overlap index for control: 3.23 ± 0.42, n = 12, 95% CI: upper limit = 4.2 μm, lower limit = 2.3 μm; MK801: 4.42 ± 0.29, n = 12, 95% CI: upper limit = 5.1 μm, lower limit = 3.8 μm; p=0.029, unpaired t-test). CSDs were also calculated for the two groups and the resulting image plots were consistent with the FP analysis: In control tecta, the main RGC-evoked current sink is localized to the distal region of the laminar axis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>), the HB-evoked current sink to the proximal region (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>). In MK-801 reared tadpoles, however, the RGC- and HB-evoked current sinks appear more diffuse is space and in some cases sinks and sources appeared throughout the entire length of the laminar axis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C,D</xref>), indicating a disorganized projection. Similar to the FPs, the position across the axis where the maximum RGC- and HB-evoked CSD sinks occurred revealed less separation between inputs in MK-801-treated group due to decreased segregation of both inputs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E</xref>): For control, the maximum RGC-evoked CSD sinks occurred at an average of 50.5 ± 8.9 μm from distal the distal edge (n = 18 tecta; 95% Cl upper limit = 97.94 μm, Cl lower limit = 63.6 μm), and major HB-evoked CSD sinks occurred at an average of 80.8 ± 7.9 μm from the distal edge (n = 13 tecta; 95% Cl upper limit = 69.28 μm, Cl lower limit = 31.83 μm). The average distance between the major HB- and RGC-evoked CSD sinks was statistically significant (p=0.02, unpaired t-test). For MK-801 tecta, the maximum RGC-evoked CSD sinks occurred at an average of 71.7 ± 9.6 μm from the distal edge (n = 18 tecta, 95% CI upper limit = 92.01 μm, lower limit = 51.32 μm), and the major HB-evoked CSD sinks occurred at an average of 70 ± 8.4 μm from the distal edge (n = 11 tecta; 95% Cl upper limit = 88.76 μm, lower limit = 51.24 μm) suggesting essentially no gap, between the inputs. Indeed, the average distance between the major RGC and HB CSD sinks in the MK-801 treated group was not statistically significant (p=0.91, unpaired t-test). Thus, the majority of the RGC synaptic input in MK801-treated tecta was happening further away from the distal edge compared to control, and the majority of the HB synaptic input was happening closer to the distal edge compared to control.<fig id="fig5" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.20502.007</object-id><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><title>NMDA receptor blockade, starting at stage 39, disrupts the normal degree of spatial segregation between RGC and HB synaptic inputs measured by peak FPs.</title><p>(<italic>Top Left</italic>) timeline of experiment.

To address this, tadpoles were exposed to MK-801 at a later stage in development (stage 45), after both the visual and non-visual inputs have established their postsynaptic targets. Once tadpoles reached stage 49, the same set of experiments as previously described were carried out to characterize the degree of functional and structural segregation. The RGC- and HB-evoked spatial profile of peak FP amplitudes of the MK-801-exposed tecta resemble control profiles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>), and we found that the maximum FP amplitude for both RGC and HB inputs occurred at approximately 40 and 100 μm, respectively, from the distal edge of the neuropil for both MK-801 and batch-matched control tecta (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>).

We found that early and late NMDAR blockade significantly increased the total amount of overlap of RGC and HB axons compared to control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8A–C and E</xref>; the average RGC and HB overlap area for control: 12.5 ± 1.7 gray value * μm, n = 7, 95% Cl upper limit = 15.82, Cl lower limit = 9.19 gray value * μm; for early MK-801 tecta: 23.1 ± 3.7 gray value * μm, n = 11, 95% Cl upper limit = 30.3, Cl lower limit = 15.9 gray value * μm; p=0.04 compared to control, un-paired t-test; for late MK-801 tecta: 29.85 ± 4.4 gray value * μm, n = 5, 95% Cl upper limit = 38.4, Cl lower limit = 21.3 gray value * μm; p=0.002 compared to control). Thus, although blocking NMDARs later in development did not disrupt the distance between peak FPS, CSDs, or axon fluorescence, it did appear to activate a fraction of axons – perhaps a set of relatively immature axons that are still undergoing NMDAR-dependent processes – to desegregate. This effect is clearly illustrated in the fluorescent profile examples shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>. Compared to the fluorescent profile for the control tectum (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8A</xref>, far right), the profile for the late MK801 tectum (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8C</xref>, far right) shows a noticeable increase in overlap of the two inputs. In this example, the overlap appears to be generated mainly by a set of low intensity (diffuse) HB axons that have moved into the distal territory. The overall result is increased overlap between inputs without altering the position of the peak axon fluorescence.</p><p>Combined, these data suggest that, once formed and likely stabilized via NMDAR-dependent mechanisms, sensory-specific axon segregation is no longer NMDAR-dependent for the majority of axons.

A portion of the HB inputs extended beyond their normal proximal lamina into a more distal lamina, and formed synapses onto more distal regions of dendrite that are normally synaptic targets for RGC axons, suggesting that the sensory-dependent segregation of afferent inputs across the neuropil, and in this case, across the distal-proximal axis of individual dendrites, requires their physical presence. If the input is absent during the development of the circuit, its target region becomes ectopically innervated by the remaining neighboring afferent input. Similar monocular enucleation studies in the axolotl (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Harris, 1983</xref>) and the rodent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Rhoades, 1980</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Rhoades et al., 1981</xref>) are consistent with our findings. In both of these studies, eye enucleation during embryonic stages of development resulted in a portion of the non-visual inputs to shift into the vacant area of the optic tectum for the axolotl, and the superior colliculus in the rodent. In cats and primates monocular enucleation leads to the inputs from the remaining eye to grow beyond their normal laminae in the lateral geniculate nucleus and take over territory that normally would have been occupied by the enucleated eye (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Rakic, 1981</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Chalupa and Williams, 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Shatz, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Shatz and Sretavan, 1986</xref>). Thus, several pieces of evidence from different model systems support the concept that a reciprocal interaction between different sensory inputs shapes their segregation. From a comparative standpoint, it would be interesting to know if this type of enucleation-induced remodeling of inputs happens in the zebrafish or chick optic tectum, because laminar segregation in these models is thought to be mediated by activity-independent molecular cues, namely cell adhesion molecules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Baier, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Xiao and Baier, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Yamagata and Sanes, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Yamagata et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Takahashi et al., 1999</xref>), however, there are no reports of enucleation studies in these models.</p><p>The monocular enucleation experiment data also provide evidence that in the tadpole tectum, the sensory-dependent subcellular targeting of axons to specific regions of a common dendrite is likely not guided by guidance molecules, such as ephrins, alone because if it were, then just removing the RGC input would not be expected to desegregate the remaining input. A rewiring study by Lyckman and colleagues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Lyckman et al., 2001</xref>) provides an example of what we may have expected to find if the segregation of sensory inputs in the tadpole optic tectum were regulated by a molecular signal: in the mouse thalamus, RGCs project to the lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN) and auditory inputs project to the medial geniculate nucleus (MGN). It was found that cutting the auditory afferent input induced the RGC inputs to shift over to the MGN <italic>only</italic> in an EphrinA2/A5 double knockout mouse. The shift was not observed in wild type mice because Ephrin expression between the LGN and MGN inhibits the remaining input from crossing over into vacant territory. Therefore, because we observe a shift in mechanosensory inputs to the more distant dendrites by just removing the RGC input indicates that, in this case, segregation is not under the sole control of molecular cues. Nevertheless, the possibility that the absence of the RGC input somehow altered the expression pattern of some putative molecular signal cannot be ruled out, and it is interesting to note that a differential pattern of ephrin expression across the laminar axis of both the Rana pipiens (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Scalia and Feldheim, 2005</xref>) and Xenopus laevis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Higenell et al., 2012</xref>) optic tectum has been reported, although whether this gradient is involved with segregation of the different sensory inputs has not been determined.</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>Segregation of visual and non-visual inputs is likely achieved via an NMDAR correlation-based mechanism</title><p>The second main finding is that blocking NMDARs with MK-801 during the development of these circuits also disrupts the normal degree of segregation between inputs. These data suggest that the subcellular segregation of inputs across tectal neuron dendrites could be governed by an NMDAR-dependent correlation-based mechanism similar to the mechanism underlying refinement of the topographic map (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Cline and Constantine-Paton, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Debski et al., 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Dong et al., 2009</xref>). Our results from both the eye enucleation and NMDAR blockade experiments support a Hebbian form of developmental plasticity that dictates that inputs are governed according to the degree of correlation that exists between their firing patterns and the firing patterns of the local neighboring inputs. If a given input is well correlated with that of surrounding inputs, there is a high probability it will be stabilized. Conversely, if there is a low degree of correlation, it will be eliminated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Ruthazer et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Munz et al., 2014</xref>). This concept of correlated inputs wiring to common regions of dendrite is supported by the finding that RGC inputs form a subcellular map across individual tectal neurons such that near-neighbor RGC inputs, which would display a high degree of correlated firing, target to near neighbor region of dendrite (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bollmann and Engert, 2009</xref>), and further the super-correlated pattern of RGC firing created by optic flow across the retina has been shown to enhance refinement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hiramoto and Cline, 2014</xref>). Thus, across a common dendrite, any HB axon that is in the vicinity of RGC axons would not be able to form stable synapses in that area because the firing patterns of HB inputs are not correlated with RGC patterns. And because weak synapses do not support the stabilization of its axon (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Ruthazer et al., 2006</xref>) – the entire HB axon and its synapses would be eliminated. Moreover, the normal distance, or gap, between the RGC and HB inputs could be a direct reflection of dendritic territory over which NMDARs can detect two given inputs as being correlated or non-correlated. Our results are consistent with NMDARs working as correlation detectors, strengthening what is perceived by the postsynaptic neuron as strong highly correlated input. Exposing tadpoles to MK-801, however, blocks all NMDARs, so the possibility that presynaptic NMDARs could play a role in axon segregation cannot be ruled out. It is not possible to block specifically postsynaptic NMDARs in essentially all tectal neurons that these tectum-wide experiments require, and this is a limit of our preparation. Alternatively, a postsynaptic NMDAR-dependent mechanism would likely involve the downstream activation of calcium-calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII), which can be blocked pharmacologically. Thus, a future experiment is to test whether blocking CaMKII at developmental stage 39 disrupts segregation. This will help to determine presynaptic versus postsynaptic NMDAR-dependent mechanisms. In addition, this will be an especially interesting experiment given that postsynaptic activation of CaMKII in cultured cortical neurons has been shown to remodel inputs such that the strongest inputs are kept and strengthened while other inputs are completely lost (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Pratt et al., 2003</xref>).</p><p>We observed that blocking NMDARs during circuit formation did not induce a global and complete remodeling of axonal inputs. Indeed, the inputs retained their normal patterns of innervation, and were targeted to their proper regions – RGC inputs to the distal region of the laminar axis, HB inputs to the proximal. Thus, similar to the formation of the topographic map, the guidance and targeting of different sensory inputs is almost certainly achieved by activity-independent molecular cues. But our data also indicate that, similar to the activity-dependent refinement phase of topographic map formation, the normal degree of segregation of inputs at the more local, synaptic level requires NMDAR-dependent activity. It is worth noting here that the segregation of different sensory inputs differs from refinement of the topographic map in that the segregation of inputs does not refine, technically. Instead of starting out coarse like the initial topographic map, meaning that the axons are less focused in space such that one postsynaptic neuron receives input from many axons and being sculpted via activity such that any one neuron receives fewer different axonal inputs, the different sensory inputs appear segregated ab initio, from the very beginning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Deeg et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Hiramoto and Cline, 2009</xref>). Thus, it is not that the inputs start out overlapping and then become refined by activity, but blocking NMDAR activation while the sensory inputs are in the midst of forming synapses with postsynaptic targets causes the inputs to lose their normal degree of segregation. In this context, therefore, NMDAR-dependent activity prevents the desegregation of inputs.</p><p>Similar to the remodeling of axonal inputs underlying ocular dominance plasticity, the desegregation of inputs induced by blocking NMDARs also appears to be defined by a critical period. The critical period appears to coincide with when the sensory inputs are forming synaptic connections with postsynaptic tectal neurons. Once this dynamic phase of synapse formation has waned, blocking NMDARs no longer has an effect on the degree of segregation between the majority of afferent axonal inputs. It is interesting to note that although the late (stage 45) MK-801 exposure was not observed to alter the spatial position of peak field potential amplitudes, peak CSD sinks, nor peak HB and RGC axon fluorescence, it did appear to significantly increase the overall amount of overlap between these two sets of axons. This increase in overlap in response to late MK801 exposure could reflect a subpopulation of relatively immature axons that have more recently entered the tectum and are still undergoing NMDAR-dependent correlation-based processes. In addition, the HB axons, specifically, appeared to be more affected by late MK-801 exposure than the RGC axons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8C</xref>, far right). This is consistent with the report that synapses made by non-visual mechanosensory inputs mature slower and display lower AMPA:NMDA ratios compared to retinotectal synapses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Deeg et al., 2009</xref>).</p><p>Why may the segregation of inputs involve an activity-dependent component while many other examples of lamination appear to be hard wired? One important aspect of the tadpole optic tectum that sets it apart from most other integration centers is that the tectal neuron dendrites span the entire laminar axis and receive input from both sensory modalities. Thus, in the tadpole optic tectum, inputs are segregated to the distal and proximal regions of a common dendrite, while in zebrafish, and chick, inputs form onto specific cell types (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Yamagata and Sanes, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Baier, 2013</xref>). The subcellular type of targeting of inputs that occurs in the tadpole optic tectum also occurs in the hippocampus where individual pyramidal neurons receive two distinct, spatially segregated sets of afferent input: entorhinal cortical input which innervates the distal region, and local commissural input which is targeted to the more proximal region of the same dendrite (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Supèr and Soriano, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Supèr et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">del Río et al., 1997</xref>). The way inputs get targeted to different regions of common dendrite in these neurons is elaborate. Early on, there are different cell types (Cajal-Retzius and GABAergic cells) residing in two different laminae – and these cells are transient and they seem to attract the different inputs – once the inputs are there they actually form synapses with these transient populations of cells, then the attractor cells die off and the axons are left to form synapses with the local dendrites of the pyramidal cells. So it is difficult to say if this shares any mechanisms with tectal neurons, except perhaps the first phase of segregation that involves the Cajal-Retzius and GABAergic attractor cells is independent of activity, but then NMDAR-dependent mechanisms maintain segregation of inputs as they form synapses onto the pyramidal dendrites.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Possible function of subcellular segregation</title><p>This study does not address the function of subcellular segregation of inputs. We have not yet been able to address this because the chronic blockade of NMDARs – which disrupts the segregation – also disrupts the refinement of the RGC topographic map (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Dong et al., 2009</xref>). In order to begin to understand why segregation of inputs across the laminar axis may be important, it will first be necessary to find a manipulation that disrupts specifically the segregation. The following ideas about possible functions of such segregation are speculative. Segregation during the formation of individual topographic maps may be conducive for the formation and refinement of these maps, because if there was no such segregation, then visual and non-visual input could potentially compete for the same postsynaptic sites and thereby interfere with necessary competition-based mechanisms which underlie refinement. Further, the segregation of different sensory inputs along the laminar axis could be necessary for the proper alignment of their topographic maps via promoting cooperation between different sensory inputs whose receptive fields match. If two axons – one at the distal end of the dendrite, one at the proximal end – contribute to generating an action potential in the postsynaptic neuron, then they will be kept and strengthened. This function of segregation is based on the assumption that the different sensory inputs are, at least a portion of the time, coactive. This subcellular cooperation between different sensory inputs would likely be weakened or made less robust if these two inputs were competing for the same region of dendrite. Thus, keeping the different inputs separated in space, yet still synapsing onto the same neuron could facilitate the alignment of the maps and thereby support proper multisensory integration. The spatial segregation of inputs also focuses or clusters correlated synaptic input onto a defined region of the dendritic tree. This clustering could promote cooperation between correlated inputs which may lead to long-lasting changes in synaptic strength (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Frick et al., 2004</xref>) and dendritic excitability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Losonczy et al., 2008</xref>). Clustered input, as opposed to a disperse pattern, is thought to potentiate spike-timing plasticity processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Sjostrom et al., 2008</xref>) which are expressed in these neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Zhang et al., 1998</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Conclusion</title><p>During development of many sensory circuits in the vertebrate CNS, molecular cues guide sensory inputs to form a course topographic map across the 2-dimensional surface of their target regions.

Our results suggest a similar progression of activity-independent, then –dependent mechanisms that together result in the segregation of inputs across tectal neuron dendrites. Activity – specifically NMDAR-dependent activity – segregates the different inputs, implicating a correlation-based mechanism.

Briefly, we used glass micropipettes in the range of 4–5 MΩ filled with external recording saline. In current clamp mode, evoked FPs in response to stimulating either the RGC (visual) or hindbrain (non-visual) inputs were recorded at 10 µm intervals from the most outer/distal part of the neuropil to the deepest somatic layer while stimulating RGC or HB axons. A scale bar was superimposed onto the video monitor for accurate placement of the recording pipette. The strength of stimulation was determined by first identifying the intensity that generates a maximal FP response then decreasing that intensity to about 75% of maximum to generate a reliable synaptic FP while minimizing action potential firing and thereby minimizing any depolarizations in the dendrites induced by back-propagating action potentials. Importantly, the modified brain slice preparation used here allows for both visual and non-visual mechanosensory inputs to be activated and the resulting synaptic field potentials to be recorded from readily accessible and accurately measured positions along the entire laminar axis of the neuropil (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Hamodi and Pratt, 2015</xref>). Unlike recording from the traditional whole brain preparation, the recording pipette is never advanced vertically through the tissue, which creates unidentified amounts of drag and thus inaccurate distance measurements and has prevented the recording of the relatively small and thin neuropil of tadpole larvae (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Chung et al., 1974</xref>).

Peak FP amplitudes of RGC and HB responses varied across tecta, therefore we normalized these responses such that the largest amplitude observed for each individual tectum was designated as 1.0. In this way, responses across tecta could be averaged. We report the distance at which FP peak amplitudes occur as the distance from distal edge because this edge is readily identified and therefore provides a precise point in space from which to measure all other points across the laminar axis. For each tectum, a spatial profile of functional RGC and HB-evoked synaptic input was generated by plotting the normalized peak FP amplitude as a function of position across the distal-proximal axis. Besides showing where along the axis the bulk of the synaptic input resides, these plots were also used to measure the degree of spatial overlap between the two sensory inputs by calculating the shared region of the plot (i.e. the portion of synaptic profiles that are common to both inputs). The area of the shared region was estimated by summing all the portions of the field potential amplitudes that were common to both inputs. For all data that passed the normality test, an un-paired 2-tailed T-test was used to test statistical significance.

Image plots were generated using Plotly software.<disp-formula id="equ1"><mml:math id="m1"><mml:mstyle displaystyle="true" scriptlevel="0"><mml:mrow><mml:mfrac><mml:mrow><mml:msup><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">∂</mml:mi><mml:mn>2</mml:mn></mml:msup><mml:mi>V</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">∂</mml:mi><mml:msup><mml:mi>x</mml:mi><mml:mn>2</mml:mn></mml:msup></mml:mrow></mml:mfrac><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mfrac><mml:mrow><mml:mi>V</mml:mi><mml:mo stretchy="false">(</mml:mo><mml:mi>x</mml:mi><mml:mo>+</mml:mo><mml:mi>n</mml:mi><mml:mo>.</mml:mo><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">Δ</mml:mi><mml:mi>x</mml:mi><mml:mo stretchy="false">)</mml:mo><mml:mo>+</mml:mo><mml:mi>V</mml:mi><mml:mo stretchy="false">(</mml:mo><mml:mi>x</mml:mi><mml:mo>−</mml:mo><mml:mi>n</mml:mi><mml:mo>.</mml:mo><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">Δ</mml:mi><mml:mi>x</mml:mi><mml:mo stretchy="false">)</mml:mo><mml:mo>−</mml:mo><mml:mn>2</mml:mn><mml:mi>V</mml:mi><mml:mo stretchy="false">(</mml:mo><mml:mi>x</mml:mi><mml:mo stretchy="false">)</mml:mo></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mo stretchy="false">(</mml:mo><mml:mi>n</mml:mi><mml:mo>.</mml:mo><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">Δ</mml:mi><mml:msup><mml:mi>x</mml:mi><mml:mn>2</mml:mn></mml:msup><mml:mo stretchy="false">)</mml:mo></mml:mrow></mml:mfrac></mml:mrow></mml:mstyle></mml:math></disp-formula></p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Axon labelling</title><p>To image axons, DiI (1,1’ -dioctadecyl- 3,3,3’,3’ -tetramethylindocarbocyanine perchlorate; Molecular Probes) and DiD (1,1’-dioctadecyl-3,3,3’,3’-tetrame- thylindodicarbocyanine perchlorate; Molecular Probes) were dissolved into 5% ethanol for injection. Xenopus tadpoles were anesthetized in 0.01% MS-222, DiI was injected into both sides of the hindbrain, and DiD was injected into both eyes, then tadpoles were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) for six days. Prior to imaging, samples were rinsed three times in 0.1 M phosphate buffer (PB: pH 7.4), mounted onto a customized slide for in vivo imaging, and then imaged using a laser scanning confocal microscope (Carl Zeiss LSM 710).</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Quantification of axon labeling</title><p>ImageJ software was used to quantify the pixel intensity of RGC and HB axon terminations in the laminar axis. For this, a single line was drawn parallel to the laminar axis at a point along the rostrocaudal axis where the neuropil is the widest. The fluorescent profile along this line was generated. We identified the distance from the distal edge of the laminar axis at which the peak pixel intensity, corresponding to the bulk of axonal input, of RGC and HB axons occurred and measured the distance (i.e. the gap) between the two peaks. The merged RGC and HB axon fluorescent profiles were also used to measure the amount of overlap between the two sets of axons by quantifying the area of each profile that was common to both inputs.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We thank Michael Dillon for the R script for calculating second spatial derivatives.

Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, one of whom, Ronald Calabrese, is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors and the evaluation has been overseen by Eve Marder as the Senior Editor.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>This study combines neuronal labeling and electrophysiology (LFP and CSD analysis) to study the segregation of visual and somatosensory inputs in the tectum of <italic>Xenopus</italic> tadpoles. The study confirms that these inputs are segregated onto the more distal and more proximal portions respectively of the same dendrites of tectal neurons. It is particularly clearly shown that they form functional synapses on these specific portions of the dendrites. The authors then show that elimination of the visual input causes spread of the somatosensory inputs and that normal segregation is compromised if the tadpoles are reared from the stage of initial synapse formation in the presence of NMDR blocker (MK-801) but not if the blockade is initiated at a later stage. Because the inputs are segregated initially during development, the results suggest a progression of activity-independent, then -dependent mechanisms that together result in the segregation of inputs across tectal neuron dendrites. Activity – specifically NMDAR-dependent activity – segregates the different inputs, implicating a correlation-based mechanism. This work thus adds to our knowledge about how inputs are segregated onto dendrites during development.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>There are some concerns that must be addressed, but overall this appears to be a strong study of general significance.</p><p>1) The examples of anatomical data presented seem to support the conclusions, but the results must be quantified and comparisons made across a number of animals to test whether the differences seen in the examples presented do indeed stand up. Such analysis is necessary for the data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1 B,C,D; 4; 7E,F,G</xref>. This concern is fleshed out more in the attached comments of reviewer #2.</p><p>2) The analysis of CSD sinks should be more thorough or this measure dropped and the physiological analysis restricted LFP. This concern is fleshed out more in the attached comments of reviewer #2.</p><p>3) A weakness of the paper is that the MK801 effect is the only direct evidence implicating NMDARs. Without evidence showing that disrupting NMDAR function specifically in tectal cells is sufficient to replicate the MK801 results the exact site of action is not clear. There are several reports of presynaptic NMDARs playing important roles, so the experiments provided do not exclude other NMDAR-dependent mechanisms being at play. Furthermore, in the discussion much attention is given to the fact that the data suggest a fundamentally different mechanism for the sorting of visual/non-visual input in <italic>Xenopus</italic> compared to other species. This makes the findings interesting, but also means that the cellular mechanism is an important one to hash out.</p><p>At the minimum this should be addressed in the discussion as a limitation of the preparation and something that should be addressed in the future. This would also be a good opportunity to provide any evidence (references or unpublished data) supporting a model in which NMDAR activity in tectal neurons is, in fact, the cellular mechanism mediating this phenomenon.</p><p>Reviewer #2:</p><p>While the interpretation is interesting, the data analysis is incomplete, decreasing confidence in the conclusions.</p><p>There are two principal concerns with the data analysis:</p><p>1) The anatomical pattern of innervation from the retina and the HB to the tectum, and the effect of eye enucleation and pharmacological treatment, are described anecdotally (a couple of examples). It is possible and probably essential to quantify (and summarize) the effect of enucleation and MK-801 on tectal innervation using some kind of laminar area measure or segregation measure (as is typically done for retino-geniculate projections or retino-collicular projections from either eye). This would put on much more solid ground the apparent effect of enucleation or MK-801 on HB projection 'segregation'.</p><p>2) The presentation of CSD and FP is a little confusing. Both are presented in the figures. It is argued that the CSD shows the site of sources and sinks (concentrated synaptic contacts occur at sinks if the structure is laminar in nature). However, only the FP amplitude is quantified, not the amplitude of the CSD sinks. In my opinion, the authors should also quantify the location (and spread as a result of enucleation) of the CSD sinks. If this is altered by the enucleation and/or MK-801, it would strengthen their arguments about the NMDA-receptor dependent 'competitive' segregation process. If quantification of the CSD pattern (and it's changes) is not possible, then this should be explained (and probably the CSD data should be de-emphasized or removed).</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were requested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;An NMDA receptor-dependent mechanism for subcellular segregation of sensory inputs in the tadpole optic tectum&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>.

The following has been added to the Discussion:</p><p>“Exposing tadpoles to MK-801 blocks all NMDARs, so the possibility that presynaptic NMDARs could play a role in axon segregation cannot be ruled out. […] In addition, this will be an especially interesting experiment given that postsynaptic activation of CaMKII in cultured cortical neurons has been shown to remodel inputs such that the strongest inputs are kept and strengthened while other inputs are completely lost (Pratt et al., 2003).”</p><p>We do not suggest a different mechanism in tadpole compared to other species, but a different situation. In the tadpole tectum it is well established that single tectal neurons receive visual and mechanosensory input. Thus, our findings suggest a classic NMDAR-dependent correlation-driven mechanism underlies this subcellular segregation of inputs. This does not mean that NMDAR-dependent mechanisms are not involved in axon segregation in the optic tectum of Zebrafish or chick where axons are segregated, to the best of our knowledge, at the cellular (not subcellular) level. Indeed, NMDARs have been shown to be required for the proper segregation of RGC input onto different cells of the LGN, and for refinement of many circuits (refinement which involves axon targeting at the cellular, not subcellular, level).</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic> </p><p><italic>While the interpretation is interesting, the data analysis is incomplete, decreasing confidence in the conclusions.</italic> </p><p><italic>There are two principal concerns with the data analysis:</italic> </p><p><italic>1) The anatomical pattern of innervation from the retina and the HB to the tectum, and the effect of eye enucleation and pharmacological treatment, are described anecdotally (a couple of examples).

ImageJ was used to generate the fluorescence intensity profiles (8-bit gray values). For the enucleation experiment, the peak fluorescence of HB inputs – which presumably reflects the peak in axon density – was measured and reported as the distance from the distal edge of the tectum. For the MK801 experiments, the distance from distal edge of peak fluorescence for both HB and RGC axons was measured as well as the distance (gap) separating these peaks. These data have been added to the figures and the text. The anatomical data are (strikingly) consistent with the FP and CSD data.</p><p><italic>2) The presentation of CSD and FP is a little confusing. Both are presented in the figures. It is argued that the CSD shows the site of sources and sinks (concentrated synaptic contacts occur at sinks if the structure is laminar in nature).

The CSD data is in accordance with the FP data. The amount of shift observed in the major CSD sink due to NMDAR blockade is the same amount of shift observed with the FPs. Identifying the major CSD sink was straightforward. We did not include the quantification of the amount of spread of the CSD sinks, however, as we did not observe such a pattern, probably because the CSDs reflect only δ. So for example if there was a big string of depolarization across the axis (i.e. a spread of depolarization) – this would not be reflected in the CSDs since a persistent depolarization (across space) would not be detected as a change in potential.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were requested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic> </p><p><italic>The authors nicely included a quantification of the anatomical patterns of projection from the retina and HB to the tectum.

These data are summarized in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8E</xref>, and the results are integrated into the Results section. The amount of axon overlap increased, compared to control, in both early and late MK801 manipulations. So, even though the late MK801 manipulation does not appear to alter the spatial position of peak field potential amplitude, peak CSD sink, nor peak axon fluorescence, it is somehow causing a subset of axons to desegregate which is resulting in increased overlap. We propose this reflects a relatively immature population of axons which are still relying on NMDA receptor-dependent mechanisms in the stage 45 tectum. This possibility is discussed in a few added sentences in the Discussion section.</p></body></sub-article></article>
