presequences and use the TIM23 complex for their translocation across the mitochondrial inner membrane. During import, translocation through the channel in the inner membrane is coupled to the ATP-dependent action of an Hsp70-based import motor at the matrix face. How these two processes are coordinated remained unclear. We show here that the two domain structure of Tim44 plays a central role in this process. The N-terminal domain of Tim44 interacts with the components of the import motor, whereas its C-terminal domain interacts with the translocation channel and is in contact with translocating proteins. Our data suggest that the translocation channel and the import motor of the TIM23 complex communicate through rearrangements of the two domains of Tim44 that are stimulated by translocating proteins.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.11897.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.11897.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.11897.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Human, yeast and other eukaryotic cells contain compartments called mitochondria. These compartments are surrounded by two membranes and are most famous for their essential role in supplying the cell with energy. While mitochondria can make a few of their own proteins, the vast majority of mitochondrial proteins are produced elsewhere in the cell and are subsequently imported into mitochondria. During the import process, most proteins need to cross both mitochondrial membranes.</p><p>Many mitochondrial proteins are transported across the inner mitochondrial membrane by a molecular machine called the TIM23 complex. The complex forms a channel in the inner membrane and contains an import motor that drives the movement of mitochondrial proteins across the membrane. However, it is not clear how the channel and import motor are coupled together. There is some evidence that a protein within the TIM23 complex called Tim44 – which is made of two sections called the N-terminal domain and the C-terminal domain – is responsible for this coupling. It has been suggested that mainly the N-terminal domain of Tim44 is required for this role.</p><p>Banerjee et al. used biochemical techniques to study the role of Tim44 in yeast. The experiments show that both the N-terminal and C-terminal domains are essential for its role in transporting mitochondrial proteins. The N-terminal domain interacts with the import motor, whereas the C-terminal domain interacts with the channel and the mitochondrial proteins that are being moved.</p><p>Banerjee et al. propose a model of how the TIM23 complex works, in which the import of proteins into mitochondria is driven by rearrangements in the two domains of Tim44. A future challenge is to understand the nature of these rearrangements and how they are influenced by other components of the TIM23 complex.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.11897.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.11897.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>TIM23</kwd><kwd>mitochondria</kwd><kwd>protein translocation/sorting</kwd><kwd>Hsp70</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd><italic>E. coli</italic></kwd><kwd><italic>S. cerevisiae</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Deutscher Akademischer Austauschdienst</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Graduate student fellowship</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Banerjee</surname><given-names>Rupa</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Deutscher Akademischer Austauschdienst</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>RISE visiting student fellowship</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Gladkova</surname><given-names>Christina</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001659</institution-id><institution>Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>GRK1721</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Witte</surname><given-names>Gregor</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001659</institution-id><institution>Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>MO1944/1-1</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Mokranjac</surname><given-names>Dejana</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Two domains of the peripheral membrane protein Tim44 interact with two different sectors of a translocase to coordinate the translocation of proteins across the inner mitochondrial membrane.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Mitochondria perform a number of essential cellular functions ranging from production of ATP and diverse other metabolic intermediates to initiation of apoptosis. It is thus not very surprising that disturbances in mitochondrial function are associated with a number of human diseases, including neurodegenerative disorders, diabetes, and various forms of cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Nunnari and Suomalainen, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Quirós et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Youle and van der Bliek, 2012</xref>). An essential prerequisite for correctly functioning mitochondria is import of about 1000 different proteins synthesized as precursor proteins in the cytosol. Recent studies revealed that mitochondrial protein import machineries are sensitive indicators of functionality of mitochondria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Harbauer et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Nargund et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Yano et al., 2014</xref>), demonstrating that a deep understanding of mitochondrial protein import pathways and their regulation will be essential for understanding the role mitochondria have under physiological and pathophysiological conditions. Over half of mitochondrial proteins are synthesized with cleavable, N-terminal extensions called presequences. Import of such precursor proteins requires a coordinated action of the TOM complex in the outer membrane and the TIM23 complex in the inner membrane and is driven by membrane potential across the inner membrane and ATP in the matrix (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Dolezal et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Endo et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Koehler, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Mokranjac and Neupert, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Neupert and Herrmann, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Schulz et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Stojanovski et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>The TIM23 complex mediates translocation of presequence-containing precursor proteins into the matrix as well as their lateral insertion into the inner membrane. The latter process requires the presence of an additional, lateral insertion signal. After initial recognition on the intermembrane space side of the inner membrane by the receptors of the TIM23 complex, Tim50 and Tim23, precursor proteins are transferred to the translocation channel in the inner membrane in a membrane-potential dependent step (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Bajaj et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Lytovchenko et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Mokranjac et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Shiota et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Tamura et al., 2009</xref>). The translocation channel is formed by membrane-integrated segments of Tim23, together with Tim17 and possibly also Mgr2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Alder et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Demishtein-Zohary et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">leva et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Malhotra et al., 2013</xref>). At the matrix-face of the inner membrane, precursor proteins are captured by the components of the import motor of the TIM23 complex, also referred to as PAM (presequence translocase-associated motor). Its central component is mtHsp70 whose ATP hydrolysis-driven action fuels translocation of precursor proteins into the matrix (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">De Los Rios et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Liu et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Neupert and Brunner, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Schulz and Rehling, 2014</xref>). Multiple cycles of mtHsp70 binding to and release from translocating proteins are required for complete translocation across the inner membrane. The ATP hydrolysis-driven cycling of mtHsp70 and thereby its binding to proteins is regulated by the J- and J-like proteins Tim14(Pam18) and Tim16(Pam16) as well as by the nucleotide-exchange factor Mge1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">D'Silva et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Kozany et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Mapa et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Mokranjac et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">2003b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Truscott et al., 2003</xref>). Tim21 and Pam17 are two nonessential components that bind to Tim17-Tim23 core of the TIM23 complex and appear to modulate its activity in a mutually antagonistic manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Chacinska et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Popov-Celeketic et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">van der Laan et al., 2005</xref>).</p><p>The translocation channel and the import motor of the TIM23 complex are thought to be coupled by Tim44, a peripheral inner membrane protein exposed to the matrix (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">D'Silva et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Kozany et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Schulz and Rehling, 2014</xref>). Like other components of the TIM23 complex, Tim44 is a highly evolutionary conserved protein and is encoded by an essential gene. In mammals, Tim44 has been implicated in diabetes-associated metabolic and cellular abnormalities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Wada and Kanwar, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Wang et al., 2015</xref>). A novel therapeutic approach using gene delivery of Tim44 has recently shown promising results in mouse models of diabetic nephropathy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Zhang et al., 2006</xref>). In addition, mutations in Tim44 were identified that predispose carriers to oncocytic thyroid carcinoma (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bonora et al., 2006</xref>). Understanding the function of Tim44 and its interactions within the TIM23 complex will therefore be essential for understanding how the energy of ATP hydrolysis is converted into unidirectional transport of proteins into mitochondria and may provide clues for therapeutic treatment of human diseases.</p><p>Tim44 binds to the Tim17-Tim23 core of the translocation channel (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Kozany et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Mokranjac et al., 2003b</xref>). Tim44 also binds to mtHsp70, recruiting it to the translocation channel. The interaction between Tim44 and mtHsp70 is regulated both by nucleotides bound to mtHsp70 as well as by translocating proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">D'Silva et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Liu et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Slutsky-Leiderman et al., 2007</xref>). Tim44 is likewise the major site of recruitment of the Tim14-Tim16 subcomplex, recruiting them both to the translocation channel as well as to mtHsp70 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Kozany et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Mokranjac et al., 2003b</xref>). In this way, Tim44 likely ensures that binding of mtHsp70 to the translocating polypeptides, regulated by the action of Tim14 and Tim16, takes place right at the outlet of the translocation channel in the inner membrane.</p><p>Tim44 is composed of two domains, depicted as N- and C-terminal domains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Recent studies suggested that the N-terminal domain is responsible for the majority of known functions of Tim44. Segments of the N-terminal domain were identified that are important for interaction of Tim44 with Tim16 and with mtHsp70 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Schilke et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Schiller et al., 2008</xref>). Furthermore, using site-specific crosslinking, residues in the N-terminal domain were crosslinked to the matrix-exposed loop of Tim23 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Ting et al., 2014</xref>). However, the C-terminal domain of Tim44 shows higher evolutionary conservation. Still, the only function that has so far been attributed to the C-terminal domain is its role in recruitment of Tim44 to cardiolipin-containing membranes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Weiss et al., 1999</xref>). Based on the crystal structure of the C-terminal domain, a surface-exposed hydrophobic cavity was initially suggested to be important for membrane recruitment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Josyula et al., 2006</xref>). However, subsequent biochemical studies combined with molecular dynamics simulations, demonstrated that the helices A1 and A2 (residues 235–262 in yeast Tim44), present in the beginning of the C-terminal domain, are important for membrane recruitment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Marom et al., 2009</xref>). Deletion of helices A1 and A2 abolished membrane association of the C-terminal domain. Interestingly, attachment of helices A1 and A2 to a soluble protein was sufficient to recruit it to a model membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Marom et al., 2009</xref>).<fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.11897.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>The function of Tim44 can be rescued by its two domains expressed <italic>in trans</italic> but not by either of the domains alone.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Schematic representation of Tim44 domain structure (numbering according to yeast Tim44 sequence). pre. - presequence (<bold><bold>B</bold></bold> and <bold><bold>C</bold></bold>) A haploid yeast deletion strain of <italic>TIM44</italic> carrying the wild-type copy of <italic>TIM44</italic> on a <italic>URA</italic> plasmid was transformed with centromeric plasmids carrying indicated constructs of Tim44 under control of endogenous promoter and 3'UTR.

A plasmid carrying the full-length copy of Tim44 enabled growth of yeast cells, whereas no viable colonies were obtained when an empty plasmid was used, confirming the specificity of the assay. We conclude that the N-terminal domain of Tim44, even when extended to include the membrane-recruitment helices of the C-terminal domain, is not sufficient to support the function of the full-length protein. Furthermore, this result suggests that the C-terminal domain of Tim44 has a function beyond membrane recruitment that is apparently essential for viability of yeast cells.</p><p>We then tested whether the function of Tim44 can be rescued by its two domains expressed <italic>in trans</italic>. Two plasmids, each encoding one of the two domains of Tim44 and both including A1 and A2 helices, were co-transformed into a Tim44 plasmid shuffle yeast strain and analyzed as above. Surprisingly, we obtained viable colonies when both domains were expressed in the same cell but not when either of the two domains was expressed on its own (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). The rescue was dependent on the presence of A1 and A2 helices on both domains (data not shown), as in their absence neither of the domains could even be stably expressed in yeast (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>).</p><p>It is possible that the two domains of Tim44, both carrying A1 and A2 helices, bind to each other with high affinity and therefore are able to re-establish the full-length protein from the individual domains. To test this possibility, we expressed both domains recombinantly, purified them and analyzed, in a pull down experiment, if they interact with each other. The N-terminally His-tagged N-terminal domain efficiently bound to NiNTA-agarose beads under both low- and high-salt conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>). However, we did not observe any copurification of the non-tagged C-terminal domain. We also did not observe any stable interaction of the two domains when digitonin-solubilized mitochondria containing a His-tagged version of the N-terminal domain were used in a NiNTA pull-down experiment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref>).

Chemical crosslinking is currently the most sensitive assay available to analyze the conformation of the TIM23 complex in intact mitochondria. We thus compared the crosslinking patterns of TIM23 subunits in N+C mitochondria to those in FL. In wild-type mitochondria, Tim16 can be crosslinked to mtHsp70, Tim44, and Tim14 in an ATP-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>).

Since the 90 kDa complex does not contain any other known subunit of the TIM23 complex, this finding further supports the above notion that the conformation of the translocation channel is changed in N+C mitochondria. We observed no obvious difference in the ca. 60 kDa Tim14-Tim16 complex between FL and N+C mitochondria.

Furthermore, they suggest that the C-terminal domain has an essential function within the TIM23 complex, beyond mere membrane recruitment. So, what is the function of the C-terminal domain of Tim44? We first searched for binding partners of the individual domains. To that end, we recombinantly expressed and purified full-length Tim44 as well as its two domains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>). To look for interaction partners of the core domains, both domains now lacked the segment containing A1 and A2 helices. Purified proteins were covalently coupled to the Sepharose beads and were subsequently incubated with mitochondrial lysates. Mitochondria were solubilized with Triton X-100 that, unlike digitonin, dissociates the TIM23 complex into its individual subunits (except for the Tim14-Tim16 subcomplex that remains stable). In this way, direct protein-protein interactions can be analyzed. We observed prominent, specific binding of mtHsp70, Tim16, Tim14 and Tim17, and to a far lesser degree of Tim23 and Tim50, to full-length Tim44 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>). None of the proteins bound to empty beads. Also, we observed no binding of two abundant mitochondrial proteins, porin, and F1βß, demonstrating the specificity of observed interactions. mtHsp70, Tim16 and Tim14 also efficiently bound to the N-terminal domain of Tim44, in agreement with previous observations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Schilke et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Schiller et al., 2008</xref>), and far less efficiently to the C-terminal domain. Since the Tim14-Tim16 subcomplex remains stable in Triton X-100, it is not possible by this method to distinguish which of the two subunits, or maybe even both, directly interacts with the N-terminal domain of Tim44. Binding of Tim17 to the N-terminal domain of Tim44 was drastically lower compared to its binding to the full-length protein. Instead, a strong binding of Tim17 to the C-terminal domain of Tim44 was observed.<fig id="fig6" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.11897.009</object-id><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><title>C-terminal domain of Tim44 interacts with Tim17 and with a precursor in transit.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Coomassie-stained SDS-PA gel of recombinantly expressed and purified constructs of Tim44.

To answer this question, we first affinity-purified antibodies that specifically recognize cores of the individual domains of Tim44 using the above described Sepharose beads. The antibodies, affinity purified using beads with coupled full-length Tim44, recognized full-length Tim44 as well as both of its domains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>). In contrast, antibodies that were affinity purified using beads with coupled individual domains recognized only the respective domain and the full-length protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>). This demonstrates that we indeed purified antibodies specific for individual domains of Tim44. Next, we accumulated <sup>35</sup>S-labelled precursor protein pcyt<italic>b</italic><sub>2</sub>(1–167)△DHFR as a TOM-TIM23-spanning intermediate. Briefly, this precursor protein consists of the first 167 residues of yeast cytochrome <italic>b</italic><sub>2</sub>, with a 19 residue deletion in its lateral insertion signal, fused to the passenger protein dihydrofolate reductase. In the presence of methotrexate, that stabilizes folded DHFR, the <italic>b</italic><sub>2</sub> part reaches the matrix, whereas the DHFR moiety remains on the mitochondrial surface resulting in an intermediate that spans both TOM and TIM23 complexes. The association of Tim44 and its domains with the arrested precursor protein was analyzed by chemical crosslinking followed by immunoprecipitation with antibodies to full-length Tim44 and its individual domains. In wild-type mitochondria, all three antibodies precipitated a crosslinking adduct of Tim44 to the arrested precursor protein, demonstrating that they are all able to immunoprecipitate the respective antigens (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>). In contrast, with N+C mitochondria, a faster migrating crosslinking adduct of a Tim44 domain to the arrested precursor protein was immunoprecipitated with the antibodies against the C-terminal domain and against the full-length protein but not with the antibodies against the N-terminal domain. This demonstrates that the C-terminal domain of Tim44 is in close vicinity of the translocating protein.</p><p>Mutations identified in human patients can frequently point to functionally important residues in affected proteins. In this respect, Pro308Gln mutation in human Tim44 has recently been linked to oncocytic thyroid carcinoma (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bonora et al., 2006</xref>). Since the mutation maps to the C-terminal domain of Tim44, we wanted to analyze functional implications of this mutation and therefore made the corresponding mutation in yeast Tim44 (Pro282Gln). We compared thermal stabilities of wild type and mutant Tim44 proteins by thermal shift assay. The melting temperature of wild-type Tim44 was 54°C, whereas that of the mutant protein was 4°C lower (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E</xref>). This demonstrates that the mutation significantly destabilizes Tim44, providing first clues toward molecular understanding of the associated human disease.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>The major question of protein import into mitochondria that has remained unresolved is how translocation of precursor proteins through the channel in the inner membrane is coupled to the ATP-dependent activity of the Hsp70-based import motor at the matrix face of the inner membrane.</p><p>Results presented here demonstrate that the two domain structure of Tim44 is essential during this process. We show here that the two domains of Tim44 have different interaction partners within the TIM23 complex. In this way, Tim44 holds the TIM23 complex together. Our data revealed a direct, previously unexpected interaction between the C-terminal domain of Tim44 with the channel component Tim17. This result not only assigned a novel function to the C-terminal domain of Tim44 but also shed new light on Tim17, the component of the TIM23 complex that has been notoriously difficult to analyze. Recent mutational analysis of the matrix exposed loop between transmembrane segments 1 and 2 of Tim17 revealed no interaction site for Tim44 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Ting et al., 2014</xref>), suggesting its presence in another segment of the protein. Our data also confirmed the previously observed interactions of the N-terminal domain of Tim44 with the components of the import motor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Schilke et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Schiller et al., 2008</xref>). We did, however, not observe any direct interaction between Tim23 and the N-terminal domain of Tim44 that has previously been seen by crosslinking in intact mitochondria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Ting et al., 2014</xref>). It is possible that this crosslinking requires a specific conformation of Tim23 only adopted when Tim23 is bound to Tim17 in the inner membrane. This notion is supported by our previous observation that the stable binding of Tim44 to the translocation channel requires assembled Tim17-Tim23 core of the TIM23 complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Mokranjac et al., 2003b</xref>). We observed a direct Tim17-Tim44 interaction here probably because of a high local concentration of the C-terminal domain when bound to the beads.</p><p>The core of the C-terminal domain is preceded by a segment that contains two amphipathic, membrane-recruitment helices. This central segment connects the two domains of Tim44. Intriguingly, the two currently available crystal structures of the C-terminal domains of yeast and human Tim44s showed different orientations of the two helices relative to the core domains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Handa et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Josyula et al., 2006</xref>). The conformational change was likely induced upon PEG binding to this region of human Tim44 during crystallization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Handa et al., 2007</xref>). It is tempting to speculate that the same conformational change takes place during translocation of proteins in the mitochondria. Such a conformational change would not only reorient the two helices in respect to the core of the C-domain but also change the relative orientation of N- and C-terminal domains. Since the two domains have different interaction partners within the TIM23 complex, such a change could rearrange the entire complex. The importance of this proposed conformational change in Tim44 is supported by the data presented here. The function of the full-length Tim44 could be reconstituted from its individual domains only very poorly. Also, there is obviously a very strong evolutionary pressure to keep the two domains of Tim44 within one polypeptide chain. N+C strain had to be kept at all times on the selective medium - even after only an overnight incubation on a nonselective medium the full-length protein reappeared (our unpublished observation), likely due to a recombination event between two plasmids.</p><p>Tim44 can be crosslinked to translocating proteins. Our data revealed that it is the C-terminal domain of Tim44 that interacts with proteins entering the matrix from the translocation channel in the inner membrane. A direct interaction of the same domain with Tim17 would optimally position the C-terminal domain to the outlet of the translocation channel. This raises an interesting possibility that translocating precursor proteins may play an important role in the above postulated conformational changes of Tim44.</p><p>A missense mutation Pro308Gln in human Tim44 is associated with familial oncocytic thyroid carcinoma. The corresponding mutation in yeast, Pro282Gln, destabilized the protein but produced no obvious growth phenotype or an <italic>in vivo</italic> import defect (our unpublished observations), suggesting that the yeast system is more robust. This observation is in agreement with the notion that mutations that would severely affect the function of the TIM23 complex would likely be embryonically lethal in humans. Still, the disease caused by a mutation in the C-terminal domain of human Tim44 speaks for an important role of this domain in the function of the entire TIM23 complex. Furthermore, the mutation maps to the short loop between A3 and A4 helices in the C-terminal domain of Tim44. Based on the crystal structure of Tim44, it was previously suggested that the mutation could affect the conformational flexibility of the A1 and A2 helices (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Handa et al., 2007</xref>), intriguingly providing further support for the above postulated conformational changes of Tim44.</p><p>Based on the previously available data and the results presented here, we put forward the following model to describe how translocation of precursor proteins through the channel in the inner membrane is coupled to their capture by the ATP-dependent import motor at the matrix face of the channel (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). Tim44 plays a central role in this model. We envisage that two domains of Tim44 are connected by the central segment that contains membrane-recruitment helices, like two cherries on the stalks (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref> insert). This central segment of Tim44 recruits the protein to the cardiolipin-containing membranes. There, through direct protein–protein interactions, the C-terminal domain of Tim44 binds to Tim17 and the N-terminal domain to mtHsp70 and to Tim14-Tim16 subcomplex (1). In this way, Tim44 functions as a central platform that connects the translocation channel in the inner membrane with the import motor at the matrix face. Additional interactions likely stabilize the complex, in particular that between the N-terminal domain of Tim44 and Tim23 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Ting et al., 2014</xref>) as well as the one between Tim17 and the IMS-exposed segment of Tim14 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Chacinska et al., 2005</xref>). In the resting state, the translocation channel is closed to maintain the permeability barrier of the inner membrane. During translocation of proteins (2), the translocation channel in the inner membrane has to open to allow passage of proteins. Opening of the channel will likely change the conformation of Tim17 that could be further conveyed to the C-terminal domain Tim44. It is tempting to speculate that this conformational change is transduced to the N-terminal domain of Tim44 through the central, membrane-bound segment of Tim44, leading to relative rearrangements of the two domains of Tim44. This change would now allow Tim14-Tim16 complex to stimulate the ATPase activity of mtHsp70 leading to stable binding of the translocating protein to mtHsp70. mtHsp70, with bound polypeptide, will then move into the matrix, opening a binding site on Tim44 for another molecule of mtHsp70 (3). We speculate that the release of mtHsp70 with bound polypeptide from the N-terminal domain of Tim44 will send a signal back to the C-terminal domain of Tim44 and further to the translocation channel. Multiple cycles of mtHsp70 are required to translocate the entire polypeptide chain into the matrix. Once the entire polypeptide has been translocated, the translocation channel will revert to its resting, closed state, bringing also Tim44 back to its resting conformation (1). Thus, the translocation channel in the inner membrane and the mtHsp70 system at the matrix face communicate with each other through rearrangements of the two domains of Tim44 that are stimulated by translocating polypeptide chain.<fig id="fig7" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.11897.010</object-id><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><title>A proposed model of function of the TIM23 complex.</title><p>See text for details.

A Tim44 plasmid shuffling yeast strain was made by transforming YPH499 cells with a pVT-102U plasmid (<italic>URA</italic> marker) containing a full-length <italic>TIM44</italic> followed by replacement of the chromosomal copy of <italic>TIM44</italic> with a <italic>HIS3</italic> cassette by homologous recombination. For complementation analyzes, endogenous promoter, mitochondrial presequence (residues 1–42) and the 3’-untranslated region of <italic>TIM44</italic> were cloned into centromeric yeast plasmids pRS315 (<italic>LEU</italic> marker) and pRS314 (<italic>TRP</italic> marker) and obtained plasmids subsequently used for cloning of various Tim44 constructs. The following constructs were used in the analyzes: Tim44(43–209), Tim44(43–262), Tim44(264–431), and Tim44(210–431). The constructs encompassing the N- and the C-terminal domains of Tim44 were cloned into pRS315 and pRS314 plasmids, respectively. Plasmids carrying the full-length copy of <italic>TIM44</italic> were used as positive controls and empty plasmids as negative ones. A Tim44 plasmid shuffling yeast strain was transformed with two plasmids simultaneously and selected on selective glucose medium lacking respective markers. Cells that lost the wild-type copy of Tim44 on the <italic>URA</italic> plasmid were selected on medium containing 5-fluoroorotic acid at 30°C.</p><p>For expression in the wild-type background, the above-described constructs of Tim44, containing endogenous Tim44 presequence, were also cloned into centromeric yeast plasmids p414GPD and p415GPD for expression under the control of the strong <italic>GPD</italic> promoter.

Pro282Gln mutation was introduced into the full-length construct using site directed mutagenesis. Proteins were expressed in <italic>E. coli</italic> BL21(DE3) at 37°C and purified using affinity chromatography on NiNTA-agarose beads (Qiagen, Germany) followed by gel filtration on Superdex 75 column (GE Healthcare, Germany). Unless otherwise indicated, the His<sub>6</sub>-tags were removed by incubation with the TEV protease.

The beads were used for purification of domain-specific antibodies from the serum raised in rabbits against recombinantly expressed full-length Tim44. For direct binding analysis, mitochondria isolated from wild-type yeast cells were solubilized with 0.5% Triton X-100 in 20 mM Tris/HCl, pH 8.0, 80 mM KCl, 10% glycerol at 1 mg/mL and incubated with Tim44 constructs coupled to CNBr-Sepharose beads for 30 min at 4<sup>o</sup>C.

Your article has been favorably evaluated by Randy Schekman (Senior editor) and three reviewers, one of whom, Klaus Pfanner, is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors. The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>Mitochondrial import of matrix proteins requires the mitochondrial import motor to drive protein translocation. The manuscript by Banerjee et al. investigates the structure function relation of Tim44, an essential subunit of the mitochondrial import motor. To dissect the N- and C-terminal domains functionally, the authors expressed these domains in trans and find that they suffice to confer viability to yeast cells lacking TIM44. Their analyses reveal that mitochondria with &quot;split&quot; Tim44 display transport defects along the presequence import route. Their analyses suggest that the N- and C-terminal domains engage with different modules of the presequence translocase. In comparison to full length Tim44, the split protein causes reorganization within the presequence translocase, implicating Tim44 in translocase/motor communication.</p><p>This is an interesting analysis that provides new and unexpected insight into how the import motor constituent Tim44 engages with the presequence translocase. Moreover, the data provides evidence for a link between motor dynamics and translocase organization. Thus, the manuscript addresses a long standing question on how the dynamic of the import motor is linked to translocase function.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Since rearrangements of the two domains of Tim44 are not directly demonstrated, the title should be modified to better reflect the main message of the paper.</p><p>2) The observed import defects of sorted and matrix targeted precursors is surprising. Why are sorted proteins affected that should not depend on the ATP driven motor and thus not on Tim44 function? The authors should assess the membrane potential directly to exclude indirect effects. Since the membrane potential-dependence of precursors varies a lot, AAC import alone might be misleading. In addition, carrier transport should be analyzed also by BN PAGE.</p><p>3) Ting et al. (2014) reported that the N-terminal domain of Tim44 interacts with Tim23 as well as motor components by using crosslinking in intact mitochondria. Using purified Tim44 domains and mitochondria lysed with detergent, the authors confirmed the interaction of the N-terminal domain with motor components, however, not with Tim23. They speculate that crosslinking of the N-terminal Tim44 domain to Tim23 requires a specific conformation of Tim23 only adopted when Tim23 is bound to Tim17 in the inner membrane (i.e. in intact mitochondria). Since the authors demonstrate the interaction of the C-terminal domain of Tim44 with Tim17 by using the purified domains and lysed mitochondria, but use crosslinking in intact mitochondria for showing the interaction with precursor proteins, the two approaches should be compared more directly. A suitable approach would be to analyze the interaction of the C-terminal domain of Tim44 with Tim17 in intact mitochondria by crosslinking. They may use radiolabeled Tim17 imported into mitochondria and their domain-specific Tim44 antibodies to address this topic.</p><p>4) The purification experiments shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref> will benefit from quantification/statistics. In case of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>, the outcome is clearly visible in the presented experiment, but this seems to be only a representative (of how many experiments?). The statistical analysis of repetitions would provide more confidence for this important conclusion. In the case of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>, the conclusion about the presence of the N-and C-domains is clear looking at the presented experiment (representative?), in contrast to the conclusion concerning Tim21 and Pam17. If the authors would like to keep the observation concerning Tim21 and Pam17 in the text, it requires statistics.</p><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>: It is difficult to compare the co-immunoprecipitation efficiencies of different TIM23 components since the membranes have been strongly trimmed and the blots are overexposed. Here different exposures might have to be presented.</p><p>5) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>: There is far less Tim44 N+C associated with the TIM23 complex than full-length Tim44 in WT. This raises the question to what extend a Tim44-depletion mirrors the observed effects for the split protein with regard to crosslinks that do not include Tim44 (Tim23-Tim23, Tim16-Tim16) or import defects of sorted proteins.</p><p>6) The conclusion that the TIM23 complex adopts an &quot;altered conformation&quot; in N+C mitochondria is based on crosslinking experiments. It would be good to support this conclusion by an independent approach, such as native gel electrophoresis or differential protease sensitivity of the TIM23 components.</p><p>Moreover, the term &quot;altered conformational flexibility&quot; is not fully fitting to the results presented here.

We agree that the title may have been somewhat misleading as we have indeed not directly demonstrated rearrangements of the two domains of Tim44.</p><p><italic>2) The observed import defects of sorted and matrix targeted precursors is surprising. Why are sorted proteins affected that should not depend on the ATP driven motor and thus not on Tim44 function? The authors should assess the membrane potential directly to exclude indirect effects. Since the membrane potential-dependence of precursors varies a lot, AAC import alone might be misleading. In addition, carrier transport should be analyzed also by BN PAGE.</italic> </p><p>We would not agree that the import defects of TIM23 substrates we observed in N+C mitochondria are in general surprising. Tim44 has been identified over twenty years ago as an essential component of the TIM23 complex required for transport of presequence-containing precursors into mitochondria. Over the years, several temperature-sensitive mutants of Tim44 have been identified that specifically affected transport along the TIM23 pathway. We would thus rather argue that it would be surprising if in N+C mitochondria, which contain only a split version of this protein, no import defect was observed. We were certainly surprised to see that the N+C cells are viable at all. The point that we observed no difference between sorted and matrix targeted precursors may potentially be seen as surprising. However, it should also be said that the role of Tim44 in the differential sorting of proteins by the TIM23 complex has not been carefully analyzed, at least to the best of our knowledge, in contrast to mtHsp70 and the J proteins Tim14/Pam18 and Tim16/Pam16. While the latter proteins are very likely directly involved in the ATP-dependent steps of protein transport, the exact role of Tim44 is far less clear. Indeed the data presented in this manuscript would suggest a role of Tim44 also at an earlier stage of protein transport, which could affect both sorted as well as matrix-targeted precursors. Also, we have previously seen that Tim44 can be crosslinked to laterally sorted precursors (Popov-Celeketic et al., EMBO Reports, 2011), even when their transport does not depend on the ATPase activity of the import motor. However, as differential sorting of precursors by the TIM23 complex is not a focus of this manuscript, we removed this point from the text to simplify it for non-specialists.</p><p>We measured the membrane potential in FL and N+C mitochondria and, not surprisingly, observed its slight reduction in N+C mitochondria, in agreement with the very strong growth defect of N+C cells and with the established essential role of Tim44 in transport of a number of components of respiratory chain complexes and their assembly factors into mitochondria. In this respect, it is also worth noting that even in glucose medium at either 24°C or 30°C, N+C cells grow about three times slower than FL. In addition, rather than analyzing import of AAC by another method, we analyzed import of another TIM23-independent substrate, Tim23 itself. Like with AAC, we also observed no major difference in its import efficiency in FL and N+C mitochondria. These data are now included in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref> and in the Results section.</p><p><italic>3) Ting et al. (2014) reported that the N-terminal domain of Tim44 interacts with Tim23 as well as motor components by using crosslinking in intact mitochondria. Using purified Tim44 domains and mitochondria lysed with detergent, the authors confirmed the interaction of the N-terminal domain with motor components, however, not with Tim23. They speculate that crosslinking of the N-terminal Tim44 domain to Tim23 requires a specific conformation of Tim23 only adopted when Tim23 is bound to Tim17 in the inner membrane (i.e. in intact mitochondria). Since the authors demonstrate the interaction of the C-terminal domain of Tim44 with Tim17 by using the purified domains and lysed mitochondria, but use crosslinking in intact mitochondria for showing the interaction with precursor proteins, the two approaches should be compared more directly. A suitable approach would be to analyze the interaction of the C-terminal domain of Tim44 with Tim17 in intact mitochondria by crosslinking. They may use radiolabeled Tim17 imported into mitochondria and their domain-specific Tim44 antibodies to address this topic.</italic> </p><p>We agree that it would be excellent to demonstrate a direct Tim17-Tim44 interaction also by another assay such as crosslinking. However, to the best of our knowledge, no crosslinks of Tim17 to any other component of the TIM23 complex have ever been seen in wild type mitochondria, radiolabeled or not, not even to Tim23, even though their interaction was demonstrated by several different assays. The only crosslinks to Tim17 observed so far were upon a very comprehensive cysteine-scanning mutagenesis of Tim23 followed by cysteine-specific crosslinking (Alder et al., MBC, 2008) and the above mentioned paper by Ting et al. that used site-specific UV crosslinking to demonstrate an interaction between Tim17 and Pam17. Since the surfaces of either Tim17 or Tim44 involved in this interaction remain currently unknown, we feel that undertaking such a comprehensive site-specific approach would be beyond the scope of this manuscript.</p><p><italic>4) The purification experiments shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref> will benefit from quantification/statistics.

Here different exposures might have to be presented.</italic> All the experiments presented in this manuscript are representatives of experiments repeated at least three times. In addition, all the critical experiments were not only performed with at least three biological replicates but were also repeated by at least two different researchers to make sure that all the observed effects are reproducible.</p><p>Following the suggestion of the reviewers, we included a panel containing quantifications of binding of mtHsp70, as a representative of the import motor components, and of Tim17 to the various beads that were obtained in three different experiments. In addition, we added to the Figure legend the information that input contains 4.5% of the material used for binding. This information was unfortunately missing in the original submission.</p><p>The original <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref> was trimmed in order to remove the supernatants after coimmunoprecipitations. We felt this would make the figure easier for non-specialists. However, this certainly made it more difficult to judge the efficiencies of different coimmunoprecipitations. The new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref> now includes the supernatants, so that the efficiencies can be directly compared. We agree with the reviewers on the point that the observations with Tim21 and Pam17, though certainly reproducible, as explained above, are not essential for the conclusions of the manuscript. We have therefore removed them both from the Figure and from the text, to make it clearer for non-specialists. In addition, the Figure legend now contains the information that the total and supernatant fractions contain 20% of the material used for coimmunoprecipitations. As above, we unfortunately forgot to add this information during original submission.</p><p><italic>5) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>: There is far less Tim44 N+C associated with the TIM23 complex than full-length Tim44 in WT. This raises the question to what extend a Tim44-depletion mirrors the observed effects for the split protein with regard to crosslinks that do not include Tim44 (Tim23-Tim23, Tim16-Tim16) or import defects of sorted proteins.</italic> </p><p>The new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>, which now contains the supernatants after coimmunoprecipitations, also addresses this question. In addition, we used for western blot Tim44 antibodies prepared by mixing affinity-purified antibodies to N and C domains so that both domains are now roughly equally well visible. We would also like to note that the Tim44 signal in FL is expected to be stronger as antibodies to both domains recognize the full-length protein whereas the individual domains are recognized only by certain antibodies. We think that from the new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref> it is clear that there is no less Tim44 bound to TIM23 in N+C than in FL. We would also like to add that it was previously shown that, upon depletion of Tim44 from cells, both Tim17-Tim23 and Tim14-Tim16 subcomplexes remain intact but they are completely dissociated from each other (Kozany et al., NSMB, 2004). In our opinion, it is clear from the presented coimmunoprecipitations experiment that the two subcomplexes remain associated in N+C mitochondria, unlike in cells depleted of Tim44.</p><p><italic>6) The conclusion that the TIM23 complex adopts an &quot;altered conformation&quot; in N+C mitochondria is based on crosslinking experiments. It would be good to support this conclusion by an independent approach, such as native gel electrophoresis or differential protease sensitivity of the TIM23 components.</italic></p><p><italic>Moreover, the term &quot;altered conformational flexibility&quot; is not fully fitting to the results presented here. The authors rather look at an altered subunit composition and not protein conformations. The text should be changed.</italic> </p><p>We greatly appreciate this suggestion. We analyzed the TIM23 complex by blue native PAGE and indeed observed a changed running behavior of both Tim17 and Tim23 in N+C mitochondria as compared to FL. Since this alteration mainly affected the 90 kDa complex whose only known components are Tim17 and Tim23, this finding provides further support for our notion that the conformation, rather than the composition, of the TIM23 complex is affected in N+C mitochondria. This new finding is now included in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref> and is described in the text.</p><p>As also discussed above, since the coimmunoprecipitation experiments revealed no major changes in the composition of the complex and both crosslinking and BN-PAGE support the notion of the changed conformation of the complex, we think that the term “altered conformational flexibility” is fitting our results and is supported by them.</p><p><italic>7) The part on the human patient mutation mimicked in yeast Tim44 is interesting, but not required for the rest of the story. Does the mutation in Tim44 affect the TIM23 complex or protein import in yeast or humans? As it stands it is not very informative. The authors should either remove that part or perform a functional analysis, i.e. test mutant cells/mitochondria for the functionality of the Tim44 C-terminal domain in the binding of Tim17 and precursor binding during mitochondrial import.</italic> </p><p>We agree that the patient mutation mimicked in yeast Tim44 is not required to understand the rest of the story and have therefore removed this finding from the Abstract. As we also previously stated in the Discussion, we have performed initial analyses of yeast cells carrying this mutation and we observed neither an obvious growth nor an obvious in vivo import defect in these cells. Both these observations are in agreement with the relatively mild effect seen in the affected patients (as discussed in the text, mutations that would dramatically reduce the activity of the TIM23 complex would likely be embryonically lethal in humans). We did however observe that the mutation partially destabilizes the protein and we feel that this is an important observation as it may provide a clue as to what goes wrong in the affected patients and may stimulate studies with patient cell lines, which are clearly beyond the scope of this manuscript. We would thus prefer to keep this finding in the manuscript but are happy to leave the final decision to the editors.</p></body></sub-article></article>
