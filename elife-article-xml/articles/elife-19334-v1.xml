However, little is known about how postprandial sleep is regulated. Here, we simultaneously measured sleep and food intake of individual flies and found a transient rise in sleep following meals. Depending on the amount consumed, the effect ranged from slightly arousing to strongly sleep inducing. Postprandial sleep was positively correlated with ingested volume, protein, and salt—but not sucrose—revealing meal property-specific regulation. Silencing of leucokinin receptor (Lkr) neurons specifically reduced sleep induced by protein consumption. Thermogenetic stimulation of leucokinin (Lk) neurons decreased whereas Lk downregulation by RNAi increased postprandial sleep, suggestive of an inhibitory connection in the Lk-Lkr circuit. We further identified a subset of non-leucokininergic cells proximal to Lkr neurons that rhythmically increased postprandial sleep when silenced, suggesting that these cells are cyclically gated inhibitory inputs to Lkr neurons. Together, these findings reveal the dynamic nature of postprandial sleep.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.19334.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.19334.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.19334.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Many of us have experienced feelings of sleepiness after a large meal. However, there is little scientific evidence that this “food coma” effect is real. If it is, it may vary between individuals, or depend on the type of food consumed. This variability makes it difficult to study the causes of post-meal sleepiness.</p><p>Murphy et al. have now developed a system that can measure fruit fly sleep and feeding behavior at the same time. Recordings using this system reveal that after a meal, flies sleep more for a short period before returning to a normal state of wakefulness. The sleep period lasts around 20-40 minutes, with flies that ate more generally sleeping more.</p><p>Further investigation revealed that salty or protein-rich foods promote sleep, whereas sugary foods do not. By using genetic tools to turn on and off neurons in the fly brain, Murphy et al. identified a number of brain circuits that play a role in controlling post-meal sleepiness. Some of these respond specifically to the consumption of protein. Others are sensitive to the fruit fly’s internal clock, reducing post-meal sleepiness only around dusk. Thus, post-meal sleepiness can be regulated in a number of different ways.</p><p>Future experiments are now needed to explore the genes and circuits that enable meal size and the protein or salt content of food to drive sleep. In nature, sleep is likely a vulnerable state for animals. Thus, another challenge will be to uncover why post-meal sleep is important. Does sleeping after a meal boost digestion? Or might it help animals to form memories about a food source, making it easier to find similar food in the future?</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.19334.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.19334.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>feeding</kwd><kwd>sleep</kwd><kwd>behavior</kwd><kwd>neurogenetics</kwd><kwd>nutrition</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd><italic>D. melanogaster</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R21DK092735</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ja</surname><given-names>William W</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000863</institution-id><institution>Ellison Medical Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>New Scholar in Aging award</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ja</surname><given-names>William W</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100001642</institution-id><institution>Glenn Foundation for Medical Research</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Medical Research Award for Research in Biological Mechanisms of Aging</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ja</surname><given-names>William W</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Evidence of food coma has been found in fruit flies, allowing the properties that drive postprandial sleep and their underlying genetic and neuronal mechanisms to be described.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Despite accumulating evidence of interactions between sleep and metabolism, few studies have documented an increased propensity for sleep that animals might experience after meals. Results on human postprandial behavior have shown an increased sleep propensity following a meal, a lagging response, or no effect at all (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Orr et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Zammit et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Wells et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Harnish et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Stahl et al., 1983</xref>). It has been proposed that postprandial sleep is not invariable; it may be absent in particular individuals or heavily dependent on specific food properties (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Stahl et al., 1983</xref>). While the behavior likely exists, these intrinsic variabilities have limited our ability to study its molecular basis. A thorough examination of this behavior would be facilitated by use of an animal model although, at present, no clear model exists (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Watson, 2014</xref>).</p><p>In <italic>Drosophila</italic> there is a well-documented sleep-metabolism interaction in which flies suppress sleep or increase locomotion when starved (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Lee and Park, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Thimgan et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Keene et al., 2010</xref>). However, the acute effects of food consumption on sleep have not been tested, largely because there is no system available to do so. Here we establish a system for simultaneous measurement of discrete feeding events and sleep, allowing us to examine the mechanisms underlying their interaction.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>To simultaneously measure sleep and feeding of individual adult flies, we designed the Activity Recording CAFE (ARC), a system that couples machine vision tracking of capillary-based food consumption and animal motion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A–C</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Ja et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Donelson et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Deshpande et al., 2014</xref>). Previous studies have shown that flies inactive for 5 min exhibit multiple hallmarks of sleep (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Shaw et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Huber et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Hendricks et al., 2000</xref>). Using this standard, we extracted sleep parameters by defining sleep as periods of inactivity &gt;5 min. Despite different housing and food consistency, we found sleep architecture to be similar to previous studies using high resolution object tracking, a method which has greater resolution of total sleep and sleep duration than the infrared-beam based alternative (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A–D</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Donelson et al., 2012</xref>).

The animals experienced a sharp decline in P<sub>sleep</sub> in the time approaching each meal, as expected since flies cannot sleep and feed simultaneously. Subsequent to the meal, P<sub>sleep</sub> rose rapidly and exceeded the respective pre-meal P<sub>sleep</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). To quantify changes in sleep subsequent to each meal, we calculated the change in P<sub>sleep</sub> of respective time points before and after each event (i.e. t<sup>+1</sup> – t<sup>−1</sup>, t<sup>+2</sup> – t<sup>−2</sup>, …). This analysis revealed a rise in sleep lasting approximately 20–40 min with a maximum ΔP<sub>sleep</sub> amplitude of 0.15 and 0.2 for the control strains, <italic>w<sup>1118</sup></italic> and Canton-S, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). The effect was observed in both males and females (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A</xref>). While the duration of sleep events prior to a meal is inherently limited by the time until an animal wakes to eat, sleep initiation is not limited and was more probable following a meal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1B</xref>).<fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.19334.005</object-id><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Animals exhibit increased sleep and arousal threshold after eating.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Probability of sleep (P<sub>sleep</sub>) preceding or following each meal (t = 0) in Canton-S (top) or <italic>w<sup>1118</sup></italic> (bottom) males.

To test if arousal threshold is increased after a meal, we adapted methodology from the <italic>Drosophila</italic> arousal tracking system in which animals are exposed to a series of increasing vibrational stimuli (0.8–3.2 <italic>g</italic>) once every hour in order to measure the intensity at which inactive animals respond (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">van Alphen et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Faville et al., 2015</xref>). Consistent with previous studies, we found that arousal threshold initially increases with the amount of time that a fly is inactive, with the greatest change occurring in the first 5 min (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Shaw et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Huber et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">van Alphen et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Faville et al., 2015</xref>). Since the maximum duration of inactivity is lower following a meal, irrespective of sleep probability (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>), we filtered arousal events to compare animals in similar stages of sleep. While animals inactive for more than 5 min are experiencing change in sleep depth, animals inactive for 0–5 min are transitioning into sleep. In this transition state animals showed a significantly greater arousal threshold in the 20, 40, and 60 min post-meal compared to animals during the respective pre-meal times (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>). Interestingly, the correlation between arousal threshold and postprandial sleep grew weaker when comparing animals in deeper stages of sleep (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2A–B</xref>). This suggests that food intake transiently influences sleep induction rather than depth, which might be shaped solely by the amount of time that an animal is inactive.</p><p>We further considered the possibility that increases in immobility-derived sleep and arousal threshold could be artifacts of grooming behavior. To test this, we manually scored videos of animals during an ARC recording and annotated grooming events. Falsely calculated sleep, in which animals were grooming rather than immobile, accounted for ~7% of sleep surrounding meals and had statistically indistinguishable occurrence before and after a meal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3</xref>). Re-analysis of sleep surrounding a meal, where sleep was defined as periods of immobility and a lack of grooming exceeding 5 min, lowered total sleep but did not alter the rise in postprandial sleep (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2H</xref>).</p><p>We next asked how the quantity of food consumed might influence postprandial sleep. We plotted P<sub>sleep</sub> or ΔP<sub>sleep</sub> for different consumption volumes and found that sleep following meals increased as a function of meal size, while pre-prandial sleep did not (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1A</xref>). Since average postprandial sleep lasted between 20–40 min, and since arousal threshold differences were most apparent in the first 20 min, we re-calculated ΔP<sub>sleep</sub> for the 20 min surrounding each meal. We found a significant correlation between ΔP<sub>sleep</sub> and consumption volume when meals were analyzed individually (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1B</xref>) or binned (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). Since this analysis used individual meals rather than individual animals, we tested whether animals that consumed meals more frequently could bias the observed effect. We performed a Monte Carlo simulation by iteratively recapitulating the analysis with an equal number of randomly selected meals from each animal and found that equal sampling accurately portrays the full data set (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2A–B</xref>). Since sleep is derived from periods of inactivity, we considered whether increased consumption could affect mobility, which might in turn appear to be sleep. The change in movement rate after a meal (Δ<sub>speed</sub>) showed a much weaker correlation to meal size than ΔP<sub>sleep</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2C</xref>). Since speed is a strong indicator of mobility, we reasoned that immobility is not likely responsible for the sleep effect.<fig-group><fig id="fig3" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.19334.009</object-id><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>Postprandial sleep correlates with food intake quantity.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Sleep probability of Canton-S and <italic>w<sup>1118</sup></italic> surrounding meals of varying size (lines represent mean; color grading corresponds to meal size).

To determine the potential contribution of individual components to postprandial sleep, we designed a paradigm that allowed us to test a range of feeding volumes or of ingested nutrients.

All diets contained a base of 0.25% protein to induce feeding while minimizing effects on baseline sleep that might arise by differences in sucrose consumption. Within each series we compared nutrient consumption within a narrow volume range (0.02–0.04 µl, representing 33–38% of recorded meals) to limit the contribution of ingested volume on sleep. We found that ΔP<sub>sleep</sub> was significantly correlated to both protein and salt ingestion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1A–B</xref>). Interestingly, despite reported effects of sucrose on total sleep (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Keene et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Linford et al., 2012</xref>), we found no correlation between ingested sucrose and ΔP<sub>sleep</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1A–B</xref>). For all analyses, only the meal parameter of interest varied, while all others were kept within a restricted range (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). To compare the kinetics of ΔP<sub>sleep</sub> for each effective driver, we quantified maximum ΔP<sub>sleep</sub> amplitude and the total ΔP<sub>sleep</sub> during its decay. For any given increase in total ΔP<sub>sleep</sub> during the decay, meal volume induced a greater rise in amplitude than protein or salt (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2B</xref>). We hypothesize that multiple mechanisms operating on different time scales might underlie postprandial sleep regulation by the various drivers.</p><p>We next sought to identify a neuronal mechanism by which feeding drives postprandial sleep. A previous study showed that Lk was involved in meal size regulation, suggesting that this system acts rapidly during feeding to signal a behavioral shift (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Al-Anzi et al., 2010</xref>). To test if Lk signaling regulates postprandial sleep, a subset of Lkr neurons labeled by the line, <italic>R65C07</italic> (hereafter referred to as <italic>Lkr<sup>GAL4</sup></italic>), were silenced by overexpressing <italic>Kir<sup>2.1</sup></italic>, an inward rectifying K<sup>+</sup> channel (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Johns et al., 1999</xref>). This manipulation eliminated any rise in postprandial sleep and instead caused slight arousal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>). There was no significant change in postprandial activity (Δ<sub>motion</sub> for 20 min after meal: <italic>Kir</italic><sup>2.1</sup> / <italic>w<sup>CS</sup></italic>, −0.006 ± 0.003; <italic>Lkr<sup>GAL4</sup></italic> / <italic>w<sup>CS</sup></italic>, −0.001 ± 0.002; <italic>Kir</italic><sup>2.1</sup> / <italic>Lkr<sup>GAL4</sup></italic>, 0.004 ± 0.004; p=0.28, Kruskal-Wallis test followed by Dunn’s multiple comparisons).

We first tested whether the subset of Lkr neurons labeled by <italic>Lkr<sup>GAL4</sup></italic>mediated the sleep response to meal volume by feeding a low nutrient diet to <italic>Lkr<sup>GAL4</sup></italic>-silenced animals. Silenced animals and their controls showed similar ΔP<sub>sleep</sub> in response to ingested volume, indicating that the <italic>Lkr<sup>GAL4</sup></italic> neurons are not responsible for the volumetric modulation of postprandial sleep (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>). To test the role of Lkr neurons in the postprandial sleep response mediated by nutrients, we supplemented a sucrose diet with either salt or tryptone. <italic>Lkr<sup>GAL4</sup></italic>-silenced animals and their controls showed statistically indistinguishable ΔP<sub>sleep</sub> responses to salt manipulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>).

Interestingly, this waking response exceeded that of control animals on sucrose alone, indicating that protein can also drive wakefulness in the absence of <italic>Lkr<sup>GAL4</sup></italic> neuronal activity. We did not observe changes in meal size, total sleep, or total consumption, indicating that these behaviors are independent of Lkr influence on postprandial sleep (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1A–C</xref>). To test whether this phenotype was caused by changes in development, we conditionally silenced the cells by co-expressing a temperature sensitive GAL4 suppressant protein, GAL80<sup>ts</sup>, throughout development (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>). Inactivation of GAL80<sup>ts</sup> to silence <italic>Lkr<sup>GAL4</sup></italic>-labeled cells in adulthood was sufficient to induce a postprandial sleep defect (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F</xref>).</p><p>Subsets of Lk neurons have been found in the lateral horn, with the diffuse puncta in close proximity to the cell bodies of the Lkr neurons, suggesting a neuromodulatory connection between these cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Al-Anzi et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">de Haro et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Cavey et al., 2016</xref>).

Using this tool, we found that flies exhibit a rise in sleep following a meal. Interestingly, consumption of a meal did not necessarily affect the depth of sleep when controlling for time inactive. There are many instances in which genes or neural processes have been found to influence particular features of sleep while leaving others unaffected (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Harbison et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Shi et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Shang et al., 2011</xref>). Similarly, our work suggests that sleep probability and sleep depth can also be dissociated. By further examination of the shift in sleep probability, we found that it increased as a function of meal size. This may be paralleled in humans where cranial EEG power increases with meal size and during certain stages of sleep (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Reyner et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>In examining individual meal components, we identified volume, protein, and salt as effectors of postprandial sleep. While human studies have been unable to resolve a link between meal volume and measures of wakefulness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Landström et al., 2001</xref>), artificial distension of the gut has been shown to increase sleep in rats (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Lorenz et al., 1998</xref>). Although there are no studies on the effect of protein on postprandial sleep, protein consumption modulates sleep in <italic>Drosophila</italic> and positively correlates with napping in humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Catterson et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Grandner et al., 2010</xref>). Similarly, although there are no studies on the influence of salt on postprandial sleep, salt intake increases mammalian oxytocin signaling, which has been implicated in sleep-wake behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Krause et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Lancel et al., 2003</xref>). Sucrose has been shown to play a critical role in long-term sleep homeostasis and architecture in flies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Keene et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Linford et al., 2012</xref>), although our findings indicate that it does not modulate postprandial sleep. Although we demonstrate the effectiveness of these dietary components in isolation, we note that meals typically incorporate multiple elements. Thus, further work is necessary to identify the mechanisms by which each constituent is sensed and the potential interactions between them. Lipids are also present in many fly food sources and future examination of their influence on postprandial sleep might be facilitated by adding fat solubilizers to the liquid food used in the ARC.</p><p>We demonstrate that the Lk system plays a role in postprandial sleep (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7H</xref>). A subset of Lkr neurons were necessary to initiate postprandial sleep in the presence of protein. While we expected that animals defective in protein sensing would experience postprandial sleep similar to that of animals fed only sucrose, we found instead that they had a waking response. This suggests that ingested protein promotes both sleep and wakefulness, and that the wakefulness is normally counterbalanced by Lkr neuronal activity. While this study does not specifically identify the waking output for protein, it was previously shown that Translin acts through Lk-expressing cells to drive wakefulness in response to sucrose starvation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Murakami et al., 2016</xref>). While this does not explain rapid wake promotion in response to protein ingestion, it does demonstrate that Lk-expressing cells are capable of promoting wakefulness.</p><p>Another recent finding identified Lkr neurons as circadian output neurons, which modulate activity rhythmically. The same study found that incubation of Lkr cells with Lk shunts their calcium response to the cholinergic agonist carbachol (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Cavey et al., 2016</xref>), suggesting an inhibitory connection between Lk and downstream Lkr neurons. By stimulating these same Lk neurons, we observed a reduction of postprandial sleep matching the effect of Lkr silencing, providing additional evidence that the lateral horn harbors an inhibitory node between Lk and Lkr neurons. We also found that knockdown of Lk in these cells increased postprandial sleep, supporting this notion. However, it has been suggested that Lk may have additional receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Terhzaz et al., 1999</xref>), and there is still a lack of definitive evidence for the inhibitory mechanism between Lk and Lkr neuronal activity in the lateral horn. Additional genetic tools, including lines with restricted expression patterns, will be needed to fully uncover the genetic interactions and neuronal connectivity of this system.</p><p>We also found a subset of cells labeled by <italic>20G03</italic> that modulate postprandial sleep during the period near ‘dusk’ or ‘lights-off’. Interestingly, the subset harbors acetylcholine MBONs—cells necessary for the short-term associative memory between sucrose consumption after starvation and an odor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Aso et al., 2014</xref>). This suggests that these cells activate following a feeding event, in agreement with our results. This is further supported by the anatomical distribution of cells in the SOG, a region of the fly brain that regulates feeding behavior. The distribution also shows overlap with Lkr neurons and regions of the neuronal clock network, suggesting a diversity of regulatory inputs and outputs. Further studies might employ GFP reconstitution across synaptic partners (GRASP) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Gordon and Scott, 2009</xref>) or neuronal co-labeling to demonstrate these connections. The apparent diversity of neuronal modulators of postprandial sleep opens the door to future work on determining the various genes and circuits involved.</p><p>The tachykinin family to which Lk belongs has been implicated in the regulation of satiety and sleep, however any physiological connections between these behavioral outputs has not been explored (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Massi et al., 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Zielinski et al., 2015</xref>). The orexin system is regulated by a diversity of signaling molecules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Scammell and Winrow, 2011</xref>) and has already shown promise as a target for sleep therapeutics. Such genetic diversity and therapeutic potential may also be true of systems governing postprandial sleep. Accordingly, the ARC provides a platform for future studies aimed at uncovering additional genes, circuitry, and physiological roles of postprandial sleep. Furthermore, the ability to measure both sleep and feeding in individual animals may shed new light on the fundamental relationship between these behaviors in other paradigms.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title><italic>Drosophila</italic> lines and culture</title><p>Flies were developed in 6 oz. bottles on a standard cornmeal-sucrose-yeast medium consisting of (w/v) 5.8% cornmeal, 3.1% active dry yeast, 0.7% agar, 1.2% sucrose, and (v/v) 1% propionic acid and 0.22% Tegosept (w/v, pre-dissolved in ethanol).

Strips of infrared led lights were placed ~16 cm behind each chamber on a heat sink to provide backlighting for feeding and motion tracking. Each animal was given access to a capillary filled with liquid food. Above the chambers was a 2 mm gap with a small overhang allowed for a sliding gate (5 mm × 2 mm) to seal individual fly cells. The gate contained evenly spaced 2.5 mm vertically oriented holes above the center of each fly cell. This allowed for the insertion of tightly fitting 200 µl pipette tip sleeves that were cut to hold the food-containing capillaries (5 µl glass capillaries, VWR). Sleeves were made by cutting the narrow end of 200 µl pipette tips to fit capillaries tightly. The dye used for liquid meniscus tracking was composed of 75% mineral oil, 25% dodecane, and 1% Copper (II) 1,4,8,11,15,18,22,25-octabutoxy-29<italic>H</italic>,31<italic>H</italic>-phthalocyanine (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO).

The camera was mounted with a custom bracket at equal height to the base of the capillaries. PhenoCapture software was used to capture one image per min using the time-lapse image capture tool (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.phenocapture.net">www.phenocapture.net</ext-link>).

ImageJ was used for image processing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Schneider et al., 2012</xref>). Images were cropped to include all capillaries and dye bands. The images were background subtracted using the built-in subtract background function with a rolling ball radius of five and disabled smoothing. The images were then thresholded manually until the dye bands and reference marks were faithfully displayed without background noise. The images were split to contain image stacks of individual capillaries and tracked using a custom ImageJ plugin. The relative distance between the food meniscus and the reference mark was calculated at each frame using the custom plugin. We used a meal selection algorithm that estimates noise by an iterative filtration of distal values 4.0 s.d. above the Δ<sub>pixel</sub> mean (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Supplementary file 1</xref>). Meals were then selected as values which were 3.5 s.d. above the estimated noise, based on the one frame/min sampling rate. In a setup tracking 30 capillaries, this method provides 10 nL resolution although greater resolution can be achieved by increasing camera resolution and sampling rate. Though infrequent, temporally adjacent feeding bouts were combined and time stamped with the latter meal time. Thus, feeding bouts followed by at least 1 min of non-feeding were considered meals. Each feeding event was corrected for effects of evaporation and luminance fluctuation on observed meal size by subtracting the average noise value from all non-feeding frames. Meal output contains meal associated time and corrected volume.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Positional tracking</title><p>Behavioral tracking was carried out with a custom, freeware, cross-platform analysis framework (JavaGrinders Library, available for free download at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://iEthology.com/">http://iEthology.com/</ext-link>). This library utilizes and extends machine vision functions provided by the OpenCV project for high-resolution analysis of spatial and behavioral data. With an integrated interface for standard USB video device class (UVC) cameras, the software implements multi-stage object detection and analysis for 8-bit grayscale/32-bit color frame sequences in real-time. Following the subtraction of a reference frame, the tracker locates the frame coordinate with the highest remaining pixel value. Provided this value exceeds the object's threshold, the detection algorithm proceeds outwards until it identifies a starting point along the object's thresholded border. By following this edge until it returns to the starting point, the detection algorithm characterizes the object's outline as a polygonal shape. The object's center location is estimated by the polygon's centroid, directional attributes (e.g., long axis) which are obtained via a Singular Value Decomposition of the polygon's outline. The projected size is represented by the shape's area. The size of a fly tracked in the ARC measured approximately 15–20 pixels in length. The present study used a Microsoft Lifecam Studio camera with the infrared filter replaced by an infrared pass filter. Although much higher rates are possible within this system, a reduced sampling rate of 1 Hz was chosen as it proved sufficient for identifying the extended periods of inactivity indicative of sleep. The maximum frame rate capability depends on a number of factors, including the video's resolution, the object's size, the performances of processor and graphics card, and the specifications of the hardware drivers used to interface with the camera. Distance traveled was obtained from Euclidean measures between object centers in consecutive frames. Motion values less than 50% of the fly body length (FBL) were discarded. Dropped positions were reset to the last known location for motion and sleep calculation purposes. This system has been previously tested for <italic>Drosophila</italic> tracking sufficiency and demonstrated enhanced motion/sleep characterization compared to alternative methods (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Donelson et al., 2012</xref>).

Speed of each motion event was calculated as the distance traveled during that event divided by its uninterrupted duration. This is the first time, to our knowledge, that sleep has been measured in vertically oriented chambers, and on a liquid diet. However, we found sleep patterning in the ARC to be in line with the more commonly used Drosophila Activity Monitor (TriKinetics, Waltham, MA).

Alternative experiments for testing volumetric effects used small amounts of sucrose (1%) or both sucrose and tryptone (1% sucrose + 0.25% tryptone) and gave similar results (data not shown). For sucrose grading, the same paradigm was used with a low tryptone diet (0.25%) supplemented with varying concentrations of sucrose (0, 1, 5, 15, and 25%). Feeding events were then filtered to include volumes within the range 0.02–0.04 µl which included 37% of all recorded meals (1131/3038 meals). This range was chosen to maintain a small and narrow volumetric input, and because all dietary groups maintained meal volumes within this range. Meals were grouped into 1.333 µg bins of sucrose consumed during the meal (meal volume × nutrient concentration). Salt grading was performed similarly but with varying concentrations of salt (0, 0.25, 0.3, 0.4, 0.5, 0.6, 0.75, and 1%) and 0.05 µg bins, and included 33% of all recorded meals (478/1446 meals). Protein grading was performed by providing diets of varying concentrations of tryptone (0.25, 1, 2.5, 3, 4, and 5%) and analyzed similarly to sucrose and salt experiments using 0.333 µg bins, and included 38% of all recorded meals (714/1872 meals).</p></sec><sec id="s4-11"><title><italic>Lkr<sup>GAL4</sup></italic> dietary manipulations</title><p>For <italic>Lkr<sup>GAL4</sup></italic> silencing experiments, flies were fed standard liquid diets: 2.5% sucrose + 2.5% yeast extract, respectively. To test volume response deficiency, animals were fed a low nutrient (1% sucrose + 0.25% tryptone) food which elicited a large range and frequency of meals. To test protein response deficiency, animals were fed 2.5% sucrose supplemented with the standard diet equivalent of protein (1.67% tryptone). The standard diet contained a negligible amount of salt (with respect to inducing a postprandial sleep response). To test a salt response deficiency, animals were fed 2.5% sucrose supplemented with 1% NaCl. Average meal size between groups did not differ—hence, meal size filtering was not applied.</p></sec><sec id="s4-12"><title>Immunohistochemistry</title><p>Brains were imaged as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Murakami et al., 2016</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-13"><title>Statistics</title><p>Statistical analysis was performed using Matlab statistical toolbox or GraphPad Prism version 5.04 (GraphPad Software, La Jolla, CA). All reported values are mean ± s.e.m. Shapiro-Wilk test was used to determine data normality. Data were analyzed using either Wilcoxon matched-pairs sign rank test for comparisons of non-parametric P<sub>sleep</sub> of animals before and after meals, Kruskal-Wallis test followed by Dunn’s multiple comparisons for non-parametric comparisons of ΔP<sub>sleep</sub>, or the Mann-Whitney test when comparing two non-parametric groups, non-paired observations. Comparisons of meal size to given features were analyzed using Spearman rank correlation, due to non-parametric distribution, while binned data were analyzed using Pearson correlation.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We thank M Southern for writing the image splitter plugin for ImageJ.

Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Senior Editor. Our decision has been reached after consultation between the reviewers. Based on these discussions and the individual reviews below, we regret to inform you that your work will not be considered further for publication in <italic>eLife</italic>.</p><p>The following individual involved in the review of your submission has agreed to reveal his identity: Paul Shaw (peer reviewer).</p><p>Although all three reviewers found the work of high quality and potentially interesting, the consensus opinion was that there was still a great deal of work required to support the conclusions of the manuscript. In particular, the studies of the role of leucokinin and LKR require additional experiments. Given the time it would take to perform these lengthy additional experiments, we felt it would be most fair to return the paper to you.

The authors show decreased locomotion post-feeding, increased startle response, and that volume consumed and nutrient affects sleep probability. They further show that silencing a subset of LKR neurons decreased sleep whereas silencing LK neurons increased sleep, and interpreted this to suggest that LK has multiple roles in promoting and inhibiting sleep. Overall, there are intriguing findings in this manuscript; in particular the notion the feeding increases sleep is very exciting. The data, however, seem preliminary and more suitable for publication in a specialty journal. My main reservations are the following:</p><p>1) The role of LKR and LK is unclear. The nature of the lines used is not well-described. Do these lines really label a subset of all LKR neurons and all LK neurons? By what criteria, Ab staining?</p><p>2) The function of LK and LKR neurons is not clear. The observation that silencing LK neurons increased sleep and silencing LKR decreased sleep needs to be explained. Use of multiple RNAi lines to knock down LK and LKR, and use of multiple LK-Gal4 and LKR-Gal4 lines would be important to resolve this. Does RNAi against LK and LKR pan-neuronally increase sleep? Do different LKR and LK Gal4 lines show consistent behavioral phenotypes?</p><p>3) What is the evidence that the decreased locomotion is sleep? Flies may significantly increase grooming after feeding, leading to decreased movement overall. This, in principle, could influence startle and depend on ingested compound. High resolution monitoring of behavior would be important to rule out that feeding influences the probability of other behaviors.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>In this manuscript the authors study the impact of food intake on subsequent sleep. They report that the probability of sleeping is increased following meals which was correlated with the meal content. In addition, they report that silencing Leucokininreceptor expressing neurons reduces postprandial sleep. Similarly, silencing Leucokininneurons increase postprandial sleep.</p><p>All in all, I thought this was a well written and fun manuscript. The authors do a nice job of presenting the data and the results are solid. My main critique is that virtually all of the data is presented as a probability. While this may very well be the best way to present the data it leaves the reader without any way to assess the magnitude of the effect or compare it with changes in sleep reported in the literature in response to other manipulations.</p><p>With that in mind, it seems important to show some data that shows the changes in sleep in minutes and to describe other sleep parameters such as average sleep bout duration (if this data was included, I apologize but I couldn't find it). Small effects can have large consequences so there shouldn't be any hesitation about showing more data. Similarly, nobody has recorded sleep in flies maintained in a vertical environment. It would be great to see what the pattern of sleep looked like compared to the typical experiment.</p><p>To my knowledge yeast also contain lipids but there wasn't any attempt to determine how lipids changed postprandial sleep. This decision should be discussed.</p><p>In summary, I am very enthusiastic about this manuscript even though I am quite not sure if it will be functionally relevant for the animal.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic></p><p>Postprandial sleepiness is a phenomenon that most can easily recognize, but has been difficult to objectively document. In this manuscript, Murphy et al. develop a novel assay combining the CAFE assay with video measurements of locomotor activity, in order to simultaneously assess feeding and sleep in <italic>Drosophila</italic>. Using this ARC assay, they find that larger meals, and protein and salt meals promote sleepiness, while sucrose meals do not. They also suggest that the Leuc/LKR pathway, previously implicated in regulating feeding in flies, modulates post-prandial sleepiness in response to protein intake.</p><p>Overall, the work is interesting and generally carefully done, and the ARC assay is likely to provide new insights into the dynamic relationship between feeding and sleep. However, the manuscript still needs additional work to justify its publication in a journal with broad impact and scope, like <italic>eLife</italic>.</p><p>1) The characterization of post-prandial sleepiness using the ARC assay has been carefully done. However, the novelty and impact of this work lies with the use of this assay to identify molecular or cellular mechanisms that mediate this process. To this point, the authors have significant work to do to make a convincing argument regarding the role of LKR and Leuc neurons in this post-prandial sleepiness.</p><p>a) The authors use a single LKR RNAi to knockdown LKR. QPCR data should be provided demonstrating effective knockdown of LKR and another independent RNAi strain (or alternative genetic approach) should be used to ensure specificity of phenotype.</p><p>b) The authors also use a single LKR-Gal4 line (R65C07) in their experiments. Has this driver been previously characterized, in terms of number of LKR+ cells vs LKR- cells, as well as precisely which LKR+ cells are present? As is the case with the RNAi line, an additional Gal4 line containing LKR cells (such as the original Lkr-Gal4-, AI-Anzi et al., 2010) would help to strengthen their claims. Similar issues exist with the authors' use of a single Leuc-Gal4 line (R20G03).</p><p>c) Given that they are examining adult behavior, it would be better to use conditional silencing approaches (e.g., Kir2.1, tubGal80ts) to bypass effects on development in assessing the role of LKR and Leuc neurons in post-prandial sleepiness. Also, does activation of LKR and Leuc neurons result in a postprandial phenotype opposite to that seen with silencing?</p><p>d) The authors make the unexpected finding that Leuc neurons (or at least a subset of them) seem to promote post-prandial arousal. In the absence of a better understanding of how the Leuc and LKR neurons interact to regulate sleep/wake, the Leuc data could be removed from the manuscript, as it does not add much.</p><p>e) Do the LKR or Leuc neurons show changes in activity with feeding? If they play a physiological role in post-prandial sleepiness, one would expect their activity levels to change with feeding (and with protein feeding in particular).</p><p>[Editors’ note: what now follows is the decision letter after the authors submitted for further consideration.]</p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Postprandial sleep mechanics in <italic>Drosophila</italic>&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>.

In their resubmitted manuscript, Murphy et al. have performed a number of control experiments and focused their analysis of mechanisms underlying postprandial sleep to Leuc and LKR circuits. Since their last submission, Cavey et al. (2016) have published a description of Leuc/LKR neurons acting downstream of clock neurons to regulate locomotion and sleep, and also provide evidence for an inhibitory action of Leuc on LKR neurons, which helps to resolve the opposing effects of Leuc and LKR circuits on postprandial sleep previously seen by Murphy et al. Although the manuscript has considerably improved, questions remain about the Gal4 lines used and the roles of LK and LKR.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The Gal4 lines used for LK and LKR are Rubin transgenic lines that contain 3 Kb fragments of LK and LKR non-coding regions (these are not enhancer traps). Many times these fragments do not recapitulate endogenous gene expression. The Cavey study nicely validated the LKR line by showing that the neurons respond to LK. The LK line has not been validated and LK Ab staining with the Gal4 line used is required.</p><p>2) The authors removed the RNAi studies shown in the previous version, but these are important. Two RNAi lines for LK and LKR should be used to test the role of these genes in LK and LKR neurons (the Rubin Gal4 lines used in this study). If the LKR RNAi data conflicts with the model presented, then the model should be modified.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.19334.022</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p>[Editors’ note: the author responses to the first round of peer review follow.]</p><p><italic>[…] Although all three reviewers found the work of high quality and potentially interesting, the consensus opinion was that there was still a great deal of work required to support the conclusions of the manuscript.

The manuscript has been substantially revised, as detailed in the point-by-point responses to reviewers below. The submission includes deeper characterization of the new behavioral paradigm so that results can be better interpreted. This characterization includes comparing different behavioral systems (ARC vs. DAM), demonstrating conserved postprandial sleep behavior in females, and a comprehensive examination of fly grooming behavior to verify the correlation between measured immobility and sleep.</p><p>We have also revised the manuscript to focus solely on the circuit regulation of postprandial sleep. We include new data for conditional silencing of Lk and Lkr neurons in adulthood, improved images for the neuronal drivers used and their interaction with one another, and the demonstration that Lk inhibitory signaling to Lkr neurons has a postprandial sleep effect that is both rhythmic and induced by feeding. This new data complements a recent publication (Cavey et al., Nature Neurosci. 2016) showing that Lk inhibits Lkr neurons in the fan-shaped body. We believe the new integrated system for <italic>Drosophila</italic> behavioral measurement, the description and validation of a new behavior, and the dissection of one aspect of its dietary and neuronal regulation are appropriate for consideration as an article in <italic>eLife</italic>.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic> </p><p><italic>[…] 1) The role of LKR and LK is unclear. The nature of the lines used is not well-described. Do these lines really label a subset of all LKR neurons and all LK neurons? By what criteria, Ab staining?</italic> </p><p>Previous studies have characterized both LKR and LK cells in the Drosophila brain using antibody staining (De Haro et al., Cell Tissue Res. 2010 and Al-Anzi et al., Curr. Biol. 2010) which is recapitulated by the enhancer trap GAL4 lines used in this work. This is addressed in the text (“The expression pattern of R65C07 recapitulates that of Lkr neurons which were found to regulate meal size. […] Subsets of Lk neurons have been found in the lateral horn and are in close proximity to cell bodies of the Lkr neurons, suggesting neuromodulatory connection between these cells. This expression is recapitulated by R20G03, an enhancer trap line of Lk, which labels cell bodies in the lateral horn that coincide with Lkr neurons”). We have also re-focused the manuscript on the role of neuronal circuitry rather than Lk and Lkr within these circuits. The circuit-based section of the manuscript has been bolstered by substantial supportive data, and we believe the specific roles of LK and LKR are now better dissected in future work.</p><p><italic>2) The function of LK and LKR neurons is not clear. The observation that silencing LK neurons increased sleep and silencing LKR decreased sleep needs to be explained. Use of multiple RNAi lines to knock down LK and LKR, and use of multiple LK-Gal4 and LKR-Gal4 lines would be important to resolve this. Does RNAi against LK and LKR pan-neuronally increase sleep? Do different LKR and LK Gal4 lines show consistent behavioral phenotypes?</italic> </p><p>We agree that the role of these neurons was previously unclear. The recent finding of an inhibitory interaction between Lk and Lkr neurons has clarified this opposing phenotype (Cavey et al. Nature Neurosci. 2016), which is now explained in the text. While we agree that a deep genetic interrogation of the behavior is also important, we think that doing so would be enough work for a separate manuscript and have in turn limited the current manuscript to a more thorough circuit-based analysis.</p><p><italic>3) What is the evidence that the decreased locomotion is sleep? Flies may significantly increase grooming after feeding, leading to decreased movement overall. This, in principle, could influence startle and depend on ingested compound. High resolution monitoring of behavior would be important to rule out that feeding influences the probability of other behaviors.</italic> </p><p>We agree that this experiment is crucial to the validity of this study. We have addressed this by performing our typical experiment with simultaneous high resolution video capture. We manually scored grooming events and generated grooming ethograms for alignment with sleep data, allowing us to recalculate sleep while excluding immobile flies which were grooming. While grooming does account for ~7% of calculated sleep, we found that it does not artificially raise the calculated sleep after a meal any more than it raises the sleep prior (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G-H</xref>, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3</xref>).</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic> </p><p><italic>In this manuscript the authors study the impact of food intake on subsequent sleep.

Small effects can have large consequences so there shouldn't be any hesitation about showing more data.</italic> </p><p>We thank the reviewer for the positive remarks and suggestions. While we recognize that probability is a non-traditional method for presenting sleep, this behavior occurs on a much shorter time scale than other data sets which are better shown in the typical 30 minute bins. Since there are no sleep-related behaviors, to our knowledge, which use 1-minute time bins we decided it was most intuitive to think of the changes in sleep as probability rather than seconds per minute. However, we agree that experts in the field should be given a relatable scale for comparison with their own data, and so a seconds per minute scale was added to the first sleep probability graphs shown (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>) as well as the graph of sleep probability related meal size (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). We also recognize the utility in further examining the sleep architecture surrounding a meal. However, since sleep duration in the time leading up to a meal is restricted by the fact that the animal cannot sleep while eating, we had originally excluded any examinations of sleep architecture. Since sleep initiation is not restricted we have included a supplemental figure showing the probability of sleep initiation as well as the sleep frequency before and after meals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1B</xref>).</p><p><italic>Similarly, nobody has recorded sleep in flies maintained in a vertical environment. It would be great to see what the pattern of sleep looked like compared to the typical experiment.</italic> </p><p>Comparison of sleep in a vertical versus horizontal chamber is an excellent suggestion and should serve to inform the <italic>Drosophila</italic> community about the influence of environmental orientation on fly sleep. We have now included a supplementary figure comparing sleep data from animals in an ARC or the traditional DAM system (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). Although the type of data (video versus IR beam breaks) and calculation of sleep is different in the two systems, sleep patterns were similar and we believe the comparison makes our findings more relatable to those using the classical system.</p><p><italic>To my knowledge yeast also contain lipids but there wasn't any attempt to determine how lipids changed postprandial sleep. This decision should be discussed.</italic> </p><p>Because the food used in the experiments is water based, and because oil is used to mark the meniscus for high resolution feeding measurement, lipids have been extremely difficult to measure in the ARC (and with the capillary feeder or CAFE assay in general). However, we are beginning to test various methods for measuring lipid consumption in high resolution and have added a small section discussing the potential interest in these findings (“Lipids are also present in many fly food sources and future examination of their influence on postprandial sleep might be facilitated by adding fat solubilizers to the liquid food used in the ARC.”)</p><p><italic>In summary, I am very enthusiastic about this manuscript even though I am quite not sure if it will be functionally relevant for the animal.</italic> </p><p>We thank the reviewer for these comments. We believe the strong conservation of postprandial somnolence in different species (at least anecdotally) suggests an important function that will be revealed in future work.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic> </p><p><italic>[…] 1) The characterization of post-prandial sleepiness using the ARC assay has been carefully done.

However, enhancer trap lines tend to show more variability in cell labeling between animals so it would be difficult to verify how many Lkr– cells are labeled within an experiment. We have now included higher resolution images of both the Lkr and Lk cells labeled by the R65C07 and R20G03 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>), respectively, which can be visually compared to the drivers used by Al-Anzi et al.

While we have attempted activation of these neurons using TrpA, the results have not been strong enough for us to make any conclusions on the data. It is notable that both the Lk and Lkr cells seem to have very low basal activity and that TrpA activation may quickly hyperpolarize the cells or might have non-physiologically relevant activation.</p><p> <italic>d) The authors make the unexpected finding that Leuc neurons (or at least a subset of them) seem to promote post-prandial arousal. In the absence of a better understanding of how the Leuc and LKR neurons interact to regulate sleep/wake, the Leuc data could be removed from the manuscript, as it does not add much.</italic> </p><p>During the revision of this paper, Cavey et al. showed that Lkr neurons respond to carbachol, a cholinergic agonist, and that incubating Lkr neurons with Leucokinin shunted this response. While this strongly suggested that the lateral horn Lk neurons inhibit the connecting Lkr neurons, there was very little evidence of this on a behavioral level. Our data shows a clear opposing phenotype when silencing Lkr versus Lk neurons, shedding new light on their findings. Cavey et al. also showed that Lk signaling peaked at ZT 10-14 using Gcamp6 in explanted brains. We were able to expand our analysis to show that the inhibitory effect of Leucokinin was greatest during this time period. We think our findings are strongly supported by and complementary to the evidence from Cavey et al. of Lk-Lkr inhibition.</p><p> <italic>e) Do the LKR or Leuc neurons show changes in activity with feeding? If they play a physiological role in post-prandial sleepiness, one would expect their activity levels to change with feeding (and with protein feeding in particular).</italic> </p><p>We do observe a trend for increased activity; however the difference is not consistently significant across experiments. We have highlighted this in the results (“This manipulation eliminated any rise in postprandial sleep and instead caused slight arousal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>).

However, anti-Lk immunostaining did not show Lk co-localization in any of the cells labeled by this driver (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1</xref>). Additionally, promoting Lk RNAi in the cells had no effect on postprandial sleep, in agreement with the lack of Lk expression in <italic>R20G03</italic>-labeled cells.</p><p>We have also now tested the previously validated Lk-Gal4, which we confirmed does label cells expressing Lk (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). TRPA stimulation of these cells, or Lk knockdown by RNAi, are consistent with the idea that they are inhibitory, in agreement with Cavey et al. Thus, the revised manuscript now describes two populations of cells labeled by R20G03 or Lk-Gal4 that are independent or dependent on leucokinin, respectively. Our proposed model suggests that these cells function through modulating Lkr neuronal activity, but further studies are needed to confirm these hypotheses.</p><p><italic>2) The authors removed the RNAi studies shown in the previous version, but these are important. Two RNAi lines for LK and LKR should be used to test the role of these genes in LK and LKR neurons (the Rubin Gal4 lines used in this study). If the LKR RNAi data conflicts with the model presented, then the model should be modified.</italic> </p><p>We have now demonstrated the role of LK in Lk-Gal4 labeled cells using two independent RNAi lines. Knockdown of Lk using either line increased postprandial sleep, consistent with the putative Lk-Lkr inhibitory action found by Cavey et al. As an additional control, we have also shown that Lk RNAi does not have an effect when driven in R20G03 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1</xref>). We were ultimately only able to obtain one reliable RNAi line for Lkr. While results using this line were robust, we have left this series of experiments for future work where we will generate additional independent RNAi lines to validate the observed effects. The proposed model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7H</xref>) has been modified and the text has been revised to reflect the additional unknown genetic interactions and neuronal connections that must describe postprandial sleep.</p></body></sub-article></article>
