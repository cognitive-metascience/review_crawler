mechanisms. Here we report structures of complexes formed by the DD of p75 neurotrophin receptor (p75<sup>NTR</sup>) with RhoGDI, for activation of the RhoA pathway, with caspase recruitment domain (CARD) of RIP2 kinase, for activation of the NF-kB pathway, and with itself, revealing how DD dimerization controls access of intracellular effectors to the receptor. RIP2 CARD and RhoGDI bind to p75<sup>NTR</sup> DD at partially overlapping epitopes with over 100-fold difference in affinity, revealing the mechanism by which RIP2 recruitment displaces RhoGDI upon ligand binding. The p75<sup>NTR</sup> DD forms non-covalent, low-affinity symmetric dimers in solution. The dimer interface overlaps with RIP2 CARD but not RhoGDI binding sites, supporting a model of receptor activation triggered by separation of DDs. These structures reveal how competitive protein-protein interactions orchestrate the hierarchical activation of downstream pathways in non-catalytic receptors.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.11692.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.11692.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.11692.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Cells have proteins called receptors on their surface that can bind to specific molecules on the outside of the cell. Typically, this binding activates the receptor and the activated receptor then triggers some biochemical changes inside the cell. For many receptors, the portion of the receptor inside the cell is essentially an enzyme that can trigger a biochemical change by itself. Some receptors, however, lack any enzymatic activity, and it is often unclear how these ‘non-catalytic receptors’ trigger changes inside a cell.</p><p>A protein called p75 neurotrophin receptor (or p75<sup>NTR</sup> for short) is a non-catalytic receptor that is expressed when neurons are injured and its activity leads to the death of the neurons and related cells. Inhibiting this non-catalytic receptor is an attractive strategy for limiting the damage caused by diseases of the nervous system. However, the molecular mechanisms behind the activity of p75<sup>NTR</sup> are not well understood.</p><p>Previous biochemical studies set out to answer the question of how p75<sup>NTR</sup> engages with components of the signaling machinery inside the cell, and found several components that interact with this receptor. Now, Lin et al. have tried to gain a more detailed understanding of those interactions at a molecular level. This involved solving the three-dimensional structures of three protein complexes that involve part of p75<sup>NTR</sup> (called the “death domain”) and one of two signaling components (called RhoGDI and RIP2).</p><p>Two of the protein complexes showed that RIP2 and RhoGDI bind to the receptor’s death domain at partially overlapping sites, although RIP2 binds about 100 times more strongly than RhoGDI.A third protein complex showed an interaction between two copies of the death domain, which involves a surface of the receptor that overlaps with RIP2’s, but not RhoGDI’s, binding site.</p><p>These structures, together with the results of other experiments, allowed Lin et al. to propose a model that could explain how p75<sup>NTR</sup> is activated. First, the two death domains must be separated. Next, RIP2 is recruited to the receptor, and outcompetes and displaces RhoGDI. This change in protein-protein interactions switches the receptor’s signaling from one pathway to the other. Now that these structures are available, they can be used in future experiments to design specific changes in the receptor that would allow researchers to dissect its different activities.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.11692.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.11692.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>p75</kwd><kwd>nmr</kwd><kwd>structure</kwd><kwd>binding</kwd><kwd>receptor</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000781</institution-id><institution>European Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>339237-p75ntr</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ibanez</surname><given-names>Carlos F</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004359</institution-id><institution>Vetenskapsrådet</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>K2012-63X-10908-19-5</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ibanez</surname><given-names>Carlos F</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100002794</institution-id><institution>Cancerfonden</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>13-0676</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ibanez</surname><given-names>Carlos F</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004047</institution-id><institution>Karolinska Institutet</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Distinguished Professor Award</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ibanez</surname><given-names>Carlos F</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001349</institution-id><institution>National Medical Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>CBRG13nov012</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ibanez</surname><given-names>Carlos F</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001459</institution-id><institution>Ministry of Education -

DDs are present in a variety of proteins, including several members of the tumor necrosis factor receptor superfamily (TNFRSF) and a range of intracellular signaling components, such as caspases and kinases. The DD family includes four subfamilies of structurally related domains, including the canonical DD, the death effector domain (DED), the caspase recruitment domain (CARD), and the pyrin domain (PYD). DD-containing proteins play central roles in apoptotic and inflammatory signaling through the formation of oligomeric protein complexes, and several disease-causing mutations have been mapped to DD interfaces (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Park et al., 2007</xref>). All DD complexes described so far involve homotypic interactions between DDs of the same subfamily (e.g., DD with DD, CARD with CARD, etc.). All known DD interactions belong to one of three types (I to III), each mediated by conserved asymmetric interfaces in the interacting DDs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Park, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Park et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Weber and Vincenz, 2001</xref>). Heterotypic complexes between DDs from different subfamilies have not yet been described and, aside from a few structures of DDs bound to small polypeptides, no complexes of DDs with proteins outside the DD superfamily have been reported. Thus, type I, II, and III interactions between DDs are thought to represent the predominant mechanism of oligomerization and complex formation for DD-containing proteins.</p><p>The cytoplasmic domain of the p75 neurotrophin receptor (p75<sup>NTR</sup>, also known as NGFR and TNFRSF16) contains a C-terminal DD connected to the transmembrane (TM) domain by a 60-residue-long linker region (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Liepinsh, 1997</xref>). p75<sup>NTR</sup> is a receptor for members of the neurotrophin family, such as nerve growth factor (NGF) and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Dechant and Barde, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Roux and Barker, 2002</xref>). In addition to the neurotrophins, a number of other extracellular ligands can also engage or signal through p75<sup>NTR</sup>, including the beta-amyloid peptide (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Knowles et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Perini et al., 2002</xref>), the rabies virus glycoprotein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Tuffereau et al., 1998</xref>), and various myelin-derived polypeptides (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Wang et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Wong et al., 2002</xref>). p75<sup>NTR</sup> may function alone or in conjunction with other transmembrane proteins to allow ligand binding and intracellular signaling. These proteins include members of the Trk family of receptor tyrosine kinases, members of the Vps10p family of sorting receptors, such as Sortilin, and the Nogo receptor, which promotes binding to myelin-derived ligands (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Underwood and Coulson, 2008</xref>). p75<sup>NTR</sup> can engage different intracellular pathways, of which the best characterized are the RhoA pathway, which regulates axon growth, collapse and degeneration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Park et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Yamashita et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Yamashita and Tohyama, 2003</xref>), the NF-kB pathway, which contributes to cell survival (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Carter et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Khursigara et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Vicario et al., 2015</xref>), and the c-Jun kinase (JNK) or caspase pathway, which mediates apoptotic cell death (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Friedman, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Yoon et al., 1998</xref>). p75<sup>NTR</sup> signaling through any of those three pathways requires a functional DD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Charalampopoulos et al., 2012</xref>). Expression of p75<sup>NTR</sup> increases in a number of neurodegenerative diseases and upon injury or stress conditions, where it contributes to neuronal and glial cell damage, axonal degeneration, and synaptic dysfunction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Ibanez and Simi, 2012</xref>). Inhibition of p75<sup>NTR</sup> signaling has emerged as an attractive strategy for limiting neural damage in neurodegeneration and nerve injury.</p><p>The mechanism of activation of p75<sup>NTR</sup> in response to neurotrophins involves a conformational rearrangement of disulfide-linked receptor dimers, resulting in the separation of intracellular DDs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Vilar et al., 2009</xref>). Fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) experiments have shown that the two DDs in the p75<sup>NTR</sup> dimer are in close proximity to each other (high FRET state) and that NGF binding induces a decrease in FRET signal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Vilar et al., 2009</xref>). Disruption of this conformational change through mutation of a conserved cysteine residue in the TM domain prevents p75<sup>NTR</sup> signaling in response to neurotrophins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Vilar et al., 2009</xref>). p75<sup>NTR</sup> lacks an associated catalytic activity. Similar to other members of the TNFRSF, signaling by p75<sup>NTR</sup> proceeds via ligand-induced recruitment and release of cytoplasmic effectors to and from its intracellular domain. Ligand-induced separation of p75<sup>NTR</sup> DDs may allow the recruitment of intracellular components for downstream signal propagation. Although a variety of intracellular proteins have been reported to interact with p75<sup>NTR</sup>, the molecular mechanisms by which the receptor engages different signaling pathways remain unclear. To begin addressing these questions, our laboratory performed a comprehensive structure–function study of the p75<sup>NTR</sup> DD that resulted in the identification of three sets of solvent-exposed residues that are critical for p75<sup>NTR</sup>’s ability to engage the RhoA, NF-kB and JNK/cell death pathways, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Charalampopoulos et al., 2012</xref>). Receptor mutants that are selectively deficient in one pathway but not others were generated, demonstrating that different signaling outputs can be genetically separated in p75<sup>NTR</sup>. Understanding how such interfaces relate to each other and to the mechanism of receptor activation has remained an important challenge.</p><p>In this study, we have undertaken a structural biology approach to elucidate the molecular mechanisms underlying downstream signaling mediated by the DD in p75<sup>NTR</sup>. We have determined the solution structures of the p75<sup>NTR</sup> DD in complex with RhoGDI (Rho guanine nucleotide dissociation inhibitor), which links the receptor to the RhoA pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Yamashita et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Yamashita and Tohyama, 2003</xref>), or with the CARD domain of RIP2 kinase, which is necessary for p75<sup>NTR</sup> coupling to the NF-kB pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Charalampopoulos et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Khursigara et al., 2001</xref>). We have also solved the solution structure of the p75<sup>NTR</sup> DD homodimer, revealing the DD surface that is occluded prior to neurotrophin-mediated receptor activation. These structures uncover novel heterotypic DD interactions, not previously seen in other DD-containing complexes, and reveal the molecular mechanisms underlying the early stages of p75<sup>NTR</sup> activation and downstream signaling.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Solution structure of the complex between the p75<sup>NTR</sup> DD and RhoGDI</title><p>RhoGDI interacts constitutively with the DD of unliganded p75<sup>NTR</sup>, linking the receptor to the RhoA pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Yamashita and Tohyama, 2003</xref>). Neurotrophin binding induces the release of RhoGDI from p75<sup>NTR</sup> and decreases RhoA activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Gehler et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Yamashita et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Yamashita and Tohyama, 2003</xref>). Using biochemical and cell-based assays, we have previously identified solvent-exposed residues in the p75<sup>NTR</sup> DD that are critical for its interaction with RhoGDI and RhoA activation, including residues in helices H1 and H6 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Charalampopoulos et al., 2012</xref>). In order to obtain a molecular understanding of this interaction, we determined the solution structure of the human p75<sup>NTR</sup> DD:RhoGDI complex by multidimensional nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>). We note that, unless otherwise indicated, all amino acid residue numbering in this study corresponds to the human forms of the respective proteins. Human and rat p75<sup>NTR</sup> DD share more than 90% sequence identity—including all functionally relevant residues—and an essentially identical three-dimensional structure with an overall RMSD of 1.7 Å ((<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Liepinsh, 1997</xref>) and this study). The ensemble of the 10 lowest-energy conformers of the DD:RhoGDI complex and a representative structure are depicted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A,B</xref>. p75<sup>NTR</sup> DD in the complex consists of one 3<sub>10</sub>-helix followed by six α-helices and its global fold is very similar to that of our previously described structure of rat p75<sup>NTR</sup> DD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Liepinsh, 1997</xref>). In the complex, the C-terminal domain of RhoGDI primarily displays an immunoglobulin-like fold similar to previously described structures of this protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Longenecker et al., 1999</xref>). Residues Glu<sup>40</sup> to Gly<sup>57</sup> in the RhoGDI N-terminal domain fold into a long helix, which is not involved in p75<sup>NTR</sup> DD binding and remains flexible in the complex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Removal of this N-terminal domain did not affect RhoGDI binding to p75<sup>NTR</sup> DD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>). Inspection of the interface in the complex showed that it is mainly formed by α-helices H1 and H6 of the p75<sup>NTR</sup> DD and β-strands S2, S3, S9 and α-helix H2 of RhoGDI, forming a small hydrophobic core surrounded by polar residues (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). Charged residues play an important role in the binding interface and high concentration of salt (i.e., greater than 200 mM NaCl) can almost completely disrupt p75<sup>NTR</sup> DD:RhoGDI interaction in vitro (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C</xref>). It is gratifying to note that all functional DD determinants that we have previously identified by site-directed mutagenesis clustered at the DD:RhoGDI interface of the complex structure (labeled red in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C,D</xref>). The structure of the DD:RhoGDI complex offered an opportunity to address the functional importance of a larger set of residues in the p75<sup>NTR</sup> DD as well as in RhoGDI. Co-immunoprecipitation experiments were performed in cells transfected with constructs of full-length p75<sup>NTR</sup> and RhoGDI carrying different point mutations in selected residues. Alanine substitution of individual amino acid residues likely uncovers only those side chains making the most critical contribution to the binding interface.

The two distant binding sites on RhoGDI suggested that a heterotrimer complex p75<sup>NTR</sup> DD:RhoGDI:RhoA may be structurally feasible. We investigated this by performing HADDOCK calculations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Dominguez et al., 2003</xref>) using our solution structure of p75<sup>NTR</sup> DD from its complex with RhoGDI and the crystal structure of the RhoGDI:RhoA(GDP) complex. Multiple refinements converged to a mean backbone root mean square deviation (RMSD) of 0.64 ± 0.05 Å (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A,B</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl2">Table 2</xref>). Ramachandran plot analysis of the docking model indicated that the trimer structure, including the two intermolecular interfaces, still occupies the energetically preferred conformation. In the tripartite complex, the N-terminal domain of RhoGDI folded into two helices and bound to RhoA(GDP), similar to its conformation in the RhoGDI:RhoA(GDP) complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Longenecker et al., 1999</xref>). The DD binding site on RhoGDI remained nearly identical to that in the DD:RhoGDI complex. This analysis shows that interaction of the three proteins can indeed occur simultaneously and explains previous biochemical studies showing that RhoA can be co-immunoprecipitated with p75<sup>NTR</sup> in the presence of RhoGDI (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Yamashita et al., 1999</xref>). Using the purified proteins, we determined the binding affinity of the RhoGDI:RhoA complex by surface plasmon resonance (SPR). Titration of RhoGDI onto immobilized RhoA, yielded a binding <italic>K</italic><sub>d</sub> of 0.14 ± 0.01 μM, which is in agreement with previous measurements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Tnimov et al., 2012</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). Interestingly, when RhoGDI was precomplexed with purified p75<sup>NTR</sup> DD, the <italic>K</italic><sub>d</sub> was 2.2 ± 0.11 μM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>), indicating that binding to the p75<sup>NTR</sup> DD decreases the affinity of the RhoGDI:RhoA interaction by about 15-fold. We note that, in the absence of RhoGDI, no binding between p75<sup>NTR</sup> DD and RhoA could be detected in these experiments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>). These results suggest that RhoGDI binding to the p75<sup>NTR</sup> DD weakens its interaction with RhoA, a step which may facilitate RhoA activation.<fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.11692.007</object-id><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Structural model of tripartite complex between p75<sup>NTR</sup> death domain, RhoGDI and RhoA.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Superposition of backbone traces of the 10 lowest-energy structures of p75<sup>NTR</sup> DD:RhoGDI:RhoA tripartite complex.

Recruitment of RIP2 is required for regulation of the NF-kB pathway by p75<sup>NTR</sup>. Previous biochemical studies established that the interaction between p75<sup>NTR</sup> and RIP2 is mediated by their DD and CARD domains, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Khursigara et al., 2001</xref>). The RIP2 CARD consists of 107 amino acids and is located in the C-terminal of the protein. It connects to the N-terminal kinase domain via a linker of 120 amino acids. We determined the NMR structure of human RIP2 CARD in monomeric form (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A,B</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>). The solution structure of RIP2 CARD comprises an arrangement of six α-helices followed by one short 3<sub>10</sub>-helix, all tightly packed around a hydrophobic core. A C-terminal tail of 17 amino acids (Leu<sup>524</sup>-Met<sup>540</sup>) follows the CARD and is unstructured and flexible in solution. A unique segment (Gln<sup>518</sup>-Ile<sup>523</sup>) between the C-terminal tail and the 3<sub>10</sub>-helix contains two structural disruptor residues (i.e., Pro<sup>519</sup> and Pro<sup>520</sup>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>) and lacks a secondary structure, but its orientation was well-defined in the NMR structure. A number of hydrophobic residues (e.g., Ile<sup>523</sup>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>) in this segment closely interact with the first and the last α-helices in the RIP2 CARD. Structural comparison using the DALI server (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Holm and Rosenström, 2010</xref>) showed that the most similar structure to RIP2 CARD was the CARD of nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain-containing protein 1 (NOD1), with a <italic>Z</italic>-score between 9 and 11. NOD1 and RIP2 have been shown to interact with each other through their CARDs to propagate immune signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Mayle et al., 2014</xref>). The two CARDs share similar structural features, including a similar arrangement of all but the last of the α-helices, which displays different local secondary structures in the two proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1A</xref>). Despite their folding similarities, the two CARDs exhibit significantly different surface characteristics. Particularly, RIP2 CARD has many more charged residues on its surface than its NOD1 counterpart (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1B,C</xref>). Different electrostatic surfaces will confer different interaction specificities, a common feature among members of the DD superfamily, including the CARD subfamily.<fig-group><fig id="fig3" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.11692.010</object-id><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>Solution structure of RIP2 CARD and its complex with p75<sup>NTR</sup> DD.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Superposition of backbone heavy atoms of the 10 lowest-energy structures of human RIP2 CARD.

The C-terminal tail bound to α-helices H1, H5, and H6 of p75<sup>NTR</sup> DD, through both hydrophobic and charged interactions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3B</xref>). In our previous site-directed mutagenesis studies of the p75<sup>NTR</sup> DD, we had identified residues in helices H2 (Asp<sup>357</sup>, His<sup>361</sup>, and Glu<sup>365</sup>), H3 (Gln<sup>369</sup> and Glu<sup>371</sup>), H5 (Asp<sup>399</sup>), and H6 (Asp<sup>412</sup> and Glu<sup>415</sup>) as being critical for its interaction with RIP2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Charalampopoulos et al., 2012</xref>). We were pleased to note that all these residues mapped to the DD:CARD binding interface defined in our NMR structure of the complex (labeled red in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E,F</xref>). The NMR structure of the DD:CARD complex offered an opportunity to address the functional importance of residues in the RIP2 CARD. Co-immunoprecipitation experiments were performed in cells transfected with constructs of full-length p75<sup>NTR</sup> and RIP2, the latter carrying different point mutations in selected residues of the CARD. We found that individual substitution of interface residues Gln<sup>437</sup>, Asp<sup>467</sup>, Lys<sup>471</sup>, Ile<sup>496</sup>, Glu<sup>500</sup>, or Arg<sup>528</sup>, significantly diminished RIP2 interaction with p75<sup>NTR</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3G</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Differential binding of RhoGDI and RIP2 CARD to the p75<sup>NTR</sup> DD</title><p>Comparison of the DD interfaces used for binding to RhoGDI and RIP2 CARD showed that these shared partially overlapping binding sites on p75<sup>NTR</sup> DD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>), indicating that RIP2 and RhoGDI cannot bind to the p75<sup>NTR</sup> DD simultaneously due to steric hindrance. This is in agreement with our previous biochemical studies that identified overlapping epitopes required for the interaction of p75<sup>NTR</sup> DD with both RIP2 and RhoGDI (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Charalampopoulos et al., 2012</xref>). In order to better understand the hierarchical relationship of these interactions, we determined the binding affinities of the DD:RhoGDI and DD:CARD complexes by SPR. The <italic>K</italic><sub>d</sub> of RhoGDI binding to the p75<sup>NTR</sup> DD was 0.82 ± 0.3 μM, while the <italic>K</italic><sub>d</sub> of CARD binding to the DD was 4.67 ± 0.7 nM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B,C</xref>), indicating that RIP2 CARD binds with approximately 177-fold higher affinity than RhoGDI to the p75<sup>NTR</sup> DD.

Kinetic analyses revealed that CARD associates with the p75<sup>NTR</sup> DD with faster on-rate, and dissociates with slower off-rate, than RhoGDI (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl3">Table 3</xref>). The RIP2 CARD could still fold into a typical α-helical structure after deletion of the C-terminal tail (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s4">Figure 3—figure supplement 4A</xref>).

These data demonstrate that RhoGDI and RIP2 CARD compete for binding to the p75<sup>NTR</sup> DD and that RIP2 CARD can displace RhoGDI from the receptor. In order to test the functional significance of the antagonism between RIP2 and RhoGDI, we assessed the levels of RhoA-GTP, a measure of RhoA activation, in cells transfected with a p75<sup>NTR</sup> expression construct in the absence or presence of increasing concentrations of a RIP2 construct (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>).

Purified rat p75NTR DD has been shown to exist in either monomeric form or equilibrium between monomeric and dimeric forms depending on pH and counterion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Vilar et al., 2014</xref>). However, the complete assignment of the DD homodimer was not reported in that study. We also found that human p75<sup>NTR</sup> DD exists mainly in monomeric form in TRIS or HEPES buffer at pH 6.0–7.0, which were the buffer conditions used for structure determination of DD:RhoGDI and DD:CARD complexes. In phosphate buffer, however, we observed a new form of p75<sup>NTR</sup> DD as revealed by the appearance of a new set of cross peaks in the [<sup>1</sup>H-<sup>15</sup>N] HSQC spectrum (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1A,B</xref>). The set of cross peaks corresponding to monomeric DD was still visible, with nearly identical chemical shift but weaker intensity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1A</xref>), suggesting the coexistence of dimeric and monomeric DDs under these conditions. Dynamic lighter scattering (DLS) also indicated the formation of dimeric p75<sup>NTR</sup> DDs in the presence of phosphate ions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1C,D</xref>).

The p75<sup>NTR</sup> DD homodimer adopted a C2 symmetry (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A,B</xref>). A short C-terminal tail of 7 amino acids (Ser<sup>421</sup>-Val<sup>427</sup>) in each monomer remained disordered, similar to the DD:RhoGDI and DD:CARD complexes. The helical bundle, including the 3<sub>10</sub> helix, did not undergo significant structural change with an RMSD lower than 1.5 Å compared to the other complexes. The dimerization interface consisted of α-helices H2 and H3 as well as residues in the H1–H2 and H3–H4 loops. Dimerization involved both charge and hydrophobic interactions. The key residues in the dimer interface included Asp<sup>357</sup>, Arg<sup>360</sup>, Thr<sup>377</sup>, His<sup>378</sup>, Glu<sup>379</sup>, and Ala<sup>380</sup> (corresponding to Asp<sup>354</sup>, Arg<sup>358</sup>, Thr<sup>375</sup>, His<sup>376</sup>, Glu<sup>377</sup>, and Ala<sup>378</sup> in rat p75<sup>NTR</sup> DD). This is in agreement with previous site-directed mutagenesis and NMR titration studies of the rat p75<sup>NTR</sup> DD homodimer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Vilar et al., 2014</xref>) (red-labeled residues in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>). Cys<sup>381</sup> (homologous to Cys<sup>379</sup> in rat p75<sup>NTR</sup> DD) was also located in the dimerization interface but appeared in reduced form with a C<sup>β</sup> chemical shift of 26.5 ppm. The distance between Cys<sup>381</sup>S<sup>γ</sup> from each monomer was 6.7 ± 0.1 Å, that is, too long for the formation of a disulfide bond. The buried solvent accessible area in the p75<sup>NTR</sup> DD homodimer was 573 Å<sup>2</sup>, in line with the low affinity of the DD:DD interaction. We conclude that the two p75<sup>NTR</sup> DD protomers form a low-affinity, noncovalent homodimer in our structure.<fig-group><fig id="fig5" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.11692.017</object-id><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><title>Solution structure of the p75<sup>NTR</sup> DD homodimer.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Superposition of backbone heavy atoms of the 10 lowest-energy structures of the human p75<sup>NTR</sup> DD homodimer.

This is in agreement with the constitutive interaction of RhoGDI with the closed conformation of the receptor. On the other hand, the DD homodimer partially occluded the RIP2 CARD interaction surface (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>), indicating that interaction of RIP2 with p75<sup>NTR</sup> requires dissociation of the DD homodimer. We investigated whether the recruitment of RIP2 contributes to the separation of DDs triggered after neurotrophin binding to the receptor. This was done by taking real-time homo-FRET anisotropy measurements of DD:DD interaction in response to NGF in cells transfected with EGFP-tagged constructs of full length wild type p75<sup>NTR</sup> and a DD mutant deficient in RIP2 binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Charalampopoulos et al., 2012</xref>) as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Vilar et al., 2009</xref>). Application of NGF to cells expressing wild type p75<sup>NTR</sup> produced large oscillations of increased anisotropy at the cell membrane (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>), resulting in a positive net change averaged over a 15-min treatment compared to vehicle (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E</xref>). As anisotropy is inversely related to FRET, this behavior indicates ligand-triggered separation of receptor intracellular domains, as proposed earlier (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Vilar et al., 2009</xref>). We note that the oscillations observed here are unlikely to represent the synchronous behavior of ensembles of receptors, as their average period (2–3 min) would seem too slow to reflect real molecular dynamics. Importantly, the p75<sup>NTR</sup> construct carrying mutations in the CARD binding site (CBS mutant) produced very similar anisotropy changes after NGF treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D,E</xref>), indicating that recruitment of RIP2 is not required for DD separation in response to ligand binding to p75<sup>NTR</sup>. Finally, we note that the DD homodimer interface also overlapped with several residues involved in neurotrophin-mediated activation of JNK, caspase-3 and the apoptosis pathway (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6F</xref>) as identified in our previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Charalampopoulos et al., 2012</xref>). Thus, while the structure and biochemical properties of the p75<sup>NTR</sup> DD homodimer support the ligand-independent interaction of RhoGDI with the receptor, they also demonstrate that dissociation of the p75<sup>NTR</sup> DD homodimer is required for recruitment of RIP2 and for activation of the JNK/caspase-3 pathway in response to neurotrophins.<fig id="fig6" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.11692.019</object-id><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><title>Relationship between p75<sup>NTR</sup> DD dimer interface and sites of interaction with downstream effectors.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Surface presentation of p75<sup>NTR</sup> DD with homodimer interface colored in blue.

Although p75<sup>NTR</sup> contains a DD, which is required for downstream signaling, no intracellular p75<sup>NTR</sup> effectors containing canonical DDs have been identified. The study of DD signaling in p75<sup>NTR</sup> therefore addresses an unexplored dimension of the repertoire of interactions and activities in the DD superfamily. Homotypic interactions between DDs have been classified as type I, II, and III according to the interfaces involved (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Park, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Park et al., 2007b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Weber and Vincenz, 2001</xref>). Despite what might have been expected of homotypic interactions, all known interactions in the DD superfamily are asymmetric, that is, the interaction is mediated by different interfaces in each of the two interacting domains (e.g., Ia and Ib for type I). Remarkably, none of the binding surfaces in the p75<sup>NTR</sup> DD (or in RIP2 CARD) identified in this study show a close match to any of the six conserved surfaces that characterize classical type I, II, and III interactions in the DD superfamily. The p75<sup>NTR</sup> DD surface that binds RhoGDI is formed by residues in helices H1 and H6. A previous study had proposed helix 5 as a binding site to RhoGDI based on serial deletion analysis of the p75<sup>NTR</sup> DD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Yamashita and Tohyama, 2003</xref>). This conclusion is not supported by our solution structure of the DD:RhoGDI complex, in which H5 appears at the opposite side of the interface (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>), nor by previous structure–function studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Charalampopoulos et al., 2012</xref>). This discrepancy highlights some of the pitfalls in serial deletion studies that disregard the three-dimensional structures of proteins. The surface in the p75<sup>NTR</sup> DD that interacts with the CARD of RIP2 includes residues in helices H2, H3, and H6 plus residues in the H5–H6 loop. On the other side of this interaction, residues in helix H1 as well as the H3–H4 and H5–H6 loops form the binding surface on the CARD of RIP2. To the best of our knowledge, this p75<sup>NTR</sup> DD:RIP2 CARD complex represents the first structural characterization of an heterotypic interaction in the DD superfamily. Our solution structure of this complex also revealed an additional interaction between residues in the C-terminal half of helix H5 of the p75<sup>NTR</sup> DD and the C-terminal tail of RIP2, which extends beyond the RIP2 CARD. This additional contact confers approximately fivefold increased binding affinity between the two proteins. Finally, the interface that mediates the p75<sup>NTR</sup> DD homodimer involves residues located in helix H3 as well as the H1–H2 and H3–H4 loops. This surface is similar, but not identical, to the type IIIb surface, like the one identified in the DD of PIDD for interaction with RAIDD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Park et al., 2007b</xref>). Unlike the classical type IIIb surface, however, the DD:DD interaction in p75<sup>NTR</sup> makes extensive use of residues in the H3 helix, and the same surface in the two interacting DDs is used to form a symmetric dimer. Further studies will be required to determine whether the interactions identified here for the p75<sup>NTR</sup> DD are exceptions or else represent new types of interactions that are yet to be identified in other DD-containing proteins.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>A symmetric DD homodimer in p75<sup>NTR</sup></title><p>The solution structure of the p75<sup>NTR</sup> DD homodimer shows it is a symmetric, noncovalent dimer held together by low-affinity interactions involving residues in helix H3 and the H1–H2 and H3–H4 loops. The p75<sup>NTR</sup> DD dimer interface is in agreement with sites of interaction with downstream effectors identified by the structures reported here and in our previous site-directed mutagenesis studies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). This p75<sup>NTR</sup> DD dimer structure is also in accordance with a recent mutagenesis study that identified residues important for dimerization of rat p75<sup>NTR</sup> DD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Vilar et al., 2014</xref>), many of which are also implicated in our structure. On the other hand, our results do not support two crystallographic structures reported for the rat p75<sup>NTR</sup> DD homodimer that suggested this to be either a covalent symmetric dimer, held by a disulfide bond between Cys<sup>379</sup> residues, or a noncovalent asymmetric dimer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Qu et al., 2013</xref>). None of the currently available evidence derived from structural, mutagenesis, or functional studies appears to support those crystal structures. Nevertheless, we cannot at present rule out the possibility that p75<sup>NTR</sup> DDs may under certain circumstances form alternative oligomeric complexes through different interfaces. A recent study has suggested that p75<sup>NTR</sup> can form trimers in transfected cells based on the apparent molecular weights of p75<sup>NTR</sup> species in SDS/PAGE (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Anastasia et al., 2015</xref>). Our NMR studies of the p75<sup>NTR</sup> DD do not support such conclusion as we have not found any evidence for the existence of DD trimers in any of the conditions tested. Another recent study has used solution NMR spectroscopy to investigate the mobility of the transmembrane and intracellular domains of p75<sup>NTR</sup> incorporated into lipid–protein nanodisks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Mineev et al., 2015</xref>). These authors found a high level of flexibility in the juxtamembrane domain of p75<sup>NTR</sup>, an observation that we also reported in our earlier NMR studies of this domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Liepinsh, 1997</xref>), but they could not detect self-association of intracellular domains. However, it is unclear whether the lipid detergent used to form the lipid–protein nanodisks interacted with the p75<sup>NTR</sup> DD and prevented its dimerization. A few detergent molecules, too few to affect DD rotational correlation time, would be sufficient to hinder DD:DD interactions.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Competitive protein–protein interactions define the hierarchical activation of downstream pathways in p75<sup>NTR</sup> signaling</title><p>The mechanism underlying ligand-induced dissociation of RhoGDI from p75<sup>NTR</sup> has remained unclear. As neurotrophins induce the release of RhoGDI and the recruitment of RIP2, we have speculated that RIP2 may displace RhoGDI from binding sites in the p75<sup>NTR</sup> DD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Charalampopoulos et al., 2012</xref>). Our solution structures of the p75<sup>NTR</sup> DD in complex with RhoGDI and the RIP2 CARD lend experimental support to this notion by showing how steric clashes between the two effector proteins preclude their simultaneous binding to the p75<sup>NTR</sup> DD. SPR experiments indicated that RIP2 CARD binds with over 100-fold higher affinity to the p75<sup>NTR</sup> DD than RhoGDI, and 2D-NMR competition studies demonstrated that RIP2 CARD can in fact displace RhoGDI from the receptor. The functional significance of this relationship was evidenced by the ability of RIP2 to decrease p75<sup>NTR</sup>-mediated RhoA activation in a dose-dependent manner. Furthermore, the enhanced activation of the RhoA pathway observed in brain extracts of <italic>Rip2</italic> knockout mice suggests that RIP2 may also restrict activation of this pathway in vivo. These results demonstrate how a hierarchy of binding affinities dictates the differential interaction of downstream effectors with p75<sup>NTR</sup> and ultimately controls the logic of p75<sup>NTR</sup> signaling.</p></sec><sec id="s3-4"><title>A model for the early stages of p75<sup>NTR</sup> engagement with the RhoA and NF-kB pathways</title><p>p75<sup>NTR</sup> has been postulated to function as a “displacement factor” that releases RhoA from RhoGDI leading to RhoA activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Yamashita and Tohyama, 2003</xref>). This model has led to the idea that the p75<sup>NTR</sup> DD and RhoA may compete for binding to RhoGDI. On the other hand, biochemical experiments have shown that RhoA can associate with p75<sup>NTR</sup> through RhoGDI and the three proteins can be recovered together in co-immunoprecipitation assays (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Yamashita et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Yamashita and Tohyama, 2003</xref>), a result that would be incompatible with the displacement concept. Our structural studies show that the p75<sup>NTR</sup> DD and RhoA bind on opposites sides of the RhoGDI molecule, allowing the formation of a tripartite DD:RhoGDI:RhoA complex. Using a model of this complex and our solution structure of the p75<sup>NTR</sup> DD homodimer, we have constructed a model of the hexameric complex of these proteins (<xref ref-type="other" rid="media1">Video 1</xref>). This model retains the two fold symmetry of the DD homodimer, and accommodates all six components without any steric clashes. How can these interactions lead to RhoA activation? Our SPR experiments showed that association of RhoGDI with the p75<sup>NTR</sup> DD reduced its affinity for RhoA by 15-fold. Close comparison of RhoGDI structures in the complexes with either p75<sup>NTR</sup> DD or RhoA revealed local structural perturbations in RhoGDI (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>), suggesting a potential allosteric mechanism underlying the release and activation of RhoA upon RhoGDI biding to the receptor. Based on the present studies, we propose a model for the early stages of p75<sup>NTR</sup> engagement with the RhoGDI/RhoA and RIP2/NF-kB pathways based on differential binding affinities and competitive protein–protein interactions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). At the plasma membrane, the p75<sup>NTR</sup> forms a dimer held together by interactions between its DD and TM domains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>). Recruitment of the RhoGDI:RhoA complex brings RhoA close to the plasma membrane (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>). RhoGDI binding to the p75<sup>NTR</sup> DD weakens its interaction with RhoA, a lipid-modified protein, allowing it to equilibrate with the plasma membrane where it can be activated by membrane-associated guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Garcia-Mata et al., 2011</xref>). RhoA may thus be in equilibrium between the cell membrane and the RhoGDI:p75<sup>NTR</sup> complex, and the action of GEFs and GTPase-activating proteins (GAPs) may further contribute to the dynamics of this exchange (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>). Upon dissociation from p75<sup>NTR</sup>, for example, as a consequence of RIP2 recruitment in response to NGF binding, RhoGDI regains high affinity for RhoA, extracting it from the membrane and holding it back in the cytosol in an inactive state (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref>). This new view of the p75<sup>NTR</sup> DD in the activation of RhoA is in better agreement with the emerging role of RhoGDI as a general facilitator of small GTPase activity cycles. Recruitment of RIP2 to p75<sup>NTR</sup> ultimately leads to increased NF-kB activity by as yet unknown mechanisms. Another p75<sup>NTR</sup> interactor, TRAF6, is also a known regulator of the NF-kB pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Khursigara et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Ye et al., 1999</xref>). As TRAF6 has been shown to interact with the juxtamembrane region of p75<sup>NTR</sup>, but not with the DD, RIP2 and TRAF6 may be able to bind simultaneously to the receptor and together contribute to enhance NF-kB activity in response to neurotrophins.<media content-type="glencoe play-in-place height-250 width-310" id="media1" mime-subtype="mp4" mimetype="video" xlink:href="elife-11692-media1.mp4"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.11692.020</object-id><label>Video 1.</label><caption><title>Model of the hexameric complex between p75<sup>NTR</sup>, RhoGDI and RhoA(GDP).</title> <p>Animation around the two-fold symmetry axis of the hexameric p75<sup>NTR</sup> DD:RhoGDI:RhoA(GDP) complex. p75<sup>NTR</sup> DD appears in light brown, RhoGDI in cyan and RhoA in blue.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.11692.020">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.11692.020</ext-link></p></caption></media><fig id="fig7" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.11692.021</object-id><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><title>Competitive protein–protein interactions orchestrate coupling of p75<bold><sup>NTR</sup></bold> to the RhoGDI/RhoA and RIP2/NF-kB pathways.</title><p>Schematic drawing of a model for the coupling of p75<sup>NTR</sup> to the RhoGDI/RhoA and RIP2/NF-kB pathways based on the structural and biochemical studies presented above.

(<bold>B</bold>) RhoGDI (cyan) brings RhoA (dark purple) in proximity to the plasma membrane through its interaction with the DD of p75<sup>NTR</sup>. While the twofold symmetry axis of the DD:RhoGDI:RhoA hexametric complex is likely to be perpendicular to the plasma membrane, its relative orientation is hypothetical. RhoGDI binding to the p75<sup>NTR</sup> DD decreases its affinity for RhoA by 15-fold, and allows equilibration of RhoA with the plasma membrane, where it can be activated by GEFs. (<bold>C</bold>) Neurotrophin binding induces a conformational change in p75<sup>NTR</sup> resulting in the separation of its DDs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Vilar et al., 2009</xref>), exposing binding sites to downstream effectors that couple to the JNK/caspase-3 or NF-kB pathways, including RIP2. Recruitment of RIP2 to the p75<sup>NTR</sup> DD is mediated by the interaction of its CARD (green) with a binding surface that partially overlaps with that occupied by RhoGDI. As the binding affinity of the RIP2 CARD for the p75<sup>NTR</sup> DD is 100-fold higher than that of RhoGDI, the recruitment of RIP2 displaces RhoGDI from the receptor. Released from the DD, RhoGDI regains higher affinity for RhoA, extracting it from the membrane and holding it back in the cytosol.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.11692.021">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.11692.021</ext-link></p></caption><graphic xlink:href="elife-11692-fig7-v2.tif"/></fig></p></sec><sec id="s3-5"><title>Conclusions</title><p>The structural studies of DD signaling in p75<sup>NTR</sup> presented here uncovered novel heterotypic interactions not previously seen in other DD-containing complexes.

Your article has been favorably evaluated by John Kuriyan (Senior editor) and three reviewers, one of whom, David Ginty, is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors. The other two referees involved in the review process of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Mark Bothwell and Savvas Savvides.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary</p><p>The contribution by Lin et al. uses 3D NMR to elucidate structures and death domain binding interfaces of components of p75<sup>NTR</sup> signaling, including the DD domain of p75<sup>NTR</sup> itself, RhoGDI coupling p75<sup>NTR</sup> to RhoA activation, and RIP2 coupling p75<sup>NTR</sup> to NF-kB activation. The structures are consistent with this lab's prior mutational work identifying residues that are important for these binding interactions, and are combined with biophysical and cellular studies to propose a model for p75<sup>NTR</sup> signaling. Taken together with prior work from this lab, the present study offers, for the first time, a detailed and compelling model for p75<sup>NTR</sup> signaling. There is substantial additional novelty in the characterization of heterotypic complexes of death domains of different families.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>A major concern is that some key mechanistic conclusions in the manuscript are derived from a comparative study of binding affinities of the protein domains, and the mechanistic insights are derived from an SPR-based experimental approach that needs to be revised or at least validated in part by an orthogonal approach.</p><p>The strategy to immobilize p75<sup>NTR</sup>-DD and RhoA via amine coupling onto CM5 sensor chips for the binding studies via SPR introduces uncertainties about the reliability of the data obtained and the ensuing comparison of affinities. This is because the two proteins have lysine residues at or near the interaction interfaces involved in their complexes as revealed by the structural studies. Given that the coupling to CM5 sensor chips would largely occur via surface exposed lysine residues, any ensuing SPR data generated using such an approach is inherently unreliable as partial steric obstruction of available binding sites would compromise the kinetics and affinities of the interaction under study.</p><p>The authors appear to possess the necessary tools for readdressing their binding studies, given that they produced the relevant proteins for NMR studies. The Methods section implies, although it does not explicitly state, that recombinant p75<sup>NTR</sup>-DD and RhoA were produced as His-tagged proteins. If that is indeed the case immobilization approaches described in Wear and Wilkinshaw Analytical Biochemistry 371 (2007) 250-252 might provide a convenient alternative for at least repeating some key measurements. Otherwise, isothermal titration calorimetry might provide yet another tool for generating the necessary orthogonal information on affinities, at least for the strongest interactions in the study. Another approach, albeit experimentally more laborious, would be to produce N- or C-terminally biotinylated versions of the proteins of interest and use streptavidin biosensor chips to immobilize the proteins for SPR measurements.</p><p>Minor points (which need to be addressed in the text):</p><p>1) Why was RhoA-GDP-Mg<sup>2+</sup> used for the binding studies? What are the biological extrapolations from a complex involving RhoA bound by the product of GTP hydrolysis?</p><p>2) In the first paragraph of the subsection “Solution structure of the complex between the p75<sup>NTR</sup> DD and RIP2 CARD”, the authors cite a previous study reporting that the interaction between p75<sup>NTR</sup> and RIP2 is mediated by their DD and CARD domains, yet, in the first paragraph of the Discussion, the authors indicate that the present study is the first heterotypic interaction described in the DD superfamily. These statements are seemingly in contradiction. Certainly the present statement is the first structural characterization of such a complex.</p><p>3) p75<sup>NTR</sup> is somewhat unusual in that ligand binding terminates a constitutively active signaling pathway (RhoA). The first sentence of the Results indicates that the receptor signals through RhoA constitutively, but fails to make it clear that neurotrophin binding terminates this signaling (although they make this point later). To avoid confusing readers who lack familiarity with the p75<sup>NTR</sup> system, this point needs to be introduced earlier and more fully (in the Introduction and/or beginning of the Results).</p><p>4) The authors mention the wildly oscillatory FRET signal in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>, but they fail to comment on this further. The authors don't make it clear whether they think reflects a real biological phenomenon, or reflects a technical limitation of measurement of weak FRET signals. Synchronous oscillation of an ensemble of receptors seems implausible, so some comment is necessary.</p><p>5) The paper does not mention the other proteins that are recruited to the p75<sup>NTR</sup> intracellular domain in a neurotrophin-dependent manner (NRIF, TRAF6, etc.). We realize that little can be said at present about how those proteins might influence the death domain interactions described and a full discussion is beyond the scope of the paper, but we would appreciate a discussion of the implication of TRAF6 binding, at least, because of its importance for NF-kB signaling.</p><p>6) Data presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>: What were the concentrations used for each binding curve? It would be convenient for the reader to annotate each SPR binding curve with the corresponding concentrations of the flowed binding partner.</p><p>7) Data presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>: Why was this SPR experiment not done in kinetic mode? Please discuss this point.</p><p>8) The association 'on-rate' is actually ka and the so-called 'off-rate' should be denoted by kd, with k being a lower case letter and a and d as subscripts. The equilibrium dissociation constant Kd is denoted by a capital K and lower case d in the subscript.</p><p>9) Data presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s4">Figure 3—figure supplement 4</xref> (panel B). What was the concentration series used to obtain the reported kinetic binding data? What binding models did the authors use in SPR data fitting? Please state in each relevant figure legend.</p><p>10) Please replace 'sensogram' with 'sensorgram' throughout the manuscript (including the figure legends).</p><p>11) It would help the reader tremendously if the authors would come up with a uniform way of annotating the figures presenting binding data to illustrate schematically the geometry of the experiment. For instance, to show which binding partner was immobilized versus the one that was flowed.</p><p>12) The authors did not provide (structural) insights as to how the interaction of p75<sup>NTR</sup>-DD with RhoGDI would lower the affinity between RhoGDI and RhoA. Please discuss this point.</p><p>13) A general comment on all figures showing structural models: Please label the N- and C-termini of all models shown.</p><p>14) The methods pertaining to the preparation of the recombinant proteins used are not described in sufficient detail. Information on construct design and domain delineation needs to be provided as well as chromatographic elution profiles for the protein complexes used in the structural studies.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.11692.023</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>Essential revisions:</italic> </p><p><italic>A major concern is that some key mechanistic conclusions in the manuscript are derived from a comparative study of binding affinities of the protein domains, and the mechanistic insights are derived from an SPR-based experimental approach that needs to be revised or at least validated in part by an orthogonal approach.

These new measurements are now in the revised version of <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl2">Table 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figures 4B and 4C</xref>. We note that the new equilibrium Kd for interaction of RhoGDI to p75<sup>NTR</sup>-DD is virtually identical to the previous one that was derived from DD protein immobilized by amine coupling. The revised Kd for interaction of RIP2-CARD to p75<sup>NTR</sup>-DD is 1.69-fold lower than the previous one. This indicates that RIP2-CARD binds with approximately 177-fold higher affinity than RhoGDI to the p75<sub>NTR</sub> DD, result that is very similar to (in fact even larger difference than) the one reported previously using CM5 chips. These results fully support (in fact, strengthen) our mechanistic conclusions concerning competition between these two interactors for p75<sup>NTR</sup>-DD binding.</p><p>We note that the Kd for RhoGDI binding to RhoA that was reported in our manuscript (0.14 ± 0.01 µM) is very similar to the one previously published by other groups. For example, Tnimov et al. (2012) reported a Kd of 0.17 µM for this same interaction. Therefore, we are confident that this measurement is correct.</p><p><italic>Minor points (which need to be addressed in the text):</italic> </p><p><italic>1) Why was RhoA-GDP-Mg<sup>2+</sup> used for the binding studies? What are the biological extrapolations from a complex involving RhoA bound by the product of GTP hydrolysis?</italic> </p><p>RhoGDI binds and sequesters RhoA in the inactive, i.e. GDP-loaded, state. Although GTP-loaded RhoA is also able to bind RhoGDI in vitro, the binding affinity of this complex is much weaker and its lifetime much shorter compared to the RhoGDI:RhoA-GDP-Mg<sup>2+</sup> complex. RhoA-GDP-Mg<sup>2+</sup> is therefore more suitable for binding studies with RhoGDI protein. In cells, a stable cytosolic pool of GDP-loaded RhoA (inactive form) is largely maintained (or chaperoned) by RhoGDI. In response to specific signals, release from RhoGDI and insertion in the membrane leads to RhoA activation (GTP-loading). Deactivation by GAPs allows GDP-loaded RhoA to be extracted from the membrane by RhoGDI, thus resetting the cycle.</p><p><italic>2) In the first paragraph of the subsection “Solution structure of the complex between the p75<sup>NTR</sup> DD and RIP2 CARD”, the authors cite a previous study reporting that the interaction between p75<sup>NTR</sup> and RIP2 is mediated by their DD and CARD domains, yet, in the first paragraph of the Discussion, the authors indicate that the present study is the first heterotypic interaction described in the DD superfamily. These statements are seemingly in contradiction. Certainly the present statement is the first structural characterization of such a complex.</italic> </p><p>Point taken. Although the previous study did not used purified proteins, it did already indicate that CARD and DD are sufficient for binding. We have changed this sentence to mean that our present study is the first structural characterization of a heterotypic interaction in the DD superfamily.</p><p><italic>3) p75<sup>NTR</sup> is somewhat unusual in that ligand binding terminates a constitutively active signaling pathway (RhoA). The first sentence of the Results indicates that the receptor signals through RhoA constitutively, but fails to make it clear that neurotrophin binding terminates this signaling (although they make this point later). To avoid confusing readers who lack familiarity with the p75<sup>NTR</sup> system, this point needs to be introduced earlier and more fully (in the Introduction and/or beginning of the Results).</italic> </p><p>We have followed this advice and introduced this concept earlier in the text of the revised manuscript (Results, first paragraph).</p><p><italic>4) The authors mention the wildly oscillatory FRET signal in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>, but they fail to comment on this further. The authors don't make it clear whether they think reflects a real biological phenomenon, or reflects a technical limitation of measurement of weak FRET signals. Synchronous oscillation of an ensemble of receptors seems implausible, so some comment is necessary.</italic> </p><p>The oscillations observed may indeed reflect a technical limitation of the measurement of weak FRET signals, as suggested by the reviewers. On the other hand, we do think that synchronous oscillation of ensembles of receptors is in fact possible, but this is unlikely what is being detected here, as the average period of these oscillations (2-3 min) would seem too slow to reflect real molecular dynamics which usually are much faster. We have clarified this point in the relevant section of the text (Results, last paragraph).</p><p><italic>5) The paper does not mention the other proteins that are recruited to the p75<sup>NTR</sup> intracellular domain in a neurotrophin-dependent manner (NRIF, TRAF6, etc.). We realize that little can be said at present about how those proteins might influence the death domain interactions described and a full discussion is beyond the scope of the paper, but we would appreciate a discussion of the implication of TRAF6 binding, at least, because of its importance for NF-kB signaling.</italic> </p><p>TRAF6 has been reported to interact with the juxtamembrane region of the intracellular domain of p75<sup>NTR</sup>, but not with its death domain. It is difficult at present to speculate on the possible implications of that interaction for the mechanisms described in the present study, which focus on the death domain. It is possible that such interactions are independent and non-overlapping. RIP2 has been shown to be polyubiquitinated (e.g. Hasegawa et al., 2008 EMBO J. 27:373–83 and Bertrand et al., 2011 PLoS ONE 6, e22356) and we are at present investigating the possible ubiquitination of RIP2 after its association with p75<sup>NTR</sup>. As TRAF6 has ubiquitin ligase activity, there might be a biochemical connection between these two p75<sup>NTR</sup> effectors. We have included one sentence in the Discussion to highlight this possibility (subsection “A model for the early stages of p75<sup>NTR</sup> engagement with the RhoA and NF-kB pathways).</p><p><italic>6) Data presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>: What were the concentrations used for each binding curve? It would be convenient for the reader to annotate each SPR binding curve with the corresponding concentrations of the flowed binding partner.</italic> </p><p>The concentrations used have now been indicated on the SPR curves.</p><p><italic>7) Data presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>: Why was this SPR experiment not done in kinetic mode? Please discuss this point.</italic> </p><p>Due to weak binding affinity of RhoGDI to p75<sup>NTR</sup> DD, it was difficult to apply a simple kinetic model to fit the data and get a Kd for binding of the p75<sup>NTR</sup> DD:RhoGDI complex to RhoA. But it was possible to do this through steady state analysis. As we wanted to make a direct comparison between <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2C and 2D</xref>, both were done in steady-state mode. We note that the Kd obtained here for the interaction between RhoGDI and RhoA is consistent with previously published results, as indicated above and in the text of our manuscript.</p><p><italic>8) The association 'on-rate' is actually ka and the so-called 'off-rate' should be denoted by kd, with k being a lower case letter and a and d as subscripts. The equilibrium dissociation constant Kd is denoted by a capital K and lower case d in the subscript.</italic> </p><p>Thanks. We have changed these accordingly.</p><p><italic>9) Data presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s4">Figure 3—figure supplement 4</xref> (panel B). What was the concentration series used to obtain the reported kinetic binding data? What binding models did the authors use in SPR data fitting? Please state in each relevant figure legend.</italic> </p><p>We have now indicated all the concentrations in the respective SPR curves. One binding site model was used for SPR data fitting. This has now been indicated in the figure legends and Methods section.</p><p><italic>10) Please replace 'sensogram' with 'sensorgram' throughout the manuscript (including the figure legends).</italic> </p><p>We have replaced these accordingly.</p><p><italic>11) It would help the reader tremendously if the authors would come up with a uniform way of annotating the figures presenting binding data to illustrate schematically the geometry of the experiment. For instance, to show which binding partner was immobilized versus the one that was flowed.</italic> </p><p>We have revised these figures and included the schematics requested.</p><p><italic>12) The authors did not provide (structural) insights as to how the interaction of p75<sup>NTR</sup>-DD with RhoGDI would lower the affinity between RhoGDI and RhoA. Please discuss this point.</italic> </p><p>Direct structural insights into this matter would require actual experimental determination of the tripartite DD:RhoGDI:RhoA complex and its comparison to the RhoGDI:RhoA complex. In the absence of this structure, we have examined changes in the RhoGDI structure when in complex with either P75<sup>NTR</sup> DD or RhoA. As mentioned in the text of our manuscript (and documented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>), this revealed local structural perturbations in RhoGDI upon binding to the DD compared to RhoA. Based on this analysis, we have suggested in the Discussion of our manuscript a potential allosteric mechanism by which small but detectable structural changes in RhoGDI elicited upon binding to the p75<sup>NTR</sup> DD contribute to the release of RhoA. It is possible that other processes, such as RhoGDI phosphorylation, may also contribute. At this point, and in the absence of additional structural information, we consider that the current discussion of this point is adequate.</p><p><italic>13) A general comment on all figures showing structural models: Please label the N- and C-termini of all models shown.</italic> </p><p>We have labeled all the N- and C-termini in the figures.</p><p><italic>14) The methods pertaining to the preparation of the recombinant proteins used are not described in sufficient detail. Information on construct design and domain delineation needs to be provided as well as chromatographic elution profiles for the protein complexes used in the structural studies.</italic> </p><p>We have included additional information in the Methods section with details on construct design and delineation of protein domains. Protein complexes were prepared by mixing individual purified proteins at different ratios. We did not use gel filtration to purify the complexes. Chromatographic elution profiles are usually used for complexes of strong binding affinity, it is not suitable to define complexes of weak binding affinity. The binding affinities of DD:RhoGDI and DD homodimer complexes are too weak to display distinct dimer peaks in gel filtration chromatography. Although the affinity of the DD:CARD complex is stronger, the special conditions used for its formation (i.e. pure water) are not suitable for gel filtration which requires at least 150 mM salt in the running buffer to prevent non-specific binding to the matrix. This has now been clarified in the text of the revised manuscript (subsection “Sample preparation”).</p></body></sub-article></article>
