processing. Multiple sites of alternative splicing within a single gene exponentially increase the number of possible spliced isoforms, with most human genes currently estimated to express at least ten. To understand the mechanisms underlying these complex isoform expression patterns, methods are needed that faithfully maintain long-range exon connectivity information in individual RNA molecules. In this study, we describe SeqZip, a methodology that uses RNA-templated DNA–DNA ligation to retain and compress connectivity between distant sequences within single RNA molecules. Using this assay, we test proposed coordination between distant sites of alternative exon utilization in mouse <italic>Fn1</italic>, and we characterize the extraordinary exon diversity of <italic>Drosophila melanogaster Dscam1</italic>.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.03700.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.03700.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.03700.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>A flow chart can show how an outcome can be achieved from a particular start point by breaking down an activity into a list of possible steps. Often, a flow chart contains several alternative steps, not all of which are taken every time the flow chart is used. The same can be said of genes, which are biological instructions that often contain many options within their DNA sequences.</p><p>Proteins—which perform many roles in cells—are built following the instructions contained in genes. First, the DNA sequence of the gene is copied. This produces a molecule of ribonucleic acid (RNA), which is able to move around the cell to find the machinery that can use the genetic information to make a protein. Genes and their RNA copies contain instructions with more steps—called exons—than are necessary to make a working protein, so extra exons are removed (‘spliced’) from the RNA copies. Different combinations of exons can be removed, so splicing can make different versions of the RNA called isoforms. These allow a single gene to build many different proteins. In fruit flies, for example, the different exons of the gene <italic>Dscam1</italic> can be spliced into one of 38,016 unique RNA isoforms.</p><p>Current technology only allows researchers to deduce the sequence of RNA molecules by combining sequences recorded from short fragments of the molecule. However, before splicing, RNA molecules tend to be much longer than this, so this restricts our understanding of the RNA isoforms found in cells. Here, Roy et al. devised and tested a new method called SeqZip to solve this problem.</p><p>SeqZip uses short fragments of DNA called ligamers that can only stick to the sections of RNA that will remain after the molecule has been spliced. After splicing, the ligamers can be stuck together to make a DNA replica of the spliced RNA. The end product is at least 49 times shorter than the original RNA, so it is easier to sequence. In addition, the combinations of the ligamers in the DNA replica show which exons of a specific gene are kept and which ones are spliced out.</p><p>To test the method, Roy et al. studied a mouse gene that has six RNA isoforms. SeqZip reduced the length of the RNA by five times and made it possible to measure how frequently the different isoforms naturally arise. Roy et al. also used SeqZip to work out which isoforms of the <italic>Dscam1</italic> gene are used at different stages in the life of fruit fly larvae. SeqZip can provide insights into how complex organisms like flies, mice, and humans have evolved with relatively few—a little over 20,000—genes in their genomes.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.03700.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.03700.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author keywords</title><kwd>ligation</kwd><kwd>Dscam1</kwd><kwd>RNA-templated</kwd><kwd>isoform</kwd><kwd>alternative splicing</kwd><kwd>fibronectin</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>D. melanogaster</italic></kwd><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health (NIH)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>GM62862</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Zamore</surname><given-names>Phillip D</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health (NIH)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>GM067842</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Olson</surname><given-names>Sara</given-names></name><name><surname>Graveley</surname><given-names>Brenton R</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funder had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.3</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>SeqZip is a new DNA ligation-based method to condense and maintain exon connectivity information within individual RNA molecules, which can provide new insights into alternative splicing.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>One of the most important drivers of metazoan gene expression is the ability to produce multiple mRNA isoforms from a single gene. Around 58% of <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> genes and &gt;95% of human genes produce more than one transcript (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Pan et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Wang et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Brown et al., 2014</xref>), with most human genes expressing 10 or more distinct isoforms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Djebali et al., 2012</xref>). Alternative promoter use, alternative splicing, and alternative polyadenylation all contribute to isoform diversity. In genes with multiple alternative transcription start and/or pre-mRNA processing sites, their combinatorial potential exponentially increases the number of possible products, with some human genes predicted to express &gt;100 mRNA isoforms. In <italic>D. melanogaster</italic>, the number of isoforms observed per gene correlates with open reading frame length, suggesting that isoform complexity is a function of transcript length (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Brown et al., 2014</xref>). The current record holder in this regard is <italic>Dscam1</italic>, in which four regions of mutually exclusive cassette exons combine to generate a remarkable 38,016 distinct &gt;7000 nt mRNAs, each encoding a unique protein isoform (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Schmucker et al., 2000</xref>).</p><p>In <italic>Dscam1</italic>, the four regions of mutually exclusive cassette exon splicing are separated by one to eight constitutive exons. This feature of multiple alternative splicing regions separated by constitutive exons is shared by more than a quarter of human genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Fededa et al., 2005</xref>). In many cases, these regions are separated by &gt;500 nts, the current limit for contiguous sequence output on most deep sequencing platforms. Further, high-throughput sequencing of RNA (RNA-Seq) generally requires its reverse transcription, with the processivity of available reverse transcriptases (RTs) limiting even single molecule cDNA sequencing (e.g., Pacific Biosciences) to &lt;2500 nt (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Sharon et al., 2013</xref>). Thus, existing high-throughput technologies cannot readily retain connectivity information between very distant sequences within individual mRNA molecules. Instead, full-length transcripts must be inferred by piecing together multiple short overlapping reads (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Garber et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Grabherr et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Haas et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Boley et al., 2014</xref>). For widely separated regions of alternative exon use, this loss of connectivity significantly limits our abilities to catalog isoform abundance and understand the mechanisms underlying alternative isoform generation.</p><p>Here, we describe SeqZip, a method for profiling multiple distant (&gt;1000 nt) sites of alternative splicing within individual RNA molecules. SeqZip uses sets of DNA oligonucleotides termed ‘ligamers’. Each ∼40–60 nt ligamer hybridizes to the 5′ and 3′ ends of a single alternatively spliced exon or the beginning and end of a large block of constitutively included exons, looping out the sequences in between. These loops can be hundreds to thousands of nucleotides long. Juxtaposed ligamers hybridized to single RNA molecules are then joined by enzymatic ligation with T4 RNA ligase 2 (Rnl2) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Ho and Shuman, 2002</xref>). The resultant DNA ligation products both capture the intramolecular connectivity among exons of interest and compress the sequence space necessary to identify those exons. Exon connectivity is subsequently decoded by assessing the sizes or sequences of the ligation products. Because SeqZip does not include an RT step and is therefore not subject to RT processivity and template-switching limitations, it can be used to assess intramolecular connectivity between regions separated by thousands of nucleotides. Further, relative ligation product abundance accurately reports spliced isoform abundance in the original sample. As a proof-of-principle, we here used SeqZip to test proposed connectivity relationships among alternatively spliced exons in mouse <italic>Fibronectin</italic> (<italic>Fn1)</italic> and to define the molecular diversity of fly <italic>Dscam1</italic>.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>A reverse transcription-free method to assess sequence connectivity</title><p>The general idea of SeqZip is schematized in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>.

(<bold>D</bold>) After the regions of complementary are trimmed for Tm and length, the sequences are BLATted against the target genome to ensure correct transcript and exon targeting.

If the intervening sequences are not intact, no product is obtained (X). Thus, SeqZip can be used to monitor the integrity of long RNAs. ‘Multi-site SNP detection’ is described in the ‘Discussion’ section ‘SeqZip uses and limitations’. The panel depicting ‘Introduction of destruction sequences’ illustrates how short DNA oligos targeting ligamer-specific barcodes between hybridization regions (in this case ‘B’) could be useful in the selective cleavage and destruction of particular ligation products. In the example shown, the ABC ligamer product would be cleaved with a restriction enzyme targeting the double-stranded oligo:barcode, while DEF would be left intact for downstream applications. ‘Sequence discovery using combined SeqZip and Reverse Transcription’ illustrates 5′ end sequence discovery using Cap Analysis of Gene Expression combined with SeqZip ligamers. This allows one to investigate novel 5′ end sequence connections to distant 3′ sequences. ‘Multi-site AS QPCR analysis’ is also described in the ‘Discussion’ section ‘SeqZip uses and limitations’. The essential benefit over a conventional QPCR workflow is that SeqZip compresses distant sequences into a QPCR-friendly amplicon size and reduces the number of required primers.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.03700.005">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.03700.005</ext-link></p></caption><graphic xlink:href="elife-03700-fig1-figsupp2-v2.tif"/></fig></fig-group></p><p>To find a suitable ligase for SeqZip, we tested the ability of several other commercially available enzymes to ligate four or five 5′ <sup>32</sup>P-radiolabeled 20-nt DNA oligos hybridized to adjacent positions on either DNA or RNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>).

To test the ability of Rnl2 to ligate these species, we designed four different 26 nt ligamers to loop out various lengths of a 307 nt transcript (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). Each 26 nt ligamer contained 10 nt of complementarity on either side of the loop, with a 6 nt spacer opposite the loop. The four ligamers—individually, pairwise, in threes, or as a complete set—were annealed to the template RNA and incubated with Rnl2. Ligation products were only observed when ligamers bound to adjacent RNA sequences; four-way ligation products were obtained only when all ligamers were present. Thus, ligamers designed to loop out various lengths of a template RNA can be used to condense by more than twofold the information required to assess RNA connectivity—244 nt of the target RNA was condensed to a 104 nt DNA.

The original suggestion that an upstream splicing decision can affect a downstream splicing decision came from analysis of the EDA and V regions where it was reported that EDA exclusion promotes use of the promoter-proximal 3′ splice site (‘120’) in the V region (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Fededa et al., 2005</xref>). The EDA and V regions are separated by six constitutively included exons, comprising 813 nt; thus, RT-PCR products including the EDA and V regions range from 1 to 1.6 kbp (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>). Both the overall length of the RT-PCR products and the extensive region of similar sequence identity in the middle that can promote template switching (see below) confound RT-PCR analysis of the six possible EDA and V exon combinations. In comparison, our SeqZip ligation products were &gt;fivefold smaller (139–318 nt; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D,E</xref>), and they contained no intervening region of extensive nucleotide identity.

That study also analyzed mice heterozygous for the modified locus (+/−) and the wild-type parental strain (wt/wt). We obtained immortalized mouse embryonic fibroblasts generated from all four mouse lines and performed SeqZip analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E,F</xref>). Three different ligamer pools allowed us to analyze each region in isolation (individual pools A and V) or both regions together (combination pool A + V) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>). EDA and V isoform ratios determined from low cycle, radioactive PCR band intensities of the A and V pool ligation products (SeqZip: Observed) were used to calculate expected EDA:V isoform abundances, assuming no interdependence between the two regions (SeqZip: Expected). We also generated cDNAs by low-cycle RT-PCR and sequenced them on a Pacific Biosciences RSII instrument (PacBio:Observed), a single molecule platform with sufficient read length to maintain connectivity between the EDA and V regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Sharon et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>In both the SeqZip and PacBio data sets, constitutive EDA inclusion or exclusion was as expected in the +/+ and −/− cells, respectively.

Regardless, neither SeqZip nor PacBio yielded any evidence for an effect of EDA inclusion or exclusion on V region splice site choice.

Long regions of sequence homology promote template switching during both RT and PCR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Judo et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Houseley and Tollervey, 2010</xref>); this can generate novel isoforms not originally present in the biological sample. SeqZip can both dramatically reduce these regions of sequence of identity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>) and introduce new exon-specific codes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>). Thus, in addition to maintaining connectivity information, SeqZip both compresses sequence length and increases sequence heterogeneity, thereby greatly decreasing the potential for template switching compared to cDNAs created by standard RT or circularized cDNA approaches.</p><p>Prior to our development of SeqZip, we had attempted to use a RT-PCR-based triple-read sequencing method to determine exon connectivity between <italic>Dscam1</italic> alternative splicing regions 4, 6, and 9 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1B</xref>, ‘Materials and methods’). To measure the extent of template switching, we generated four RNA transcripts corresponding to distinct isoforms. As expected, this RT-based method detected many novel transcript isoforms containing exon combinations not present in the four input transcripts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1B</xref>). These template-switched isoforms represented 34–55% of the isoforms detected, with many being significantly more abundant than one or more of the input isoforms.</p><p>A similar circularized cDNA method, CAMSeq, has also been used to assess <italic>Dscam1</italic> exon connectivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Sun et al., 2013</xref>). In light of the high rate of template switching in our triple-read sequencing approach, we reexamined the published CAMSeq control data to assess the extent of template-switching events (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1B</xref>). Indeed, template-switched isoforms were present in the CAMSeq data, with many template-switched isoforms being more abundant than the low abundance input isoforms. Moreover, we detected 5386–5914 additional isoforms whose presence could not be explained by either the composition of the 8 input RNA isoforms or by template switching. Thus, while CAMSeq was a clear improvement over both previous linear RT-PCR-based approaches and our triple-read sequencing approach, template-switching artifacts remained a substantial problem.</p><p>By eliminating RT and using exon-specific barcodes to ensure unambiguous isoform assignment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>), SeqZip should greatly reduce template switching. To measure this directly, we mixed together three different in vitro-transcribed <italic>Dscam1</italic> isoforms in the presence of total RNA from a mouse hepatoma cell line (Hepa 1–6c; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>). This mixture was then divided into two separate ligation reactions, each containing a complete 97 ligamer pool that differed only in the 7 nt ligamer barcode assigned to two exons in each cluster (* in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>). Following ligation, the differentially coded samples were mixed together, subjected to PCR, and sequenced on the MiSeq platform (on which paired-end reads can cover a total of 500 nts). Of the 50,475 reads obtained in these control reactions, none were indicative of template switching (i.e., no ligation product contained both pool 1 and pool 2 barcodes; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>). Moreover, when the same differential coding approach was applied to <italic>Drosophila</italic> S2 cell poly(A)-selected RNA, just 17 of 111,242 reads (0.015%) corresponded to template-switched isoforms (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1B</xref>).

One potential explanation for this effect is promoter-dependent polymerase speed: slow RNA synthesis favors inclusion of cassette exons with weak splicing signals, while fast RNA synthesis favors their exclusion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Fededa et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Dujardin et al., 2014</xref>). This polymerase speed effect does not necessitate any dependence of a downstream splicing decision on an upstream decision—the multiple sites of alternative splicing can be independently but similarly influenced by polymerase speed. In this case, although alternative splicing decisions in different regions within a transcript might correlate with one another, they would not depend on one another.</p><p>Neither oligonucleotide microarrays nor short high-throughput sequencing reads preserve long-range exon connectivity within individual mRNA molecules. Thus, neither approach is able to unambiguously distinguish between dependent coordination, wherein alternative processing at an upstream site causes alternative processing changes at a downstream site, and independent coordination, wherein multiple regulated exons are simply subject to similar external influences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Calarco et al., 2007</xref>). SeqZip, however, does preserve single molecule connectivity, so is perfectly suited to investigate coordination mechanisms. Our proof-of-principle SeqZip experiments with the mouse <italic>Fn1</italic> gene revealed no evidence of dependent coordination between the two regions of alternative splicing we examined (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>).

Single molecule methods capable of longer reads (e.g., Pacific Biosciences) have limited read depths, making it difficult to fully analyze transcripts expressed over many orders of magnitude. Finally, many <italic>Dscam1</italic> exon variants arose from exon-duplication events, so their sequences are highly similar (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Lee et al., 2010</xref>).

Using pools of 97 individual ligamers targeting every exon in clusters 4, 6, and 9, we analyzed <italic>Dscam1</italic> diversity in S2 cells, 4–6 hr, and 14–16 hr embryos.

This application is similar to the multiple-exon-skipping detection assay (MESDA) used to study <italic>SMN1</italic> and <italic>SMN2</italic> isoform expression in different Batten disease cell lines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Singh et al., 2012</xref>). MESDA measured the relative expression of &gt;6 <italic>SMN</italic> isoforms and even identified a novel isoform, providing a useful tool for researchers working on spinal muscular atrophy. Measurement of <italic>SMN</italic> isoforms could also be performed using SeqZip, with several advantages over MESDA including reduction in amplicon size, lower propensity for template switching during amplification, and no RT step.</p><p>One limitation of SeqZip is the number of ligamers required to create a ligation product. To achieve necessary sequence specificity, ligamers need to be 40–60 nt. Current illumina-based sequencing platforms can read ∼500 nt of contiguous sequence. Thus, ∼8–12 ligamers is currently the upper limit for high-throughput sequencing analyses. Although our quantitative analysis of <italic>CD45</italic> showed no difference in ligation efficiency for isoforms requiring two ligations compared to those requiring five (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>), other transcripts could theoretically differ. Because exon-excluded isoforms require fewer ligations, as the number of sites being examined grows, it is possible that detection of shorter (i.e., exon-excluded) transcripts will be favored. Thus, if a SeqZip experiment requires different numbers of ligation events for different RNA isoforms, it is crucial to perform the necessary controls to ensure quantitative detection of all desired isoforms. In our experiments, we were able to demonstrate accurate isoform abundance reporting over &gt;4 orders of magnitude for <italic>Dscam</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>). At the low end of this range, however, near-cognate ligation events began to be problematic. As for sensitivity, we have been able to obtain detectable ligation products from as few as ∼900 (5 × 10<sup>−17</sup> M; 0.05 fM) target RNA molecules (data not shown). Because the limit of detection for SeqZip is likely more than a single molecule, lack of detection of a particular isoform should only be interpreted as that isoform being below the SeqZip detection limit. Nonetheless, when properly controlled, SeqZip is a sensitive quantitative method for assessing complex isoform abundance patterns over a wide dynamic range.</p><p>The easiest ‘complex’ form of alternative splicing for SeqZip analysis was <italic>Dscam1</italic>, where alternative processing is limited to mutually exclusive exons (i.e., all spliced isoforms contain the same number of exons, and therefore, ligamer ligation events). However, many mammalian transcripts have more varied alternative splicing, including alternative 5′ and 3′ splice site usage and intron retention. Ligamer design against these types of alternative splicing quickly becomes unwieldy. For example, characterization of alternative transcriptional start and polyadenylation sites requires different terminal ligamers for each different start or polyadenylation site. Thus, while we were able to simultaneously assess two different types of alternative splicing in <italic>Fn1</italic> (exon inclusion/exclusion and alternative 3′ splice sites), other mammalian genes displaying even more numerous forms of alternative processing (e.g., <italic>Kcnma1</italic>) would require significantly more complicated ligamer pools. Indeed, there may be genes with splicing patterns that cannot be readily interrogated with a single ligamer pool capable of generating a unique ligation product for every possible isoform. In such cases, analysis using multiple ligamer pools each targeting a select region may still be advantageous for estimating splicing frequencies compared to more traditional methods like quantitative RT-PCR. To assist readers in designing their own ligamer pools, we have included a schematic of our ligamer design process for mouse <italic>Fn1</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3-data">Supplementary file 3</xref>). For highly complex pools, this process can be automated by writing a simple Python, Perl, or R script specific to the problem being addressed.</p><p>One potential future application of SeqZip is the detection of multiple single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) on a single molecule of a long RNA. By placing the ligation sites over each SNP, one could take advantage of the requirement by Rnl2 for complete complementarity at a ligation junction; mismatches would inhibit efficient ligamer joining (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Landegren et al., 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chauleau and Shuman, 2013</xref>). Further, any sequence can be placed in between the two regions of target complementarity within each ligamer. Therefore, sequences for custom priming, restriction digestion, recombination, etc, can be introduced, allowing for quantification or subsequent manipulation of ligation products. Analysis of ligation products can even be multiplexed, allowing for simultaneous generation and analysis using internal controls. These applications and others are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>.</p><p>As demonstrated by our investigation of <italic>Dscam1</italic>, SeqZip ligation products can be analyzed by high-throughput sequencing via incorporation of platform-appropriate priming sequences in the terminal ligamers or PCR primers or in the spacer sequences of internal ligamers. SeqZip could also be used to assess the integrity of very long RNAs, such as piRNA-precursor transcripts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Li et al., 2013</xref>) or mRNAs with extended 3′ UTRs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Wang and Yi, 2013</xref>).

PCR products were purified (28104; Qiagen, QIAquick PCR Purification Kit) and quantified using a Bioanalyzer 2100 (Agilent) and High-Sensitivity DNA chip. Samples were mixed and submitted for sequencing on the MiSeq instrument using the paired-end 250 nt read option. Sequencing data are available at Short Read Archive accession SRP043516.</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>MiSeq read analysis</title><p>All Dscam1 SeqZip products were shorter than 400 nt; therefore, paired-end MiSeq 250 nt reads contained overlapping 3′ sequences. Using these overlapping sequences, paired reads were combined into one sequence using the Paired-End Assembler (pear, v. 0.8.1) and default options (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Zhang et al., 2014</xref>). An index of all possible Dscam1 ligamer combinations was created using a single PERL script that permuted all possible ligamer combinations with correct 5′ to 3′ exons 4, 6, and 9 ligamer arrangements. Paired MiSeq reads were aligned against this index using Bowtie2 v. 2.1.0 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Langmead and Salzberg, 2012</xref>) in the very-sensitive-local mode and constrained using no-discordant to only look for reads where both pairs aligned to the same isoform. Using the SAMtools (v. 0.1.19) software package (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Li et al., 2009</xref>), alignments were further filtered for alignments containing quality 31 and above (-q 31) and read counts per isoform extracted. Count analysis was performed and graphs generated using R (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">R Development Core Team, 2008</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>Differential expression of <italic>Dscam1</italic> isoforms</title><p>For differential expression analysis, we treated each <italic>Dscam1</italic> isoform as though it was its own gene. The percent use of individual exons for each cluster (4, 6, and 9) was determined. Expected use of all possible combinations of 4:6, 4:9, 6:9, and 4:6:9 was calculated by multiplying the percentages of individual exon use. Expected use was compared to observed use of the equivalent combination. The DESeq differential gene expression R package (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Anders and Huber, 2010</xref>) was used to identify isoforms whose observed and expected abundances were ‘differential’.</p></sec><sec id="s4-10"><title>Determining sequencing similarity of <italic>Dscam1</italic> sequences</title><p>Endogenous <italic>Dscam1</italic> sequences were obtained from genomic build DM3 using BEDTools (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Quinlan and Hall, 2010</xref>). All possible <italic>Dscam1</italic> isoform sequences between exons 4 and 10 were assembled using a PERL script. Five hundred random isoforms were obtained and aligned using TCOFFEE (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Di Tommaso et al., 2011</xref>) in the Jalview package (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Waterhouse et al., 2009</xref>). Consensus scores of alignments were exported and graphed in R. The same analysis was performed on <italic>Dscam1</italic> ligation products, except ligamer sequences were used in place of endogenous exonic sequences.</p></sec><sec id="s4-11"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>Error bars represent the standard error of the mean of experimental replicates.

Your article has been favorably evaluated by Aviv Regev (Senior editor), a Reviewing editor, and three reviewers.</p><p>Roy and colleagues present a new method for the assessment of complex alternative splicing systems. Most current methods for profiling the expressed alternatively spliced isoforms of a gene use short read RNAseq to assess the linkage of individual exons and thus require different positions of alternative splicing within a transcript to be examined independently. This is a problem for assembling the correct set of complete mRNAs from a gene as information on the combinatorial relationships and possible coregulation of distant exons is lost, although these relationships can frequently be deduced by statistical inference. The new method, “SeqZip”, uses oligo ligation directed by the mRNA template to report on exon-exon joints present in the mRNA and to condense distant regions of splice variation into a much shorter sequences assayable by sequencing or simply by size. The method is clever and the biochemistry is very well done, but no new biological insights are presented. The interest here is in the technology and the widespread need for such an assay. However, as a methods paper the study has several failings that need to be addressed.</p><p>Major points:</p><p>1) From the data presented, it is not clear how well a ligation event for an oligo pair will linearly report on a particular exon-exon joint when the pair is part of a complex set of ligamers. This has several complications.</p><p>A) From <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>, it appears that increasing the total number of ligation events decreases the efficiency of product generation. This will lead to a favoring of exon skipping events in the assay. In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>, the authors compare the exon inclusion ratios of <italic>CD45</italic> measured by RT/PCR and SeqZip and find that they are similar. However, RT/PCR is known to be biased towards exon-skipped products, especially when comparing size differences as large as those here. Do the similar results from the two assays indicate a similar exon-skipping bias from SeqZip?</p><p>B) Another source of error in the assay will likely be differences in annealing and ligation efficiency between different ligamer pairs. One oligo can have quite different ligation activities when joined to different partners. Different oligos have such drastically different annealing and ligation efficiency especially since they can also form various inter- and intra-molecular interactions when the complexity is increased. As a result, the poorest one will be the rate-limiting factor for the whole isoform presentation. For individual isoform pairs under different conditions, we use ratio/ratio to infer changes, but in the current study, this is not feasible. They may argue that a poor oligo will affect all isoforms equally, and thus, it is not a problem. However, other isoforms that lack the targeting exon for such poor oligo will be over represented. This problem may not surface with low complexity system. But, it is likely that it will soon be encountered by others, if the system is adopted, and if not properly addressed, the method will have little impact. This is a critical point for the authors to assess.</p><p>C) Related to B, they make passing reference to matching the free energy of binding for each hybridizing segment, but it is not clear how well this works or whether it makes all oligo pairs join equally well. Similarly, the authors discuss the question of distinguishing highly similar exon sequences in DSCAM, but it is not clear if their approach is a general solution. Through assays of constructed pools they show they can distinguish exons 4.1 and 4.7, exons 6.9, 6.33, and 6.24, and exons 9.6 and 9.9, using their complex set of ligamers. However, it is not clear if these are the most similar of all DSCAM exon pairs or that others of the many possibilities might be more difficult to distinguish.</p><p>2) Although the authors present a complex oligo set for DSCAM whose ligated product can be assayed in a length accessible by MiSeq, it is not clear how general these conditions are for other complex systems, where there are more sites of variation and more types of splicing change. It seems likely that some regions will still need to be assayed separately and combinations predicted statistically. What are the limitations here? How complex a set of ligamers is feasible? Is there an upper limit on length that can be sequenced as a single fragment? Given such a length limit, what determines the number and spacing of alternative events that can be assayed by a ligamer set targeting all the possible products? Exactly how did the DSCAM mapping and variant quantification work? It appears that DSCAM isoforms were identified and counted by aligning to a library of isoform sequences and somehow scoring for sequence match. This needs to be described in much more detail. For this to be a useful method, it will need to be applicable to other complex transcript sets. It is not clear how feasible this is. Without understanding the mapping strategy, it is not clear how one might develop this for another gene.</p><p>Minor points:</p><p>1) The paper is very haphazardly written and it is often difficult to follow exactly what is being done. At the same time, the authors often overstate the novelty and relative performance of the assay. Oligo Ligation as an assay for specific sequences in a complex mixture goes back at least to Landegren and Hood. The method here is basically an extension of RASL-seq. It doesn't take away from the advance to reference these precedents. The authors comment on the better performance on SeqZip over CamSeq and PacBio long read sequencing. However, examining <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2E</xref> and Supplement 6A, they appear comparable. When discussing CamSeq, in the section “SeqZip eliminates <italic>Dscam1</italic> isoform template switching analysis artifacts”, it is not clear what the authors mean by the sentence: “Although template-switched and unexplained isoforms together represented just 0.6-0.94% of all reads, they account for 99.9% of multi-exon isoforms sequenced…” The authors state that detection of template switched isoforms is much lower for SeqZip, but later report that 1.3% of the alignments in the sequencing of the DSCAM ligation products contained exons not present in the input. From this it would seem that the error rate for SeqZip is potentially higher than CamSeq.</p><p>2) It is often unclear what the figures are presenting. More labels and lane numbers are needed. In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>, it was not clear that each bar represented a different variant for each region and should thus sum to 100%. In this Figure, the EDA bars for the EDA<sup>+/-</sup> cells show only one isoform (they are not labeled as to which is which). Shouldn't both isoforms be present in these cells? The point of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref> is also not clear.</p><p>3) As mentioned above, how were the isoform abundances calculated? This should be described in detail with a figure showing the conversion from read counts to isoforms. Also needed are the data tables and sequencing statistics for the MiSeq runs. Exactly how were these sequences mapped to transcripts to identify the exon combinations? The authors report the use of DESeq to determine differential expression of DSCAM isoforms. They should be aware that this is considered to be a bad idea generally and specifically that SeqZip libraries likely violate several crucial assumptions made by DESeq. This should be clarified in detail.</p><p>4) The authors stress that PCR amplification must be minimized, but report 12 cycles of PCR after ligation, followed by 22 cycles to add the Illumina primers. How were these numbers arrived at? Was it the same for the biological samples and the artificial pools? How will this be affected by transcript abundance for targets that are less abundant than DSCAM? The DSCAM splice variants are all the same length, but this is not usually the case for systems of complex splicing. How will this PCR step affect the quantification when some variants are much shorter than others?</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were requested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for resubmitting your work entitled “Assessing long-distance RNA sequence connectivity via RNA-templated DNA-DNA ligation” for further consideration at <italic>eLife</italic>. Your revised article has been favorably evaluated by Aviv Regev (Senior editor), a member of the Board of Reviewing Editors, and the original reviewers.

These should accompany the currently well-described experimental limitations of SeqZip. As Reviewer 1 notes in further detail (and agreed by all reviewers): (1) there may be genes and isoforms that cannot readily be assayed with ligamer pools that uniquely quantify combinations of splicing events, but proper inference would still be able to help estimate splicing frequency; (2) guidelines for a method/algorithm to design a valid ligamer pool for a given gene are important to highlight in terms of what is already available and what is a future analytic direction.</p><p>2) Several critical details are missing or quite unclear, especially in the Methods sections, which were missing before or even removed in this version, per the items detailed in Reviewer 2's review.

Again, we would like to see the discussion section clarify to the reader, as much as possible, what they can and cannot expect from the method. This is important for its long-term impact in the field.</p><p><italic>Reviewer 1</italic>:</p><p>The authors have clarified a number of concerns I had with this revised version of the manuscript. The authors' section on the limitations of SeqZip clearly specifies most of the experimental limitations that remain. I would have liked to see a more thorough discussion of the analytic limitations or areas for improvement in the Discussion. For example:</p><p>1) As the authors note, there may be genes and isoforms that cannot readily be assayed with ligamer pools that uniquely quantify combinations of splicing events. However, SeqZip could still provide major advantages over conventional RNA-Seq for these genes, if it were coupled with statistical inference to estimate the frequency of splicing event combinations. The requirement that reads uniquely quantify isoforms is helpful but probably unnecessary for recovering accurate values. Using DESeq will only work well with ligamer pools that uniquely specify splicing combinations. For more complex pools, the authors’ current pipeline is likely to return unreliable numbers.</p><p>2) The authors do not describe an algorithm that generates a valid ligamer pool for a given gene. How are users of SeqZip to know that the pool they design meets the requirements of the assay and the analysis pipeline? What if they make a mistake, and leave a particular combination of splicing outcomes “uncovered” by the ligamer pool? A rigorous design tool for making ligamer pools would ensure that the current analysis pipeline returns valid quantification. Alternatively, the analysis pipeline itself could be improved (as noted in #1) to support more relaxed ligamer designs.</p><p>Both of these issues seem like good potential future directions. I would just suggest that the authors note them as limitations or opportunities in the Discussion.</p><p><italic>Reviewer 2</italic>:</p><p>While the authors addressed most of the concerns raised earlier, this “final” version still has various problems:</p><p>1) The optimal PCR cycle number. The authors argued that under their conditions, the PCR cycle up to 22 did not cause any problem, yet still recommended to keep the cycle minimal in the previous version. Now, the authors removed such recommendation because they no longer think it is a critical issue? They did not even specify in their method section how many PCR cycles used. This information is needed for others to use the method.</p><p>2) Template switching was not a major problem with the amount of starting materials the authors used. However, most experiments use total RNA from a large number of cells. The authors need to provide instruction in their Methods section for the optimal range of RNA concentrations to be used in their assays.</p><p>3) I am still confused by the phrase in the section “SeqZip eliminates template-switching artifacts in the analysis of <italic>Dscam1</italic> isoforms”: “Although the percentage of total reads aligning to template-switched and unexplained isoforms was low (0.6-0.94%), these few reads support the majority of <italic>Dscam1</italic> isoforms sequenced (99.9%)”. Did the authors mean the majority of artifacts sequenced? If this is what they meant, SeqZip detected 1.3% artifacts, which is higher than CAMSeq.</p><p>4) In the Discussion, the authors cited “slow RNA synthesis favors inclusion of cassette exons with weak splicing signals, while fast RNA synthesis favors exclusion (Kornblihtt et al. 2013)”. They need to cite a recent paper in Mol Cell from the lab that has corrected this simple version of the model.</p><p>5) The authors added additional references in the text, but many did not show up in the reference list. Seem to need to update their EndNote. They should cite the Hood Science paper, which is the first to describe the ligation approach.</p><p><italic>Reviewer 3</italic>:</p><p>The SeqZip method presented by the authors does address an important issue that is of general interest. The concept for the method has been around previously. Thus, I consider it essential that a high-profile publication reporting this method contains extensive validation of the approach.</p><p>The authors have made an attempt to address the issues raised in the review. However, the major issue remains: under which circumstances can the SeqZip method be considered as quantitative? To ensure the quantification aspect of SeqZip, several conditions have to be examined:</p><p>i) the specificity of the ligamers;</p><p>ii) the equal hybridization and ligation efficiencies according to ligamer sequences;</p><p>iii) the equal ligation efficiencies across various numbers of ligation events.</p><p>These key parameters differ for each target and rigorous control criteria are essential to set up suitable conditions for each target. Without prior validation of these criteria, SeqZip cannot be considered as quantifiable. The only conclusion that could thus be addressed is that combination of alternative events is present within one transcript if there is a signal (but absence of signal doesn't necessary mean that the isoform doesn't exist).</p><p>The authors have selected different targets to validate different aspects of the method (<italic>CD45</italic>, <italic>FN1</italic> and <italic>Dscam1</italic>) but their major figure describing SeqZip method (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>) highlights the strong bias to underrepresent mRNA isoforms that require multiple ligation events.</p><p>The <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Author response image 2</xref> increases the concern that also ligamers can be non-specific. Nevertheless, the authors strongly argue against relying on the CAMseq experiments, which at the same time they consider as not reliable. Again, a more rigorous, systematic inclusion of controls is needed. For example, the authors should have selected control constructs according to the sequence similarity rather than to the availability of clones.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.03700.022</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>Major points</italic>:</p><p><italic>1) From the data presented, it is not clear how well a ligation event for an oligo pair will linearly report on a particular exon-exon joint when the pair is part of a complex set of ligamers. This has several complications</italic>.</p><p><italic>A) From</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2"><italic>Figure 2</italic></xref><italic>, it appears that increasing the total number of ligation events decreases the efficiency of product generation.

In the RT-PCR reactions shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>, products representing the four <italic>CD45</italic> isoforms ranged from 367 to 850 nt. Our PCR conditions included a 1 min extension step, which should be more than sufficient to allow complete replication of all four isoforms (Taq DNA polymerase extension guidelines are typically 1 min per 1,000 nt). Supporting this, we observed no differences in isoform ratios after 18, 21, and 24 cycles of PCR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Author response image 1</xref>). For the data shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>, we used 21 cycles. Therefore, under the conditions we used here, there is little or no bias PCR toward shorter isoforms. Similarly, we observed no bias toward shorter isoforms with different PCR cycles in the SeqZip samples. Because SeqZip yielded the same isoform ratios as RT-PCR, we conclude that there was no bias toward shorter isoforms in the ligation reactions shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>.<fig id="fig8" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.03700.023</object-id><label>Author response image 1.</label><caption><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.03700.023">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.03700.023</ext-link></p></caption><graphic xlink:href="elife-03700-resp-fig1-v2.tif"/></fig></p><p><italic>B) Another source of error in the assay will likely be differences in annealing and ligation efficiency between different ligamer pairs.

Also, analysis of exonic splice-site sequences support more uniform terminal exonic nucleotides, especially for the 5´ splice site (Lim &amp; Burge, 2001).

Yes we fully agree that SeqZip, CamSeq, and PacBio all yield comparable usage for individual exons. But the clear advantage of SeqZip is that it is much less prone to template switching during library preparation and amplification.</p><p><italic>When discussing CamSeq, in the section “SeqZip eliminates</italic> Dscam1 <italic>isoform template switching analysis artifacts”, it is not clear what the authors mean by the sentence: “Although template-switched and unexplained isoforms together represented just 0.6-0.94% of all reads, they account for 99.9% of multi-exon isoforms sequenced…” The authors state that detection of template switched isoforms is much lower for SeqZip, but later report that 1.3% of the alignments in the sequencing of the DSCAM ligation products contained exons not present in the input.

Using our differential barcode approach, which uses sets of ligamers with different barcodes but whose ligation products are amplified together, we measure template-switching based on improper barcode combinations. We conclude that the vast majority of the reads aligning to ‘unintended’ isoforms originate from incorporation of near-cognate ligamers. Therefore, while a slightly higher overall percentage of SeqZip reads align to non-input isoforms, the source of most of these alignments (i.e. near-cognate ligamer usage) is known. In contrast, we assigned CamSeq reads to ‘template switched’ isoforms based logical rearrangement of high abundance control isoform exons. As these two ‘error rates’ are from different sources (template-switching vs. near-cognate ligamer usage), they cannot be compared. Finally, we believe that modest changes in ligamer design (i.e. longer hybridization regions, LNA incorporation) would further reduce near-cognate ligamer incorporation. In contrast, approaches to reduce of template-switching beyond the low rate that CamSeq has already achieved are not obvious to us.</p><p><italic>2) It is often unclear what the figures are presenting.

Therefore we were surprised when we only detected EDA<sup>-</sup> isoform expression. We verified the presence of the EDA<sup>+</sup> and EDA- alleles in gDNA by PCR.

This is important for its long-term impact in the field</italic>.</p><p>We have now added the following verbiage to the Discussion to address this point:</p><p>“In our experiments, we were able to demonstrate accurate isoform abundance reporting over &gt;4 orders of magnitude for <italic>Dscam1</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>). At the low end of this range, however, near-cognate ligation events began to be problematic. As for sensitivity, we have been able to obtain detectable ligation products from as few as ∼900 (5 × 10<sup>−17</sup> M; 0.05 fM) target RNA molecules (data not shown). Because the limit of detection for SeqZip is likely more than a single molecule, lack of detection of a particular isoform should only be interpreted as that isoform being below the SeqZip detection limit. Nonetheless, when properly controlled, SeqZip is a sensitive quantitative method for assessing complex isoform abundance patterns over a wide dynamic range.”</p><p>Reviewer 1:</p><p><italic>The authors have clarified a number of concerns I had with this revised version of the manuscript. The authors' section on the limitations of SeqZip clearly specifies most of the experimental limitations that remain. I would have liked to see a more thorough discussion of the analytic limitations or areas for improvement in the Discussion. For example:</italic></p><p><italic>1) As the authors note, there may be genes and isoforms that cannot readily be assayed with ligamer pools that uniquely quantify combinations of splicing events. However, SeqZip could still provide major advantages over conventional RNA-Seq for these genes, if it were coupled with statistical inference to estimate the frequency of splicing event combinations. The requirement that reads uniquely quantify isoforms is helpful but probably unnecessary for recovering accurate values. Using DESeq will only work well with ligamer pools that uniquely specify splicing combinations. For more complex pools, the authors’ current pipeline is likely to return unreliable numbers</italic>.</p><p>As the reviewer notes, application of DESeq for analyzing DSCAM ligamer isoforms is unique to that experimental design. Further, how best to analyze a particular SeqZip experiment (e.g., radioactive PCR on polyacrylamide gels vs deep sequencing) will depend on the exact experimental design and the number of isoforms being queried.</p><p><italic>2) The authors do not describe an algorithm that generates a valid ligamer pool for a given gene. How are users of SeqZip to know that the pool they design meets the requirements of the assay and the analysis pipeline? What if they make a mistake, and leave a particular combination of splicing outcomes “uncovered” by the ligamer pool? A rigorous design tool for making ligamer pools would ensure that the current analysis pipeline returns valid quantification. Alternatively, the analysis pipeline itself could be improved (as noted in #1) to support more relaxed ligamer designs</italic>.</p><p>Nowhere in this manuscript did we or do we now present any computational “pipeline” for designing ligamer pools or for analyzing the results. Because of the flexibility of the method for addressing many different kinds of questions, it is hard for us to envision (and therefore even more difficult to implement) any single “pipeline” that would be suitable for all applications. Nonetheless, we do see the utility of giving the reader a better idea of how we went about designing large ligamer pools. Therefore we now include as Figure 1–figure supplement 7 a detailed flow diagram of our ligamer design process for the mouse Fn gene.</p><p><italic>Both of these issues seem like good potential future directions. I would just suggest that the authors note them as limitations or opportunities in the Discussion</italic>.</p><p>The following paragraph has now been added to the Discussion:</p><p>“The easiest ‘complex’ form of alternative splicing for SeqZip analysis was <italic>Dscam1</italic>, where alternative processing is limited to mutually exclusive exons […] For highly complex pools, this process can be automated by writing a simple Python, Perl, or R script specific to the problem being addressed. ”</p><p>Reviewer 2:</p><p><italic>While the authors addressed most of the concerns raised earlier, this “final” version still has various problems</italic>:</p><p><italic>1) The optimal PCR cycle number. The authors argued that under their conditions, the PCR cycle up to 22 did not cause any problem, yet still recommended to keep the cycle minimal in the previous version. Now, the authors removed such recommendation because they no longer think it is a critical issue? They did not even specify in their method section how many PCR cycles used. This information is needed for others to use the method</italic>.</p><p>In the previous manuscript version, the number of PCR cycles used was clearly stated in the relevant paragraph of the Methods section for both “MiSeq Library Preparation” and “Radioactive PCR”. In rereading the Methods section, we realized however, that the order in which specific methods were presented was not the order in which they appeared in the Results. This may have led to the reviewer's confusion as to where to find the PCR cycle numbers. We have now reordered the Methods section to make it parallel the Results section, and PCR cycle numbers are clearly stated for every experiment.</p><p><italic>2) Template switching was not a major problem with the amount of starting materials the authors used. However, most experiments use total RNA from a large number of cells. The authors need to provide instruction in their Methods section for the optimal range of RNA concentrations to be used in their assays</italic>.</p><p>The range of total RNA starting concentrations is now explicitly stated in the “SeqZip” methods paragraph.</p><p><italic>3) I am still confused by the phrase in the section “SeqZip eliminates template-switching artifacts in the analysis of</italic> Dscam1 <italic>isoforms”: “Although the percentage of total reads aligning to template-switched and unexplained isoforms was low (0.6-0.94%), these few reads support the majority of</italic> Dscam1 <italic>isoforms sequenced (99.9%)”. Did the authors mean the majority of artifacts sequenced? If this is what they meant, SeqZip detected 1.3% artifacts, which is higher than CAMSeq</italic>.</p><p>No we meant that 99.9% of species detected in the CAMSeq control experiments were artifacts. Because this passage was the cause of much confusion, we have now eliminated it and reworked the paragraph to make it clearer.</p><p><italic>4) In the Discussion, the authors cited “slow RNA synthesis favors inclusion of cassette exons with weak splicing signals, while fast RNA synthesis favors exclusion (Kornblihtt et al. 2013)”. They need to cite a recent paper in Mol Cell from the lab that has corrected this simple version of the model</italic>.</p><p>Done.</p><p><italic>5) The authors added additional references in the text, but many did not show up in the reference list. Seem to need to update their EndNote. They should cite the Hood Science paper, which is the first to describe the ligation approach</italic>.</p><p>Fixed.</p><p>Reviewer 3:</p><p><italic>The SeqZip method presented by the authors does address an important issue that is of general interest. The concept for the method has been around previously. Thus, I consider it essential that a high-profile publication reporting this method contains extensive validation of the approach</italic>.</p><p><italic>The authors have made an attempt to address the issues raised in the review. However, the major issue remains: under which circumstances can the SeqZip method be considered as quantitative? To ensure the quantification aspect of SeqZip, several conditions have to be examined</italic>:</p><p><italic>i) the specificity of the ligamers</italic>;</p><p><italic>ii) the equal hybridization and ligation efficiencies according to ligamer sequences</italic>;</p><p><italic>iii) the equal ligation efficiencies across various numbers of ligation events</italic>.</p><p><italic>These key parameters differ for each target and rigorous control criteria are essential to set up suitable conditions for each target. Without prior validation of these criteria, SeqZip cannot be considered as quantifiable. The only conclusion that could thus be addressed is that combination of alternative events is present within one transcript if there is a signal (but absence of signal doesn't necessary mean that the isoform doesn't exist)</italic>.</p><p><italic>The authors have selected different targets to validate different aspects of the method (</italic>CD45<italic>,</italic> FN1 <italic>and</italic> Dscam1<italic>) but their major figure describing SeqZip method (</italic><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2"><italic>Figure 2</italic></xref><italic>) highlights the strong bias to underrepresent mRNA isoforms that require multiple ligation events</italic>.</p><p>We assume that by “<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>”, the author means <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>. In this experiment, each ligamer contained only 10 nts of complementarity to either side of the looped out region, there was no amplification of ligation products, and all ligamers were the same length. Therefore all three 2-way and both 3-way ligation products co-migrate on the gel, whereas there is only one possible 4-way ligation product. This co-migration likely explains the reviewer's conclusion that there is a “strong bias to underrepresent mRNA isoforms that require multiple ligation events”. The results in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>, however, clearly demonstrate that when full-length ligation products were amplified, there was no detectable bias against longer isoforms in favor of shorter isoforms. Indeed the number of ligation events required for the longest <italic>CD45</italic> isoform (R456) is 3 more than the number required for the shortest (R0). Of course, the safest comparisons will always be between ligation reactions requiring similar numbers of ligation events (e.g., <italic>Dscam</italic>), and care should be taken when comparing abundances of ligation products resulting from significantly different (Δ&gt;3) ligation events. We have now added the following cautionary verbiage in the Discussion:</p><p>“One limitation of SeqZip is the number of ligamers required to create a ligation product […], it is crucial to perform the necessary controls to ensure quantitative detection of all desired isoforms.”</p><p><italic>The <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Author response image 2</xref> increases the concern that also ligamers can be non-specific. Nevertheless, the authors strongly argue against relying on the CAMseq experiments, which at the same time they consider as not reliable. Again, a more rigorous, systematic inclusion of controls is needed. For example, the authors should have selected control constructs according to the sequence similarity rather than to the availability of clones</italic>.</p><p>We agree that other control constructs might have been more optimal, but at the time of these experiments such constructs were not available to us. We disagree with the reviewer, however, that we “strongly argue against relying on the CAMseq” approach. It was our intent to provide a disinterested analysis of the advantages and disadvantages of RT-PCR-based approaches (i.e., triple read sequencing and CAMseq) versus a RNA-templated ligation-based approach (i.e., SeqZip). While SeqZip solves the template-switching problem inherent to the RT-PCR-based methods, it obviously has its own limitations. These are now covered in great detail in the “SeqZip uses and limitations” section of the Discussion. We leave it to the reader to decide which approach is most appropriate for his or her needs.</p></body></sub-article></article>
