Remarkably, HIPPO signaling activity resolves conflicted cell fate by repositioning cells to the interior of the embryo, independent of its role in regulating <italic>Sox2</italic> expression. Rather, HIPPO antagonizes apical localization of Par complex components PARD6B and aPKC. Thus, negative feedback between HIPPO and Par complex components ensure robust lineage segregation.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.42298.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>As an embryo develops, its cells divide, grow and migrate in specific patterns to build an organized collection of cells that go on to form our tissues and organs. One of the first steps – well before the embryo has implanted into the womb – is to allocate cells to make part of the placenta.</p><p>Once this process is complete, the remaining cells continue building the organism. These cells are pluripotent, meaning they can develop into any part of the body. Scientists think that the embryo manages to sort ‘placenta cells’ from pluripotent ones with the help of certain proteins, which the mother has packaged into her eggs.</p><p>To investigate this further, Frum et al. used genetic tools to track a specific gene called Sox2 that identifies pluripotent cells as soon as they are formed in mouse embryos. The experiments revealed that the mother places two closely related proteins known as YAP1 and WWTR1 within each egg, which help to make placenta cells different from pluripotent cells. Moreover, both proteins enable the embryo to segregate these two cell types to two different locations: placenta cells are moved to the outer layer of the embryo, while pluripotent cells are moved to the inside.</p><p>Current technologies allow researchers to create pluripotent cells in the laboratory. But these approaches often result in error, failing to replicate the embryo’s natural ability. By studying how embryos form and arrange pluripotent cells, scientists hope to advance stem cell technology (which emerge from pluripotent cells). This may help to find new ways to heal damaged tissues and organs, or to treat or even prevent many diseases.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>pluripotency</kwd><kwd>mammals</kwd><kwd>cell polarity</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000057</institution-id><institution>National Institute of General Medical Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01 GM104009</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ralston</surname><given-names>Amy</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000071</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Child Health and Human Development</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>T32HD087166</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Murphy</surname><given-names>Tayler M</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>HIPPO signaling antagonizes the apical domain of polarized cells, driving cell internalization, regulated gene expression, and cell fate change during formation of pluripotent stem cell progenitors in the mouse embryo.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>During embryogenesis cells gradually differentiate, adopting distinct gene expression profiles and fates. In mammals, the first cellular differentiation is the segregation of trophectoderm and inner cell mass. The trophectoderm, which comprises the polarized outer surface of the blastocyst, will mainly produce cells of the placenta, while the inner cell mass will produce pluripotent cells, which are progenitors of both fetus and embryonic stem cells. Understanding how pluripotent inner cell mass cells are segregated from non-pluripotent cells therefore reveals how pluripotency is induced in a naturally occurring setting.</p><p>Progenitors of inner cell mass are first morphologically apparent at the 16 cell stage as unpolarized cells residing inside the morula (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Frum and Ralston, 2017</xref>). However, at this stage, pluripotency genes such as <italic>Pou5f1</italic> (<italic>Oct4</italic>) and <italic>Nanog</italic>, do not specifically label inside cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Dietrich and Hiiragi, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Niwa et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Palmieri et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Strumpf et al., 2005</xref>). Thus, the first cell fate decision has been studied mainly from the perspective of trophectoderm specification because the transcription factor CDX2, which is essential for trophectoderm development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Strumpf et al., 2005</xref>), is expressed specifically in outer cells of the 16 cell embryo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Ralston and Rossant, 2008</xref>), and has provided a way to distinguish future trophectoderm cells from non-trophectoderm cells. Knowledge of CDX2 as a marker of trophectoderm cell fate enabled the discovery of mechanisms that sense cellular differences in polarity and position in the embryo, and then respond by regulating expression of <italic>Cdx2</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Nishioka et al., 2009</xref>). However, the exclusive study of <italic>Cdx2</italic> regulation does not provide direct knowledge of how pluripotency is established because the absence of <italic>Cdx2</italic> expression does not necessarily indicate acquisition of pluripotency. As such, our understanding of the first cell fate decision in the early mouse embryo is incomplete.</p><p>In contrast to other markers of pluripotency, <italic>Sox2</italic> is expressed specifically in inside cells at the 16 cell stage, and is therefore the first marker of pluripotency in the embryo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Guo et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Wicklow et al., 2014</xref>). The discovery of how <italic>Sox2</italic> expression is regulated in the embryo therefore provides unique insight into how pluripotency is first established in vivo. Genes promoting expression of <italic>Sox2</italic> in the embryo have been described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Cui et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Wallingford et al., 2017</xref>). However, it is currently unclear how expression of <italic>Sox2</italic> becomes restricted to inside cells. We previously showed that <italic>Sox2</italic> is restricted to inside cells by a <italic>Cdx2</italic>-independent mechanism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Wicklow et al., 2014</xref>), which differs from <italic>Oct4</italic> and <italic>Nanog</italic>, which are restricted to the inner cell mass by CDX2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Niwa et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Strumpf et al., 2005</xref>). Thus, <italic>Sox2</italic> and <italic>Cdx2</italic> are regulated in parallel, leading to complementary inside/outside expression patterns. However, it is not known whether <italic>Sox2</italic> is regulated by the same pathway that regulates <italic>Cdx2</italic> or whether a distinct pathway could be in use.</p><p>The expression of <italic>Cdx2</italic> is regulated by members of the HIPPO signaling pathway. In particular, the HIPPO pathway kinases LATS1/2 become active in unpolarized cells located deep inside the embryo, where they antagonize activity of the YAP1/WWTR1/TEAD4 transcriptional complex that is thought to promote expression of <italic>Cdx2</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Anani et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Cockburn et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Hirate et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Kono et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Korotkevich et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Leung and Zernicka-Goetz, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Lorthongpanich et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Mihajlović and Bruce, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Nishioka et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Nishioka et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Posfai et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Rayon et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Watanabe et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Yagi et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Zhu et al., 2017</xref>). In this way, the initially ubiquitous expression of <italic>Cdx2</italic> becomes restricted to outer trophectoderm cells. However, the specific requirements for <italic>Yap1</italic> and <italic>Wwtr1</italic> in the regulation of <italic>Cdx2</italic> has been inferred from overexpression of wild type and dominant-negative variants, neither of which provide the standard of gene expression analysis that null alleles can provide. Nonetheless, the roles of <italic>Yap1</italic> and <italic>Wwtr1</italic> in regulating expression of <italic>Sox2</italic> have not been investigated. Here, we evaluate the roles of maternal and zygotic YAP1/WWTR1 in regulating expression of <italic>Sox2</italic> and cell fate during blastocyst formation.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Patterning of <italic>Sox2</italic> is ROCK-dependent</title><p>To identify the mechanisms regulating <italic>Sox2</italic> expression during blastocyst formation, we focused on how <italic>Sox2</italic> expression is normally repressed in the trophectoderm to achieve inside cell-specific expression. We previously showed that SOX2 is specific to inside cells in the absence of the trophectoderm factor CDX2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Wicklow et al., 2014</xref>), suggesting that mechanisms that repress <italic>Sox2</italic> in the trophectoderm act upstream of <italic>Cdx2.</italic> Rho-associated, coiled-coil containing protein kinases (ROCK1 and 2) are thought to act upstream of <italic>Cdx2</italic> because embryos developing in the presence of a ROCK-inhibitor (Y-27632, ROCKi) exhibit reduced <italic>Cdx2</italic> expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Kono et al., 2014</xref>). Additionally, quantitative RT-PCR showed that <italic>Sox2</italic> mRNA levels are elevated in ROCKi-treated embryos (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Kono et al., 2014</xref>), suggesting that ROCK1/2 activity leads to transcriptional repression of <italic>Sox2</italic>. However, the role of ROCK1/2 in regulating the spatial expression of <italic>Sox2</italic> has not been investigated.</p><p>To evaluate the roles of ROCK1/2 in patterning <italic>Sox2</italic> expression, we collected 8-cell stage embryos prior to embryo compaction (E2.5), and then cultured these either in control medium or in the presence of ROCKi for 24 hr (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Embryos cultured in control medium exhibited normal cell polarity, evidenced by the apical localization of PARD6B and basolateral localization of E-cadherin (CDH1) in outside cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B,C</xref>) as expected (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Vestweber et al., 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Vinot et al., 2005</xref>). Additionally, SOX2 was detected only in inside cells in control embryos (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C,D</xref>). By contrast, embryos cultured in ROCKi exhibited defects in cell polarity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B’, C’</xref>), consistent with prior studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Kono et al., 2014</xref>). Interestingly, in ROCKi-treated embryos, we observed ectopic SOX2 expression in cells located on the outer surface of the embryo (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C’, D</xref>), indicating that ROCK1/2 participates in repressing expression of <italic>Sox2</italic> in the trophectoderm.</p><p>To scrutinize the identity of outside-positioned SOX2-positive cells in ROCKi-treated embryos, we co-stained an additional cohort of control and ROCKi-treated embryos with CDX2 and SOX2 and compared the overlap of lineage marker expression. In control embryos, CDX2 was detected only in outside cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>) as expected at this stage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Ralston and Rossant, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Strumpf et al., 2005</xref>). In ROCKi-treated embryos, CDX2 expression levels were reduced (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A’</xref>) as was the proportion of outside cells in which CDX2 was detected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>), as previously reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Kono et al., 2014</xref>). However, among outside cells, a substantial proportion coexpressed CDX2 and SOX2 in ROCKi-treated embryos compared with controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>), suggesting that ROCK inhibition leads to an increase in outside cells of mixed lineage. Since SOX2 expression does not regulate expression of CDX2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Wicklow et al., 2014</xref>), these observations suggest that ROCK1/2 activity regulates these genes through parallel mechanisms. We next sought to identify mediators that act downstream of ROCK1/2 to repress expression of <italic>Sox2</italic> in the trophectoderm.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.42298.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>ROCK1/2 and nuclear YAP1 repress expression of SOX2.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Experimental design: embryos were collected at E2.5 and treated with ROCK inhibitor Y-27632 (ROCKi) or DMSO (control) for 24 hr.

Among these is YAP1, a transcriptional partner of TEAD4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Nishioka et al., 2009</xref>), since ROCK activity is required for the nuclear localization of YAP1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Kono et al., 2014</xref>).

To test this hypothesis, we overexpressed a constitutively active variant of YAP1 (YAP1<sup>CA</sup>). Substitution of alanine at serine 112 leads YAP1 to be constitutively nuclear and constitutively active (YAP1<sup>CA</sup> hereafter) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Dong et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Nishioka et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Zhao et al., 2007</xref>).

Therefore, LATS2 is sufficient to induce expression of SOX2 in cells regardless of their position within the embryo. We predicted that, if <italic>Lats2</italic> overexpression drove cells to adopt inner cell mass fate by influencing YAP1 and WWTR1 activity, then co-overexpression of <italic>Yap1<sup>CA</sup></italic> would enable <italic>Lats2</italic>-overexpressing cells to contribute to trophectoderm. Consistent with this prediction, cooverexpression of <italic>Lats2</italic> and <italic>Yap1<sup>CA</sup></italic> led to a significant decrease in the proportion of <italic>Lats2-</italic>overexpressing cells contributing to the inside cell position, and a concomitant increase in the proportion of <italic>Lats2</italic>-overexpressing cells remaining in the outside position (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2A–D</xref>).

Collectively, these observations strongly suggest that LATS2 promotes inside cell positioning by regulating the activities of YAP1 and, likely, the related protein WWTR1.</p><p>To pinpoint when <italic>Lats2</italic>-overexpressing cells come to occupy the inside of the embryo, we performed a time course, examining the position of injected and non-injected cells from the 16-cell to the blastocyst stage (~80 cells). Surprisingly, between the 16 and 32-cell stages, the proportion of injected and non-injected cells in the total, outside, and inside cell populations were comparable whether embryos had been injected with <italic>Lats2</italic> and <italic>GFP</italic> or <italic>GFP</italic> mRNA alone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F–H</xref>). In embryos injected with <italic>GFP</italic> mRNA alone, the proportion of injected and non-injected cells making up the total, outside, and inside cell populations remained constant throughout the time course. In contrast, starting around the 32-cell stage, the average proportion of <italic>Lats2</italic>-overexpressing cells making up the inside population began to increase dramatically. This increase was associated with a decrease in the proportion <italic>Lats2</italic>-overexpressing cells making up the outside population, consistent with internalization of <italic>Lats2</italic>-overexpressing cells after the 32-cell stage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G</xref>). After the 32-cell stage, <italic>Lats2</italic>-injected cells became underrepresented as a proportion of the total cell population (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2H</xref>), lending further support to the idea that <italic>Lats2</italic>-overexpressing cells that fail to internalize undergo cell death. Interestingly, the inside-skewed contribution of <italic>Lats2</italic>-overexpressing cells did not influence the ability of non-injected cells to contribute to the ICM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2I</xref>), arguing that <italic>Lats2</italic>-overexpression drives inside positioning cell-autonomously.

This observation suggested that, similar to <italic>Lats2-</italic>overexpressing cells, cells with reduced <italic>Wwtr1</italic> and <italic>Yap1</italic> exhibit an increased frequency of outside cell death, in addition to increased outside cell internalization. Consistent with this, embryos with one or fewer wild type alleles of <italic>Wwtr1</italic> or <italic>Yap1</italic> exhibited an increase in the ratio of inside to outside cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>) and an increase in cells undergoing apoptosis by TUNEL assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6G</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1A,B</xref>).</p><p>Critically, the fewer outside cells in embryos lacking <italic>Wwtr1</italic> and <italic>Yap1</italic>, which appeared stretched over the mass of inside cells, exhibited ectopic expression of SOX2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E–F</xref>). Therefore, WWTR1/YAP1 repress inner cell mass fate, downstream of LATS kinases. Intriguingly, our data also indicate that WWTR1 is a more potent repressor of <italic>Sox2</italic> at E3.75 than YAP1 since embryos with a single wild type allele of <italic>Wwtr1</italic> had significantly fewer cells expressing ectopic SOX2 then embryos with a single wild type allele of <italic>Yap1</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1F,G</xref>).</p><p>Since loss of <italic>Wwtr1</italic> and <italic>Yap1</italic> phenocopied <italic>Lats2</italic> overexpression in terms of <italic>Sox2</italic> expression, cell death, and cell repositioning, we next evaluated the apical domain and cell polarization in outside cells of embryos lacking <italic>Wwtr1</italic> and <italic>Yap1</italic> at E3.75.

For example, <italic>Oct4</italic> and <italic>Nanog</italic> are expressed in both inner cell mass and trophectoderm until after blastocyst formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Dietrich and Hiiragi, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Strumpf et al., 2005</xref>). Similarly, CDX2 is detected in inner cell mass, as well as trophectoderm, until blastocyst stages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">McDole and Zheng, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Ralston and Rossant, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Strumpf et al., 2005</xref>). In striking contrast to these genes, SOX2 is never detected in outside cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Wicklow et al., 2014</xref>), indicating that robust mechanisms must exist to minimize noise and prevent its aberrant expression in trophectoderm. Here, we identify YAP1/WWTR1 as key components that repress <italic>Sox2</italic> expression in outside cells of the embryo. Notably, manipulations known to antagonize YAP1/WWTR1 activity, including chemical inhibition of ROCK and overexpression of LATS2, lead to ectopic expression of SOX2 in outside cells, reinforcing the notion that YAP1/WWTR1 activity are crucial for repression of <italic>Sox2</italic> in outside cells.</p><p>Additionally, we find that <italic>Sox2</italic> expression is more sensitive than is <italic>Cdx2</italic> to YAP1/WWTR1 activity, since intermediate doses of active YAP1/WWTR1 yield cells that coexpress both SOX2 and CDX2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>). This observation is consistent with the fact that CDX2 is initially detected in inside cells of the embryo during blastocyst formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Dietrich and Hiiragi, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">McDole and Zheng, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Ralston and Rossant, 2008</xref>), where SOX2 is also expressed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Wicklow et al., 2014</xref>). Thus, inside cells could initially possess intermediate doses of active YAP1/WWTR1 at this early stage. By contrast, outside cells have greatly reduced YAP1/WWTR1 activity, owing to elevated LATS activity. In this way, the HIPPO pathway ensures robust developmental transitions, by rapidly nudging SOX2-expressing cells into their correct and final positions inside the embryo (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>).</p><fig id="fig7" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.42298.013</object-id><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><title>Resolution of cell fate conflicts in the preimplantation mouse embryo.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) The expression of <italic>Sox2</italic> and <italic>Cdx2</italic> is differentially sensitive to YAP1/WWTR1 activity, leading to co-expression of both lineage markers in cells when YAP1/WWTR1 activity levels are intermediate. (<bold>B</bold>) During division from the 16 to the 32-cell stage, cells that inherit the apical membrane repress HIPPO signaling and maintain an outside position. However, cells that inherit a smaller portion of the apical membrane would initially elevate their HIPPO signaling. We propose that elevated HIPPO then feeds back onto polarity by further antagonizing PAR-aPKC complex formation, leading to a snowball effect on repression of <italic>Sox2</italic> expression, and thus ensuring that SOX2 is never detected in outside cells because these cells are rapidly internalized or apoptosed. (<bold>C</bold>) A closeup of the boxed region in panel B. In most outside cells, low LATS2 activity enables high levels of YAP1/WWTR1 activity, which repress <italic>Sox2</italic> and apoptosis and promote <italic>Cdx2</italic> expression and apical localization of aPKC and PARD6B, which in turn repress the HIPPO pathway. In rare outside cells, LATS2 activity becomes elevated, leading to lower activity of YAP1/WWTR1, which then leads these cells to become internalized or to undergo apoptosis.</p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-42298-fig7-v1.tif"/></fig><p>Consistent with our proposed model, the timing of HIPPO-induced cell internalization coincides with loss of cell fate plasticity around the 32-cell stage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Posfai et al., 2017</xref>). This timing also coincides with the formation of mature tight junctions among outside cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Sheth et al., 1997</xref>), which reinforce and intensify differences in HIPPO signaling activity between inside and outside compartments of the embryo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Hirate and Sasaki, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Leung and Zernicka-Goetz, 2013</xref>). Our observations indicate that HIPPO signaling can, in turn, interfere with trophectoderm epithelialization. Therefore, we propose that HIPPO engages in a negative feedback loop with cell polarity components (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>).</p><p>We propose two mechanisms by which HIPPO signaling eliminates cells from the trophectoderm, both of which are downstream of YAP1/WWTR1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref>). First, a small proportion of conflicted cells undergo cell death. This is in line with the observed increase in the level of apoptosis detected after the 32-cell stage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Copp, 1978</xref>). We showed that cell lethality due to elevated HIPPO can be rescued by increasing levels of nuclear YAP1, suggesting that YAP1 activity normally provides a pro-survival signal to trophectoderm cells, consistent with the proposed role of YAP1 in promoting proliferation in non-eutherian mammals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Frankenberg, 2018</xref>). Moreover, deletion of <italic>Sox2</italic> did not rescue survival of outside cells in which HIPPO signaling was artificially elevated, arguing that HIPPO resolves cell fate conflicts independently of lineage-specific genes.</p><p>The second way that conflicted cells are eliminated from the trophectoderm is that cells with elevated HIPPO signaling drive their own internalization. This is consistent with the observation that cells in which <italic>Tead4</italic> has been knocked down become internalized (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Mihajlović et al., 2015</xref>). However, in contrast to <italic>Tead4</italic> loss of function, which preserves the apical domain in outside cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Mihajlović et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Nishioka et al., 2008</xref>), we observed that <italic>Yap1/Wwtr1</italic> loss of function leads loss of apical PARD6D/aPKC. These observations suggest that YAP1/WWTR1 could partner with proteins other than TEAD4 to regulate apical domain formation. Consistent with this proposal, TEAD1 has been proposed to play an essential role in the early embryo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Sasaki, 2017</xref>). Nevertheless, since PARD6B/aPKC are essential for outside cell positioning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Dard et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Hirate et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Plusa et al., 2005</xref>), the loss of the apical domain could affect cell positioning in several ways. For instance, loss of PARD6B/aPKC would eventually lead to cell depolarization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Alarcon, 2010</xref>), which could influence any of the processes normally governing the allocation of inside cells, such as oriented cleavage, cell contractility, or apical constriction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Korotkevich et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Maître et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Samarage et al., 2015</xref>). Identifying the downstream mechanisms by which HIPPO drives cells to inner cell mass will be a stimulating topic of future study.</p><p>Our studies also revealed that SOX2 does not play a role in cell positioning. This observation sheds light on a recent study, which showed that SOX2 dwells longer in select nuclei of four-cell stage embryos that are destined to contribute to the inner cell mass (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">White et al., 2016</xref>). We propose that SOX2 is associated with future pluripotent state but does not alone contribute to all aspects of pluripotency, such as inside positioning. It is therefore still unclear why it is important to establish the inside cell-specific SOX2 expression during embryogenesis. Identification pathways that function downstream of YAP1/WWTR1 and in parallel to SOX2 to promote formation of pluripotent cells will provide meaningful insights into the natural origins of mammalian pluripotent stem cell progenitors.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th>Reagent type <break/>(species) or <break/>resource</th><th>Designation</th><th>Source or <break/>reference</th><th>Identifiers</th><th>Additional <break/>information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Strain, strain <break/>background <break/>(<italic>Mus musculus</italic>)</td><td>CD-1</td><td>Charles River <break/>Laboratories</td><td>RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/IMSR_CRL:22">IMSR_CRL:22</ext-link></td><td/></tr><tr><td>Strain, strain <break/>background <break/>(<italic>M. musculus</italic>)</td><td><italic>Sox2</italic><sup>tm1.1Lan</sup></td><td> <break/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Smith et al.

Primary Antibodies used were: mouse anti-CDX2 (Biogenex, CDX2-88), goat anti-SOX2 (Neuromics, GT15098), rabbit anti-PARD6B (Santa Cruz, sc-67393), rabbit anti-PARD6B (Novus Biologicals, NBP1-87337), mouse anti-PKCζ (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, sc-17781), rat anti-CDH1 (Sigma Aldrich, U3254), mouse anti-ZO1 (Thermo Fisher Scientific, 33–9100), mouse anti-YAP (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, sc101199), rabbit anti phospho-YAP (Cell Signaling Technologies, 4911), chicken anti-GFP (Aves, GFP-1020). Stains used were: Phallodin-633 (Invitrogen), DRAQ5 (Cell Signaling Technologies) and DAPI (Sigma Aldrich). Secondary antibodies conjugated to DyLight 488, Cy3 or Alexa Flour 647 fluorophores were obtained from Jackson ImmunoResearch. Embryos were imaged using an Olympus FluoView FV1000 Confocal Laser Scanning Microscope system with 20x UPlanFLN objective (0.5 NA) and 5x digital zoom.

All embryos were imaged prior to knowledge of their genotypes.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Embryo analysis</title><p>For each embryo, z-stacks were analyzed using Photoshop or Fiji, which enabled the virtual labeling, based on DNA stain, of all individual cell nuclei. Using this label to identify individual cells, each cell in each embryo was then assigned to relevant phenotypic categories, without knowledge of embryo genotype. Phenotypic categories included marker expression (e.g., SOX2 or CDX2 positive or negative), protein localization (e.g., aPKC or CDH1 apical, basal, absent, or unlocalized), and cell position, where cells making contact with the external environment were considered ‘outside’ and cells surrounded by other cells were considered ‘inside’ cells.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>TUNEL assay</title><p>Embryos were fixed, permeabilized, and blocked as described for immunofluorescence. Zonae pellucida were removed using Tyrode’s Acid treatment prior to performing the TUNEL assay (In Situ Cell Death Detection Kit, Fluorescein, Millipore-Sigma). Embryos were incubated in 200 µl of a 1:10 dilution of enzyme in label solution for 2 hr at 37°C. Embryos were then washed twice with blocking solution for 10 min each, and then mounted in a 1 to 400 dilution of DRAQ5 in blocking solution to stain DNA.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Embryo genotyping</title><p>To determine embryo genotypes, embryos were collected after imaging and genomic DNA extracted using the Extract-N-Amp kit (Sigma) in a final volume of 10 µl.

A lightly edited version of the letter sent to the authors after peer review is shown, indicating the most substantive concerns; minor comments are not usually included.</p></boxed-text><p>[Editors’ note: a previous version of this study was rejected after peer review, but the authors submitted for reconsideration. The first decision letter after peer review is shown below.]</p><p>Thank you for submitting your work entitled &quot;HIPPO provides a fail-safe for resolving embryonic cell fate conflicts during establishment of pluripotency in vivo&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by two peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and a Senior Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>Our decision has been reached after consultation between the reviewers. Based on these discussions and the individual reviews below, we regret to inform you that in its current state your manuscript will not be considered further for publication in <italic>eLife</italic>.</p><p>However as you will see both reviewers were very positive and feel that your genetic approach certainly has provided further insights into lineage segregation in the early embryo. However the biggest issue is that the study is a bit premature given the small numbers of embryos you've been able to analyse to date. If you can considerably improve the manuscript along the lines suggested by the reviewers, including expanding the samples sizes for critical genotypes we would be happy to see a major revision of the paper in the coming months, which would be considered as a new submission.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic> </p><p>In this paper, the authors investigate further the mechanism of restriction of <italic>Sox2</italic> expression to the ICM during early mouse development. As the blastocyst forms, there is a segregation of expression of key lineage-specific transcription factors for the outer trophectoderm (TE) (Cdx2) and the pluripotent ICM (<italic>Sox2</italic>), which is regulated by the Hippo signaling pathway. They previously showed that <italic>Sox2</italic> is activated (probably indirectly) and Cdx2 inactivated by active Lats kinase function in the inside cells that will form the ICM. <italic>Sox2</italic> is regulated independently of Cdx2. Here they explore further this regulatory interaction by making floxed alleles of both <italic>Yap</italic> and <italic>Wwtr1</italic>, the redundant coactivators downstream of Hippo signaling. This enabled them to make a dosage series of maternal and zygotically inactivated alleles of the two proteins, demonstrating their redundant nature, the requirement for maternal protein and the fact that <italic>Sox2</italic> is more sensitive to reduced dosage than is Cdx2. They then went on to ask whether Lats kinase acts through Yap to mediate cell position during the cleavage stages leading up to blastocyst formation. They claim that overexpressing Lats2 reduces expression of PARD6B and aPKCz in cells and leads to their internalization, alongside a reduction in the number of outside versus inside cells.</p><p>Overall this is a carefully carried out study that provides some more insights into the mechanisms of the first lineage segregation in the mouse embryo. The strength of the paper is the description of the allelic series of mutations in <italic>Yap/Wwtr1</italic>, which have not been previously described. All previous studies depended largely on dominant negative and overexpression studies, which have their limitations. What is less strong is the section proposing a direct role for Lats in regulating polarity via downregulation of PARD6B and aPKCz. This underlies their model that Hippo signaling interaction with polarity components acts as a failsafe feedback mechanism to ensure lineage segregation. As outlined below, the data as presented raise some issues that need further resolution. In addition, there is no clear molecular mechanism proposed by which Lats activity would regulate specifically PARD6B and aPKCz and not other polarity components including the actin domain and phospho-ERM. The linkage between Lats, the apical domain, ROCK, etc. is presented in a model but there are many missing links in the model and a failure to link to other models of how polarity is thought to control Hippo signaling.</p><p>1) The first section on ROCK1/2 being upstream regulators of Cdx2 and <italic>Sox2</italic> expression is not well connected to the rest of the paper. They also did not actually look at the effects of Rocki on both Cdx2 and <italic>Sox2</italic> in the same embryos. Are the outside cells that remain <italic>Sox2</italic>-ve expressing Cdx2? Inhibition of Rock has multiple effects on the cell- which downstream response do they consider to be the critical one? Are they proposing a direct effect on Lats- as shown in Figure 7? Or the more usually suggested effect on the cortical actin domain, thus disrupting the segregation of Lats2? Or an effect on aPKC? All might be possible, but do they have any evidence for one versus the other?</p><p>2) Much of the conclusion on the involvement of <italic>Yap/WWtr1</italic> and Lats on changing the behavior of cells depends on the scoring of cells as inside or outside. The authors define inside cells as &quot;appearing inside and showing uniform CDH1 over the cell surface&quot;. It is not clear exactly how these criteria were applied. What does it mean to 'appear' internal? 3D reconstructed from z stacks or just estimated from midline optical sections? I am not sure that this is a very accurate way to determine inner and outer cells and indeed they note that uniform CDH1 was not always a good predictor of position. This is a key point, because they then go on to claim that loss of <italic>Yap/WWTr1</italic> or activation of Lats leads not just to internalization of Lats-overexpressing cells, but to a shift in the actual proportion of inside and outside cells, with loss of outside and gain of inside cells. It is hard to understand how this can occur topologically, if the total cell number is unchanged, because reduction in outside cells would presumably lead to bulging of inside cells to the outside. Or are they proposing that the reduced number of outside cells somehow stretch out over the enlarged group of inner cells? The resolution of the images provided does not really resolve this issue.</p><p>3) It is not clear to me how the apparent reduction in expression of PARD6B and aPKCz in Lats-overexpressing cells is proposed to alter polarity and contractility, leading to internalization of the cells, given that the cells actually remain polarized as judged by other markers. Are they proposing a specific phosphorylation event that would alter cell polarity and contractility? Recent work from other labs has suggested that differential contractility is key to internalization of blastomeres during cleavage (e.g. Maitre et al., 2016)- have they looked at actomyosin? What happens to other components of the Hippo signaling pathway?</p><p>4) The model proposed in Figure 7 has ROCK as the factor linking the cell membrane to Lats regulation, but no specific mechanism is proposed. This model does not include the data from the Sasaki lab suggesting that the apical actin domain in the outside cells binds Lats and segregates it from its active complex with Nf2/Angiomotin/E-cadherin, thus reducing Hippo signaling in outside cells. ROCK could be involved in regulating the cortical actin domain, but has several other roles in the cell. A more comprehensive model, including data from other groups should be developed.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic> </p><p>The manuscript by Frum and Ralston reports an analysis of the role of the Hippo signalling pathway during the differentiation between trophectoderm and ICM.</p><p>They first show that the exclusion of SOX2, an inner cell marker, from outer cells depends on the activity of Rock as the use of a pharmacological inhibitor causes SOX2 expression in outer cells. The ectopic expression of a constitutively activated YAP prevents SOX2 expression in inner cells, showing nuclear Yap inhibition on SOX2 expression. This data reinforces their previous findings using Tead4 loss of function.</p><p>They then analysed the loss of function of <italic>Yap1</italic> and <italic>Wwtr</italic> genes in compound mutants. Their analysis shows that the phenotypes are linked to the number of alleles present, in a dose dependent manner, and that maternal expression partially rescues the loss of zygotic expression. The lower the dose of &quot;Yap/Wwtr&quot;, the less CDX2 expression in outer cells and the more SOX2 expression in outer cells. They nicely show that completely removing the alleles by maternal-zygotic double deletion fully abolishes CDX2 expression and causes SOX2 expression in all the cells. Moreover, the loss of &quot;Yap/Wwtr&quot; is also correlated with a lower number of outside cells. Gain of function experiments with ectopic expression of Lats not only induced ectopic SOX2 expression but also decreases the number of outer cells and increases the number of inside cells. This lead them to the conclusion that ectopic Lats expression induces inside cell repositioning. Ectopic Lats expression phenotype can be partially rescued by co-expressing constitutively activated YAP. The mutation of <italic>Sox2</italic> does not interfere with YAP expression and activity, showing that SOX2 is only a marker (an important one) but not an actor. Finally, using Lats ectopic expression in outside cells, they show that the Hippo pathway can strikingly downregulate some polarity markers (Pard6B/aPKCz) but maintain others (Cdh1, pERM).</p><p>Their results are clearly described. They report an important analysis of Yap;Wwtr compound mutants, an involvement of the Hippo pathway for cell (re-)positioning and an effect of ectopically activated Hippo in outside cells on cell polarisation.</p><p>I suggest to address the following points:</p><p>1) The number of mutants is very low even if the phenotype seems to be fully penetrant. Would it be possible to increase the numbers, at least for the MZ-double mutants (2 is very/too small).</p><p>2) What is the proportion of outside cell death in these mutant embryos?</p><p>3) It is proposed that caYAP can rescue cell survival in Lats overexpressing cells.
