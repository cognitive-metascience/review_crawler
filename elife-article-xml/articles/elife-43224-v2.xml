We show that EBA-175 shed from parasites promotes clustering of RBCs, and EBA-175-dependent clusters occur in parasite culture. Region II of EBA-175 is sufficient for clustering RBCs in a GpA-dependent manner. These clusters are capable of forming under physiological flow conditions and across a range of concentrations. EBA-175-dependent RBC clustering provides daughter merozoites ready access to uninfected RBCs enhancing parasite growth. Clustering provides a general method to protect the invasion machinery from immune recognition and disruption as exemplified by protection from neutralizing antibodies that target AMA-1 and RH5. These findings provide a mechanistic framework for the role of shed proteins in RBC clustering, immune evasion, and malaria.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>malaria</kwd><kwd>antibody</kwd><kwd>evasion</kwd><kwd>growth</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>P. falciparum</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000861</institution-id><institution>Burroughs Wellcome Fund</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Tolia</surname><given-names>Niraj H</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000060</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Intramural Research Program</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Tolia</surname><given-names>Niraj H</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000060</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Extramural Research Program AI080792</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Tolia</surname><given-names>Niraj H</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value><italic>Plasmodium falciparum</italic> invasion protein EBA-175, once shed from the parasite surface post invasion, facilitates RBC clustering and enhances parasite growth while simultaneously enabling parasite immune evasion of host neutralizing antibodies.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p><italic>Plasmodium falciparum</italic> is a causative agent of malaria that alternates between an insect vector and a human host. Within the human host, the parasite undergoes an asymptomatic exo-erythrocytic cycle followed by a symptomatic erythrocytic cycle. During the erythrocytic cycle, merozoite stage parasites invade red blood cells (RBCs) to initiate asexual replication. This is followed by parasite egress from cells and subsequent reinvasion of uninfected RBCs by daughter merozoites. Invasion of RBCs by parasites is a multistage process characterized by 1) initial weak engagement of the RBC by the parasite, 2) apical reorientation of the parasite and strong anchoring to the RBC, 3) tight junction formation, 4) active invasion utilizing an actin-myosin motor, and 5) shedding of the surface proteins of the parasite (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Cowman et al., 2017</xref>). Invasion culminates in the formation of a parasitophorous vacuole surrounding the parasite within the RBC.</p><p>Erythrocyte Binding Antigen of 175 kDa (EBA-175) is a <italic>P. falciparum</italic> protein that binds to the host receptor glycophorin A (GpA) and this interaction has a well-defined role in anchoring the parasite during invasion of erythrocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Orlandi et al., 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Orlandi et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Klotz et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Sim et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Salinas and Tolia, 2014a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Liang and Sim, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Sim, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Duraisingh et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Tolia et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Wanaguru et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chen et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Salinas et al., 2014b</xref>).

The minimal binding domain of EBA-175, region II (RII), is comprised of two DBL domains, F1 and F2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>), which together bind to GpA to form a tight junction between the parasite and RBC in the initial stages of invasion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Sim et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Salinas and Tolia, 2014a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Tolia et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Salinas et al., 2014b</xref>). Binding of GpA induces EBA-175 dimerization to facilitate high avidity associations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Salinas and Tolia, 2014a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Tolia et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Wanaguru et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Salinas et al., 2014b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Paing and Tolia, 2014</xref>). This binding is dependent on the terminal sialic acid residues of <italic>O</italic>-linked glycans on the extracellular domain of GpA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Orlandi et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Sim et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Salinas and Tolia, 2014a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Wanaguru et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Salinas et al., 2014b</xref>). Removal of sialic acid by neuraminidase or specific mutation of <italic>O</italic>-linked glycans ablates binding both in direct protein:protein interactions and in parasite culture (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Salinas et al., 2014b</xref>). These specific <italic>O</italic>-linked glycans on GpA also allow for the specificity of EBA-175 for GpA over its highly related family member glycophorin B (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Salinas et al., 2014b</xref>).</p><p>Merozoites use a diverse array of proteins to ensure attachment to and invasion of RBCs. Many of these proteins are involved in establishing a tight junction during invasion and antibodies to these proteins are known to prevent invasion and reduce parasite growth. The interaction with GpA can be blocked by antibodies (Abs) that target the dimer interface and glycan binding pockets of EBA-175 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chen et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Ambroggio et al., 2013</xref>). Ab-217, a mouse monoclonal that targets these regions, has an IC<sub>50</sub> of 0.1 mg/mL for parasites and can block binding of EBA-175 to GpA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chen et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Sim et al., 2011</xref>). Ab-218, another mouse monoclonal that targets a non-functional epitope in EBA-175, does not block this interaction and has minimal effects on parasite viability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chen et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Sim et al., 2011</xref>). These studies highlight the established role of membrane-anchored EBA-175 in binding GpA during <italic>P. falciparum</italic> invasion of erythrocytes. In addition to the EBL family, the reticulocyte-binding protein homologue (RH) family of proteins contains multiple members; each recognizing distinct receptors on RBCs during invasion. RH5, a member of the RH family, binds to the RBC receptor basigin, which is essential for invasion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Crosnier et al., 2011</xref>). Post-attachment, another parasite protein, AMA1, binds to a parasite protein RON2, which is inserted into the RBC plasma membrane; this interaction is crucial for the active invasion of RBCs by the parasite (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Vulliez-Le Normand et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Srinivasan et al., 2011</xref>). Both RH5 and AMA1 are promising vaccine candidates for malaria and are targets of neutralizing Abs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Douglas et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>In this study, we establish a role for shed EBA-175 in RBC clustering and examine the biological consequences of this phenomenon. We embarked on this line of investigation after observing potent clustering of red blood cells upon addition of the binding domain of EBA-175 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Koch et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Salinas and Tolia, 2014a</xref>). Here, we demonstrate that purified endogenously shed EBA-175 promotes RBC clustering and that recombinant soluble RII domain of EBA-175 is sufficient to promote RBC clustering in a GpA-dependent manner. This RII-mediated red cell clustering enhances parasite growth by providing daughter merozoites ready access to uninfected RBCs. Furthermore, we demonstrate that RII-mediated RBC clustering confers protection from neutralizing Abs that target diverse heterologous invasion proteins. This study highlights that a soluble, not a membrane-anchored, parasite protein can promote clustering of RBCs which may contribute to malaria pathogenesis by enhancing parasite growth and facilitating immune evasion. Over two hundred million new cases of malaria are reported worldwide annually with an estimated half a million deaths. The majority of these deaths are due to severe malaria caused by <italic>Plasmodium falciparum</italic> parasites. EBA-175-mediated clustering may facilitate the high parasite burdens observed during severe malaria, protect parasites from antibody recognition, and prevent infected erythrocyte clearance.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Shed EBA-175 purified from parasite culture induces RBC clustering</title><p>EBA-175 is shed by the parasite during invasion.

High parasitemia may occur in the micro environment of capillaries where infected RBCs are sequestered allowing for localized parasite multiplication. However, determining levels of native EBA-175 in blood drawn from infected individuals would be complicated by the fact that shed EBA-175 binds to uninfected RBCs and would not be freely available in serum. A large FSC-A signal was seen in the untreated NF54-GFP-Luc cultures. To assess if the large particle size seen was due to EBA-175 mediated RBC clustering, 30 µM Ab-217 orAb-218 were added to the culture after the reinvasion step to exclude the invasion-blocking effects of the Ab. Approximately 12 hr post addition of the Ab and before the next round of egress, the particle size in culture was analyzed by flow cytometry. The cultures in the presence of Ab-217 contained significantly fewer clusters in the gated population (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref> bottom panel). All samples showed high levels of GFP demonstrating the Ab treatments had no effect on parasite invasion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref> top panel). This is expected as the cultures were treated with Abs at a time point to exclude invasion inhibition effects.

Immune evasion has long been suspected in <italic>Plasmodium</italic> infections. However, neither the molecular basis for this process nor how it might relate to disease pathogenesis have been fully defined. The results support a model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>) in which shed EBA-175, perhaps in conjunction with other membrane-anchored proteins, facilitates formation of RBC clusters to benefit parasite growth and survival. During infection, EBA-175 on the surface of parasites interacts with GpA on the surface of RBCs during invasion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Sim et al., 1994</xref>). Post invasion, we and others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">O'Donnell et al., 2006</xref>) have shown that EBA-175 is released into the surrounding environment where it binds to uninfected RBCs, facilitating EBA-175- and GpA-dependent clustering of naïve RBCs around the infected RBCs. Red cell clustering subsequently confers protection from antibodies and the immune system, promoting efficient invasion of adjacent uninfected RBCs by daughter merozoites. The enhancement of invasion into adjacent uninfected RBCs leads to an increase in parasite growth and the process perpetuates through the next round of uninfected RBC recruitment. We observed red cell clustering and growth enhancement at picomolar concentrations of EBA-175 implying that this phenomenon could exist in vivo. These concentrations are likely achievable during malaria infection particularly in the capillaries and extremities of blood vessels. This may be a mechanism, along with rosetting afforded by membrane-anchored proteins, for the high parasitemia seen in severe malaria through enhancement of parasite growth and immune evasion.</p><fig id="fig5" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.43224.012</object-id><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><title>Model of the parasite survival and immune evasion mediated by EBA-175.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Merozoite (purple) secretes EBA-175 to the apical end for engagement of GpA.

This phenomenon may be relevant for the interpretation of the data generated from EBA-175-based vaccines in clinical trials. Additional studies are needed to examine whether this phenomenon extends to Abs that target additional parasite proteins, and if antibodies that occur in natural infection block EBA-175 or other EBL family member-mediated red cell clustering. The model proposed is consistent with synergistic inhibition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Ord et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Williams et al., 2012</xref>) observed when α-EBA-175 and α-RH5 antibodies are used in combination. The model indicates that the synergistic inhibition arises as EBA-175 red cell clustering is prevented, allowing for increased inhibition by α-RH5 Abs. Additionally, other EBL family members, along with numerous other parasite proteins that are vaccine candidates, are released during infection. The model and data presented here forms a strong foundation for the future study of clustering and its role in immune evasion in patient populations. In addition, this study forms a framework to examine the breadth and depth of proteins that can facilitate RBC clustering and immune evasion.</p><p>The clustering phenomenon reported here exhibits similarities to <italic>P. falciparum</italic> rosetting attributed to the parasite membrane proteins PfEMP1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Rowe et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Moll et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Chen et al., 1998</xref>), RIFINs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Goel et al., 2015</xref>) and STEVORs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Niang et al., 2014</xref>). PfEMP-1 is related to the EBL family as it contains multiple DBL domains including the DBLα domain which binds to the RBC receptor CR1 during sequestration of rosettes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Rowe et al., 1997</xref>). RIFINs bind to blood group A RBCs to form rosettes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Goel et al., 2015</xref>) and may bind to GpA on RBCs to mediate rosetting (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Goel et al., 2015</xref>). STEVORs bind to RBCs through glycophorin C (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Niang et al., 2014</xref>). Similarly, the EBL protein EBA-140 also binds glycophorin C and may serve a parallel role (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Lobo et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Malpede et al., 2013</xref>). However, evidence of growth enhancement and immune protection from Abs due to rosetting has yet to be reported. Further studies are necessary to determine if additional members of the EBL family can also promote RBC clustering and enhance growth of parasites. It is also important to note that both PfEMP1 and RIFINs appear to prefer type A blood for rosetting and show minimal binding to type O blood (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Goel et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Vigan-Womas et al., 2012</xref>). Red cell clustering defined here is independent of blood type and provides a novel pathway for RBC clustering that complements PfEMP1, RIFINs or STEVORs.</p><p>Individuals in regions endemic for malaria develop partial immunity to all parasite invasion ligands and yet incidences of severe malaria still occur. The evidence we provide here offers three mechanisms by which this may occur. The first mechanism is that EBA-175-mediated enhancement of growth simply outpaces the ability of the immune system to target parasites and prevent invasion. The second is that RBC clustering limits the time window of antigen exposure to neutralizing antibodies during the rapid invasion of an adjacent RBC, preventing Ab access. The third is that RBC clustering may block physical access of the antibodies to parasites during invasion. These mechanisms are not mutually exclusive and the true mechanism may be a combination of the three. These studies underline the need to explore the role of the EBL family of proteins in pathogenesis of malaria beyond the tight junction formation.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Protein expression and purification</title><p>RII, RII-6xHis, F1, and F2 were expressed and purified as described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Salinas and Tolia, 2014a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chen et al., 2013</xref>).

Briefly, a µ-slide VI 0.4 (dimensions: 400 µm × 3.8 mm×17 mm) constructed of optical quality polymer.

To generate the flow rate, chips were connected to an NE-1002X syringe pump (World Precision Instruments, U.K.) All measurements of clusters under physiological shear stress where conducted within the area of homogenous shear stress. For µ-slide I 0.4, this is at least 400 µm away from the channel walls; following manufacturer’s recommendations, all observations are made down the central line of the slide (see Application Note AN-11, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://ibidi.com/">https://ibidi.com/</ext-link>).

The first decision letter after peer review is shown below.]</p><p>Thank you for submitting your work entitled &quot;Shed EBA-175 mediates red blood cell clustering that enhances malaria parasite growth and enables immune evasion&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Senior Editor. The following individuals involved in review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Richard Culleton (Reviewer #2).</p><p>Our decision has been reached after consultation between the reviewers. Based on these discussions and the individual reviews below, we regret to inform you that your work will not be considered further for publication in <italic>eLife</italic>.</p><p>In this nicely written manuscript, the authors show that shed <italic>Plasmodium falciparum</italic> EBA-175 mediates red cell clustering during parasite invasion and hence promotes parasite growth and also enables immune evasion. Although EBA-175 has been widely investigated and many aspects of this glycophorin binding protein are known, the function of the shed EBA-175 has not been defined. By performing a series of well-designed experiments, the authors expanded our understanding of this protein crucial for the survival of the parasite and a possible target for malaria vaccine.</p><p>The reviewers have also expressed major concerns and those are included in each individual review attached below. The main issue surrounds the lack of results in support of the authors claim concerning EBA-175-mediated clustering as a possible mechanism that may be occurring in vivo. The hypothesis that EBA-175 aggregated red blood cells may in fact contribute to pathogenesis in natural <italic>Plasmodium falciparum</italic> infection is indeed attractive. Therefore, the in vitro phenomenon should be replicated in vivo under physiological conditions and that may necessitate a substantial body of extra work and revision to validate the main hypothesis. In addition, validation of the purification of shed EBA-175, description and validation of flow cytometry data, and the number biological replicates needs to be included.</p><p>Should the authors perform the suggested experiments and provide data in support of their claims, they are encouraged to submit their manuscript as a new submission.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic> </p><p>The authors describe their observations concerning an interesting phenomenon, namely the shedding of EB-175 during <italic>Plasmodium</italic> infection of red blood cells. This shed EB-175 (actually a fragment of EBA-175 called RII is the main component that binds to GpA on RBC) not only potentiates the growth of the parasites by inducing agglutination or clustering of RBC, but it also causes or leads to immune evasion by preventing antibodies to access the parasite.</p><p>From my quick read of this manuscript I was quite excited about the EBA-175 story from Niraj Tolia's lab and thought the paper worthwhile for an external review. Upon closer reviewing and particularly examining the results and the approach, my enthusiasm has somewhat diminished. They support their claim of the shed EBA-175-induced clustering by showing that antibodies against EBA-175 do prevent this clustering, whereby in the absence of these antibodies, the parasites do expand/grow. This is shown in Figure 3 with Ab-217 that prevent parasite growth. However, I am not clear about this particular representation of their data mainly because nowhere in the manuscript do the authors provide adequate explanations about this particular manner of data presentation, stats, normalization, etc.</p><p>In essence, I have some concern about the veracity of some of the results given the number of biological replicates as in the case of results shown in Figure 1C, which represent a single biological replicate, of 5 technical replicates. Similarly, the results in Figure 2B that demonstrate the clustering effect brought about by RII, at titrated concentration, and not by F1 or F2, appear to be from a single biological replicate; the figure legend is not particularly informative. Similar concern is directed to results in Figure 2D where the authors show that treating Plasmodium RBC cultures with NA and with antibodies to GpA also inhibits clustering.

The authors hypothesise that this clustering of non-infected red blood cells (RBCs) around infected RBCs (iRBCs) also occurs in natural infections of <italic>P. falciparum</italic>, and that it benefits the parasite by increasing replication rates through reducing the amount of time required for daughter merozoites to encounter new RBCs to invade, and through shielding of the iRBC from the action of growth and invasion inhibitory antibodies.</p><p>The experiments that show that clustering occurs in in vitro cultures, and that this can be mediated through shed RII of EBA-175, are on the surface well thought out and conducted, but could be made greatly more robust by validation of the purification of shed EBA-175, and description and validation of the flow cytometry data.</p><p>Moreover, the author's interpretation of the utility of this phenomenon to the parasite is based on the assumption that clustering also occurs in vivo. I think that the authors need to present evidence that 'clusters' are viable under the large stresses and shear forces encountered in the host blood stream, and that they remain viable under these conditions for the 48 hours required for the daughter merozoites to egress from the original iRBC. Apparatus and protocols for measuring the effects of flow on malaria parasite iRBCs are well established (e.g. flow chamber type experiments such as Dasanna et al., 2017), and would benefit this work immensely. I feel that without evidence that clustering could occur in vivo, the authors are overreaching in their interpretation of the significance of these results. I recommend that the authors test the robustness of these clusters under relevant physiological conditions in flow chamber experiments.

Without firm evidence that clustering occurs in vivo under typical physiological conditions, the speculation pertaining to the advantages effects of cluster formation is not justified based on the experimental evidence presented here. The authors have shown convincingly that EBA-175 mediated clustering occurs in in vitro cultures, and that this can lead to increased parasite growth rates, but their experiments do not show that this occurs in natural infections.</p><p>Discussion, first paragraph: 'uninfected' should be used instead of 'naïve'.</p><p>Discussion, second paragraph: The situation regarding EBL and virulence in <italic>P. yoelii</italic> is more complicated than the authors describe. The redirected localisation of EBL from the micronemes to the dense granules that occurs as a result of a mutation in R6 of EBL in 17XL, leads to a change in red blood cell tropism; from a predilection for the invasion of reticulocytes to the ability to invade RBCs of all ages. This change in RBC cell invasion preference cannot be explained through enhanced clustering. Furthermore, it has also been shown that another mutation in PyEBL, this time in RII, also increases virulence (again through an increase in the RBC invasion repertoire), but does not lead to localisation away from the micronemes (Abkallo et al., 2017).</p><p>References:</p><p>Abkallo HM, Martinello A, Inoue M, Xangsayarath P, Gitaka J, Yahata K, … Culleton R.

However, EBA-175 is shed post invasion and a role for this shed protein has not been defined. The authors showed that EBA-175 shed from parasites promotes clustering of RBCs. Region II of EBA-175 is sufficient for clustering RBCs in a GpA-dependent manner. EBA-175-dependent RBC clustering enhances parasite growth and provides a general method to protect the invasion machinery from immune recognition. Finally, they proposed a mechanistic framework for the role of shed EBA-175 in RBC clustering, immune evasion, and severe malaria.

Please consider to remove.</p><p>4) Subsection “EBA-175-RII-mediated RBC clustering confers parasites protection from diverse neutralizing Abs”, last paragraph: To interpret the results described here, the authors should pay more careful attention to the timings when RH5, AMA1 and EBA-175 works during merozoite invasion into the erythrocyte.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic> </p><p>In this eloquent manuscript, the authors investigate the phenomenon whereby EBA-175 shed by <italic>Plasmodium</italic> parasites during invasion promotes red blood cell clustering in culture. They show that the clustering is mediated by the glycophorin A binding region of EBA-175, called RII. Intriguingly, they observe that addition of recombinant RII protein to generate RBC clusters both enhances parasite growth and serves as an immune evasion strategy by hindering access of invasion-inhibitory antibodies.</p><p>The authors clearly demonstrate the EBA-175-mediated clustering of RBCs in vitro, and have revised an earlier version of the manuscript to include evidence that clustering occurs under conditions approximating physiological flow conditions. However, there is no in vivo evidence for EBA-175 mediated clustering, such as the observation of clusters from patients, or an estimate of the blood concentration of EBA-175 (which latter the authors posit is not possible). As a result, the authors' hypothesis that EBA-175-mediated clustering plays a role in enhancing parasite growth and immune evasion in severe malaria is speculative. Further, there is controversy surrounding the function of rosetting in vivo – as the authors point out in the Discussion, there is limited experimental evidence that rosetting leads to increased parasitemia or immune evasion. Nevertheless, I agree with the authors' comment that field studies are beyond the scope of this paper. In light of this, I would suggest that the authors make a point in the Discussion that their model still needs to be validated in vivo.</p><p>Overall I think this work is interesting and novel, and the experiments well-designed, well-executed, and well-presented.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.43224.016</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p>[Editors’ note: the author responses to the first round of peer review follow.]</p><p>We appreciate the in-depth review and have revised the manuscript to address the reviewers’ concerns.

Upon closer reviewing and particularly examining the results and the approach, my enthusiasm has somewhat diminished. They support their claim of the shed FBA-175- induced clustering by showing that antibodies against EBA-175 do prevent this clustering, whereby in the absence of these antibodies, the parasites do expand/grow. This is shown in Figure 3 with Ab-217 that prevent parasite growth. However, I am not clear about this particular representation of their data mainly because nowhere in the manuscript do the authors provide adequate explanations about this particular manner of data presentation, stats, normalization, etc.</p><p>In essence, I have some concern about the veracity of some of the results given the number of biological replicates as in the case of results shown in Figure 1C, which represent a single biological replicate, of 5 technical replicates. Similarly, the results in Figure 2B that demonstrate the clustering effect brought about by RII, at titrated concentration, and not by F1 or F2, appear to be from a single biological replicate; the figure legend is not particularly informative. Similar concern is directed to results in Figure 2D where the authors show that treating Plasmodium RBC cultures with NA and with antibodies to GpA also inhibits clustering. It is not clear if the differences between untreated and treated are significant? Subsection “EBA-173f RII promotes RBC clusters in a GpA dependent manner” – the results are poorly described. In general, although the in vitro results are interesting, some results are difficult to understand.</p></disp-quote><p>We apologize that the number of replicates for each experiment was not adequately presented. A thorough explanation of the number of technical and biological replicates in each experiment was added to the manuscript (in figure legends and in text).

This is primarily because the EBA-175/GpA interaction is not replicated in mouse models of malaria. EBA-175 cannot bind murine glycophorin A. This lack of binding is due to a modification on the sialic acid of mouse Oglycan that is not found in humans. In addition, there is no direct ortholog of EBA-175 that can be studied in mice. A CRISPR/Cas9 knock out of EBA-175 would also not add to the manuscript as traditional knock outs of EBA-175 show little to no phenotype in culture.

It is unclear what additional negative controls will provide.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Figure 3: Can the authors propose a reason for the fact that the growth of Dd2 is enhanced to greater degree than the other strains? Does Dd2 grow more slowly than the other strains under normal culture conditions? Could it be that the merozoites of Dd2 have shorter viable life spans than merozoites of the other strains?</p></disp-quote><p>All strains used in experiments have between 45-48 hr life cycle, therefore the cycle time and life span is unlikely to contribute to the higher growth rate observed for Dd2. It is evident that the specific increase in growth by Dd2 is due to multiple factors and we do not wish to overly speculate in one direction or another. The exact mechanism for enhanced growth by Dd2 does not alter the main conclusions and focus of the manuscript that EBA-175 clustering enhances parasite growth and protects from neutralizing antibodies.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Figure 4: Again, another region of EBA-175 might make an appropriate negative control here.</p></disp-quote><p>F1 and F2 individual domains of RII have already shown not to induce enhanced parasite growth in Figure 3B.

Without firm evidence that clustering occurs in vivo under typical physiological conditions, the speculation pertaining to the advantages effects of cluster formation is not justified based on the experimental evidence presented here. The authors have shown convincingly that EBA-175 mediated clustering occurs in in vitro cultures, and that this can lead to increased parasite growth rates, but their experiments do not show that this occurs in natural infections.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer that examining clustering under physiologically relevant flow conditions establishes the in vivo role for this phenomenon.

The redirected localisation of EBL from the micronemes to the dense granules that occurs as a result of a mutation in R6 of EBL in 17XL, leads to a change in red blood cell tropism; from a predilection for the invasion of reticulocytes to the ability to invade RBCs of all ages. This change in RBC cell invasion preference cannot be explained through enhanced clustering. Furthermore, it has also been shown that another mutation in PyEBL, this time in RII, also increases virulence (again through an increase in the RBC invasion repertoire), but does not lead to localisation away from the micronemes (Abkallo et al., 2017).</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer that the relationship of clustering to virulence in <italic>P. yoelii</italic> is complex.

However, there is no in vivo evidence for EBA-175 mediated clustering, such as the observation of clusters from patients, or an estimate of the blood concentration of EBA-175 (which latter the authors posit is not possible). As a result, the authors' hypothesis that EBA-175-mediated clustering plays a role in enhancing parasite growth and immune evasion in severe malaria is speculative. Further, there is controversy surrounding the function of rosetting in vivo – as the authors point out in the Discussion, there is limited experimental evidence that rosetting leads to increased parasitemia or immune evasion. Nevertheless, I agree with the authors' comment that field studies are beyond the scope of this paper. In light of this, I would suggest that the authors make a point in the Discussion that their model still needs to be validated in vivo.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for their response and have included the following sentence in the Discussion: “The model and data presented here forms a strong foundation for the future study of clustering and its role in immune evasion in patient populations.”</p></body></sub-article></article>
