Using a system comprising the plant virus <italic>Rice stripe virus</italic> (RSV) and its vector insect, the small brown planthopper, we have studied the response of the vector insect’s JNK pathway to plant virus infection. We found that RSV increased the level of Tumor Necrosis Factor-α and decreased the level of G protein Pathway Suppressor 2 (GPS2) in the insect vector. The virus capsid protein competitively bound GPS2 to release it from inhibiting the JNK activation machinery. We confirmed that JNK activation promoted RSV replication in the vector, whereas JNK inhibition caused a significant reduction in virus production and thus delayed the disease incidence of plants. These findings suggest that inhibition of insect vector JNK may be a useful strategy for controling the transmission of plant viruses.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.26591.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.26591.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.26591.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>There are over a thousand different viruses that infect plants. Many plant viruses are transmitted by insects that feed on the plants, much as mosquitoes spread diseases between people when feeding on blood. Often the plant virus can replicate inside the cells of the insect. However, unlike in the plant hosts, the viruses do not seem to cause disease in the insects that carry them.</p><p>Rice stripe disease is a major viral disease of rice that can reduce the crop’s yield by more than 50% in some areas. An insect called the small brown planthopper spreads the rice stripe virus between plants. Like other animals, insects have an immune system that protects them against viral infections. This means that the rice stripe virus must manipulate the planthopper’s immune system in order to replicate inside the insect’s cells. It was not clear how the virus did this, but answering this question could provide important clues to help scientists develop new ways to protect crops against plant viruses.</p><p>Wang, Zhao, Li et al. now show that rice stripe virus manipulates its insect host to produce more of a protein called TNF-α and less of a protein called GPS2. Moreover, a protein that makes up part of the virus also binds to GPS2. This stops GPS2 from inhibiting a conserved signaling pathway that involves an enzyme known as JNK. When the JNK signaling pathway becomes active, replication of the rice stripe virus inside the insect is accelerated. Further experiments showed that inhibiting JNK made it harder for the virus to replicate, which meant that it took longer for the disease to develop in rice plants.</p><p>These findings uncover a host of proteins that could be manipulated in insects to benefit rice agriculture. Such alterations could possibly be achieved through breeding or otherwise genetically modifying the insects to make them less able to carry viruses and then releasing them into wild populations. Alternatively, if further studies can identify chemicals that cause insect cells to alter the levels of the proteins, such chemicals could be administered to farmland to reduce the spread of viruses.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.26591.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.26591.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>plant virus</kwd><kwd>rice stripe virus</kwd><kwd>small brown planthopper</kwd><kwd>JNK</kwd><kwd>GPS2</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd>Virus</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100002367</institution-id><institution>Chinese Academy of Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Strategic Priority Research Program XDB11040200</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Cui</surname><given-names>Feng</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100002855</institution-id><institution>Ministry of Science and Technology of the People's Republic of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Major State Basic Research Development Program of China 2014CB13840402</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Cui</surname><given-names>Feng</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001809</institution-id><institution>National Natural Science Foundation of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>L1524009</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kang</surname><given-names>Le</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100002367</institution-id><institution>Chinese Academy of Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Grant of State Key Laboratory of Integrated Management of Pest Insects and Rodents ChineseIPM1604</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Cui</surname><given-names>Feng</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Plant viruses enhance their replication in vector insects by activating the vector's JNK pathway, and inhibition of this pathway may be a useful strategy for controlling transmission of plant viruses.</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>eLife Digest</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Most plant viruses depend on sap-feeding insects from the order Hemiptera for their transmission (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Hogenhout et al., 2008</xref>). The success and efficiency of virus transmission, especially for the persistent-propagative viruses, depend on specific interactions between the virus and proteins of the vector insects, allowing transport of the virus in and out of insect tissues and overcoming insect immune reactions for successful replication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Blanc et al., 2014</xref>). A detailed knowledge of the vector proteins that participate in viral transmission and replication could provide important clues for the development of control strategies to plant viruses.</p><p><italic>Rice stripe virus</italic> (RSV), a member of the genus <italic>Tenuivirus</italic>, causes rice stripe disease, one of the most notorious rice diseases in temperate and subtropical East Asia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Toriyama, 1986</xref>). RSV is transmitted mainly by the small brown planthopper, <italic>Laodelphax striatellus</italic>, in a persistent, circulative-propagative manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Toriyama, 1986</xref>). As with most persistent-propagative viruses, RSV cannot be transmitted directly between plants in the field, and there is a large difference in pathogenicity of the virus from the insect vectors and from the viruliferous plants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Zhao et al., 2016b</xref>). The viral genome consists of four single-stranded RNA segments and encodes seven proteins: RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, NS2 (RNA silencing suppressor), NSvc2 (putative membrane glycoprotein), NS3 (gene-silencing suppressor), CP (capsid protein), SP (nonstructural disease-specific protein), and NSvc4 (movement protein) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Cui et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Du et al., 2011</xref>). CP is the most abundant viral protein and plays a crucial role in the retention and movement of the virus in the insect vector (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Blanc et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>Direct interaction between insect vector proteins and RSV proteins has been established, but knowledge about the functions of these vector proteins is limited. Numerous proteins from small brown planthopper interact with CP of RSV, such as atlasin, cuticular protein CPR1, jagunal, NAC domain protein, ribosomal proteins RPL5, RPL7a and RPL8, and vitellogenin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Huo et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Li et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Liu et al., 2015</xref>). There is evidence that cuticular protein CPR1 and vitellogenin, but not other vector proteins, affect RSV accumulation and transmission by binding with viral CP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Huo et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Liu et al., 2015</xref>). RSV NS3 protein is able to attenuate the 26S proteasome- mediated host defense response by interacting directly with the planthopper RPN3 protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Xu et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>G protein pathway suppressor 2 (GPS2) is a small protein that was initially found to inhibit G protein (Ras)-activated MAPK (mitogen-activated protein kinase) signaling, especially JNK (c-Jun N-terminal kinase), in yeast and mammalian cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Spain et al., 1996</xref>). The JNK signaling pathway can be activated by environmental stress and is implicated in multiple physiological processes, such as cell apoptosis/survival signaling, tumor development, diabetes, metabolism, embryonic development and aging (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Weston and Davis, 2002</xref>). GPS2 in mammals is bifunctional. In the cell nucleus, GPS2 is a transcriptional cofactor that mediates both gene repression and activation as an intrinsic component of a major transcriptional repressor complex, the NcoR/SMRT nuclear receptor corepressor complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Zhang et al., 2002</xref>). In the cytoplasm, GPS2 has a function in the regulation of JNK activation by inhibiting TRAF2/Ubc13 enzymatic activity in response to a proinflammatory cytokine, Tumor Necrosis Factor-α (TNF-α) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Cardamone et al., 2012</xref>). JNK is activated through phosphorylation of threonine and tyrosine residues within a Thr-Pro-Tyr motif located in kinase subdomain VIII. The activation of JNK requires the presence of the E2 ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme Ubc13, the assembly of K63-ubiquitin chains, and the integrity of the TRAF2 RING domain. GPS2 interacts with the TRAF2/Ubc13 K63 ubiquitylation machinery, translating into a significant decrease of JNK activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Cardamone et al., 2012</xref>). The functions of GPS2 in invertebrates have not yet been determined.</p><p>Because viruses are obligatory cellular parasites, viral proteins can regulate host cellular signaling pathways. In mammals, hepatitis B virus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Doria et al., 1995</xref>), herpesvirus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Jung and Desrosiers, 1995</xref>), and human T-cell lymphotrophic virus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Jin et al., 1997</xref>) have been shown to affect Ras-dependent kinase cascades. In a compatible vector–virus relationship, such as vector insects and their transmitted plant or mammal viruses, how the viruses regulate the insect's Ras-dependent kinase cascadesand what benefits the viruses would get from this manipulation remain open questions. It has been reported that the JNK-like protein regulates phagocytosis and endocytosis in the <italic>Aedes albopictus</italic> mosquito cell line, C6/36, and West Nile virus infection may depend on JNK-mediated endocytosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Mizutani et al., 2003b</xref>).</p><p>In this study, we explored the effect of RSV on the JNK signaling pathway in the virus's vector insect. We found that RSV activates the JNK signaling pathway in several ways, especially through the interaction of CP and GPS2, to secure a benefit in viral replication and disease outbreak in plants.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Interaction between planthopper GPS2 and virus CP</title><p>To detect virus interactive proteins in the small brown planthoppers, we used RSV CP as bait to screen the insect cDNA library in a yeast two-hybrid system.

The JNK signaling pathway in mammal or invertebrate hosts has been reported to be involved in or affected by infections by various viruses. For instance, infection with rhesus rotavirus, herpes simplex virus type 1, or varicella-zoster virus results in the activation of JNK in mammalian cells. Inhibition of JNK by SP600125 reduced virus replication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Holloway and Coulson, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">McLean and Bachenheimer, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Zapata et al., 2007</xref>). In <italic>Bombyx mori</italic>, the magnitude and pattern of JNK activation were dependent on the multiplicity of nucleopolyhedrovirus infection, and inhibition of JNK reduced occlusion body formation and budded virus production (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Katsuma et al., 2007</xref>). In a crustacean, <italic>Litopenaeus vannamei</italic>, JNK was activated in response to white spot syndrome virus infection and the virus proliferation benefited from JNK activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Shi et al., 2012</xref>). Although this phenotype is common in virus–vector and virus–host systems, there should be some mechanisms in vector insects to limit the virus replication to a sustainable level.</p><p>Our study shows that the capsid protein of RSV not only induces a decrease of GPS2 expression, but also directly binds GPS2 so as to release GPS2 from repressing the JNK pathway. The N-terminal coiled-coil region of GPS2 is evidently key for the binding of CP. This explains the moderate strength of the interaction in the yeast two-hybrid assay between CP and the partial GPS2 that lacks the intact coiled-coil region. The N-terminal coiled-coil region of GPS2 is also the binding site of planthopper Ubc13. We proved that the planthopper Ubc13 is indispensable for JNK activation, as is the mammal homolog. Binding of GPS2 to Ubc13 leads to the inhibition of JNK activation. Thus the presence of CP that competitively binds GPS2 activates the JNK pathway. On the other hand, we do not exclude the possibility that other viral proteins could also be involved in the JNK regulation. A study on human T-cell lymphotrophic virus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Jin et al., 1997</xref>) is of particular interest in light of our results. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Jin et al. (1997</xref>) found that this virus’ protein Tax, a Type-I oncoprotein, binds to GPS2. Given our results on the binding of the RSV capsid protein to GPS2, it is possible that Tax’s binding to GPS2 activates JNK. They also showed that induction of Tax expression reduced the level of GPS2 in Jurkat cells.</p><p>In the present study, we found that JNK activation by RSV is caused by increased levels of the proinflammatory signaling molecule, TNF-α. When the expression of <italic>TNF-α</italic> was lowered, RSV did not upregulate the phosphorylation of JNK. In mammals, TNF-α is an upstream JNK-stimulating signal that regulates a wide range of physiological activities, such as immune responses and inflammation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Grivennikov et al., 2010</xref>). RSV capsid protein, as a surface recognition factor, induces this immune response, as does the entire virus. In mammals, excessive activation of proinflammatory signaling pathways is harmful, promoting the development of human diseases such as autoimmune disorder, neurodegeneration, and cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Amor et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Grivennikov et al., 2010</xref>). However, the inflammation in the planthopper caused by RSV seems sustainable. Perhaps this is due to the rather short lifespan of the planthopper (about 40 days under optimal conditions).</p><p>Activation of the JNK signaling pathway in the planthoppers by RSV might promote stress resistance in the insects. The JNK signaling pathway serves as a molecular sensor for various stresses. The protective functions of JNK activation have been shown in oxidative stress tolerance at the cellular level and in the aging of the organism. For example, JNK signaling activity alleviates the toxic effects of reactive oxygen species and increases the lifespan of <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Wang et al., 2003</xref>). JNK overexpression and phosphorylation increase the lifespan of <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic> as well as its resistance to oxidative stress and heat stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Oh et al., 2005</xref>). JNK signaling also protects a host against bacterial infections by promoting apoptosis or phagocytosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Mizutani et al., 2003a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Wandler and Guillemin, 2012</xref>). Only a few studies have shown effects of RSV infection on the physiology of the planthoppers, such as reduced fecundity and progeny hatchability, accelerated development, greater body weight, and increased abundance of a yeast-like symbiont (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Li et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Wan et al., 2015</xref>). Possible influences of RSV on the stress tolerance of the planthoppers, such as their ability to tolerate cold stress or heat stress, deserve to be further explored.</p><p>Given the effects of JNK inhibition in postponing the incidence of disease in rice plants infected with RSV, it seems reasonable to suggest that inhibition of the JNK pathway is a potential means to benefit rice agriculture. Perhaps we can generalize from our results on the knockdown of the JNK transcripts in this study to suggest that such inhibition of the JNK pathway —by lowering JNK transcript levels, by strengthening interactions with GPS2 or by weakening the effects of TNF-α or Ubc13 — could be beneficial agriculturally. Such alterations could possibly be achieved through breeding or other means of genetic modification or, especially in the case of weakening effects, by administering appropriate chemical compounds. A successful case has been reported in which genetically engineered rice plants that expressed the RSV CP showed resistance to RSV infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Hayakawa et al., 1992</xref>).</p><p>In conclusion, our study has uncovered strategies through which the RSV manipulates the JNK signaling pathway of its vector insect, the small brown planthopper, for its own benefit. Inhibition of the JNK pathway of insect vectors may, more generally, provide an important means of intervening in the transmission of persistent plant viruses.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Small brown planthopper strains</title><p>The viruliferous and non-viruliferous small brown planthopper strains used in this study were established from a field population collected in Hai’an, Jiangsu Province, China.

In this manuscript, the authors studied the response of the JNK pathway in the vector insect, the small brown planthopper, to infection by the plant virus RSV. They found that the planthopper increased its level of TNF-α and decreased its level of G protein Pathway Suppressor 2 (GSP2) after RSV infection. The virus capsid protein competitively bound GPS2 to release it from inhibiting the JNK activation machinery. They further showed that JNK activation promoted RSV replication in the insect vector, while JNK inhibition reduced virus production and postponed the plant morbidity. Overall, the findings are interesting and potentially important. The experiments are well executed and most conclusions are well supported by the data presented in this work. This manuscript is suitable for publication in <italic>eLife</italic> after appropriate revisions.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) In light of the different patterns of JNK and P-JNK bands seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figures 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">4</xref> (see details below), it is critical that expression of these two JNK genes and the specificity of the anti-human JNK and anti-human P-JNK antibodies used in this study be verified. For example, in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>, two major bands were detected by the anti-JNK antibody in the &quot;Non-viruliferous insects&quot; sample (right, middle panel), similar to what was observed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>, however, only one major band was detected by the anti-JNK antibody in the &quot;Viruliferous insects&quot; sample (left, middle panel). Why? Moreover, because these samples were not run on the same blot, it is difficult to directly compare the mobility of the bands. Along the same line, one or two bands were detected by the anti-P-JNK antibody in different samples: e.g. one band in &quot;control&quot; sample (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>, top panel; possibly P-JNK1 as suggested by comparing it to the MW markers), one band in &quot;Salivery gland, viruliferous&quot; sample (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>; is this the same band as in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>, &quot;control&quot;, top panel?), two major bands in &quot;Ovary, viruliferous&quot; sample (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>; no MW markers indicated on the blot – could they correspond to P-JNK1 and P-JNK2?), one major and slower migrating band plus one minor and faster migrating band in &quot;Testis, viruliferous&quot; sample (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). Similarly, there were one minor and slower migrating band plus one major and faster migrating band in &quot;Female&quot; samples, but only one major band in &quot;Male&quot; samples (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>).

We expressed the two JNK proteins of small brown planthoppers in <italic>E. coli</italic> and tested the specificity of the anti-human JNK2 polyclonal antibody. The results are presented in a new figure, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>. We found that the anti-human JNK2 antibody can recognize both of the two planthopper JNKs. We complement this information in the manuscript: The recombinantly expressed planthopper JNK1 and JNK2 were recognized by the anti-human JNK2 polyclonal antibody (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>) (subsection “GPS2 represses JNK activation in the planthoppers”). As for the one or two bands detected by the anti-JNK or anti-P-JNK antibody in planthopper samples, we think that there are differences between the two JNKs in their expression levels in different organs. But this does not influence the main conclusion of this work.</p><p> <italic>2) For all figures attempting to show increase or decrease in JNK activation (mostly in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figures 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">4</xref>), quantitative analysis should be performed by densitometry of P-JNK image bands, with normalizing for total JNK and for protein loading (tubulin) in the same sample.</italic> </p><p>We performed the densitometry analysis for P-JNK and GPS2 image bands from <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>.
