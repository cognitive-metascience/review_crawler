learning. LTP involves local remodeling of dendritic spines and synapses. Smooth endoplasmic reticulum (SER) and endosomal compartments could provide local stores of membrane and proteins, bypassing the distant Golgi apparatus. To test this hypothesis, effects of LTP were compared to control stimulation in rat hippocampal area CA1 at postnatal day 15 (P15). By two hours, small spines lacking SER increased after LTP, whereas large spines did not change in frequency, size, or SER content. Total SER volume decreased after LTP consistent with transfer of membrane to the added spines. Shaft SER remained more abundant in spiny than aspiny dendritic regions, apparently supporting the added spines. Recycling endosomes were elevated specifically in small spines after LTP. These findings suggest local secretory trafficking contributes to LTP-induced synaptogenesis and primes the new spines for future plasticity.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>synapse</kwd><kwd>ultrastructure</kwd><kwd>3D electron microscopy</kwd><kwd>development</kwd><kwd>plasticity</kwd><kwd>long-term potentiation</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Rat</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>NS21184</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Harris</surname><given-names>Kristen M</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01NS074644</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Harris</surname><given-names>Kristen M</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01MH095980</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Harris</surname><given-names>Kristen M</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01MH104319</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Harris</surname><given-names>Kristen M</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000001</institution-id><institution>National Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>NeuroNex 1707356</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Harris</surname><given-names>Kristen M</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>F32 MH096459</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Watson</surname><given-names>Deborah J</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The secretory and recycling components of neuronal dendrites, smooth endoplasmic reticulum and endosomes, were discovered to support synaptogenesis underlying a cellular mechanism of learning and memory in the developing brain.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>As the longest and most architecturally complex cells in the body, neurons face the unique challenge of regulating membrane and protein levels in distal compartments. Neurons have highly elaborate dendritic arbors. These dendrites possess synapses, points of contact where electrochemical transmission of information occurs. Most of the excitatory synapses are situated on dendritic spines, tiny protrusions with a head and neck comprising a geometry that is essential for shaping electrical signals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Yuste and Denk, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Hering and Sheng, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Yuste, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Harnett et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Harris and Weinberg, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Yuste, 2013</xref>) and providing biochemical compartmentalization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Harris and Stevens, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bourne and Harris, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Colgan and Yasuda, 2014</xref>). For synapses to function appropriately, the levels of receptor proteins at the postsynaptic density must also be finely tuned. Synapses are often located hundreds of micrometers away from the neuronal cell body. Adding to this spatial problem is the challenge of regulating protein abundance on the membrane in a temporally precise manner, as demanded by fast-acting processes such as synaptic potentiation.</p><p>Integral membrane proteins destined for the cell surface are canonically thought to be synthesized in the somatic rough endoplasmic reticulum, transported to the Golgi apparatus, and then secreted into the plasma membrane via exocytosis. It is now known that many proteins are translated locally in dendrites, a highly regulated process essential for normal development and plasticity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Sutton and Schuman, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Bramham and Wells, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Hanus and Schuman, 2013</xref>). Endoplasmic reticulum (ER) extends into dendrites, forming a continuous tubular network with regions of varying structural complexity and occasional entry into spines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Spacek and Harris, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Cooney et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Cui-Wang et al., 2012</xref>). Together with endosomes, the ER is perfectly positioned to provide a local source of membrane and integral membrane proteins, such as glutamate receptors. However, the Golgi apparatus is absent in most distal dendrites. This puzzling observation has been resolved by recent work demonstrating that dendritic and somatic protein trafficking are highly segregated, and that glutamate receptors are trafficked through a specialized Golgi apparatus-independent pathway from the dendritic ER to the plasma membrane via recycling endosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bowen et al., 2017</xref>). Structural changes in ER contribute to normal synaptogenesis during development and maturation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Cui-Wang et al., 2012</xref>). The involvement of this system in activity-induced synaptogenesis is unknown.</p><p>Long-term potentiation (LTP), the long-lasting enhancement of synaptic strength due to repetitive activity, is thought to underlie learning and memory. This process has been studied extensively in the hippocampus, a key brain region responsible for new memory formation. Insertion of glutamate receptors from an extrasynaptic reserve pool into the postsynaptic compartment is required for LTP in hippocampal area CA1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Granger et al., 2013</xref>). LTP is also accompanied by structural changes in dendritic spines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bourne and Harris, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bailey et al., 2015</xref>). In the young rat hippocampus, LTP produces new dendritic spines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Watson et al., 2016</xref>), contrasting with adult rat hippocampus where new spine outgrowth is stalled in favor of synapse enlargement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bourne and Harris, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bell et al., 2014</xref>). While Golgi apparatus-independent trafficking has not been studied directly in the context of lasting LTP, recycling endosomes (RE) are known to supply AMPA receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Park et al., 2004</xref>), and recycling endosome exocytosis is required for spine formation and growth shortly after the induction of LTP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Park et al., 2006</xref>). Expanded knowledge about the involvement of Golgi apparatus-independent pathways in developmental synaptic plasticity could provide new targets for rescuing dysregulated synaptogenesis in cases of profound developmental disorders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Fiala et al., 2002</xref>).</p><p>Here, three-dimensional reconstruction from serial section electron microscopy (3DEM) revealed morphological changes in SER and endosomal compartments 2 hr following the induction of LTP. The findings are consistent with the involvement of the Golgi-bypass secretory system in supporting synaptic plasticity in the developing hippocampus.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>An acute within-slice experimental protocol (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Watson et al., 2016</xref>) was used to compare the effects of TBS and control stimulation on subcellular membranous compartments in dendrites. In brief, two stimulating electrodes were positioned ~800 µm apart with a recording electrode halfway in between them in CA1 stratum radiatum of P15 rat hippocampus in one slice from each of two animals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Baseline responses were collected from both electrodes. TBS was delivered at one stimulating electrode and control stimulation was delivered at the other stimulating electrode, counterbalanced in position relative to CA3 for each experiment. There was a significant increase in the field excitatory postsynaptic potential (fEPSP) slope immediately after TBS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B,C</xref>). Slices were fixed 120 min later. EM image volumes were collected from tissue on a diagonal ~120 µm below and to the side of each stimulating electrode. Segments of spiny dendrites, synapses, and all subcellular membrane compartments were reconstructed in three dimensions (see Materials and methods for details).</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.46356.002</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Within-slice experimental design and electrophysiological outcome.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Illustration of an acute slice from a P15 rat hippocampus with a recording electrode (rec.) in the middle of CA1 stratum radiatum between two bipolar stimulating electrodes (S1 and S2).

This difference was not present at earlier times, and the small spines more than tripled in density by 2 hr post induction of LTP, suggesting that most of this population comprised newly formed spines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Watson et al., 2016</xref>). There were no significant effects on SER content in these small spines; not in frequency of spine-localized SER (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>), average SER volume (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>), nor average SER surface area (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>).

In 3D reconstruction, the primarily tubular structure of SER in aspiny regions and the expanded SER in spiny regions of the dendrite become apparent (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). Following LTP, there was a trend towards reduced shaft SER surface area (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>) that reached statistical significance with reduced shaft SER volume (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>) when quantified across the total length of the dendritic segments. The SER complexity was estimated by summing the dendritic shaft SER cross-sectional areas in each section, assigning the value to the spiny or aspiny segments, and summing across their independent lengths (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Cui-Wang et al., 2012</xref>). This measure of SER complexity was greater in spiny than aspiny segments under both conditions yet was significantly reduced in both the aspiny and spiny regions following LTP relative to the control condition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>). Considering the prior work, this outcome suggests that SER resources may have contributed to the spine outgrowth by 2 hr following the induction of LTP.</p><fig id="fig3" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.46356.007</object-id><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>Reduction in shaft SER following LTP.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Electron micrographs showing the dendrite (yellow), SER (green), and synapses (red).

The distribution of SER along the dendritic shaft was non-uniform, with greater abundance and complexity in spiny than aspiny regions under control and LTP conditions. However, the shaft SER was reduced in volume and complexity after LTP. In conjunction, there was an LTP-related increase in endosomal structures confined to the small, presumably newly formed spines.

SER is a limited resource, entering only 10–20% of hippocampal dendritic spines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Spacek and Harris, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Cooney et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Chirillo et al., 2019</xref>). Spines containing SER are larger than those without SER, and in adults 2 hr after induction of LTP the SER was elaborated into a spine apparatus in spines with enlarged synapses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Chirillo et al., 2019</xref>). Spines clustered around the enlarged spines and local shaft SER remained complex, whereas distant clusters had fewer spines than control dendrites and lost local shaft SER. These findings suggest that mature dendrites support a maximum amount of synaptic input and strengthening of some synapses uses resources that would otherwise be targeted to support spine outgrowth, even in adults.</p><p>At P15, CA1 dendrites have less than one-third mature synaptic density, which will nearly reach adult levels in another week (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Kirov et al., 2004</xref>). These findings suggest that P15 may well be an age when synaptogenesis predominates over the growth of existing synapses, which may account for the spinogenesis response to LTP. At P15, SER was also restricted to a small number of spines, and like adults the few spines that had SER were larger than those without SER (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Chirillo et al., 2019</xref>). However, at P15, most of the small, presumably newly formed spines did not contain SER. Similar to adults, shaft SER was reduced in complexity and volume, but at P15 the redistribution was apparently targeted only to the plasma surface, rather than elaboration of the spine apparatus and growth of potentiated spines, as in adults (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Chirillo et al., 2019</xref>). These findings suggest that synapse growth occurs where synapses had already been activated or previously potentiated, and few of those existed at P15 prior to the induction of LTP. Thus, resources were available for spine outgrowth to dominate. Future work is needed to learn when the shaft SER recovers, and when this recovery becomes necessary for additional synaptogenesis or synapse enlargement as the animals mature.</p><p>SER regulates intracellular calcium ion concentration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Verkhratsky, 2005</xref>). Regulation of postsynaptic calcium levels is necessary for the expression of synaptic plasticity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Lynch et al., 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Malenka et al., 1988</xref>), hence the presence of SER could be important for signaling cascades associated with LTP and stabilization of AMPA receptors at potentiated synapses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Borgdorff and Choquet, 2002</xref>). Consistent with this, spines with larger synapses tended to contain SER, and were maintained at stable density post-TBS. However, it might be of some concern that calcium regulation is disrupted by the reduction in SER volume in both adult and P15 hippocampal dendritic shafts by 2 hr after induction of LTP. The reduction in SER volume was by no means complete, and instead likely reflects the multiple roles of SER in membrane and protein trafficking in addition to the regulation of calcium. That a substantial amount of shaft SER remains well after the induction of LTP, supports the hypothesis that SER is a dynamically regulated resource at both ages.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Role of satellite secretory system in synaptogenesis and subsequent plasticity</title><p>Dendrites support local processing and secretory trafficking of newly synthesized cargo independent of a Golgi apparatus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bowen et al., 2017</xref>). Secretory cargo passes from the ER to ER-Golgi intermediate compartments (ERGICs) into recycling endosomes en route to the plasma membrane. While molecular understanding of this pathway has been achieved, the spatial organization of the responsible organelles has been nebulous. Recycling endosomes were seen about 25% of spines on cultured neurons that also contained synaptopodin, a marker for the ER-derived spine apparatus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bowen et al., 2017</xref>). This finding suggested that recycling endosomes might receive newly synthesized cargo directly from a spine apparatus. However, at P15, only one spine apparatus was found in each of the control and TBS conditions, suggesting that recycling endosomes derive from alternate recycling organelles in the dendritic shaft. Previously, this satellite secretory system has only been studied in neurons under baseline conditions in culture. Here, we provide the first evidence that this specialized secretory system locally supports spine formation during plasticity.</p><p>Synaptogenesis at P15 does not precede the expression of LTP, as evidenced by a lack of added spines at 5 min following TBS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Watson et al., 2016</xref>). The magnitude of potentiation following the initial TBS is constant across time, so the added small spines at 2 hr after the induction of LTP are likely to be functionally silent. Hence, the newly added spines could be viewed as a form of heterosynaptic plasticity that readies the neurons for subsequent potentiation. In support of this hypothesis, a second bout of TBS delivered 90 min after the first TBS produces substantial additional potentiation at this age (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Cao and Harris, 2012</xref>). Many of the added small spines contained endosomes at 2 hr after the initial induction of LTP. These endosomes might be interpreted as a heterosynaptic mechanism for long-term depression, namely internalizing receptors from pre-existing spines. However, since most of the endosomal structures occupied the added small spines and were of a constructive nature, they could instead be available to convert the new silent synapses to active synapses after a later bout of potentiation. Such a mechanism would support the establishment of functional circuits as the young animals learn and begin to form memories.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th valign="top">Reagent type <break/>(species) or <break/>resource</th><th valign="top">Designation</th><th valign="top">Source or reference</th><th valign="top">Identifiers</th><th valign="top">Additional <break/>information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td valign="top">Strain, strain background (Rattus norvegicus, male)</td><td valign="top">Long-Evans Rat</td><td valign="top">Charles River</td><td valign="top">Charles River strain# 006; RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/RGD_2308852">RGD_2308852</ext-link></td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Chemical compound, drug</td><td valign="top">Potassium ferrocyanide</td><td valign="top">Sigma-Aldrich</td><td valign="top">Cat# P3289</td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Chemical compound, drug</td><td valign="top">Osmium tetroxide</td><td valign="top">Electron Microscopy Sciences</td><td valign="top">Cat# 19190</td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Chemical compound, drug</td><td valign="top">Uranyl acetate</td><td valign="top">Electron Microscopy Sciences</td><td valign="top">Cat# 22400</td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Chemical compound, drug</td><td valign="top">LX-112 embedding kit</td><td valign="top">Ladd Research Industries</td><td valign="top">Cat# 21210</td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Chemical compound, drug</td><td valign="top">Lead nitrate</td><td valign="top">Ladd Research Industries</td><td valign="top">Cat# 23603</td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Chemical compound, drug</td><td valign="top">Pioloform F</td><td valign="top">Ted Pella</td><td valign="top">Cat# 19244</td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Software, algorithm</td><td valign="top">Igor Pro 4</td><td valign="top">WaveMetrics</td><td valign="top"><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.wavemetrics.net/">https://www.wavemetrics.net/</ext-link></td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Software, algorithm</td><td valign="top">Reconstruct</td><td valign="top"><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Fiala, 2005</xref></td><td valign="top">Executable and manual: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://synapseweb.clm.utexas.edu/software-0">http://synapseweb.clm.utexas.edu/software-0</ext-link></td><td valign="top">Source at:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/orgs/SynapseWeb/teams/reconstruct-developers">https://github.com/orgs/SynapseWeb/teams/reconstruct-developers</ext-link></td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Software, algorithm</td><td valign="top">STATISTICA 13 Academic</td><td valign="top">Tibco</td><td valign="top"><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://onthehub.com//statistica/">https://onthehub.com//statistica/</ext-link></td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Other</td><td valign="top">Tissue slicer</td><td valign="top">Stoelting</td><td valign="top">Cat # 51425</td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Other</td><td valign="top">Vibratome</td><td valign="top">Leica Biosystems</td><td valign="top">VT1000S</td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Other</td><td valign="top">Ultramicrotome</td><td valign="top">Leica Biosystems</td><td valign="top">UC6</td><td valign="top">Used with a Diatome Ultra35 knife</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Other</td><td valign="top">SynapTek Grids</td><td valign="top">Ted Pella</td><td valign="top">Cat# 4514 or 4516</td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Other</td><td valign="top">Diffraction grating replica</td><td valign="top">Electron Microscopy Sciences</td><td valign="top">Cat# 80051</td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Other</td><td valign="top">Transmission electron microscope</td><td valign="top">JEOL</td><td valign="top">JEM-1230</td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Other</td><td valign="top">Harris Lab wiki</td><td valign="top">Harris Lab</td><td valign="top"><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://wikis.utexas.edu/display/khlab/">https://wikis.utexas.edu/display/khlab/</ext-link></td><td valign="top">This wiki site hosts experimental methods used for this paper and updates.</td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap><sec id="s4-1"><title>Animals</title><p>Hippocampal slices (400 µm) were rapidly prepared from P15 male Long-Evans rats (RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/RGD_2308852">RGD_2308852</ext-link>, n &gt; 100, including the initial test experiments and slices used in prior work for the 5 min and 30 min time points; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Watson et al., 2016</xref>).

Hippocampal slices were kept room temperature (~25°C) in artificial cerebrospinal fluid (ACSF) bubbled with 95% O<sub>2</sub>/5% CO<sub>2</sub> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bourne et al., 2007</xref>).

The slices were kept at 32°C for approximately 3 hr <italic>in vitro</italic> prior to recording (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Fiala et al., 2003</xref>). Two concentric bipolar stimulating electrodes (100 µm diameter, Fred Haer, Brunswick, ME) were positioned ~300–400 µm on either side of a single glass extracellular recording electrode in the middle of stratum radiatum for independent activation of subpopulations of synapses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Sorra and Harris, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Ostroff et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bourne and Harris, 2011</xref>). The recording electrode was a glass micropipette filled with 120 µM NaCl. After initial recovery period, stable baseline recordings were obtained from both sites for a minimum of 40 min. Extracellular field potentials (fEPSPs) were obtained with custom designed stimulation data acquisition protocols using Igor software (WaveMetrics, Lake Oswego, OR). fEPSPs were estimated by linear regression over 400 µs along maximal initial slope (mV/ms) of test pulses of 100 µs constant, biphasic current. Stimulus intensity was set to evoke 1/2 maximum fEPSP slope based on a stimulus/response curve for each experiment and was held constant for the duration of the experiment.</p></sec><sec id="s4-3"><title>TBS-LTP paradigm</title><p>Theta burst stimulation (TBS) was used to induce LTP. TBS was administered by one stimulating electrode as one episode of eight trains 30 s apart, each train consisting of 10 bursts at 5 Hz of 4 pulses at 100 Hz. The control stimulating electrode delivered one pulse every 2 min. Stimulations were alternated between the TBS-LTP and the control electrode once every two minutes with a 30 s interval between electrodes. In order to counterbalance across experiments, control and TBS-LTP electrode positions were interchanged between the CA3 and subicular side of the recording electrode (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Physiological responses were monitored for 120 min after the first train of TBS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B,C</xref>) and then rapidly fixed, as described below.</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>Fixation and processing for 3DEM</title><p>One slice from each animal was fixed and processed for electron microscopy 2 hr after induction of LTP. Only slices with good physiology were used, defined as a gradually inclining I/O curve in response to incremental increases in stimulus intensity for both stimulating electrodes, a stable baseline response at both stimulating electrodes unchanged at the control site post LTP-induction, and a significant increase in fEPSP slope that was immediately induced by TBS and was sustained for the duration of the experiment. Within a few seconds of the experiment’s end, electrodes were removed and slices were immersed in fixative (6% glutaraldehyde and 2% paraformaldehyde in 100 mM cacodylate buffer with 2 mM CaCl<sub>2</sub> and 4 mM MgSO<sub>4</sub>), microwaved at full power (700 W microwave oven) for 10 s to enhance penetration of fixative (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Jensen and Harris, 1989</xref>), stored in the fixative overnight at room temperature, rinsed three times for 10 min in 100 mM cacodylate buffer, and embedded in 7% low melting temperature agarose. They were then trimmed, leaving only the CA1 region that contained the two stimulating electrodes. They were mounted in agarose and vibra-sliced into 70 µm thick slices (VT1000S, Leica, Nusslock, Germany). Vibra-slices were kept in a 24-well tissue culture dish and examined under a dissecting microscope to locate the vibra-slices containing indentations from the stimulating electrodes.</p><p>The vibra-slices with the indentations due to the stimulating electrodes and two vibra-slices on either side of these indentations were collected and processed in 1% OsO<sub>4</sub> and 1.5% potassium ferrocyanide in 0.1M cacodylate buffer for 5–10 min, rinsed five times in buffer, immersed in 1% OsO<sub>4</sub> and microwaved (1 min on, 1 min off, 1 min on) twice with cooling to 20°C in between, and rinsed five times in buffer for two minutes and then twice in water. They were then dehydrated in ascending concentrations of ethanol (50%, 70%, 90%, and 100%) with 1–1.5% uranyl acetate and microwaved for 40 s at each concentration. Finally, slices were transferred through room temperature propylene oxide, embedded in LX-112 (Ladd Research, Williston, VT), and cured for 48 hr at 60°C in an oven (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Harris et al., 2006</xref>).</p><p>Slices with high-quality preservation, defined as dendrites with evenly spaced microtubules, well-defined mitochondrial cristae, and well-defined PSDs that were not thickened or displaced from the membrane, were selected for analysis. The region of interest was selected from middle of the CA1 stratum radiatum and 120–150 µm beneath the air surface, then cut into 150–200 serial sections. The sections were mounted on Pioloform-coated slot grids (Synaptek, Ted Pella, Redding, CA). The sections were counterstained with saturated ethanolic uranyl acetate, then Reynolds lead citrate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Reynolds, 1963</xref>) for five minutes each, and then imaged with a JEOL JEM-1230 transmission electron microscope with a Gatan digital camera at 5000X magnification along with a diffraction grating replica for later calibration (0.463 µm cross line EMS, Hatfield, PA or Ted Pella). Imaging was conducted blind to condition.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>3D reconstructions and measurements of dendrites</title><p>A random five-letter code was assigned to each series of images for the experimenter to be blind to the original experimental conditions during data collection.

The diffraction grating replica imaged with each series was used to calibrate pixel size. Cylindrical diameters method was used to calculate section thickness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Fiala and Harris, 2001</xref>). Calculated section thicknesses ranged from 46 to 63 nm. Dendrites selected for analysis were chosen based on their orientation (cross-sectioned or radial oblique) and matched for diameter. Microtubule count was used as a measure of dendritic caliber (6–22 MTs) as this range under control condition showed no differences in spine density. All dendrites chosen for the analysis were completely reconstructed. The z-trace tool in Reconstruct was used to measure dendrite lengths across serial sections of each analyzed dendrite. Four dendrites were sampled from each condition (control or TBS-LTP) in each animal, resulting in a total of 16 dendritic segments from four EM series. Each analyzed dendritic segment traversed over 100 serial sections. In total, 173 µm of dendritic length was sampled.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Identification and quantification of subcellular compartments</title><p>The process of tracing, reviewing, and curating dendrites, synapses, and subcellular objects was confirmed by three scientists (Kulik, Watson, and Harris) and conducted blind as to condition.

SER was identified on the basis of its characteristic morphology of tubules with dark staining membrane, occasional flattened cisternal distensions with a wavy membrane and clear lumen, and continuity across sections within each reconstructed dendrite. Once SER was completely traced, the remaining membrane-bound intracellular compartments were traced and their identity was assigned on the basis of morphology, as described in Results. Criteria used to differentiate endosomes included: 1) Continuity across sections: vesicles appear on single sections; tubules span multiple sections and then terminate; SER is continuous across sections throughout the entire dendrite; MVBs and tubules form a sorting complex when found on continuous sections; 2) Geometry: small and large vesicles are spherical, while amorphous vesicles are not; tubules have a uniform diameter across sections; SER has a highly variable profile across sections; MVBs have an unmistakable outer membrane surrounding multiple internal vesicles, and MVBs have tubules attached when part of a sorting complex; 3) Dimensions: small vesicles are 40–60 nm in diameter; large vesicles are 60–95 nm in diameter; 4) Electron density: amorphous vesicles and SER have a clear lumen; tubules and MVBs have a dark, grainy interior; lysosomes have a very dark, electron-dense interior.</p><p>Only spines that were entirely contained within the series were used for the analyses of subcellular compartments. In this way, we avoided possible undercounting of compartments that may have entered a portion of an incomplete spine outside the series. Spines were considered to contain a subcellular structure when it entered the head or neck of the spine, but not if it was only at the base of a spine. The frequency of occurrence was calculated as the total number of occurrences of objects divided by the length of dendrite in microns. The 3D visualization of dendrites and subcellular structures was achieved with Reconstruct. The 3D reconstructions from serial EMs allowed us to calculate volumes and surface areas of objects and to assess SER and endosome distribution within dendrites.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Statistical analyses</title><p>The statistical package STATISTICA (version 13.3; TIBCO, Palo Alto, CA) was used for all analyses. There were two conditions represented in each animal: control (CON), and LTP at 120 min following TBS. In this study, eight control dendrites (four from each animal) and 8 LTP dendrites (four from each animal) were analyzed. One-way ANOVAs were run on all density (#/µm) data involving one measurement per dendrite, in which case n = number of dendrites. Hierarchical nested analysis of variance (hnANOVAs) were run when many measures were obtained from each dendrite (e.g. SER volume per spine, PSD area etc.). In this case, n = total spines, as each spine was considered separately. In hnANOVAs dendrite was nested in condition and experiment, and experiment nested in condition to account for inter-experiment variability. Results of the one-way ANOVAs and hnANOVAs are reported as (F<sub>(df condition, df observations)</sub>=F value, P value) where df is degrees of freedom presented for condition and error. In hnANOVAs degrees of freedom are further decreased by one for each dendrite. Absolute p values are reported for each test. Statistical tests are reported in the figure legends.

A lightly edited version of the letter sent to the authors after peer review is shown, indicating the most substantive concerns; minor comments are not usually included.</p></boxed-text><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Structural plasticity of dendritic secretory compartments during LTP-induced synaptogenesis&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by Eve Marder as the Senior Editor, a Reviewing Editor, and three reviewers. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>The reviewers agreed that the manuscript contains a set of very valuable data about structural changes in the setup of spines undergoing plasticity in young animals, with a particular focus on the smooth endoplasmatic reticulum and endocytic compartments.</p><p>The reviewers however raised two key concerns, which we request to be addressed in the revised manuscript:</p><p>- The reviewers are concerned about the underlying statistics that give rise to the conclusions drawn. In particular, the number of animals, slices, and reconstructed dendrites used are both unclear from the manuscript and suspected to be very small. Here, the reviewers request clarification and (if the low n is in fact confirmed) addition of further data to exclude inter-individual variability as a source of the observed effects.</p><p>- The methodological description is considered improvable by two reviewers who request better definition of concepts such as &quot;new spine&quot;. For data annotations that may be considered subjective, the independent annotation by multiple experts may offer a way to provide classifications with confidence intervals.</p><p>Please see the detailed comments below for the context of these two key requests. All other comments can be treated as recommendations for the revision.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic> </p><p>This manuscript by Kulik et al. describes detailed ultra-structural analysis of dendritic spines after LTP using 3D reconstruction of serial section electron microscopy. They used relatively young animals, in which stage LTP induces spinogenesis. In particular, they focused on intracellular membrane structures including smooth endoplasmic reticulum (SER) and various endosomes.</p><p>They observed that spine density almost doubled 2 hours after LTP induction. Several differences in intracellular membrane structure in LTP area and control area are described. First, they observed less fraction of small spines after LTP contain SER, while large spines have reduced SER content. Next, they observed SER in dendritic shafts decreases their volume after LTP. Finally, spines containing various endosomes increased after LTP.</p><p>Overall, the manuscript contains potentially important data describing anatomical changes induced by LTP in young animals. However, some of their interpretation, for example their definition of &quot;new spines&quot; and their model of SER/endosome structure at the early time point, appears to be not well validated by the measurement.</p><p>More serious issue is that it is not clear how slice-to-slice and animal-to-animal variation can be taken into account. It appears that only two slices (not clear if they are from the same animal or different animals) are used in their analysis. The conclusion may not be generalizable to all animals.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Figure 1: The title &quot;New small spines induced by TBS contained no SER while existing large spines had reduced SER content&quot; sounds to be misleading. It is not described how they conclude that these are &quot;new&quot; spines. Also, I don't see any evidence suggesting &quot;no SER&quot; in &quot;new spines&quot; from the figure, as there are some SER in small spines.</p><p>2) Figure 5: &quot;Increased endosomal activity&quot; may be misleading, as they are not measuring the activity but the distribution of endosomes.</p><p>3) Statistics: It appears that the entire data is based on only two slices (Figure 1:. Is it from two animals?) Perhaps any statics would not work well with n=2. As LTP varies fairly a lot from slice to slice and from animal to animal, this raises a question of whether the conclusion can be generalizable.</p><p>4) Figure 6: It is not clear how they come up with the model of SER structure and endosome structure at &quot;early LTP&quot;, as the measurement only at 2 hours.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic> </p><p>In this study, the authors conducted 3D EM reconstruction of CA1 dendrites after TBS LTP and concentrated on measuring organelles such as ER and endocytic compartments. Using this method, the authors make a few new observations:</p><p>1) New spines that are formed after LTP do not contain SER and existing spines lose some SER.</p><p>2) After LTP SER in dendritic shafts is reduced.</p><p>3) After LTP, increased endocytic compartments were observed in small spines.</p><p>Based on these observations the authors suggest that new spines observed after LTP are supported by recycling endosomes rather than SER. The apparent increase in endocytic structures after LTP is intriguing, although I have some concerns on how these structures are classified.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The identification of the specific endocytic structures in Figure 4 and Figure 5 relies solely on morphology, and based on a limited set of images it is unclear how reliable the distinction can be made between recycling endosomes and endosomes that may be heading to a lysosome/degradation pathway. The authors list a few papers as explanation of how these structures were classified, but the description of how the dendrites were annotated is vague. The authors need to provide a lot more detail on exactly how these structures were classified and how reliable is the distinction between similar-looking endocytic structures. Based on the current data presented, the conclusion that small spines are mostly supported by recycling endosomes is not strongly supported.</p><p>2) The 3D reconstruction of one time point after LTP makes it hard to infer dynamics from a static snapshot. While the reconstruction is extremely consuming, the authors need to discuss caveats and alternative interpretations of the data in the discussion section. For example, can the authors rule out heterosynaptic LTD or other homeostatic mechanisms that may rely on endocytosis of receptors?</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic> </p><p>The paper by Kulik et al., examines the changes to the ultrastructure within dendrites of the P15 hippocampus after a stimulation protocol that produces long term potentiation. This piece of work is complementary to a number of other studies that have looked at similar changes in the adult and for this reason the paper it will be of some interest.</p><p>The study uses serial section EM to make detailed reconstructions of segments of dendrites that included the intracellular features such as smooth endoplasmic reticulum and endosomes. The analysis looked at dendritic spines, and the immediate piece of parent dendrite, as well as stretches of dendrite that bore no spines and compared their contents.</p><p>The stimulation protocol produced a significant increase in the number of dendritic spines, but not of spines that contained SER. The larger spines, however, considered as being the more permanent ones, had a reduction in their amount of SER, although still present. The authors conclude that these changes indicate that SER is not an organelle that is pivotal to the production of new spines induced by LTP. Measurements of the amount of SER in the parent dendrite show a decrease.</p><p>These changes led the authors to explore the intracellular ultrastructure in more detail and analyze the presence of different organelles. These they classed as either belonging to a degradative class such as lysosomes and multivesicular bodies, or constructive such as coated pits, vesicles, and endosomes. This analysis shows that the constructive elements were present only in the new (small) spines.</p><p>The study is well explained and illustrated.

In particular, the number of animals, slices, and reconstructed dendrites used are both unclear from the manuscript and suspected to be very small. Here, the reviewers request clarification and (if the low n is in fact confirmed) addition of further data to exclude inter-individual variability as a source of the observed effects.</p></disp-quote><p>Subsection “Caveats” has been added to the end of the Materials and methods section. We note that these experiments are within-slice experiments, namely the control and LTP sites are from independent locations within the same slice from two different animals. Based on numerous preliminary experiments, we found that this approach greatly reduces variation due to slice preparation, in vitro conditions, and subsequent processing for electron microscopy when comparing the control and LTP outcomes.</p><p>We also note that enhanced statistical power came from the large number of synapses and spines tested using the hierarchical nested ANOVA design with dendrite nested in condition by animal (Figure 2E,F,H,I, Figure 3E). In this way, degrees of freedom are adjusted for animal and dendrites, and outcomes are tested to ensure that no one dendrite or animal carried the findings. In addition, we had power to detect changes using multifactor ANOVAs for measurements that involved one measure per dendrite (#/µm listed on the y axes of Figure 2B-D, 2G, Figure 3C-D, Figure 5B-E). Given the extremely time-consuming nature of the imaging and 3DEM analysis, additional animals and slices were not included. (See subsection “Caveats”)</p><p>We have expanded the Materials and methods section to clarify the choice of animals, slices, reconstructed dendrites, spines, subcellular organelles, and statistics for these experiments.

Using this method, the authors make a few new observations:</p><p>1) New spines that are formed after LTP do not contain SER and existing spines lose some SER.</p><p>2) After LTP SER in dendritic shafts is reduced.</p><p>3) After LTP, increased endocytic compartments were observed in small spines.</p><p>Based on these observations the authors suggest that new spines observed after LTP are supported by recycling endosomes rather than SER. The apparent increase in endocytic structures after LTP is intriguing, although I have some concerns on how these structures are classified.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The identification of the specific endocytic structures in figure 4 and Figure 5 relies solely on morphology, and based on a limited set of images it is unclear how reliable the distinction can be made between recycling endosomes and endosomes that may be heading to a lysosome/degradation pathway. The authors list a few papers as explanation of how these structures were classified, but the description of how the dendrites were annotated is vague. The authors need to provide a lot more detail on exactly how these structures were classified and how reliable is the distinction between similar-looking endocytic structures. Based on the current data presented, the conclusion that small spines are mostly supported by recycling endosomes is not strongly supported.</p><p>2) The 3D reconstruction of one time point after LTP makes it hard to infer dynamics from a static snapshot. While the reconstruction is extremely consuming, the authors need to discuss caveats and alternative interpretations of the data in the discussion. For example, can the authors rule out heterosynaptic LTD or other homeostatic mechanisms that may rely on endocytosis of receptors?</p></disp-quote><p>Please see the complete response to Key concerns #1 and #2 above and revisions to the description of Figure 6 and the Discussion section that are also in response to these comments.</p><p>Specifically, regarding “heterosynaptic LTD and other homeostatic mechanisms”, we have added a few statements in the Discussion section, which describe a potential concern about calcium regulation if SER is diminished. We also discuss heterosynaptic LTD and explain why we opted for an interpretation that the constructive endosomes would have a positive impact on subsequent potentiation in the developing hippocampus, rather than reflect heterosynaptic LTD.</p><p>Reviewer #3:</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>[…] The study is well explained and illustrated.

In fact, as shown in Figure 3, there was a lower SER volume and surface area in the LTP relative to the control condition. To address local complexity, we used the strategy developed in the Cui-Wang et al., 2012 paper, by summing the cross-sectional area of the SER profiles on a section by section basis. In this way, we were able to detect local variation and decrease in the combined volume and reticulum fractions and compare aspiny to spiny segments of the dendrite. We have clarified this description in subsection “Reduced complexity in shaft SER after LTP” regarding Figure 3 and added further comments regarding SER complexity in the Discussion section.</p></body></sub-article></article>
