By modulating a single growth parameter—extracellular pH—we discovered a subset of these so-called ‘redundant’ enzymes in <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> are required for maximal fitness across pH environments. Among these pH specialists are the class A penicillin binding proteins PBP1a and PBP1b; defects in these enzymes attenuate growth in alkaline and acidic conditions, respectively. Genetic, biochemical, and cytological studies demonstrate that synthase activity is required for cell wall integrity across a wide pH range and influences pH-dependent changes in resistance to cell wall active antibiotics. Altogether, our findings reveal previously thought to be redundant enzymes are instead specialized for distinct environmental niches. This specialization may ensure robust growth and cell wall integrity in a wide range of conditions.</p><p><bold>Editorial note:</bold> This article has been through an editorial process in which the authors decide how to respond to the issues raised during peer review.

A commensal, pathogen, and environmental contaminant, <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> occupies and grows in diverse environmental niches, including the gastrointestinal tract, bladder, freshwater, and soil. In the laboratory, the bacterium’s flexibility in growth requirements is reflected in robust proliferation across a wide range of temperature, salt, osmotic, pH, oxygenation, and nutrient conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Ingraham and Marr, 1996</xref>).</p><p>The physiological adaptations that permit growth and survival across environmental conditions are not yet well understood, particularly for extracytoplasmic processes. Due to the discrepancy in permeability between the plasma and outer membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Rosenbusch, 1990</xref>), the periplasmic space of Gram-negative bacteria is sensitive to chemical and physical perturbations, including changes in salt, ionic strength, osmolality, and pH. Notably, upon mild environmental acidification, the periplasm assumes the pH of the extracellular media (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Slonczewski et al., 1981</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Wilks and Slonczewski, 2007</xref>). Although mechanisms that contribute to cytoplasmic pH homeostasis have been described in detail (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Castanie-Cornet et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Castanié-Cornet et al., 2010</xref>), comparatively little is known about the quality control mechanisms that preserve proper folding, stability, and activity of key proteins in the periplasm.</p><p>The peptidoglycan (PG) cell wall and its synthetic machinery are among the fundamental constituents of the periplasm that must be preserved across growth conditions. Essential for viability among most bacteria, PG is composed of glycan strands of repeating <italic>N-</italic>acetylglucosamine and <italic>N-</italic>acetylmuramic acid disaccharide units crosslinked at peptide stems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Vollmer et al., 2008</xref>). Beyond providing a force necessary to resist turgor pressure, the cell wall maintains cell shape, and components of the cell envelope serve as a major interface for cell-cell and cell-host interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Typas et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">McDonald et al., 2005</xref>). As an essential process, PG synthesis is also the principle target of several classes of antibacterial agents, including β-lactam (e.g. penicillin) and glycopeptide (e.g. vancomycin) antibiotics.</p><p>PG precursors are assembled in the cytosol and translocated across the inner membrane into the periplasm, where cell wall synthases construct the PG network through a series of glycosyltransferase (glycan polymerizing) and transpeptidase (peptide crosslinking) reactions. PG synthases include bifunctional class A penicillin binding proteins (PBPs), as well as monofunctional transpeptidases (class B PBPs) and monofunctional glycosyltransferases of the shape, elongation, division, and sporulation (SEDS) protein families (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Sauvage et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Meeske et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Cho et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Taguchi et al., 2019</xref>). LD-transpeptidases synthesize non-canonical LD-crosslinks between peptide stems. They are predominately active during PG remodeling during stationary phase growth in <italic>E. coli</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Pisabarro et al., 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Magnet et al., 2007</xref>) and are required under severe envelope stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Morè et al., 2019</xref>). In addition to synthases, a series of periplasmic cell wall hydrolases and autolysins—including DD-carboxypeptidases, DD and LD-endopeptidases, lytic transglycosylases, and amidases—are required to accommodate nascent strand insertion for expansion of the PG network, create substrate binding sites, and separate cells during the final stages of cytokinesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Typas et al., 2012</xref>). These enzymes may also play a role activating synthases to ensure cell wall integrity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Lai et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>The periplasmic steps of PG synthesis and remodeling exhibit high levels of enzymatic redundancy, the function of which remains unclear. While the cytoplasmic steps of PG precursor biogenesis in <italic>E. coli</italic> have nearly a 1:1 stochiometric ratio between reactions and enzymes (12 reactions: 14 enzymes), over 36 enzymes can carry out the nine reactions that take place in the periplasm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Pazos et al., 2017</xref>). Moreover, with the exception of the SEDS glycosyltransferase/bPBP pairs RodA/PBP2 and FtsW/PBP3 required for lateral expansion of the cell wall and cell division, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Meeske et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Cho et al., 2016</xref>), the remaining periplasmic cell wall enzymes appear to be nonessential. Inactivation of an individual enzyme—and in some cases, even multiple enzymes in the same class—often fails to confer discernable growth or morphological phenotypes under standard culture conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Singh et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Nelson and Young, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Heidrich et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Suzuki et al., 1978</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Heidrich et al., 2001</xref>). Although technological breakthroughs have aided in the identification of cell wall metabolic genes encoding proteins with similar functions (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Peters et al., 2016a</xref>), elucidating the potential fitness benefit to redundancy has proven challenging.</p><p>One model to account for the apparent redundancy of periplasmic cell wall proteins is that enzymes within a given class may be specialists for distinct environmental niches, thereby allowing bacteria to cope with the diverse chemical and physical properties that might affect protein stability and function in this compartment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Pazos et al., 2017</xref>). In support of this hypothesis, several groups have identified cell wall enzymes that have increased activity in acidic media. Peters and colleagues demonstrated that <italic>E. coli</italic> carboxypeptidase PBP6b plays a key role in maintenance of cell morphology during growth at pH 5.0 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Peters et al., 2016b</xref>), while Castanheira <italic>et al.</italic> identified a PBP3 homolog in <italic>Salmonella</italic> Typhimurium that is preferentially involved in septation at low pH (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Castanheira et al., 2017</xref>). Similarly, the lytic transglycosylase MltA exhibits maximal activity in acidic conditions in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">van Straaten et al., 2005</xref>), although whether this property is relevant in vivo remains unknown.</p><p>In light of these findings, we hypothesized that loss of an enzyme specialized for a particular environmental niche may produce a condition-specific growth defect through impaired cell wall integrity, allowing us to take a systems-level approach to identifying enzymes with differential roles in growth in vivo. In screening 32 mutants across six classes of nonessential periplasmic cell wall enzymes, we determined that a subset of these enzymes is differentially required for fitness across pH environments. We find that disruptions in the activity of cell wall synthases PBP1a and PBP1b conferred fitness defects in opposing pH ranges that can be attributed in part to pH-dependent differences in enzymatic activity. We further demonstrate that synthase specialization has consequences for intrinsic resistance to β-lactam antibiotics in nonstandard growth conditions.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Identification of pH specialist cell wall synthases and hydrolases</title><p>To determine the contribution of individual cell wall enzymes to pH-dependent growth, we cultured strains harboring deletions in genes encoding each of three class A PBPs, six LD-transpeptidases, five carboxypeptidases, four amidases, nine lytic glycosyltransferases, and six endopeptidases to mid-exponential phase (OD<sub>600</sub> ~0.2–0.6) in buffered LB media (pH 6.9) then sub-cultured them into fresh LB buffered to pH 4.8, 6.9, or 8.2 for growth rate analysis.

Complementation analysis of PBP1b variants at acidic pH further bolstered the conclusion that activity is required for pH-dependent growth.

Similar to previous reports (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bertsche et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Paradis-Bleau et al., 2014</xref>), the fusion proteins exhibited discrete localization profiles at neutral pH: GFP-PBP1a localized predominantly to the cell periphery, while GFP-PBP1b was present at both the periphery and the septum. Although GFP-PBP1b localization did not noticeably differ across pH conditions, GFP-PBP1a peripheral signal was reduced at pH 5.0, and the fusion adopted an irregular clustered distribution throughout the cell body (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A,B</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2</xref>). The physiological significance of this phenotype remains unclear and requires additional investigation.</p><p>To examine the effect of pH on PBP synthase activity, we first utilized an end-point assay that concurrently measures glycosyltransferase activity and transpeptidase domain activity, which are coupled in the bifunctional class A PBPs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bertsche et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Born et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Egan et al., 2018</xref>). Although purified PBP1a and PBP1b exhibit biochemical activity alone in vitro, we chose to test the influence of pH on the class A PBPs in the context of their key cellular activators, including LpoA for PBP1a and LpoB and FtsN for PBP1b. The outer membrane lipoprotein activators LpoA and LpoB are required for the function of their cognate class A PBP in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Typas et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Paradis-Bleau et al., 2010</xref>), and the essential division protein FtsN can act synergistically with LpoB to enhance PBP1b glycosyltransferase activity up to 16-fold in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Egan et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>Briefly, purified enzymes and their cognate activators were solubilized into detergent micelles and incubated with [<sup>14</sup>C]lipid II precursor in buffer at pH 4.8, 6.9, and 8.2. After one hour, the resulting PG was digested into muropeptides and resolved by high performance liquid chromatography. Glycosyltransferase activity is reflected qualitatively in the proportion of [<sup>14</sup>C]lipid II utilized, resulting in a decrease in peak 1. Transpeptidase activity—including both crosslinking activity and carboxypeptidase activity—is quantified by the fraction of muropeptides with modified peptides (peaks 5–9) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Egan et al., 2015</xref>). Strikingly, at pH 4.8 PBP1a + LpoA exhibited little glycosyltransferase or transpeptidase domain activity; in this condition the majority of [<sup>14</sup>C]lipid II precursor was not polymerized (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>, peak 1). In contrast, PBP1b + LpoB + FtsN maintained similar end-point activity across all tested pH conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D,E</xref>). Low PBP1a glycosyltransferase activity at pH 4.8 was confirmed in a continuous fluorescence assay, which measures the polymerization rate of a Dansyl-labeled Lipid II substrate. Consistent with previous work on PBP1b (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Egan et al., 2014</xref>), in the absence of their cognate activators, both PBP1a and PBP1b exhibited reduced rates of glycosyltransferase activity in acidic conditions. However, co-incubation of PBP1b with LpoB and division protein FtsN significantly increased its polymerization rate under all pH conditions, while PBP1a exhibited poor activity even in the presence of LpoA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s3">Figure 5—figure supplement 3</xref>).</p><p>To test whether pH-dependent changes in PBP activity reflect a change in affinity of the enzymes for their cognate lipoprotein activators, we performed surface plasmon resonance experiments in which PBP1a and PBP1b were immobilized to chips and exposed to LpoA or LpoB at various concentrations. PBP1a-LpoA and PBP1b-LpoB bound at K<sub>D</sub> values of 520 ± 49 nM and 213 ± 22 nM at pH 6.9, respectively. Both K<sub>D</sub> values were ~2 fold higher at pH 8.2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s4">Figure 5—figure supplement 4</xref>), but affinity values could not be determined at pH 4.8 due to significant non-specific binding of both LpoA and LpoB to the chip.

Mutants defective for production of each enzyme were tested for loss of resistance to CEX at pH 5.5 compared to pH 7.0.</p><p>Genetic analysis suggests that PBP1b activity is specifically required for pH-dependent resistance to β-lactam antibiotics. Strains defective for production of PBP1a, PBP1c, LdtD, LdtE, MepS, MltA, MltG, and PBP6b exhibited a similar increase in resistance to CEX at pH 5.5 as the parental strain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s4">Figure 6—figure supplement 4A</xref>). In contrast, loss of PBP1b abolished resistance at pH 5.5 and in fact, slightly increased susceptibility to CEX (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E</xref>). This phenotype was not specific to CEX: resistance to other PBP2 and PBP3 targeting compounds was also eliminated or significantly reduced in cells defective for PBP1b (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s4">Figure 6—figure supplement 4C</xref>). PBP1b enzymatic activity was required for resistance. Loss of the enzyme’s cognate outer membrane lipoprotein LpoB or inactivation of its catalytic activity eliminated CEX resistance at low pH (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s3">Figure 6—figure supplement 3B</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp6">Supplementary file 6</xref>).

Of the pH specialist enzymes identified, we focused on the bifunctional synthases PBP1a and PBP1b, which we find are required for cell wall integrity in distinct pH environments. Failure to produce PBP1b in acidic media (pH &lt;5.9) or PBP1a in more alkaline conditions (pH 6.5–8.2) reduced fitness and led to cell lysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). This lytic death is characteristic of class A PBP-deficient cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Suzuki et al., 1978</xref>) and is consistent with their essential role in PG synthesis, perhaps by filling gaps in the PG foundation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Cho et al., 2016</xref>).

Hence, the differential requirement for the class A PBPs in growth across pH conditions is unlikely to be a consequence of altered cell wall structure or distinct enzymatic activity of the PBPs.</p><p>Instead, our data suggest that pH-dependent differences in class A PBP activity underlie their contribution to maximal fitness in distinct pH environments. Even in the presence of its activator LpoA, PBP1a exhibits little glycosyltransferase and transpeptidase activity in vitro in acidic conditions, rendering the cell reliant on PBP1b to provide the essential class A PBP activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D,E</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s3">Figure 5—figure supplement 3</xref>). At present, the precise mechanism for reduced activity of PBP1a in acidic media remains unclear; possible causes include pH-dependent changes in structure, substrate binding, or catalysis, as well as reduced affinity to LpoA in acidic conditions. We attempted to test the latter model using surface plasmon resonance (SPR), but technical limitations prevented us from drawing firm conclusions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s4">Figure 5—figure supplement 4</xref>). Although further work is needed, the depletion of PBP1a from the cell periphery in acidic media may also reflect an inactive state of the protein in vivo (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>).</p><p>Unlike PBP1a, PBP1b activity is largely invariant in vitro across the pH conditions tested when assayed in the presence of its key regulators (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D,E</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s3">Figure 5—figure supplement 3</xref>). Although this finding is consistent with our observation that PBP1b can partially compensate for loss of PBP1a in alkaline media (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>), it remains unclear why PBP1a is required for maximal fitness in alkaline media. Additional factors in vivo, such as novel class A PBP regulators, may be responsible for the cell’s preference for PBP1a in alkaline conditions that are not recapitulated in our in vitro assays. In support of this model, PBP1b exhibits reduced binding to radiolabeled penicillin in membrane extracts incubated in alkaline buffer relative to neutral or acidic conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Amaral et al., 1986</xref>). Alternatively, differences in the enzymes’ localization and/or interaction partners may also play a role in their pH specialization. For example, PBP1a and PBP1b preferentially associate with specialized cell wall synthesis complexes essential for cell elongation and cell division, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Müller et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bertsche et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Banzhaf et al., 2012</xref>).

Future work investigating the influence of pH on the essential components of the elongation and division machinery is thus necessary to determine whether the activity of these complexes affects the cell’s class A PBP preference.</p><p>Although PBP1a and PBP1b share an essential role in growth and cell wall integrity under standard culture conditions (i.e. nutrient rich, neutral pH growth medium) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Suzuki et al., 1978</xref>), there had been previous hints these enzymes were not interchangeable.

Clarifying PBP1b’s role in intrinsic resistance to β-lactams will shed light on the mechanics of cell wall biogenesis and inform the design and use of novel antibiotic therapies.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Apparent redundancy ensures fitness across environmental conditions</title><p>Apart from influencing antibiotic resistance, environmental specialization of cell wall enzymes is likely a key adaptation that allows <italic>E. coli</italic> to thrive across an unusually wide pH range (pH ~4–9) and even tolerate extreme pH shocks, such as during transient exposure to gastric acid (pH ~2) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Jordan et al., 1999</xref>). Plasticity in the cell wall synthesis machinery likely works in concert with the organism’s ability to modify extracellular pH through the export of acidic and alkaline substrates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Lu et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Krulwich et al., 2011</xref>). In this context, pH-specialist cell wall enzymes may function in part to maintain cell wall integrity until the extracellular media reaches a growth-permissive pH.</p><p>Among other pH tolerant organisms, strategies employed to expand growth across wide pH ranges are likely to vary, even between closely related species. <italic>S. enterica</italic> serovar Typhimurium encodes a PBP3 paralog, termed PBP3<sub>SAL</sub>, that is active during growth in acidic environments, including intracellularly in the phagolysosome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Castanheira et al., 2017</xref>). As PBP3<sub>SAL</sub> is restricted to <italic>Salmonella</italic>, <italic>Enterobacter</italic>, and <italic>Citrobacter</italic> spp., alternative mechanisms to cope with changing pH environments must exist.

Ionic strength, osmolality, and temperature also vary across the diverse habitats bacteria occupy. Like pH, these factors may have significant impacts on the chemical and physical properties of the periplasm and the extracytoplasmic space of Gram-positive bacteria. In support of this idea, PBP2 from <italic>Caulobacter crescentus</italic> displays differential localization patterns as a function of extracellular osmolality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Hocking et al., 2012</xref>), and the lytic transglycosylase MltA from <italic>E. coli</italic> is ~10 times more active at 30°C than at 37°C in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">van Straaten et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Lommatzsch et al., 1997</xref>).

The Reviewing Editor's assessment is that all the issues have been addressed.]</p><p><italic>Evaluation of resubmission:</italic></p><p>The authors have now responded to each of the issues raised by the three reviewers. In general, the responses are thorough and appropriate. The changes made to the text as well as the additional experiments performed have now strengthened many of the conclusions and claims made in the paper. In particular, the evidence supporting the pH-specialization of PBP1a and PBP1b has been improved. This includes new in vitro studies, done collaboratively with the Vollmer group, showing that PBP1a activity is significantly reduced at pH 4.8, potentially explaining why PBP1b activity becomes required at lower pH. Precisely how pH affects PBP1a activity still is not totally clear - an attempt was made to measure stimulation by LpoA but technical difficulties prevented a clear assessment of this. The authors have also addressed a key concern from one reviewer regarding the increased resistance to a sub-class of beta-lactam antibiotics at low pH showing that the effects are likely not due to non-specific changes in permeability. All told, the changes made to the paper have improved it and strengthened the major conclusions.</p><p><italic>Decision letter after peer review:</italic></p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Plasticity of <italic>E. coli</italic> cell wall metabolism promotes fitness and antibiotic resistance across environmental conditions&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, including Michael T Laub as the Reviewing Editor and Reviewer #1, and the evaluation has been overseen by Gisela Storz as the Senior Editor.</p><p>The Reviewing Editor has highlighted the concerns that require revision and/or responses, and we have included the separate reviews below for your consideration. If you have any questions, please do not hesitate to contact us.</p><p>Summary of major concerns:</p><p>This paper presents data to support the intriguing conclusion that the apparent redundancy of cell wall synthetic proteins may stem from their specialization to different environments. The reviewers agreed that the paper was well-written and contained a substantial body of data to demonstrate that PBP1b, in particular, assumes a pivotal role in low pH environments. There were, however, a number of major concerns raised, detailed in the individual reviews below. Most notably, the reviewers were concerned about whether PBP1a is really &quot;specialized&quot; for alkaline pH and hence whether PBP1a/b redundancy has evolved to ensure optimal activities in opposing pH niches. They also thought the paper would benefit from additional data and insights into the notion that PBP1b may replace PBP2/3 in the elongation and division machineries at low pH. There were also concerns about the statistics and number of replicates in several figures.</p><p>You can see below that reviewer 2 initially was quite positive. However to be complete, we want to give you a sense of the subsequent discussion where that reviewer stated:</p><p>&quot;I was obviously more enthusiastic about the story than both of you, although I too was surprised to see it in <italic>eLife</italic>. I think that you both brought up important points and that my liking of the overarching idea of specialization made me miss some of the issues.&quot;</p><p>&quot;So, thinking about everyone's comments and my new perspective, I believe that the paper is not at par for <italic>eLife</italic>. It presents a very interesting model to explain the so-called redundancy and lack of phenotypes. I like the idea that the lack of phenotypes reflects that we are looking under the wrong conditions (which the paper illustrates) because those enzymes have been selected for in the real world for billions of years. I also like the warning about antibiotic sensitivity being affected by environmental conditions like pH. However, the problem is that the authors overinterpret some of their results. It seems that the story boils down to PBP1A specifically not being able to work at low pH for an unknown mechanism. PBP1B seems to be able to work under all conditions, although slightly worse than 1A at high pH, but the data do not support the perfect picture of Figure 7. They could get more data in response to reviews but, most importantly, they will have to revise the model.&quot;</p><p>Separate reviews (please respond to each point):</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic> </p><p>This paper examines the pH-dependencies of PBP1a and PBP1b, arguing that each is &quot;specialized&quot; for a different pH. The data are relatively clean and soundly interpreted in most cases. Overall, the paper paints a compelling picture that the apparent redundancy of cell wall enzymes may reflect specialization for different environments. Below are several issues that I think the authors should respond to before publication – in some cases, this could involve significant new experiments, but I think such experiments would substantially add to the paper's mechanistic depth and long-term impact on the field.</p><p>1) Figure 5C shows PBP1b levels – but what about PBP1a?</p><p>2) Is there any significance to the clustering of GFP-PBP1a at low pH? I was sort of surprised that this observation wasn't followed up at all.</p><p>3) PBP1b provides resistance to various antibiotics at low pH. But I don't really understand why. If the model is that PBP1a is more active and neutral and alkaline pH with PBP1b more active at low pH, why isn't PBP1a leading to comparable levels of resistance at the higher pHs? Do PBP1b and PBP1a, in fact, have different activities? I thought they were carrying out the same reaction, with one more active at low pH and the other more active at higher pHs, so the source of the difference in antibiotic susceptibility doesn't really make sense to me, but maybe I'm missing something here.</p><p>4) I really think it's a lost opportunity to not provide more insight into the molecular basis for the pH differences in PBP1a and PBP1b. It appears that PBP1b activity can be reconstituted in vitro, including with LpoB and FtsN, so testing things in vitro at different pHs so testing things in vitro at different pHs seems potentially feasible. I would encourage the authors to at least consider whether something in this regard can be done to strengthen and enhance the paper.</p><p>5) I wondered whether there are phylogenetic analyses to support the notion that PBP1a and PBP1b have evolved, at least in part, to allow cells to cope with different pH conditions. Are there strains of <italic>E. coli</italic> lacking PBP1b or even closely related species lacking it? If so, can they not tolerate low pHs and/or would their PBPs complement a PBP1a/1b double deletion only at certain pHs?</p><p><italic>Minor Comments:</italic> </p><p>Abstract, last sentence: Awkward sentence – rephrase for clarity.</p><p>&quot;providing a force&quot; maybe not &quot;providing the force&quot; in light of recent findings from KC Huang et al.</p><p>&quot;in in&quot; typo.</p><p>Introduction, last sentence: Sort of a cryptic end to the Introduction – clarify why this is concerning and what the consequences are.</p><p>Subsection “Identification of pH specialist cell wall synthases and hydrolases”, first paragraph: The authors probably need to do an ANOVA test to control for multiple hypothesis testing.

I just always think it's tough to show something is truly optimal.</p><p>Subsection “aPBP activity promotes cell wall integrity across pH environment”, first paragraph: typo, &quot;cells&quot; not &quot;cell&quot;.</p><p>Typo &quot;previous a proteomic&quot;.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic> </p><p>Most bacteria build a peptidoglycan cell wall that protects them from osmotic lysis. While enzymes required for the synthesis of the peptidoglycan precursor (lipid-linked disaccharide pentapeptide) are essential, many of the enzymes participating in the construction of the cell wall are not. In <italic>Escherichia coli</italic>, there is functional redundancy between two class a penicillin-binding proteins (PBPs) since removal of both PBP1a and PBP1b causes lethality. This has led to the idea that functional redundancy might be widespread among enzymes that synthesize and modify the cell wall, since removal of individual factors does not typically confer phenotypes. Here, Mueller and Levin challenge the view that these enzymes are simply redundant. They showed that the so-called &quot;redundant&quot; PBP1a and PBP1b enzymes have each specialized to function in different pH ranges. While PBP1a is dispensable in acidic conditions, PBP1b is essential; in contrast, in alkaline environments, PBP1b is dispensable, but PBP1a is required for optimal survival. This is a significant discovery and it is possible that, as the authors propose, similar specialization might apply to other enzymes involved in peptidoglycan synthesis and remodeling. Furthermore, the authors demonstrate that the intrinsic resistance to antibiotics can be different based on environmental pH.</p><p>The manuscript is well written, experiments were well done, conclusions are justified, and the work reports significant findings.</p><p>There is only one issue that should be easily addressed to strengthen one of the claims:</p><p>The authors used a propidium iodide assay to quantify lysis. This assay measures the uptake of the dye not necessary lysis. Although the images of cells in Figure 3 and Figure 4 show that some cells have lysed, the authors should track loss of cytoplasmic contents (e.g. leakage of cytoplasmic GFP or LacZ) to demonstrate and quantify lysis. It would also be nice to complement lysis data with a kill curve (determine number of cells alive by CFUs after exposure to the specific pH). The authors could still leave the propidium iodide data to reflect envelope problems (but not necessarily lysis or even death).</p><p><italic>Minor Comments:</italic> </p><p>1) Delete repeated &quot;in&quot;.</p><p>2) Subsection “Identification of pH specialist cell wall synthases and hydrolases”, second paragraph: I think it should state &quot;six&quot; mutants. Not &quot;seven&quot;.</p><p>3) Subsection “aPBP activity ensures fitness across a wide pH range”, first paragraph: Denome et al., 1999, might not be the best reference to cite the synthetic lethality of PBP1a and 1b because the pbp1a mutant used in that study contained additional mutations, as described in Meberg et al., J Bacteriol. 183:6148-9; PMID: 11567017. It would be more appropriate to cite the first report of the synthetic lethality: Suzuki et al. (1978) PNAS 75: 664-668; https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.75.2.664.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic> </p><p>Bacteria maintain a tremendous enzymatic redundancy when it comes to building up their cell wall. In this paper, the authors systematically assess the contribution of 33 enzymes (carrying 7 distinct enzymatic functions) to the growth rate of <italic>E. coli</italic> in low and high pH, both commonly encountered environments for <italic>E. coli</italic> in the human body. The authors then focus on one group, the bifunctional synthases, and provide evidence that its 2 main members, PBP1a and PBP1b are specialized for acting in high and low pH, respectively. They also link this PBP1b specificity to increased resistance to a subgroup of β-lactam inhibitors at acidic environments. Overall, the authors use this example to propose that division of labor and environment-specific action is the main reason behind the apparent redundancy of cell wall enzymes.</p><p>The strengths of this paper are that:</p><p>• it is clearly and well written;</p><p>• it systematically interrogates the relationships between a specific environment (pH) and cell wall biosynthetic enzymes;</p><p>• it makes a stronger case for environment-dependent changes in the activity of cell-wall enzymes;</p><p>• it provides strong evidence for the crucial role of PBP1b at low pH (which I think the authors should focus on);</p><p>• it provides preliminary evidence that there may be a striking reorganization of the division and elongation machineries at low pH (which the authors can provide more evidence for – see point 4).</p><p>On the other hand, there are also obvious weaknesses:</p><p>• the novelty of pH-dependency of cell wall enzymes is questionable; several papers have already provided single-case examples;</p><p>• the claim that redundancy of cell wall enzymes boils down only to environment-specialized function is not something the current data can support. Specialization may be spatiotemporal (e.g. cell cycle), allow links to distinct protein machineries, allow additional functions… Redundancy could also ensure robustness of an essential process, targeted by many natural products in nature (antibiotics, T6SS effectors);</p><p>• the data for PBP1a taking control in high pH are weak/not convincing (see point 2), which undermines the main statement about clear pH division of bifunctional synthases;</p><p>• the statistics, the experimental description and sometimes the experiment setup do not warrant for the claims made (see points 1, 2 and 5);</p><p>• there are alternative ways to interpret the antibiotic resistance at low pH, which are independent of the PBP1b increased activity (see point 3).</p><p>Major points:</p><p>1) Credit should be given to authors for their effort to systematically detect growth defects of mutants in cell wall enzymes across different pH's (Figure 1). However, since most of the effects are small, statistics and experimental setups need be stronger/more transparent to substantiate claims. n=3 (Figure 1 and Figure 1—figure supplement 1) is very low to call 5% effects and to do t-tests (which assume normal distributions). It is also unclear how many measurements and what window of OD's are used for the exponential growth fit, and how good fits are at the end. Representative examples as a supp. figure would be extremely useful, in addition to providing the raw data and fits as supp. data. Last, there is no mention if authors look for/normalize plate effects (positional biases) when measuring for growth. This is very common in microtiter assays, and could very well be driving some of the small differences.</p><p>Since there are now a number of studies published in which the fitness of <italic>E. coli</italic> genome-wide mutant libraries has been probed across many different conditions (PMID 21185072, 27355376, 29769716), the authors may want to compare their results to these studies. pH is certainly one of these conditions. This way they can also look for further evidence of more conditional-specific roles for cell wall enzymes.</p><p>2) The are several pieces of data that make me doubt about the validity of the claims about the PBP1a importance/specialization in alkaline pH. I would suggest to remove (the emphasis from) this part, unless authors provide much stronger evidence.</p><p>In growth assays, the specific defect of the mrcA mutant in alkaline pH is questionable. Effect is marginal at ph8.2 in Figure 1A (mrcA seems to also have a very mild defect in all pHs in same figure) and Figure 2A mentions no n (done once?) and has no error bars to assess the significance of differences. Besides the two figures disagree; in 2A, the biggest difference is for ph~7 (difference gone for ph&gt;8) and in 1A is at pH=8.2. Also speaking against of specialized role of PBP1A-LpoA at alkaline conditions, the lpoA mutant has the same small growth defect in all pH's (Figure 2C – if anything smaller at alkaline pHs)!</p><p>In microscopy, the cell death of mrcA is only transient (Figure 3B), so this cannot be the reason for the change in steady state growth as authors suggest (subsection “aPBP activity promotes cell wall integrity across pH environments”, second paragraph). Such an effect would result into also a transient growth defect in batch culture, which will be invisible the way authors do their experiments (as they back dilute 10^3 cells/ml so first doublings are in ODs that are below level of detection). Only way to explain batch growth rate defect (if it holds) is with an accompanying change in single cell growth rate, which authors can measure.</p><p>The data on PBP1A activity (Figure 5E) at different pH's are again not convincing. Signal is very low (btw this is completely the opposite from Figure 5D, where PBP1a has the strongest signal!), kinetics are fast (so many points and replicates are needed) and this seems to be the only replicate for measuring rates. It is also unclear how fits are done for Kobs (what type of nonlinear regression?), but they are definitely bad for ph5 (it seems as if a linear fit is shown). Besides more replicates with more points in the Bocillin assay, an in-vitro PBP1a assay may allow to see better kinetics and would strengthen any argument. Please keep in mind that pH7 that experiments are done for Figure 5E are not alkaline but neutral.</p><p>Overall, I find little evidence that PBP1a-LpoA takes over in alkaline conditions (as implied in text and Figure 7). Even if all effects are validated, at best it means that PBP1a/LpoA have a role under these conditions, but PBP1b/LpoB can compensate to a large degree.</p><p>3) Increased resistance to a sub-class of β-lactams at low pH is due to increased PBP1B activity. Although this could very well be (effect gone in mrcB mutant and controls in Figure 6—figure supplement 3C and D provide strong evidence), everything could be also explained with some of these drugs having decreased entry at low pH. Note that β-lactams have differential uptake and efflux preferences – Aztreonam for example needs OmpF to enter cell (see PMID – 29980614). Less drug in the cell could explain also why cells treated with Cephalexin or Mecillinam need more drug to change their morphology at pH5, although presumably the targets of the drugs, PBP3 and PBP2 do not change levels.</p><p>Measuring drug intracellular concentrations would be required to exclude such a scenario. Or alternatively some of the experiments in point 4 could strengthen the PBP1B increased activity in complexes. Also including more non-specific/broad β-lactams would (Carbenicillin, Amoxicillin) would help towards this direction. Note that Imipinem is not a selective PBP2 inhibitor- it targets many PBPs in addition to LD-transpeptidases.</p><p>4) The authors propose 3 models to rationalize how PBP1b increased activity at low pH could make cells more resistance to PBP2/3 inhibitors. They favor the one which PBP1b replaces PBP2 and PBP3 in the elongasome and divisome (as increased repair could for example not explain the need for increased Cephalexin to see filamentation at low pH). This scenario has some straightforward ramifications that are rather easy to test: PBP2/3 should be less active at low pH (Bocillin assay), PBP1b/2/3 dynamics may differ at low pH, cells should tolerate more depletion of PBP2/PBP3 at low pH. Also it could be interesting to test if <italic>Salmonella</italic> shows the same higher resistance at low pH (in PBP1b-dependent manner) when PBP3Sal is knocked out but not when there (because PBP3Sal is still as sensitive to PBP3 inhibitors).</p><p>5) Quantification and statistics suffer throughout the paper. Replicates are not always there (Figure 2A, Figure 5E) and many times too little for the statistics authors want to do: standard deviation from 2 replicates (5C, 6D), t-tests from sets of 3 experiments (Figure 1). Microscopy is not always quantified (Figure 5A, 6B/C), and the most worrisome is that panels do not always agree (Figure 1-2, or Figure 5D and 5E). All this should be amended for the conclusions to be on solid ground.</p><p><italic>Minor Comments:</italic> </p><p>1) Introduction, second paragraph: the reason for the high sensitivity of the periplasm is not the different permeability of the two membranes; please rephrase.</p><p>2) Introduction, second paragraph: careful, there is a homeostatic control system: HdeA and HdeB are periplasmic chaperones induced and required during acidic conditions; quite some things known about their function.

The data are relatively clean and soundly interpreted in most cases. Overall, the paper paints a compelling picture that the apparent redundancy of cell wall enzymes may reflect specialization for different environments. Below are several issues that I think the authors should respond to before publication – in some cases, this could involve significant new experiments, but I think such experiments would substantially add to the paper's mechanistic depth and long-term impact on the field.</p><p>1) Figure 5C shows PBP1b levels – but what about PBP1a?</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this suggestion. We acquired a PBP1a antibody and have updated Figure 5C to include PBP1a levels across pH conditions. Normalizing to FtsZ levels as an internal loading control, this analysis revealed that both PBP1a and PBP1b levels are modestly reduced (~2 and 4-fold, respectively) during growth at pH 5.2 compared to pH 6.9. As noted in the text, this finding is consistent with the trend observed in Schmidt et al., 2016, by proteomic mass spectrometry when comparing cells grown at pH 6.0 to pH 7.0. In contrast, PBP1a and PBP1b levels were not significantly altered during growth at pH 8.2 compared to pH 6.9. This result strengthens our conclusion that changes in aPBP levels across pH environments are unlikely to contribute to the enzymes’ pH specificity.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Is there any significance to the clustering of GFP-PBP1a at low pH? I was sort of surprised that this observation wasn't followed up at all.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer this is an interesting observation that warrants further investigation in future studies. In the present revision, we have quantified PBP1a subcellular localization (see Figure 5—figure supplement 2), as suggested by reviewer 3. As expected, during growth at pH 7.0, GFP-PBP1b is enriched at the cell boundaries, similar to the localization profile previously reported for GFP-PBP1a (e.g. Paradis-Bleau, 2010). However, during growth at pH 5.0, GFP-PBP1a enrichment at the cell boundaries is reduced and instead forms irregular shaped puncta throughout the cell body. It is tempting to speculate that the reduction in peripheral GFP-PBP1a may reflect a reduction in the available/active PBP1a pool at the cell envelope and thus contribute to the cell’s reliance on PBP1b to provide the essential aPBP activity during growth in acidic media. This pH-dependent change in GFP-PBP1a localization may be a product of many factors, including but not limited to improper localization of a PBP1a activator (e.g. LpoA), sequestration of PBP1a by an unknown factor, an inactive conformational state of PBP1a, degradation of PBP1a or LpoA, or an inability of PBP1a to successfully traffic to the membrane. Rigorous assessment of each of these possibilities will be investigated in future studies.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) PBP1b provides resistance to various antibiotics at low pH. But I don't really understand why. If the model is that PBP1a is more active and neutral and alkaline pH with PBP1b more active at low pH, why isn't PBP1a leading to comparable levels of resistance at the higher pHs? Do PBP1b and PBP1a, in fact, have different activities? I thought they were carrying out the same reaction, with one more active at low pH and the other more active at higher pHs, so the source of the difference in antibiotic susceptibility doesn't really make sense to me, but maybe I'm missing something here.</p></disp-quote><p>PBP1a and PBP1b share the same biochemical activities in vitro(i.e. transpeptidase and glycosyltransferase activity) and appear to be interchangeable for growth in vivo. At the same time, their activity is differentially required in vivo in response to different types of cell envelope stress, including antibiotic, osmotic, and mechanical challenge. In particular, PBP1b seems to be critical in response to these stressors, and PBP1a cannot fully compensate in the absence of PBP1b.</p><p>At present, it remains unclear why PBP1b is preferentially required for resistance to cell wall stress. Several explanations have been proposed. One possibility is that differences in enzymatic activity (e.g. differences in cross linking ability) and/or enzymatic efficiency of the class A PBPs contributes to their distinct roles in stress resistance. For example, Born et al., 2006, found that under optimal in vitroconditions PBP1b synthesized PG with 2x the amount of crosslinked peptides compared to PBP1a. While the relationship between the enzymatic properties of the class A PBPs and the PBP1b mutant antibiotic hypersensitivity has yet to be rigorously interrogated, there is little evidence to suggest enzymatic differences are playing a role in the pH-dependent resistance phenotype described here: comparison of <italic>E. coli</italic> PG composition at pH 7.5 and 5.0 did not reveal any differences in overall PG structure, including the percentage of crosslinked peptides (Peters et al., 2016). An alternative possibility is that the class A PBPs play unique roles in cell wall quality control. In support of this idea, in the time since our manuscript was submitted, work from Moré and colleagues (Moré et al., 2019) identified a role for LpoB/PBP1b (but not LpoA/PBP1a) in a so-called “PG repair machine” important for survival after outer membrane stress. It is possible that PBP1b may play a similar role in responding to β-lactam induced cell wall “damage”, and PBP1a cannot compensate. This model also remains to be tested.</p><p>Although of significant interest, the cause of the disparate contribution of PBP1a and PBP1b to β-lactam protection is not the focus of this investigation, so we have refrained on extensively commenting on it in the text. We have, however, added lines to the Discussion and throughout the text more explicitly distinguish between the class A PBPs’ overlapping roles in supporting cell growth (under standard culture conditions) and in stress/antibiotic resistance.</p><p> <italic>4) I really think it's a lost opportunity to not provide more insight into the molecular basis for the pH differences in PBP1a and PBP1b. It appears that PBP1b activity can be reconstituted</italic> in vitro<italic>, including with LpoB and FtsN, so testing things</italic> in vitro <italic>at different pHs so testing things</italic> in vitro <italic>at different pHs seems potentially feasible. I would encourage the authors to at least consider whether something in this regard can be done to strengthen and enhance the paper.</italic> </p><p>We thank the reviewer for encouraging us to investigate the impact of pH on the biochemical activity of PBP1a and PBP1b in the context of their known activators. To this end, we collaborated with Waldemar Vollmer’s group, which has extensive expertise in reconstituting activity of the class A PBPs in the presence of their cognate activators in vitro. The results of these experiments are included in Figure 5D, E, Figure 5—figure supplement 2, and Figure 5—figure supplement 3 and are discussed in the subsection “PBP1a localization and activity are impaired at low pH”. Overall, they support a model in which PBP1a activity is significantly reduced at pH 4.8, rendering the cell reliant on PBP1b activity in acidic media.</p><p>Briefly, we performed two PG synthesis assays. The first is an end point assay, in which purified enzymes and activators are reconstituted in micelles, supplied radiolabeled Lipid II precursor, and allowed to react for our hour. Synthesized PG is digested into muropeptides and resolved via HPLC. The fraction of unutilized Lipid II provides a qualitative metric for end-point glycosyltransferase activity, and the end-point transpeptidase activity can by quantified by the sum of the peaks corresponding to crosslinked products. This analysis revealed that PBP1b-LpoA has little activity at pH 4.8, while PBP1b retains similar activity across all pH conditions (Figure 5D, E).</p><p>This finding is further bolstered by the results of a continuous fluorescence assay (Figure 5—figure supplement 3). This assay measures glycosyltransferase reaction rate by quantifying the rate of polymerization of Dansyl-labled Lipid II substrate. Polymerization causes a decrease in fluorescence signal. As previously shown for PBP1b, both class A PBPs had a reduced polymerization rate in acidic media when assayed in the absence of their regulators. However, the presence of LpoB and FtsN significantly stimulated polymerization rate of PBP1b in all pH conditions (with the highest fold-change observed at pH 4.8); in contrast, LpoA failed to stimulate PBP1a under the same conditions. Note that the experimental conditions (e.g. temperature and enzyme concentration) vary between panels A and B due to technical limitations in accurately quantifying the rapid activity of PBP1b in the presence of its activators at 37 °C.</p><p>In attempt to distinguish whether the lack of PBP1a activity in acidic conditions is due to a decrease in affinity for LpoA, we performed a series of SRP experiments to measure the binding affinity of PBP1a and PBP1b to their cognate Lpo at pH 4.8, 6.9, and 8.2. Although affinity measurements could be made at pH 6.9 and 8.2, the Lpos both bound to the chip nonspecifically at pH 4.8 and impeded affinity calculations. Therefore, while it is evident that LpoB can stimulate PBP1b in acidic conditions (as evidenced by the GTase assay), it remains unclear whether the LpoA stimulation of PBP1a occurs at pH 4.8.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) I wondered whether there are phylogenetic analyses to support the notion that PBP1a and PBP1b have evolved, at least in part, to allow cells to cope with different pH conditions. Are there strains of E. coli lacking PBP1b or even closely related species lacking it? If so, can they not tolerate low pHs and/or would their PBPs complement a PBP1a/1b double deletion only at certain pHs?</p></disp-quote><p>This is a very interesting hypothesis that we would love to test. However, previous phylogenetic analysis (Typas et al., 2010; see Figure 6) revealed that all γ-proteobacteria, including all examined <italic>E. coli</italic> and <italic>Enterobacteriaceae</italic> genomes, possess orthologs of PBP1a and PBP1b. While α and β proteobacteria only encode PBP1a orthologs, their evolutionary distance from <italic>E. coli</italic> MG1655 would complicate any conclusions that we would hope to make in doing such an analysis.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Minor Comments:</p><p>Abstract, last sentence: Awkward sentence – rephrase for clarity.</p></disp-quote><p>Rewritten, as suggested.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>&quot;providing a force&quot; maybe not &quot;providing the force&quot; in light of recent findings from KC Huang et al.</p></disp-quote><p>Modified in text in light of the recent finding by Rojas et al., 2018, that the outer membrane in Gram negative bacteria is also a load bearing element.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>&quot;in in&quot; typo.</p></disp-quote><p>Modified in text.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Introduction, last sentence: Sort of a cryptic end to the Introduction – clarify why this is concerning and what the consequences are.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree.

While enzymes required for the synthesis of the peptidoglycan precursor (lipid-linked disaccharide pentapeptide) are essential, many of the enzymes participating in the construction of the cell wall are not. In Escherichia coli, there is functional redundancy between two class a penicillin-binding proteins (PBPs) since removal of both PBP1a and PBP1b causes lethality. This has led to the idea that functional redundancy might be widespread among enzymes that synthesize and modify the cell wall, since removal of individual factors does not typically confer phenotypes. Here, Mueller and Levin challenge the view that these enzymes are simply redundant. They showed that the so-called &quot;redundant&quot; PBP1a and PBP1b enzymes have each specialized to function in different pH ranges. While PBP1a is dispensable in acidic conditions, PBP1b is essential; in contrast, in alkaline environments, PBP1b is dispensable, but PBP1a is required for optimal survival. This is a significant discovery and it is possible that, as the authors propose, similar specialization might apply to other enzymes involved in peptidoglycan synthesis and remodeling. Furthermore, the authors demonstrate that the intrinsic resistance to antibiotics can be different based on environmental pH.</p><p>The manuscript is well written, experiments were well done, conclusions are justified, and the work reports significant findings.</p><p>There is only one issue that should be easily addressed to strengthen one of the claims:</p><p>The authors used a propidium iodide assay to quantify lysis. This assay measures the uptake of the dye not necessary lysis. Although the images of cells in Figure 3 and Figure 4 show that some cells have lysed, the authors should track loss of cytoplasmic contents (e.g. leakage of cytoplasmic GFP or LacZ) to demonstrate and quantify lysis. It would also be nice to complement lysis data with a kill curve (determine number of cells alive by CFUs after exposure to the specific pH). The authors could still leave the propidium iodide data to reflect envelope problems (but not necessarily lysis or even death).</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this suggestion. To complement this analysis, we transformed PBP1a and PBP1b defective cells with a plasmid that expresses <italic>gfp</italic> under an IPTG-inducible promoter and measured concurrent π staining and loss of cytoplasmic GFP signal by time lapse microscopy when cells were exposed to their respective ‘non-permissive’ pH conditions. All cells that stained PI+ (n = 419 for Δ<italic>mrcB</italic> and n = 789 for Δ<italic>mrcA</italic>) also lost cytoplasmic GFP signal within 1-2 frames (acquisitions were taken every 3 minutes). Population-level π staining/cytoplasmic GFP loss kinetics are now summarized in Figure 3—figure supplement 1. We do note that the lysis kinetics of the Δ<italic>mrcB</italic> mutant harboring the plasmid are slower compared to the untransformed strain (compare to Figure 3C), and qualitatively there appears to be a reduced rate of lysis via bulging. We speculate that this difference in phenotype may reflect a change in turgor pressure upon excess GFP production, but we did not investigate it further. Altogether, in combination with our new finding that single cell elongation rate is invariant among the mutants across pH conditions (a suggestion of reviewer 3), this new data strongly supports our model that the bulk culture growth rate defect of the mutants at their respective non-permissive pH condition is due to cell lysis.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Minor Comments:</p><p>1) Delete repeated &quot;in&quot;.</p></disp-quote><p>Modified in text.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Subsection “Identification of pH specialist cell wall synthases and hydrolases”, second paragraph: I think it should state &quot;six&quot; mutants.

However, since most of the effects are small, statistics and experimental setups need be stronger/more transparent to substantiate claims. n=3 (Figure 1 and Figure 1—figure supplement 1) is very low to call 5% effects and to do t-tests (which assume normal distributions). It is also unclear how many measurements and what window of OD's are used for the exponential growth fit, and how good fits are at the end. Representative examples as a supp. figure would be extremely useful, in addition to providing the raw data and fits as supp. data. Last, there is no mention if authors look for/normalize plate effects (positional biases) when measuring for growth. This is very common in microtiter assays, and could very well be driving some of the small differences.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for encouraging us to provide more information on our experimental set up and data analysis, and we wholeheartedly agree that growth rate measurements can be highly sensitive to uncontrolled variables. We have rigorously designed our screen to minimize sources of uncontrolled variation. We have added additional information in the text to clarify our experimental and analysis pipeline, including subsection “Identification of pH specialist cell wall synthases and hydrolases”, in the Materials and methods, Figure 1—figure supplement 1, Figure 1—figure supplement 2, and Supplementary file 3 to address these concerns.</p><p>As we state in the original version of the manuscript, growth rates were determined by least-squares fitting of growth curves between the OD600 values of 0.005-0.1 for three independent replicates per mutant. This analysis was performed in R. For transparency, we now provide sample growth curves, fits, and fit statistics for a subset of our mutants in Figure 1—figure supplement 1. Best fit lines with R<sup>2</sup> values of &lt; 0.95 were excluded from further analysis. In addition to the representative curves and fits, we have included the growth rates (as measured in mass doublings per hour +/- standard deviation) for all tested mutants at pH 4.8, 6.9, and 8.2 in Supplementary file 3 (n=3 for all measurements). No positional effects were observed. As suggested by reviewer 1, we re-assessed significance of our hits using a one-way ANOVA, normalized for multiple comparisons; 5 of the 6 original hits remained significantly attenuated with this analysis.</p><p>To address the concern that some of our hits confer relatively small reductions in growth rate, we added an additional layer of validation to our analysis. We reasoned that a consistent growth defect across a discrete range of pH values would be a rigorous way to validate bona fide hits as opposed to statistical aberrations (analogous to what we had previously done for PBP1a and PBP1b-defective cells). To this end, we compared the growth rate of each mutant to the WT across a range of pH values (pH 4.8-8.4). Six biological replicates spread across at least two days were performed. Excitingly, all five of the mutants tested demonstrated consistent, statistically significant growth rate defects across a contiguous range of pH values (see Figure 1—figure supplement 2 and Figure 2). This data is now plotted in both absolute doublings per hour as well as% doublings per hour of the parental strain to allow for easier comparison between the mutants’ growth across different pH conditions (see point #2). This analysis strongly suggests each of the mutants pulled out in our screen exhibits a specific and reproducible pH sensitivity. We would like to further note that relatively small differences in mutant growth rate may lead to significant fitness defects in natural environments with competition for limited resources.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Since there are now a number of studies published in which the fitness of E. coli genome-wide mutant libraries has been probed across many different conditions (PMID 21185072, 27355376, 29769716), the authors may want to compare their results to these studies. pH is certainly one of these conditions. This way they can also look for further evidence of more conditional-specific roles for cell wall enzymes.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for making us aware of these resources. Excitingly, loss of function mutants in the genes encoding PBP1b and MepS both have acid-specific growth defects for colony formation (PMID 21185072). We have added a sentence to the text (subsection “Class A PBP activity ensures fitness across a wide pH range”) to reflect this.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) The are several pieces of data that make me doubt about the validity of the claims about the PBP1a importance/specialization in alkaline pH. I would suggest to remove (the emphasis from) this part, unless authors provide much stronger evidence.</p><p>In growth assays, the specific defect of the mrcA mutant in alkaline pH is questionable. Effect is marginal at ph8.2 in Figure 1A (mrcA seems to also have a very mild defect in all pHs in same Fig) and Figure 2A mentions no n (done once?) and has no error bars to assess the significance of differences. Besides the two figures disagree; in 2A, the biggest difference is for ph~7 (difference gone for ph&gt;8) and in 1A is at pH=8.2. Also speaking against of specialized role of PBP1A-LpoA at alkaline conditions, the lpoA mutant has the same small growth defect in all pH's (Figure 2C- if anything smaller at alkaline pHs)!</p><p>In microscopy, the cell death of mrcA is only transient (Figure 3B), so this cannot be the reason for the change in steady state growth as authors suggest (subsection “aPBP activity promotes cell wall integrity across pH environments”, second paragraph). Such an effect would result into also a transient growth defect in batch culture, which will be invisible the way authors do their experiments (as they back dilute 10^3 cells/ml so first doublings are in ODs that are below level of detection). Only way to explain batch growth rate defect (if it holds) is with an accompanying change in single cell growth rate, which authors can measure.</p><p>The data on PBP1A activity (Figure 5E) at different pH's are again not convincing. Signal is very low (btw this is completely the opposite from Figure 5D, where PBP1a has the strongest signal!), kinetics are fast (so many points and replicates are needed) and this seems to be the only replicate for measuring rates. It is also unclear how fits are done for Kobs (what type of nonlinear regression?), but they are definitely bad for ph5 (it seems as if a linear fit is shown). Besides more replicates with more points in the Bocillin assay, an in-vitro PBP1a assay may allow to see better kinetics and would strengthen any argument. Please keep in mind that pH7 that experiments are done for Figure 5E are not alkaline but neutral…</p><p>Overall, I find little evidence that PBP1a-LpoA takes over in alkaline conditions (as implied in text and Figure 7). Even if all effects are validated, at best it means that PBP1a/LpoA have a role under these conditions, but PBP1b/LpoB can compensate to a large degree.</p></disp-quote><p>While we acknowledge that the growth defect for the PBP1a-defective strain in neutral/alkaline media is modest in comparison to the complete loss of growth of the PBP1b-defective strain at pH 4.8, we stand by our assertion that PBP1a is required for maximal fitness in this pH range.</p><p>At least part of this reviewer’s concern seems to stem from misinterpretation of the data extrapolated from the figures. For example, although the reviewer claims there is a discrepancy between Figures 1A and 2A in terms of which pH PBP1a-deficient cells have the greatest maximal growth defect, in both of these figures, PBP1a-deficient cells have a greater growth defect at pH 8.2 than 6.9. To avoid confusion, we have added a table denoting the mean growth rate +/- SD for each mutant tested in our original screen (Supplementary file 3), as well as panels in Figure 2 and Figure 1—figure supplement 2 depicting the% WT growth (DPH for mutant/DPH of wild-type x 100). We hope that this representation of the data allows for more accurate comparisons among the mutants and pH conditions. We have also updated our figure legends to reflect the n value for each experiment. Figure 2A-C, for example, has an n = 6 for each strain (3 replicates were presented in the original draft of the manuscript, but the n was increased to 6 in response to this reviewer’s concern in point #1). Our findings in these experiments reveal a reproducible and significant defect for PBP1a from pH 6.9-8.2.</p><p>In this revision, we also repeated the pH sensitivity testing of the <italic>lpo</italic> mutants at an extended pH range. Cells defective for LpoA display a comparable range and magnitude of growth defect compared to PBP1a defective cells. (updated Figure 2C; Figure 2—figure supplement 2). These data provide additional support for a specific role for PBP1a in these conditions.</p><p>In response to the reviewer’s concern that the transient lytic phenotype for the mutant defective for PBP1a could not underlie the bulk culture growth defect, we examined lysis kinetics in liquid culture to more closely mimic the conditions of our initial screen. Briefly, cells were cultured to mid-exponential phase in pH 6.9 media, back-diluted to an OD600 of 0.005 at pH 8.2 and sampled at various time points for propidium iodine (PI) staining via fluorescence microscopy. As shown in Figure 3—figure supplement 1D, up to 10% of the cells lysed up to 3 hours post-alkaline shock with no observable recovery. Although we hoped to extend the experiment beyond 3 hours, at cell densities with OD600 values &gt; 1, the buffering capacity of the media was overwhelmed, and the media began to decrease in pH. In light of this finding, we speculate that the recovery phenotype observed on the agarose pad may reflect a decrease in local pH upon increasing cell density, protecting the cells against further lysis. In tandem, we measured single cell elongation rate for each of the mutants and parental strain from our time lapse videos at pH 4.5 and 8.0 in SuperSegger, a MATLAB based cell segmentation program. As shown in Figure 3A-B, no differences in elongation rate were observed between the strains at each pH, implicating lysis as the sole source of the bulk culture growth defect.</p><p>The reviewer has valid concerns about the Bocillin assays; our signal is low and inconsistent (likely in part due to a technical limitation in using an LED-based imager instead of a fluorescence scanner with higher sensitivity, as is typical for these experiments), and these assays fail to differentiate between intrinsic and extrinsic effects on enzyme activity. In consideration of this, we have removed them from the manuscript and instead replaced them with in vitroassays of biochemical activity conducted in collaboration with Waldemar Vollmer’s group, as suggested by reviewer 1. Briefly, we find that PBP1a has negligible glycosyltransferase and transpeptidase activity at pH 4.8, which causes the cell to be reliant on PBP1b activity in this pH range (Figure 5D, E; Figure 5—figure supplement 3; Figure 5—figure supplement 4). Although we do not observe any differences in PBP1b activity that account for the preference for PBP1a in more alkaline conditions, these phenotypes may be too subtle to capture in these assays, or alternatively, differences in the aPBP’s subcellular localization and/or interactions partners may also contribute to their pH specialization. Future work will be necessary to evaluate these possibilities.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Increased resistance to a sub-class of β-lactams at low pH is due to increased PBP1B activity. Although this could very well be (effect gone in mrcB mutant and controls in Figure 6—figure supplement 3C and d provide strong evidence), everything could be also explained with some of these drugs having decreased entry at low pH. Note that β-lactams have differential uptake and efflux preferences – Aztreonam for example needs OmpF to enter cell (see PMID – 29980614). Less drug in the cell could explain also why cells treated with Cephalexin or Mecillinam need more drug to change their morphology at pH5, although presumably the targets of the drugs, PBP3 and PBP2 do not change levels.</p><p>Measuring drug intracellular concentrations would be required to exclude such a scenario. Or alternatively some of the experiments in point 4 could strengthen the PBP1B increased activity in complexes. Also including more non-specific/broad β-lactams would (Carbenicillin, Amoxicillin) would help towards this direction. Note that Imipinem is not a selective PBP2 inhibitor- it targets many PBPs in addition to LD-transpeptidases.</p></disp-quote><p>These β-lactams act on their targets in periplasmic space, not in the cytoplasm. We assume the reviewer meant to ask us to measure periplasmic concentration of the compounds. To our knowledge, there is no direct method to measure this, and to design one would require significant innovation beyond the scope of the current study.</p><p>We have added additional data to the revision to support our conclusion that changes in outer membrane permeability are unlikely to underlie the low pH-dependent resistance phenotype.</p><p>A) Additional compounds we have tested and included in this revision match our previously observed results. At the suggestion of the reviewer, we added an additional broad-spectrum antibiotic (amoxicillin) and two additional PBP2 inhibitors (meropenem and doripenem). As expected, MG1655 exhibited reduced susceptibility to the PBP2 inhibitors at pH values &lt; 6.0. In contrast, the MIC to amoxicillin was only mildly elevated (2-fold) at pH values &lt; 5.0. (compared to &gt;8-fold for the majority of PBP2/PBP3-specific compounds). Importantly, while meropenem and doripenem do target the L,D-transpeptidases (similar to imipenem, as the reviewer noted), cells that lack three or six L,D-transpeptidases still exhibited a comparable increase in the drugs at pH 5.0 (Figure 6—figure supplement 4E), indicating that these enzymes do not play a role in this phenotype. As an aside, we have removed imipenem from the study because we found it to be unstable at pH 4.5.</p><p>B) As a separate means of addressing the contribution of OM permeability to our phenotype, we treated cells with sub-inhibitory concentrations of polymyxin B, a compound which forms pores in the outer membrane. We reasoned that this treatment would non-specifically compromise outer membrane integrity in cells independent of pH. Thus, if our pH-dependent changes in MIC were due to differences in outer membrane integrity, there would be no difference in CEX MIC at pH 7 and pH 5.0. Instead, we observed the same fold-change in MIC as cells not treated with polymyxin B. Importantly, the concentrations of Polymixin B used in these assays decrease the cells’ CEX MIC at both pH values, indicating comparable outer membrane disruption (Figure 6—figure supplement 3C). This data offers strong evidence that low pH dependent resistance cannot be explained solely by changes in outer membrane permeability.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) The authors propose 3 models to rationalize how PBP1b increased activity at low pH could make cells more resistance to PBP2/3 inhibitors. They favor the one which PBP1b replaces PBP2 and PBP3 in the elongasome and divisome (as increased repair could for example not explain the need for increased Cephalexin to see filamentation at low pH). This scenario has some straightforward ramifications that are rather easy to test: PBP2/3 should be less active at low pH (Bocillin assay), PBP1b/2/3 dynamics may differ at low pH, cells should tolerate more depletion of PBP2/PBP3 at low pH. Also it could be interesting to test if Salmonella shows the same higher resistance at low pH (in PBP1b-dependent manner) when PBP3Sal is knocked out but not when there (because PBP3Sal is still as sensitive to PBP3 inhibitors).</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer that this is a very interesting question and appreciate their suggestions on ways in which we can test this model in future studies. However, we believe rigorously addressing this model necessitates a thorough investigation into the effect of pH on the composition and the activity of both the elongation and division machinery, which is beyond the scope of the current manuscript. Consequently, we have significantly revised the Discussion to decrease the emphasis on this point.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) Quantification and statistics suffer throughout the paper. Replicates are not always there (Figure 2A, Figure 5E) and many times too little for the statistics authors want to do: standard deviation from 2 replicates (5C, 6D), t-tests from sets of 3 experiments (Figure 1). Microscopy is not always quantified (Figure 5A, 6B/C), and the most worrisome is that panels do not always agree (Figure 1-2, or Figure 5D and 5E). All this should be amended for the conclusions to be on solid ground.</p></disp-quote><p>As the reviewer suggested, we have re-evaluated our statistical test choice (Figure 1; Figure 2D), added additional replicates (Figure 2A-C; Figure 5C; Figure 6D), and quantified our microscopy (Figure 5A, B; Figure 6B, C).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Minor Comments:</p><p>1) Introduction, second paragraph: the reason for the high sensitivity of the periplasm is not the different permeability of the two membranes; please rephrase.</p></disp-quote><p>It is a widely held belief that differential membrane permeability contributes to pH and osmotic sensitivity of the periplasm. The outer membrane contains porins, including OmpC and OmpF, that are permissive to ions, protons and water; these porins are not present in the inner membrane, and thus the inner membrane is often considered the major permeability barrier for Gram negative bacteria. If the reviewer can point us to references that refute this point or elaborate on why they took issue with this statement, we are happy to revise accordingly.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Introduction, second paragraph: careful, there is a homeostatic control system: HdeA and HdeB are periplasmic chaperones induced and required during acidic conditions; quite some things known about their function.

While it would be interesting to investigate pH-specialized cell wall enzymes in UPEC, selecting a representative strain to conduct this analysis would be challenging for several reasons. In particular, UPEC strains exhibit remarkable genetic diversity and lack a conversed genetic signature for urovirulence (Schreiber IV et al., 2017).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7) Subsection “aPBP activity ensures fitness across a wide pH range”, first paragraph: effect is not dramatic for mrcA.</p></disp-quote><p>The word ‘dramatic’ has been removed.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>8) Subsection “aPBP activity ensures fitness across a wide pH range”, second paragraph: how is p-val calculated with no replicates here?</p></disp-quote><p>As addressed above, n = 3 for this experiment.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>9) Subsection “aPBP activity ensures fitness across a wide pH range”, second paragraph (Figure 2—figure supplement 1); could be informative to test pbpC double mutants with mrcA and mrcB to check if the effect of PBP1c is masked by any of the other two.</p></disp-quote><p>As suggested, we constructed these mutants and tested for pH-dependent growth rate defects from pH 4.8-8.4.
