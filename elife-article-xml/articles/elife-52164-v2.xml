A single structural class of voltage sensor domain exists, but two different modes of voltage sensor attachment to the pore occur in nature: domain-swapped and non-domain-swapped. Since the more thoroughly studied Kv1-7, Nav and Cav channels have domain-swapped voltage sensors, much less is known about non-domain-swapped voltage-gated ion channels. In this paper, using cryo-EM, we show that KvAP from <italic>Aeropyrum pernix</italic> has non-domain-swapped voltage sensors as well as other unusual features. The new structure, together with previous functional data, suggests that KvAP and the Shaker channel, to which KvAP is most often compared, probably undergo rather different voltage-dependent conformational changes when they open.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>KvAP</kwd><kwd>voltage sensor domain</kwd><kwd>non-domain-swapped</kwd><kwd>domain-swapped</kwd><kwd>cryo-EM</kwd><kwd>VSD</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>E. coli</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000011</institution-id><institution>Howard Hughes Medical Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Tao</surname><given-names>Xiao</given-names></name><name><surname>MacKinnon</surname><given-names>Roderick</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>GM43949</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Tao</surname><given-names>Xiao</given-names></name><name><surname>MacKinnon</surname><given-names>Roderick</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The structure of KvAP addresses a mechanism of voltage-dependent gating that has been debated for 16 years.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Voltage sensors are integral membrane proteins that ‘sense’ transmembrane voltage differences.

Sensor conformational changes are imparted onto the channel or enzyme to regulate activity.</p><p>Atomic structures of several different eukaryotic voltage-gated K<sup>+</sup> (Kv) channels demonstrate that nature employs two topologically distinct connections between the voltage sensors and the ion channel pore (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Long et al., 2005a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Whicher and MacKinnon, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Sun and MacKinnon, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Tao et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Wang and MacKinnon, 2017</xref>). Viewed down an axis perpendicular to the membrane, Kv channels are four-fold symmetric, exhibiting one central pore surrounded by four voltage sensors. Each subunit encodes a voltage sensor from transmembrane helices S1-S4 and one fourth of the pore from S5 and S6. The channel tetramer is held together by a ‘barrel stave’ assemblage of the pore, with the voltage sensors residing on the periphery (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Long et al., 2005a</xref>). The topological distinction between two classes of Kv channels relates to whether the voltage sensors are ‘domain-swapped’ or not. If four K<sup>+</sup> channel subunits are designated A, B, C and D, to be domain-swapped means the voltage sensor of subunit A leans against the pore-forming helices of subunit B, B against C and so on around the tetramer, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>. In non-domain-swapped Kv channels, the voltage sensor of subunit A leans against the pore-forming helices of subunit A, B against B, etc., as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>. Kv1-7 channels have domain-swapped voltage sensors; Kv10-12 and Slo1 channels have non-domain-swapped voltage sensors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Long et al., 2005a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Whicher and MacKinnon, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Sun and MacKinnon, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Tao et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Wang and MacKinnon, 2017</xref>). Other voltage-gated channels can also be characterized according to this classification: voltage-gated Na<sup>+</sup> (Nav) and Ca<sup>2+</sup> (Cav) channels and other cation channels have domain-swapped voltage sensors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Payandeh et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Zhang et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Guo et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Wu et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Shen et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Yan et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">She et al., 2018</xref>); HCN channels, which are hyperpolarization-activated cation channels, have non-domain-swapped voltage sensors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Lee and MacKinnon, 2017</xref>).</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Two distinct topological connections between the voltage sensors and the ion channel pore exemplified by Kv1.2–2.1 paddle chimera (PDB: 2R9R) (<bold>A, C</bold>) and eag1 (Kv10) (PDB: 5K7L) (<bold>B, D</bold>) channel, viewed along the 4-fold axis from the extracellular side (<bold>A, B</bold>) or parallel to the membrane with the extracellular side up (<bold>C, D</bold>).</title><p>The channels are shown as ribbons and each subunit of a tetramer is colored uniquely.

In the former case, the voltage sensor is connected to the pore by an ~20 Å long S4-S5 linker helix, which runs along the channel’s cytoplasmic surface and contacts the S6 helix, which forms the gate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Long et al., 2005a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Long et al., 2007</xref>).

Channels with non-domain-swapped voltage sensors do not have a helical S4-S5 linker and the mechanism of gate control is unknown (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>).</p><p>KvAP is a Kv channel from the thermophilic archaea <italic>Aeropyrum pernix</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Ruta et al., 2003</xref>). It provided the first atomic structures from a voltage-gated ion channel and the isolated voltage sensor structure turned out to be the prototype for this domain family (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Jiang et al., 2003a</xref>). Crystallographic analysis of the full-length KvAP channel, however, consistently yielded structures with voltage sensors that were rotated relative to the pore and partially unfolded (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Jiang et al., 2003a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Lee et al., 2005</xref>). Together with voltage-dependent accessibility measurements, the KvAP structures led us to propose the ‘paddle model’, in which S4 moves adjacent to the lipid membrane as part of a helix-turn-helix structure consisting of helices S3b and S4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Jiang et al., 2003b</xref>).</p><p>Until recently, all voltage-gated channels were thought to be of the domain-swapped variety (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Whicher and MacKinnon, 2016</xref>). For this reason, KvAP was considered representative of the more extensively studied Shaker-like (i.e. Kv1) channels, with domain-swapped voltage sensors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Long et al., 2005a</xref>). We show here with a cryo-EM structure that this is not the case. In addition to being a non-domain-swapped Kv channel, KvAP has other structural features that distinguish it further from Shaker and most other voltage-gated ion channels. Structural differences between KvAP and Shaker may account for some discrepant results in the study of their voltage sensor conformational changes.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Image analysis and map calculation</title><p>KvAP was expressed in <italic>E. coli</italic>, extracted in a mixture of lauryl maltose neopentyl glycol (LMNG) and cholesteryl hemisuccinate (CHS), exchanged into digitonin and then purified as a complex with Fab fragments using size exclusion chromatography (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). The Fab fragments, which bind to KvAP’s voltage sensors, were used to assist the alignment of channels in image processing. Following 2D classification, 734,850 particles were 3D-classified in Relion3 with C1 symmetry (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Scheres, 2012</xref>). All classes showed that the voltage sensors were oriented with Fabs projecting towards the extracellular face of the channel. This orientation is compatible with the extracellular accessibility of these Fabs in electrophysiological studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Jiang et al., 2003b</xref>). The extracellular orientation of Fabs in cryo-EM images contrasts with the non-native orientation of KvAP voltage sensors in crystal structures of the full-length channel, in which detergents more dispersive than digitonin were used (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Jiang et al., 2003a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Lee et al., 2005</xref>).</p><p>While the Fabs were on the extracellular surface in all 3D classes, the precise positioning of the Fabs was variable, as shown (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2B</xref>). The positional variability explains why in both 2D (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3A,B</xref>) and 3D classes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3C</xref>), density for the four Fabs is not constant: in some classes only a single Fab is well aligned, in others 2, 3, or least frequently 4 Fabs are aligned. The variation in Fab orientation is consistent with past studies showing the high degree of mobility of the S3b-S4 paddle region of the voltage sensor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Ruta et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Butterwick and MacKinnon, 2010</xref>). To increase resolution of the structure we selected one class, representing 13% of the particles, in which all four Fabs were oriented most similarly with respect to each other. We emphasize that these particles were not fundamentally different than the others, but statistically they happened to have more similarly-oriented Fabs, thus permitting better particle averaging. To analyze the pore and voltage sensors in greater detail, we further applied focused 3D classification in Relion3 while masking the KvAP transmembrane region and Fabs and also applying C4 symmetry (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2B</xref>). The final density map, calculated to 6 Å resolution, showed continuous density for the transmembrane region, density for the Fabs on the extracellular side and a poorly resolved cytoplasmic domain (CTD) on the intracellular side (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s4">Figure 2—figure supplement 4</xref>).

We note that this model is similar to a second structure that we determined independently using NMR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Butterwick and MacKinnon, 2010</xref>).

Small rigid body adjustments of helical segments were made, followed by a round of real-space refinement. The only new model rebuilding at the level of individual amino acids involved four amino acids inside the continuous density connecting S4 to S5. Without the crystal structures it would have been impossible to build more than a poly-alanine model at 6 Å resolution. However, the crystal structures, which were determined at 1.9 Å for the voltage sensor and 3.2 Å for the pore, conform so well to the experimental map (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>) that we know the approximate location of the amino acids in the final model.</p><p>An important first conclusion is that KvAP is a non-domain-swapped voltage-gated ion channel, meaning each voltage sensor is contiguous with the pore element from the same polypeptide chain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>). That this must be the case is evident in the short turn connecting S4 to S5 instead of a long α-helical S4-S5 linker (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). Therefore, KvAP is topologically like Kv10-12 channels and unlike Kv1-7 channels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">2E</xref>).</p><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref> highlights a notable structural difference between KvAP and eag1 (Kv10) even though they both share a non-domain-swapped topology. Viewed from the extracellular side, their voltage sensors orient differently with respect to the pore, as shown (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). The unique orientations result from the manner in which the S1 from the voltage sensor and S5 from the pore interact with each other. In eag1, S1 contacts S5 near the extracellular surface, but is displaced about 15 Å away from S5 near the intracellular surface (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). In contrast, S1 in KvAP runs parallel to and in contact with S5 throughout its length inside the membrane (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). Perozo and co-workers analyzed amino acid side-chain accessibility and mobility in membrane-embedded KvAP channels using EPR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Cuello et al., 2004</xref>). Their data, which we have mapped onto the structure of KvAP, support the S1-S5 contact observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). Specifically, a continuous surface of low side-chain mobility and low O<sub>2</sub> collision frequency, which are both signatures of a buried protein surface, is observed where S1 contacts S5 in the cryo-EM structure. Altogether, the cryo-EM structure is consistent with the EPR data.

We had assumed incorrectly that KvAP and Kv1 were similar in structure, but they are not (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Lee et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Ruta et al., 2005</xref>). Through studies of domain-swapped Kv, Nav, Cav and other voltage-gated ion channels we are starting to understand certain aspects of how they work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Long et al., 2005b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Long et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Tao et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Guo et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Shen et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Wisedchaisri et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Xu et al., 2019</xref>). We have also seen that even among channels with domain-swapped voltage sensors, the S4 helix apparently moves to different extents to regulate the pore (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Guo et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Shen et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Wisedchaisri et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Xu et al., 2019</xref>). Channels with non-domain-swapped voltage sensors, because they do not have an S4-S5 linker helix, might undergo conformational changes that are not only different in magnitude, but also in character. Obviously, that KvAP has non-domain-swapped voltage sensors is important to the interpretation of functional data, especially those addressing voltage sensor conformational changes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Cuello et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Ruta et al., 2005</xref>).</p><p>KvAP is an outlier among voltage-gated ion channels, whether domain-swapped or not, in two respects. First, the distribution of positive-charged amino acids on S4 is unique. In other Kv channels the region of S4 that contains gating charge residues – the active region – consists of the strict triplet (RXX)<sub>n</sub>, where R (arginine) is sometimes replaced by K (lysine) and X stands for a hydrophobic amino acid. More rarely R is replaced by a non-charged polar amino acid, but when this occurs the triplet periodicity almost always persists so that the occurrence of subsequent arginine residues remains in-phase in the sequence. But consider the S4 sequence in KvAP: (RLV)(RLL)(RFL)(RIL)(LII)(SRG)(SKF). Here, we observe a discontinuity between the fourth and fifth arginine residues created by six consecutive uncharged amino acids; this produces a phase shift of the fifth and sixth (lysine) with respect to the first four. The fifth R as well as the following lysine in the sequence are certainly part of the active region of S4, because in the structure the lysine resides inside the gating charge transfer center (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>), which is the site at the center of the voltage sensor that lowers the energy barrier for charged amino acids as they cross the membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Tao et al., 2010</xref>). In other voltage-gated ion channels, S4 adopts a 3<sub>10</sub> helix at the center of the membrane; this secondary structure directs the arginine residues towards the gating charge transfer center. The α to a 3<sub>10</sub> transition may well occur when the region of S4 containing the first four arginine residues approaches the center of the membrane (because they are distributed with triplet periodicity), but it might not occur in the gap between the fourth and fifth arginine residues. Because triplet periodicity is not maintained over the lower half of S4 in KvAP, it is not entirely clear whether properties learned from other Kv channels apply to KvAP.</p><p>The second respect in which KvAP is an outlier concerns the gating charge transfer center. KvAP has the typical constellation of negative-charged amino acids to stabilize the positive charge on arginine or lysine. But instead of the phenylalanine found in other Kv channels (357 out of 360 examined), KvAP contains a leucine. The functional significance of this is also unknown.</p><p>Our original expectation that KvAP and Shaker-like Kv channels probably undergo similar voltage sensor conformational changes may be incorrect. The present study shows that the voltage sensors in KvAP, in contrast to Shaker, are not domain-swapped. In separate studies in our lab, we have captured the HCN channel, another non-domain-swapped voltage-gated channel, in both depolarized and hyperpolarized conformations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Lee and MacKinnon, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Lee and MacKinnon, 2019</xref>). When depolarized, the voltage sensor in HCN is similar to that in KvAP. But when hyperpolarized, the S4 helix translates toward the cytoplasm and breaks into an L-shape, with the bottom half of S4 forming an interfacial helix. Thus, the voltage sensor in HCN couples to the gate in a fundamentally different manner than in domain-swapped voltage-gated channels studied so far, where the S4-S5 linker forms a permanent interfacial helix (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). Whether the allosteric communication between the voltage sensor and pore in KvAP will be similar to that observed in HCN remains to be seen.</p></sec><sec id="s4"

Rotational and translational parameters of particles from two major classes (~67 k particles) of the focused 3D classification were used as the input for further focused refinement masking around the KvAP transmembrane region and Fabs in FrealignX, during which the resolution of the reference map used for alignment was limited to 8 Å (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Lyumkis et al., 2013</xref>). The final map achieved a resolution of ~5.9 Å as assessed by Fourier shell correlation using the 0.143 cut-off criterion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>) and was sharpened using an isotropic b-factor of −500 Å<sup>2</sup>. Symmetry expansion of the above 67 k particles in Relion followed by local refinement in cryoSPARC slightly improved the map quality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Scheres, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Punjani et al., 2017</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Model building and refinement</title><p>For model generation, the crystal structure of the isolated voltage sensor (PDB: 1QRS) and a model of the pore from the crystal structure of the full-length KvAP channel (PDB: 1ORQ) were placed into the density. Small rigid body adjustments of helical segments were made, followed by a round of real-space refinement in Phenix (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Afonine et al., 2018</xref>). The only new model rebuilding at the level of individual amino acids involved four amino acids inside the continuous density connecting S4 to S5.

cryo-EM structure of KvAP channel in complex with the Fab fragment of a monoclonal antibody. Despite of low resolution around 6 Å, the previously determined high resolution crystal structure of the isolated VSD of KvAP and the pore region of the full-length KvAP structure conform well with the EM map, allowing them to build an accurate model into the density. The structure reveal some unexpected features that distinguish KvAP from most other canonical Kv channels: (1) the channel adopts a non-domain-swapped topology; (2) S4 does not appear to form a 310 helix and has a distinct arrangement of voltage-sensing arginine residues; (3) KvAP contains a Leu instead of a Phe at its gating charge transfer center; (4) the relative position between VSD and pore in KvAP is different from that in both domain-swapped and non-domain-swapped Kv channels; (5) S1 and S5 form extensive contact in KvAP, which is not observed in other Kv channels. These distinct features suggest that KvAP is an outlier among voltage-gated ion channels and its structural mechanism of voltage gating is likely different from that of most canonical voltage-gated K<sup>+</sup> channels. KvAP was the channel for which the first structures were solved and thus has been widely used as a model protein for studying voltage gating, the findings of this study become particularly important and may provide explanations for some discrepant results in the studies of voltage-dependent conformational changes. Overall, this is a straightforward and informative study that will valuable for understanding the fundamental mechanisms by which voltage-activated ion channels open and close in response to changes in membrane voltage.

However, KvAP appeared to be distorted in the full-length crystal structure and despite extensive structural and functional studies, the native structure of KvAP is unknown. In this work, the authors have used modern single-particle cryo-EM techniques to obtain a seemingly native-state structure of KvAP in which the voltage-sensing domain (VSD) and pore domain of each KvAP sub-unit are in direct contact, unlike canonical voltage-gated potassium channels (Kv1-9) in which each VSD nestles against the pore domain of the neighboring sub-unit.</p><p>This is an important result, and the article is exceptionally clear and well written. However, there are a few aspects of the study that could benefit from further discussion.</p><p>1) Effect of Resolution on Model:</p><p>The authors have clearly accounted for the EM map resolution (~6 Å) during modelling, but it would help a general reader to present whatever cross-checks the authors performed. For example, did the authors manually assess map uncertainties by plotting different sigma level surfaces, or use a more automated approach (e.g. Beckers, M., Jakobi, A.J., and Sachse, C. (2019). Thresholding of cryo-EM density maps by false discovery rate control. IUCrJ 6, 18-33.). Is the direct S4-S5 linker clearly visible in the raw unmasked ~8 Å map of Class I, or only after masking and symmetry expansion steps? What is the worst resolution at which the EM map could exclude a domain-swapped linker &quot;smeared out&quot; by C4 averaging of multiple conformations, especially if the inner gate were to be in a mixture of open and inactivated states (subsection “Conformational State”)? Does the direct linker density still jump out even if one incorrectly uses a domain-swapped KvAP model (e.g. Figure 6, Lee et al., 2005) for masking and refinement?</p><p>2) Effects of Detergent and Antibodies on Conformation:</p><p>The MacKinnon lab has previously shown that the conformation of voltage sensing proteins, and KvAP in particular, can be very sensitive to the composition of the lipid membrane. In addition, although Jiang et al. (2003) elegantly showed that binding of the 6E1 antibody drives the channel into a non-conducting state this may not be the physiological inactivated state. In this KvAP structure the VSD domain seems to be displaced towards the extra-cellular side of the membrane (relative to the pore domain) whether one looks at the position of aromatic residues in the TM helices or PEG-Biotin accessibility. It may seem crazy to think lipid composition or antibody-protein interactions could switch a 6-TM channel between direct and domain-swapped configurations, but the Sobolevsky lab observed exactly such a transition for TRPV6 following a single point mutation in the S4-S5 linker (Singh, A.K., Saotome, K., and Sobolevsky, A.I. (2017). Swapping Of Transmembrane Domains In The Epithelial Calcium Channel TRPV6. BioRxiv 141523.) Thus, it would be helpful for the authors to discuss whether the conditions used to obtain the structure could influence the domain organization.</p><p>3) Consistency of Structure with Published Cysteine Cross-Linking Data:</p><p>The MacKinnon lab has previously reported that KvAP can tetramerize through introduced cysteine residues into the VSD and pore (S4 117C / S5 169C; Figure 5D, Lee et al., 2005; S1 T47C / PD V183C; Lee et al., 2009, PLoS Biol 7, e1000047.) These residue pairs were quite close in KvAP domain-swapped homology models, but are quite distant in this direct KvAP structure. A membrane-based assay to excluded a domain swapped architecture would be especially valuable to check that these cross-links are indeed non-specific.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>In this study, Tao and MacKinnon determine the cryo-EM structure of KvAP channel in complex with the Fab fragment of a monoclonal antibody. Despite of low resolution around 6 Å, the previously determined high resolution crystal structure of the isolated VSD of KvAP and the pore region of the full-length KvAP structure conform well with the EM map, allowing them to build a pretty accurately model into the density. The structure reveal some unexpected features that distinguish KvAP from most other canonical Kv channels: (1) the channel adopts a non-domain-swapped topology; (2) S4 does not appear to form a 310 helix and has a distinct arrangement of voltage-sensing arginine residues; (3) KvAP contains a Leu instead of a Phe at its gating charge transfer center; (4) the relative position between VSD and pore in KvAP is different from that in both domain-swapped and non-domain-swapped Kv channels; (5) S1 and S5 form extensive contact in KvAP, which is not observed in other Kv channels. These distinct features suggest that KvAP is an outlier among voltage-gated ion channels and its structural mechanism of voltage gating is likely different from that of most canonical voltage-gated K<sup>+</sup> channels. As KvAP has been widely used as a model protein for studying voltage gating, the findings of this study become particularly important and may provide explanations for some discrepant results in the studies of voltage-dependent conformational changes. In short, this is a simple but informative study that will bring some clarifications to the channel field.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic></p><p>This is an important study that answers questions that surrounded the first X-ray structure of a voltage-gated channel, namely this one. It is particularly satisfying to see the mapping of accessibility and EPR experiments on the new structure.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.52164.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1:</p><p>[…]</p><p>1) Effect of Resolution on Model:</p><p>The authors have clearly accounted for the EM map resolution (~6 Å) during modelling, but it would help a general reader to present whatever cross-checks the authors performed.

The non-domain-swapped S4-S5 linker is clearly visible in the raw unmasked ~8 Å map of Class I. A new supplementary figure (Figure 2—figure supplement 5) is now added to demonstrate this fact.</p><p>In cryo-EM image analysis, as it was carried out here, information from an atomic model never enters into the map calculation (unlike model-guided phase refinement in X-ray crystallographic map calculation). Thus, neither a correct nor incorrect model is used to modify phases. The maps we show are experimental. We showed the maps for the entire molecule in stereo to answer the questions this reviewer raises. There is no doubt about the connectivity of the non-helical S4-S5 linker and about the absence of a helical, domain-swapping S4-S5 linker. Furthermore, we show in stereo the unmodified models of the pore and voltage sensor from crystal structures to emphasize how well the map conforms to them.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Effects of Detergent and Antibodies on Conformation:</p><p>The MacKinnon lab has previously shown that the conformation of voltage sensing proteins, and KvAP in particular, can be very sensitive to the composition of the lipid membrane.

Thus, it would be helpful for the authors to discuss whether the conditions used to obtain the structure could influence the domain organization.</p></disp-quote><p>We cannot conclude with certainty what the functional state of this channel is. In fact, no one can ever do that with a structure. Based on comparison to other voltage sensors and to the biotin-avidin accessibility data on KvAP, recapitulated in the paper, we conclude the voltage sensors are depolarized. As we stated, the pore could be activated, inactivated (as we would expect based on electrophysiological studies) or some combination of these states.</p><p>We do not think that the voltage sensor is displaced towards the extracellular side abnormally. Please note Figure 5A. Also note that voltage sensor Fabs capture the top of the paddle only upon depolarization, and they associate very rapidly, implying the epitope becomes exposed to solution without hindrance by the membrane (Jiang et al. 2003). We think the structure is in good agreement with these observations. Also, the cryo-EM structure is consistent with independent EPR studies of KvAP in lipid vesicles, shown in the paper.</p><p>We think that the interchangeable topologies in mutant TRPV6 channels of a single species is a singular observation and very confusing and the physiological significance unclear. Time will tell what those findings mean. Since such behavior has never been seen anywhere else I do not think our paper is the place to discuss it.</p><p>Prior to knowing the existence of Kv channels with non-domain-swapped voltage sensor topology, we modelled KvAP as having a domain-swapped voltage sensor (Lee et al., 2005). This was difficult because it seemed there were not enough amino acids to make S4 and an S4-S5 linker helix. Consequently, S4 had to be very short and the tip of the voltage sensor paddle had to be embedded in the membrane. From the present work we now understand the problem. KvAP has a non-domain-swapped topology. The structure we present here is the first hard evidence for the real topology (i.e. we finally see it).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Consistency of Structure with Published Cysteine Cross-Linking Data:</p><p>The MacKinnon lab has previously reported that KvAP can tetramerize through introduced cysteine residues into the VSD and pore (S4 117C / S5 169C; Figure 5D, Lee et al., 2005; S1 T47C / PD V183C; Lee et al., 2009, PLoS Biol 7, e1000047.)

It is worth pointing out that in our non-domain-swapped cryo-EM model, the Cα-Cα distance between residue 117 (S4) and 169 (S5) on the same subunit is ~35 Å, whereas distance between 117 and 169 on neighboring subunits is ~42 Å. For the other pair, i.e. residue 47(S1) and 183 (pore), the Cα-Cα distance on the same subunit (20.5 Å) and neighboring subunits (21.1 Å). For both cysteine pairs in both models the distances are too far. Neither model is consistent with these disulfide bridges. Unfortunately, when given enough time, as was the case in the Lee et al. studies, disulfide bridges can occur between cysteine residues that are very far apart in protein structures (Careaga and Falke, 1992). Trapping of distant cysteines is a common occurrence unless the kinetics of bridge formation is monitored and shown to be rapid. We now have a much better data set – a structure that explains that KvAP has non-domain-swapped voltage sensors.</p></body></sub-article></article>
