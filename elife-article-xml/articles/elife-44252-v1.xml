How this tightly regulated axonal surface polarity is established and maintained is unclear. To address this question, we used time-resolved imaging to determine the trafficking of CB1R from biosynthesis to mature polarised localisation in cultured rat hippocampal neurons. We show that the secretory pathway delivery of CB1R is axonally biased and that surface expressed CB1R is more stable in axons than in dendrites. This dual mechanism is mediated by the CB1R C-terminus and involves the Helix 9 (<italic>H9</italic>) domain. Removal of the <italic>H9</italic> domain increases secretory pathway delivery to dendrites and decreases surface stability. Furthermore, CB1R<sup>ΔH9</sup> is more sensitive to agonist-induced internalisation and less efficient at downstream signalling than CB1R<sup>WT</sup>. Together, these results shed new light on how polarity of CB1R is mediated and indicate that the C-terminal <italic>H9</italic> domain plays key roles in this process.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.44252.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>The brain contains around 100 billion neurons that are in constant communication with one another. Each consists of a cell body, plus two components specialized for exchanging information. These are the axon, which delivers information, and the dendrites, which receive it. This exchange takes place at contact points between neurons called synapses. To send a message, a neuron releases chemicals called neurotransmitters from its axon terminals into the synapse. The neurotransmitters cross the synapse and bind to receptor proteins on the dendrites of another neuron. In doing so, they pass on the message.</p><p>Cannabinoid type 1 receptors (CB1Rs) help control the flow of information at synapses. They do this by binding neurotransmitters called endocannabinoids, which are unusual among neurotransmitters. Rather than sending messages from axons to dendrites, endocannabinoids send them in the opposite direction. Thus, it is dendrites that release endocannabinoids, which then bind to CB1Rs in axon terminals. This backwards, or 'retrograde', signalling dampens the release of other neurotransmitters. This slows down brain activity, and gives rise to the 'mellow' sensation that recreational cannabis users often describe.</p><p>Like most other proteins, CB1Rs are built inside the cell body. So, how do these receptors end up in the axon terminals where they are needed? Are they initially sent to both axons and dendrites, with the CB1Rs that travel to dendrites being rerouted back to axons? Or do the receptors travel directly to the axon itself? Fletcher-Jones et al. tracked newly made CB1Rs in rat neurons growing in a dish. The results revealed that the receptors go directly to the axon, before moving on to the axon terminals. A specific region of the CB1R protein is crucial for sending the receptors to the axon, and for ensuring that they do not get diverted to the dendrite surface. This region stabilizes CB1Rs at the axon surface, and helps to make the receptors available to bind endocannabinoids.</p><p>CB1Rs also respond to medical marijuana, a topic that continues to generate interest as well as controversy. Activating CB1Rs could help treat a wide range of diseases, such as chronic pain, epilepsy and multiple sclerosis. Future studies should build on our understanding of CB1Rs to explore and optimize new therapeutic approaches.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>cannabinoid receptor type 1</kwd><kwd>receptor trafficking</kwd><kwd>axonal polarity</kwd><kwd>secretory pathway</kwd><kwd>neuronal culture</kwd><kwd>surface expression</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Rat</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100004440</institution-id><institution>Wellcome</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Evans</surname><given-names>Ashley J</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000265</institution-id><institution>Medical Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Wilkinson</surname><given-names>Kevin A</given-names></name><name><surname>Henley</surname><given-names>Jeremy M</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000268</institution-id><institution>Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Wilkinson</surname><given-names>Kevin A</given-names></name><name><surname>Henley</surname><given-names>Jeremy M</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000883</institution-id><institution>University of Bristol</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Fletcher-Jones</surname><given-names>Alexandra</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>An intracellular H9 motif facilitates the highly localised axonal surface expression of CB1R.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>CB1R is one of the most abundant G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) in the CNS and endocannabinoid signalling through CB1R is a neuromodulatory system that influences a wide range of brain functions including pain, appetite, mood, and memory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Soltesz et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Lu and Mackie, 2016</xref>). Furthermore, CB1R function and dysfunction are implicated in multiple neurodegenerative disorders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Basavarajappa et al., 2017</xref>). Thus, modulation of endocannabinoid pathways is of intense interest as a potential therapeutic target (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Reddy, 2017</xref>).</p><p>CB1R is present in both excitatory and inhibitory neurons, and also in astroglia, where it plays important roles in synaptic plasticity and memory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Han et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Robin et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Busquets-Garcia et al., 2018</xref>). In hippocampal neurons, ~80% of CB1R is present in intracellular vesicular clusters in the soma and dendrites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Leterrier et al., 2006</xref>). Strikingly, however, CB1R is not stably surface expressed on somatodendritic plasma membrane. Rather, it has a highly polarised axonal surface expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Irving et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Coutts et al., 2001</xref>) where it acts to attenuate neurotransmitter release (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Katona, 2009</xref>) and modulate synaptic plasticity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Lu and Mackie, 2016</xref>).</p><p>How this near exclusive axonal surface expression of CB1R is established remains the subject of debate. One suggestion is that high rates of endocytosis due to constitutive activity selectively remove CB1Rs from the somatodendritic plasma membrane, resulting in an accumulation at the axonal surface (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Leterrier et al., 2006</xref>). These internalised somatodendritic CB1Rs may then be either sorted for degradation or recycled to axons via a transcytotic sorting pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Simon et al., 2013</xref>). Alternatively, newly synthesized CB1Rs may be constitutively targeted to lysosomes, but under appropriate circumstances the CB1Rs destined for degradation are retrieved and rerouted to axons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Rozenfeld and Devi, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Rozenfeld, 2011</xref>).</p><p>Surprisingly, a direct role for the 73-residue intracellular C-terminal domain of CB1R (ctCB1R) in axonal/somatodendritic trafficking or polarised surface expression has not been identified. It has, however, been reported that motifs within ctCB1R are required for receptor desensitization and internalization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hsieh et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Jin et al., 1999</xref>) (reviewed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Mackie, 2008</xref>). Interestingly, there are two putative amphipathic helical domains in ctCB1R (<italic>H8</italic> and <italic>H9</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Ahn et al., 2009</xref>]). <italic>H8</italic> has been proposed to play a role in ER assembly and/or exit during biosynthesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Ahn et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Stadel et al., 2011</xref>). The role of the 21-residue <italic>H9</italic> motif is unknown, although analogous regions have been reported to act as a G<sub>αq</sub>-binding site in both squid rhodopsin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Murakami and Kouyama, 2008</xref>) and bradykinin receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Piserchio et al., 2005</xref>).</p><p>Here we systematically investigated how axonal surface polarity of CB1R arises by tracking newly-synthesised CB1Rs through the secretory pathway to their surface destination. We demonstrate that a population of CB1R is preferentially targeted to the axon through the biosynthetic pathway. CB1Rs that reach the dendritic membrane are rapidly removed by endocytosis whereas CB1Rs surface expressed on the axonal membrane have a longer residence time. We further show that the putative helical domain <italic>H9</italic> in ctCB1R plays a key role in CB1R surface expression and endocytosis in hippocampal neurons. Taken together our data suggest that CB1R polarity is determined, at least in part, by a novel determinant in the C-terminus of CB1R that contributes to targeted delivery to the axonal compartment and the rapid removal of CB1Rs that reach the somatodendritic membrane.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Preferential delivery of newly synthesized CB1Rs to, and retention at, the axonal membrane establishes surface polarisation</title><p>To investigate how CB1R surface polarity is established we used the retention using selective hooks (RUSH) system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Boncompain et al., 2012</xref>) and antibody feeding techniques to examine its secretory pathway trafficking and surface expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>).

SBP-EGFP-CB1R was surface expressed in the proximal segment of axons 40 min after release from the ER, whereas in dendrites, CB1R was not surface expressed until 60 min after release (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>). Moreover, significantly more SBP-EGFP-CB1R reached the surface of axons than the surface of dendrites 45, 60, and 90 min after release from the ER (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>). These data demonstrate that the secretory pathway delivers a greater amount of CB1R more rapidly to the axonal membrane than to the dendritic membrane.</p></sec><sec id="s2-1-3"><title><italic>De novo</italic> CB1R is retained longer at the surface of axons than of dendrites</title><p>It has been suggested CB1R polarity is maintained by differential rates of endocytosis in the somatodendritic and axonal compartments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Leterrier et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">McDonald et al., 2007a</xref>). To test this, we also stained for surface SBP-EGFP-CB1R and compared the amount of surface expressed SBP-EGFP-CB1R to the amount of surface + endocytosed SBP-EGFP-CB1R in axons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D,F</xref>) and dendrites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D,G</xref>). In the proximal segment of axons, the normalised surface and surface + endocytosed curves were identical, suggesting that most surface expressed SBP-EGFP-CB1R is stable and retained at the axonal membrane (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D,F</xref>). This may be due either to minimal endocytosis or to the efficient recycling of endocytosed receptors. In stark contrast, however, in dendrites there is significantly less surface than surface + endocytosed SBP-EGFP-CB1R 90 min after addition of biotin, indicating that surface expressed CB1R is more rapidly endocytosed from and/or not recycled back to the dendritic membrane (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-1-4"><title>CB1R is trafficked to more distal parts of the axon via intracellular mechanisms</title><p>Analysis of CB1R total fluorescence along the axon indicates that by 30 min after release from the ER, and before CB1R appears on the surface, intracellular CB1R has progressed through the AIS and is already present at least 100 µm along the axon at levels similar to the unretained control (O/N; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2H,I</xref>). These data indicate that CB1R-containing secretory vesicles can rapidly travel to more distal areas of the axon. Furthermore, surface CB1Rs delivered from the secretory pathway accumulate at the final portion of the AIS, before then progressing further along the axon (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2I</xref>). Interestingly, 100 µm along the axon CB1R levels reach a steady state 90 min after release, at levels similar to when receptors are released overnight. However, following overnight release fewer receptors remain in the most proximal region of the axon. These results suggest that additional mechanisms contribute to the delivery of CB1R receptors the distal axon and presynaptic boutons. This process occurs over a time-course of several hours and could involve lateral surface diffusion and trapping analogous to the accumulation of AMPARs at the postsynaptic membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Borgdorff and Choquet, 2002</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-1-5"><title>A two-part model of CB1R polarity</title><p>Our results using RUSH time-resolved analysis show that CB1R surface polarity is initially established and maintained by two distinct but complementary mechanisms. Firstly, we show the novel finding that the secretory pathway preferentially delivers CB1R to the axonal surface, with significantly less going to the dendritic surface. Secondly, by distinguishing between surface and surface + endocytosed receptors, our antibody feeding experiments show that newly delivered CB1R is preferentially retained/stabilised at the axonal membrane and internalised from the dendritic membrane. Previous literature proposes that this differential internalisation is due to the presence of agonist in the dendritic membrane and absence of agonist on axonal membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Leterrier et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Ladarre et al., 2014</xref>), although a potential role for constitutive internalisation distinct to agonist-induced internalisation has also been proposed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">McDonald et al., 2007a</xref>).

Since dendritic and axonal cargo are synthesized in the somatodendritic compartment, selective sorting to the correct domain is crucial. While several sorting signals and adaptors have been described for dendritic cargo, the mechanisms behind selective sorting to axons are less well known (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Lasiecka and Winckler, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bentley and Banker, 2016</xref>). For example, a recent study in <italic>C. elegans</italic> has suggested that sorting of cargos to axons or dendrites depends on binding to different types of clathrin-associated adaptor proteins (AP); axonal cargo bind to AP-3 whereas dendritic cargo bind to AP-1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Li et al., 2016</xref>). Interestingly, AP-3 binding has been associated with CB1R trafficking to the lysosome in the dendritic compartment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Rozenfeld and Devi, 2008</xref>). One possibility is that <italic>H9</italic> may modulate CB1R binding to AP-3, allowing for preferential delivery to axons and sorting to dendritic lysosomes, causing an decrease in dendritic membrane CB1R. More studies are needed to examine the possibility of <italic>H9</italic> influencing AP-3 and CB1R interaction.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Trafficking within the axon</title><p>We used time-resolved RUSH experiments to investigate the initiation of CB1R polarity. We measured the transit through the secretory pathway and incorporation into, and passage through, the highly organised axon initial segment (AIS) that acts as a ‘gate-keeper’ for proteins entering the axonal compartment. Our data show that CB1R polarisation was initiated in the first 90 min since they were directly targeted to, and surface expressed within, proximal axonal regions.</p><p>Immunocytochemistry in brain sections using immunogold electron microscopy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Katona et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Nyíri et al., 2005</xref>) or STORM super-resolution imaging (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Dudok et al., 2015</xref>) detect CB1R predominantly at the presynaptic terminal, consistent with a disto-proximal gradient of expression at the axonal plasma membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Simon et al., 2013</xref>). Therefore, given the highly branched morphology of typical CB1R expressing neurons, correct axonal polarization likely requires specific distal targeting mechanisms in addition to the processes we describe using time-resolved RUSH experiments.</p><p>CB1Rs are highly mobile and diffuse rapidly in the plasma membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Mikasova et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Oddi et al., 2012</xref>), so the accumulation of surface CB1R we observe may be followed by lateral diffusion and ‘capture’ of surface CB1R at presynaptic sites, analogous to the diffusion and retention models proposed for AMPARs and GABA<sub>A</sub>Rs at the postsynaptic membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Hastings and Man, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kneussel and Hausrat, 2016</xref>). Another, non-exclusive possibility is that CB1R-containing vesicles originating from the secretory system and/or endosomal system traffic to distal sites inside the axon (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Lasiecka and Winckler, 2011</xref>). Indeed, it has been reported that CB1R in somatodendritic endosomes can be rerouted and trafficked to distal axonal surfaces (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Simon et al., 2013</xref>). Our observation that intracellular CB1R is present at least 100 µm along the axon before it appears at the surface supports the concept of a rapid and direct trafficking of CB1R-containing secretory vesicles to more distal areas of the axon, although more detailed tracking of these secretory vesicles to presynaptic boutons would be required to confirm this. Overall, we interpret our data to suggest that arrival at, and progression through, the AIS constitutes the initial phase of CB1R axonal polarisation. Once within the axonal compartment trafficking to more distal locations and to presynaptic sites is then mediated by additional mechanisms that probably include both intracellular transport and lateral diffusion and trapping.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title><italic>H9</italic> and membrane retention</title><p>Our data suggest that <italic>H9</italic> stabilises CB1R at the membrane, regardless of compartment.

Consistent with this possibility, ctCB1R interacting proteins regulate CB1R endocytosis. For example, SGIP1, a protein linked to clathrin-mediated endocytosis, binds at an as yet undefined site on ctCB1R downstream of <italic>H8</italic>, preventing internalisation of activated CB1R (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Hájková et al., 2016</xref>). Similarly, cannabinoid receptor interacting protein 1a (CRIP1a), which interacts directly with a motif in the last 9 C-terminal amino acids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Niehaus et al., 2007</xref>), reduces constitutive CB1R internalisation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Mascia et al., 2017</xref>) by competing with β-Arrestin binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Blume et al., 2017</xref>).

Further studies examining the interaction between CB1R<sup>WT</sup>, CB1R<sup>ΔH9</sup>, CRIP1a, β-Arrestin1/2, and SGIP1 are needed to examine the mechanism by which <italic>H9</italic> stabilises surface CB1R.</p><p>Given the increased interest in CB1R as a clinical target, understanding the fundamental cell biology and trafficking behaviour of CB1R is an increasingly active and important area of research. Taken together, our results reveal that the C-terminal domain, and <italic>H9</italic> in particular, play important roles in trafficking of CB1R.

Helix 9 (residues 440–460) was removed by site-directed mutagenesis. These WT and Δ<italic>H9</italic> constructs were subsequently used as a template to clone into the RUSH vector system (interleukin-2 signal peptide followed by SBP and EGFP N-terminal tags) as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Evans et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Boncompain and Perez, 2013</xref>). Non-ER-retained SBP-EGFP-tagged versions were obtained by re-cloning these inserts from the RUSH vector into pcDNA3.1 (pcDNA-SP<sup><sub>Il-2</sub></sup>-SBP-EGFP-CB1R). The SBP tag was deleted for surface biotinylation experiments by site-directed mutagenesis (pcDNA-SP<sup><sub>Il-2</sub></sup>-EGFP-CB1R). Chimeric CD4-ctCB1R WT and Δ<italic>H9</italic> were generated by overlap extension PCR followed by cloning into a plasmid expressing CD4 lacking its own C-terminus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Garrido, 2001</xref>).</p><p>Chicken anti-GFP was from Abcam (ab13970); mouse anti-Ankyrin-G was from NeuroMab (clone N106/36); rabbit anti-MAP2 was from Synaptic Systems (188 003); mouse anti-CD4 was from BioLegend (clone OKT4); rat anti-GFP was from ChromoTek (3H9); anti-phosphoERK (M7802), and anti-non-phosphoERK (M3807) were from Sigma; mouse anti-GAPDH (6C5 ab8245) was from Abcam.

Glass coverslips were coated in poly-D-lysine or poly-L-lysine (1 mg/mL, Sigma) in borate buffer (10 mM borax, 50 mM boric acid) overnight and washed in water. Dissociated hippocampal cells were plated at different densities in plating medium (Neurobasal, Gibco supplemented with 10% horse serum, Sigma; 2 mM GlutaMAX, Gibco; and either GS21, GlobalStem, or B27, Thermo Fisher) which was changed to feeding medium (Neurobasal supplemented with 1.2 mM GlutaMAX and GS21 or B27) after 24 hr. For RUSH experiments, cells were plated and fed in media containing GS21 instead of B27 because it does not contain biotin. Cells were incubated at 37°C and 5% CO<sub>2</sub> for up to 2 weeks. Animal care and procedures were carried out in accordance with UK Home Office and University of Bristol guidelines.</p><p>Transfection of neuronal cultures was carried out at DIV 12 using Lipofectamine2000 (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer’s instructions with minor modifications. Cells were left for 20–48 hr before fixation.</p><p>HEK293T cells (ECACC) were passaged and maintained in complete DMEM (DMEM + 10% FBS + 2 mM L-Glutamine).

The neurons were washed multiple times in PBS before fixation.</p><p>For agonist and inverse agonist experiments, the neurons were treated with 5 μM ACEA (in EtOH) or vehicle control (0.1% EtOH) for 3 hr or 10 μM AM281 (in DMSO) or vehicle control (0.2% DMSO) for 3 hr in conditioned media at 37°C and 5% CO<sub>2</sub>, and then subsequently surface stained.</p><p>To measure endocytosed receptors, neurons were fed with the appropriate antibody (chicken anti-GFP or mouse anti-CD4) for 2 hr in conditioned media at 37°C and 5% CO<sub>2</sub>. Neurons were washed several times in PBS and then surface antibody was stripped by two quick washes with ice-cold pH 2.5 PBS (anti-GFP) or a 4 min incubation with 0.5M NaCl and 0.2M acetic acid (anti-CD4) followed by several washes in PBS before fixation.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>RUSH live labelling</title><p>Neurons were transfected with RUSH constructs at DIV 12 for no longer than 24 hr to prevent ER stress resulting from accumulation of unreleased receptors. Neurons were incubated in conditioned media containing D-biotin (40 μM, Sigma) and chicken anti-GFP (1:1,000) for different lengths of time at 37°C and 5% CO<sub>2</sub>. The 0 min timepoint was only incubated with chicken anti-GFP without biotin for 60 min. For the O/N timepoint, neurons were incubated in 40 μM D-biotin immediately following transfection and then left overnight at 37°C and 5% CO<sub>2</sub> before being incubated with biotin and chicken anti-GFP for 60 min to label surface CB1R. Every independent experiment included a 60 min timepoint to which values were normalised and a 0 min control. Following biotin treatment, neurons were washed several times in PBS and cooled to 4°C to prevent further internalisation. They were then live labelled with 647-labelled anti-chicken in conditioned media for 15 min at 4°C before being fixed and permeabilised and stained with Cy3-labelled anti-chicken. In the text, ‘surface’ thus refers to 647 fluorescence acquisition, whereas ‘surface + endocytosed’ refers to Cy3 fluorescence acquisition.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Fixation and fixed immunostaining</title><p>Cultured neurons were fixed in 4% formaldehyde in PBS for 12 min, then washed 3x in PBS, 1x in 100 mM Glycine in PBS, and 3x in PBS. The neurons were then blocked and permeabilised in PBS + 3% BSA + 0.1% Triton X-100 before being incubated in fluorescent secondary (1:400) in PBS + 3% BSA. Subsequently, the neurons were re-incubated in primary antibody (anti-GFP or anti-CD4) to measure total levels of expression and stained with either anti-MAP2 (dendritic marker) or anti-Ankyrin-G (axonal initial segment marker) in PBS + 3% BSA. The neurons were then washed several times in PBS and mounted onto glass slides using Fluoromount-G (ThermoFisher Scientific).</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>Image acquisition and analysis</title><p>Images were acquired using either a Leica SPE single channel confocal laser scanning microscope or a Leica SP8 AOBS confocal laser scanning microscope (Wolfson Bioimaging Facility, University of Bristol). All settings were kept the same within experiments. Neurons used for data acquisition were selected only on their total staining.</p><p>All quantification was performed using FIJI (ImageJ) software. Based on previous experiments, at least five cells were analysed per experiment, and at least three independent experiments (i.e. on different neuronal cultures on different days) were performed.</p><p>Images were max projected, and regions of interest (ROIs) of approximately similar lengths were drawn around axons and 3–4 proximal and secondary dendrites based on the total channel only. Axons were defined either as processes whose initial segment was positive for Ankyrin-G or as processes negative for MAP2. The mean fluorescence was measured for each channel and the dendritic values were averaged. ‘Surface’ or ‘endocytosed’ mean fluorescence values were normalised to the ‘total’ mean fluorescence value for each ROI to account for varying levels of expression of transfected constructs. These values were then normalised to the axon value of the control (WT or CD4). For drug treatments, surface values were normalised to their respective vehicle treated controls and sampled at the same time-point (i.e. WT + drug was normalised to WT + vehicle and ΔH9 + drug was normalised to ΔH9 + vehicle) to account for possible differences in steady-state surface expression between the constructs and/or constitutive internalisation.</p><p>Because of the change in total mean fluorescence in axons throughout the different conditions, the above image analysis was slightly modified for RUSH experiments. In these experiments, neurites were traced using NeuronJ so that only the mean fluorescence of exactly the first 50 μm of the axons and 30–40 μm of 2–4 primary dendrites for each channel was measured. All ‘surface’ and ‘surface + endocytosed’ values (of both axons and dendrites) were normalised to the average total dendritic value for each neuron. Axon total mean fluorescence was also normalised to the average total dendritic value within each cell. All values were then normalised to the WT 60 min axon value within each experiment. In a slightly smaller subset of RUSHed neurons, axons were traced for ~100 µm using NeuronJ. Line plots were generated and the mean fluorescence was averaged in 10 µm segments. The averages for each 10 µm segment from each cell were normalised first to the dendritic total value, then to the axonal 60 min value of the first 50 µm.</p><p>Polarity indices (A/D ratio) were calculated by dividing the axonal mean fluorescence value by the average dendritic mean fluorescence value.</p><p>The scalebar for all images represents 20 μm.</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>Statistics</title><p>All statistics were performed using GraphPad Prism. The ROUT method was used to identify outliers for all parameters measured before normalising to control. Neurons were removed from analysis if any one parameter was found to be an outlier. As is the convention in the field (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Leterrier et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Coutts et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Simon et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Evans et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">McDonald et al., 2007b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Leterrier et al., 2017</xref>), ‘N’ denotes the number of separate neuronal cultures prepared from litters of pups from separate dams and ‘n’ denotes the total number of neurons across the separate cultures assessed. To determine statistical significance between two groups, a D’Agostino and Pearson normality test was performed. Unpaired t-tests were performed on data that passed the normality test whereas the Mann-Whitney test was used if it did not. One- or Two-way ANOVAs with Tukey’s or Sidak’s <italic>post hoc</italic> test were used to determine statistical significance between more than two groups depending on the comparisons required. *p ≤ 0.05, **p ≤ 0.01, ***p ≤ 0.001, ****p ≤ 0.0001.

Your article has been reviewed by Richard Aldrich as the Senior Editor, a Reviewing Editor, and three reviewers.

In addition to re-investigating several debated previous findings of CB1R targeting, such as the role of receptor-state dependent somatodendritic endocytosis, their study introduces a novel element, the role of the C-terminal segment in general and its Helix 9 (H9) in particular, by suggesting the involvement of H9 in specific targeting to axons. The use of the RUSH protocol to examine early steps of CB1R targeting is interesting. However, several shortcomings limit the enthusiasm for the manuscript.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The CB1 receptor displays a well-described disto-proximal gradient of expression at the axonal plasma membrane both in vitro and in vivo, with the highest receptor levels present at the pre-terminal or distal axonal segments. Given the highly branched morphology of typical CB1 expressing neurons, correct axonal polarization likely requires specific distal targeting mechanisms and not simply diffusion on the membrane from the proximal axonal surface. Unfortunately, the present manuscript investigates CB1R targeting only to a short and highly proximal axonal region, the first 50µm that also contains the axon initial segment (AIS), a highly-specialized axonal sub-region. This proximal segment is not representative for entire axonal surface, which includes the functionally more relevant distal segments. So while it's possible that this proximal axonal segment specifically captures CB1Rs delivered through H9-dependent transport in the early stages of CB1R export, it seems premature to draw conclusions on the mechanisms of polarized axonal expression of CB1Rs, which was reported to be established at a longer time-scale of several hours (Figure 7 in Leterrier et al., 2006), through measurement of CB1 targeting only to this sub-region during the first 90 minutes of release from the ER.</p><p>2) The data presented on Figure 2 on the effect of the C-terminal segment of CB1R on CD4 expression are interesting. The authors suggest specific axonal transport of the chimeric proteins. However, the green color on the merged images of CD4-ctCB1R constructs suggests that they are mostly endocytosed, while the WT CD4 is mostly surface-localized, as expected for a surface-expressed protein. Given the known, and in this manuscript partially confirmed the role of endocytosis in CB1R targeting to the axon, an alternative hypothesis is that the C-terminal segment of CB1R is driving CD4 into more endocytosed phenotype at least in dendrites, contributing to its axonal polarization. Consequently, the role of ctCB1R<sup>WT</sup> and ctCB1R<sup>∆H9</sup> in CD4 endocytosis should be excluded/analyzed more precisely.</p><p>3) On Figure 5A-C, reduced activation of ERK 1/2 is demonstrated for EGFP-CB1R<sup>∆H9</sup> as compared to EGFP-CB1R<sup>WT</sup> after normalizing for the amount of expressed receptors. However, since the <italic>∆H9</italic> mutants were shown to be more endocytosed in neurons, it is important to normalize rather for the surface population of receptors, since endocytosed EGFP-CB1R<sup>∆H9</sup> may be less accessible to exogenous ligands, putatively explaining the measured differences in signaling.</p><p>4) The authors use an N-terminally truncated CB1R as &quot;CB1R<sup>WT</sup>&quot;. This choice should be explained in the manuscript and the lack of effect of this truncation on axonal polarization should be shown, either by citing the literature or by experimental demonstration.</p><p>5) I have main concerns around the use of the statistics, I have not come across N vs. n used in these standardized test before. It appears that the authors have combined data from each individual neuron in order to carry out the statistics, as opposed to using an n=3 from the independent experiments, or some form of nested analysis where each experiment is treated separately. Perhaps this is the convention for this field, but it needs to be more clearly explained and justified.</p><p>6) HEK cells were used to look at signaling – why not do the pERK assay in neurons? While the cells appear to express similar total receptor was there equivalent cell surface expression? (Figure 5C).</p><p>7) The internalization assay was carried out at 3 hours which is enough time for significant constitutive internalization to have occurred. Were these compared to vehicle treatment or to time zero? A time course of internalization (which could have been done on the HEK cells) would provide greater insight into the mechanism by which this relatively subtle difference is occurring (the data sets are very much overlapping – see concerns around n vs. N in point one).</p><p>8) The use of the RUSH system is very powerful in helping to interpret the movement of the receptors – have the authors established that the tags on the receptor do not significantly alter the expression and function of the receptor (once released from the ER)?</p><p>9) In the brain little CB1 is seen along axons – rather it is very localized to the presynaptic terminal, yet in cells in culture the entire axon appears to express surface CB1 – does this suggest that trafficking is different in culture to in vivo?</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.44252.015</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The CB1 receptor displays a well-described disto-proximal gradient of expression at the axonal plasma membrane both in vitro and in vivo, with the highest receptor levels present at the pre-terminal or distal axonal segments.

We have added additional data and text to clarify the revised manuscript.</p><p>We used time-resolved RUSH experiments to investigate the initiation of CB1R polarity. We measured the transit through the secretory pathway and incorporation into, and passage through, the highly organised axon initial segment (AIS) that acts as a ‘gate-keeper’ for proteins entering the axonal compartment. Our data show that CB1R polarisation is initiated in the first 90 min since they are directly targeted to, and surface expressed within, proximal axonal regions.</p><p>We have edited our revised manuscript to explicitly state that our time-resolved experiments were designed to examine the initiation of polarity and that we chose to examine the most proximal region of the axon to establish when CB1Rs first reach the axon.</p><p>Importantly, we also now emphasize that the mechanism for the initiation of polarity that we describe here does not exclude the possibility that further trafficking signals determine the subsequent distal targeting and presynaptic enrichment of the receptor. These distal CB1R trafficking processes may include lateral diffusion and/or trafficking of CB1R-containing vesicles originating from the secretory pathway or transcytosis via the endosomal system (Simon et al., 2013) inside the axon. As the reviewer suggests, these additional mechanisms may take place on a time-scale of several hours.</p><p>To further address this issue, we performed additional analyses to monitor CB1R delivery beyond the AIS. We traced the first 100 µm of axon from the soma and plotted total and surface CB1R delivery at 0, 30, 90 minutes and overnight (O/N) after biotin-mediated release from the ER (Figure 2H,I). Interestingly, 30 minutes after release from the ER, before CB1R appears on the surface, CB1R is already present at least 100 µm along the axon at levels similar to the effectively unretained control (O/N). Furthermore, surface CB1Rs delivered from the secretory pathway accumulate at the distal region of the AIS before progressing further along the axon. 100 µm along the axon, CB1R levels reach a steady state 90 min after release, again at levels similar to the O/N control. However, when released O/N, fewer receptors remain in the most proximal region of the axon, consistent with the involvement of other mechanisms in distal axonal delivery (&gt;100 µm) over a time-course of several hours.</p><p>Overall, we interpret these data to suggest that arrival at the AIS likely represents an initial ‘axonal capture’ of CB1R. Once within the axonal compartment trafficking to more distal locations and to presynaptic sites is then mediated by additional mechanisms that probably include both intracellular transport and lateral diffusion and trapping within the axonal membrane analogous to processes reported for postsynaptic AMPA receptors (Penn et al., 2017). While of undoubted interest, we believe that the detailed investigation of these subsequent distal axonal trafficking steps for CB1R is beyond the scope of our current manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) The data presented on Figure 2 on the effect of the C-terminal segment of CB1R on CD4 expression are interesting. The authors suggest specific axonal transport of the chimeric proteins. However, the green color on the merged images of CD4-ctCB1R constructs suggests that they are mostly endocytosed, while the CD4<sup>WT</sup> is mostly surface-localized, as expected for a surface-expressed protein. Given the known, and in this manuscript partially confirmed the role of endocytosis in CB1R targeting to the axon, an alternative hypothesis is that the C-terminal segment of CB1R is driving CD4 into more endocytosed phenotype at least in dendrites, contributing to its axonal polarization. Consequently, the role of ctCB1R<sup>WT</sup> and ctCB1R<sup>∆H9</sup> in CD4 endocytosis should be excluded/analyzed more precisely.</p></disp-quote><p>In the original manuscript we analysed differences in endocytosis between full-length SBP-EGFP-CB1R<sup>WT</sup> and SBP-EGFP-CB1R<sup>ΔH9</sup>. Crucially, the only the difference between these constructs is omission of the H9 motif within the C-terminal domain of the receptor. These experiments demonstrate that the H9 domain plays a role in stabilising surface expression at the axonal membrane and that SBP-EGFP-CB1R<sup>ΔH9</sup> is more rapidly endocytosed than SBP-EGFP-CB1R<sup>WT</sup> in both axons and in dendrites. Moreover, we showed that the CB1R-specific inverse agonist AM281 significantly reduced surface polarity of EGFP-CB1R<sup>ΔH9</sup> compared to EGFP-CB1R<sup>WT</sup> in hippocampal neurons due to increased dendritic surface expression (Figure 8).</p><p>As suggested, to more fully address the role of H9 in endocytosis we have now performed additional antibody feeding experiments using the CD4-ctCB1R<sup>WT</sup> and ctCB1R<sup>ΔH9</sup> fusion proteins in neurons and added these new data to the revised manuscript (Figure 4). Entirely consistent with the AM281 results from full-length CB1Rs there is no difference in internalisation between CD4-ctCB1R<sup>WT</sup> and ctCB1R<sup>ΔH9</sup> in either axons or dendrites, since the CD4 chimeras are incapable of endocannabinoid-induced internalisation.</p><p>Interestingly, there is a slight, but significant, increase in dendritic internalisation of both CD4-ctCB1R<sup>WT</sup> and ctCB1R<sup>ΔH9</sup> compared to the CD4<sup>Δct</sup> control. Importantly, because this increase in internalisation in identical between CD4-ctCB1R<sup>WT</sup> and ctCB1R<sup>ΔH9</sup>, it cannot account for the failure of CD4-ctCB1R<sup>ΔH9</sup> to polarise to the level of CD4-ctCB1R<sup>WT</sup>. However, it could provide an explanation for why CD4-ctCB1R<sup>ΔH9</sup> surface polarisation does not return completely to CD4<sup>Δct</sup> control levels.</p><p>This dendrite selective increase in internalisation suggests the presence of a constitutive activation-independent internalisation mechanism that does not involve H9 and is absent from the axonal compartment. Although detailed identification of this process is beyond the scope of the current manuscript, we have included new discussion to highlight this point.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) On Figure 5A-C, reduced activation of ERK 1/2 is demonstrated for EGFP-CB1R<sup>∆H9</sup> as compared to EGFP-CB1R<sup>WT</sup> after normalizing for the amount of expressed receptors. However, since the ∆H9 mutants were shown to be more endocytosed in neurons, it is important to normalize rather for the surface population of receptors, since endocytosed EGFP-CB1R<sup>∆H9</sup> may be less accessible to exogenous ligands, putatively explaining the measured differences in signaling.</p></disp-quote><p>We have now used surface biotinylation to assess surface expression of EGFP-CB1R<sup>WT</sup> and EGFP-CB1R<sup>ΔH9</sup> in HEK cells. We detected no difference, indicating that EGFP-CB1R<sup>ΔH9</sup> is not more internalised in this cell line. Furthermore, these data demonstrate that the lack of ERK activation by EGFP-CB1R<sup>ΔH9</sup> is attributable to a deficit in signalling capability rather than altered surface expression. We have added this new data to the revised manuscript (Figure 7D-E).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) The authors use an N-terminally truncated CB1R as &quot;CB1R<sup>WT</sup>&quot;. This choice should be explained in the manuscript and the lack of effect of this truncation on axonal polarization should be shown, either by citing the literature or by experimental demonstration.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this point, and we apologise for not including these details in the original manuscript.</p><p>N-terminal fluorphore-tagged-CB1R was first reported by the Irving group (McDonald et al., 2007). In that construct the extreme 25 N-terminal amino acids were removed to avoid possible cleavage of the tag during protein processing (Nordstrom et al., 2006). Interestingly, it has subsequently been reported that the first 22 residues constitute a mitochondrial targeting motif, and that removal of these 22 residues prevents mitochondrial localisation of CB1R but does not affect plasma membrane trafficking (Hebert-Chatelain et al., 2016).</p><p>In all reports, the plasma membrane trafficking and axonal polarisation of N-terminally truncated CB1 was indistinguishable from endogenous CB1R. Thus, our use of the N-terminal truncations circumvents potential complications due to mitochondrial targeting which, although of interest, are not the focus of our study. Nonetheless, to fully confirm these reports we generated an entirely full-length EGFP-CB1R (EGFP-CB1R<sup>FL</sup>) that is not missing the N-terminal amino acids. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig1">Author response image 1</xref>, the axonal surface polarisation of this full-length CB1R behaves identically to the truncated version used throughout our manuscript. These points are now included in the revised manuscript.</p><fig id="respfig1"><label>Author response image 1.</label><caption><title>Indistinguishable axonal surface polarisation of full-length CB1R and CB1R lacking the first 25 N-terminal residues.</title></caption><graphic mime-subtype="jpeg" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-44252-resp-fig1-v1"/></fig><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) I have main concerns around the use of the statistics, I have not come across N vs. n used in these standardized test before.

While the cells appear to express similar total receptor was there equivalent cell surface expression? (Figure 5C).</p></disp-quote><p>Performing the pERK assay in neurons is complex because of the confounding issue of endogenous CB1R expression. To be meaningful, experiments would require knockdown of endogenous CB1R and subsequent replacement with EGFP-CB1R<sup>WT</sup> or EGFP-CB1R<sup>ΔH9</sup>. While this would be feasible in the long term, we argue it is unnecessary for these fundamental signalling experiments. Rather, because HEK cells don’t contain endogenous CB1R but do contain all the components of the ERK pathway, they provide a convenient, tractable, and standardly used model system to test the ability of EGFP-CB1R<sup>WT</sup> and EGFP-CB1R<sup>ΔH9</sup> to couple to pERK signalling.</p><p>As set out in our response to point 3, we have performed surface biotinylations to confirm that EGFP-CB1R<sup>WT</sup> and EGFP-CB1R<sup>ΔH9</sup> are surface expressed at the same levels in HEK293T cells. These data are now included in the revised manuscript (Figure 7D-E).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7) The internalization assay was carried out at 3 hours which is enough time for significant constitutive internalization to have occurred.

More specifically, EGFP-CB1R<sup>WT</sup> and + ACEA was normalized to EGFP-CB1R<sup>WT</sup> + EtOH, and EGFP-CB1R<sup>ΔH9</sup> + ACEA was normalized to EGFP-CB1R<sup>ΔH9</sup> + EtOH to fully account for any differences in steady-state levels of surface expression between the constructs and for any differences in constitutive internalisation. This is now better explained in the revised manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>8) The use of the RUSH system is very powerful in helping to interpret the movement of the receptors – have the authors established that the tags on the receptor do not significantly alter the expression and function of the receptor (once released from the ER)?</p></disp-quote><p>As outlined above, N-terminal tags do not impede CB1R plasma membrane localisation or function. Moreover, our pERK signalling assays further validate and confirm the functionality of the SBP-EGFP-CB1R constructs (Figure 7).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>9) In the brain little CB1 is seen along axons – rather it is very localized to the presynaptic terminal, yet in cells in culture the entire axon appears to express surface CB1 – does this suggest that trafficking is different in culture to in vivo?</p></disp-quote><p>This is a difficult question to address directly but we very much doubt that different trafficking mechanisms are employed in culture to those that occur in the brain. We note, however, that the pattern of localisation we observe is entirely consistent with previous studies investigating the distribution of endogenous and expressed CB1R in cultured neurons (Soltesz et al., 2015; Basavarajappa et al., 2017; Busquets-Garcia et al., 2018: Coutts et al., 2001).</p><p>We agree that CB1R localisation in brain sections, determined mainly using immunogold electron microscopy, predominantly detects CB1R at the presynaptic terminal (Katona, 2009; Simon et al., 2013). However, immunogold staining detects only a relatively small fraction of the total antigen present (Rozenfeld and Devi, 2008; Rozenfeld, 2011). Therefore, because CB1Rs are concentrated in the bouton, that is the region where they are most reliably visualised. A recent paper using STORM super-resolution imaging of CB1R in brain slices specifically focused on presynaptic boutons but did not compare this region to the axonal shaft (Hsieh et al., 1999). Furthermore, the fact that dispersed neuronal cultures are more tractable to manipulation and permeabilization, and therefore likely more accessible to antibodies than brain slices, may also partly explain why axonal CB1Rs are more readily observed in culture.</p><p>We emphasize, however, that CB1Rs present at presynaptic termini must initially be delivered and therefore must undergo targeting to, and trafficking via, the axon. Importantly, it is aspects of these processes that we are investigating.</p><p>References:</p><p>Penn AC, Zhang CL, Georges F, Royer L, Breillat C, Hosy E, et al.
