organizational principles for nervous system function. Functional variation also exists between neurons of the same type. This is exemplified by correspondence between grid cell spatial scales and the synaptic integrative properties of stellate cells (SCs) in the medial entorhinal cortex. However, we know little about how functional variability is structured either within or between individuals. Using ex-vivo patch-clamp recordings from up to 55 SCs per mouse, we found that integrative properties vary between mice and, in contrast to the modularity of grid cell spatial scales, have a continuous dorsoventral organization. Our results constrain mechanisms for modular grid firing and provide evidence for inter-animal phenotypic variability among neurons of the same type. We suggest that neuron type properties are tuned to circuit-level set points that vary within and between animals.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><title>eLife digest</title><p>The brain consists of many types of cells that are specialised to perform different tasks. This is similar to how different groups of people will have different responsibilities in a large company. But within each group with the same role, individual employees will also do their jobs in different ways. Does the same apply to the brain? In other words, do individual neurons of the same type – with the same role – process information differently?</p><p>To find out, Pastoll et al. studied stellate cells in the mouse brain: these neurons take their name from their distinctive star-shaped arrays of projections, and they work together in groups known as modules to help animals navigate their environment. To determine whether stellate cells differ between mice, and how they might differ within a single animal, Pastoll et al. measured the activity of more than 800 stellate cells in more than two dozen individuals.</p><p>The results revealed that stellate cells process the same information differently between mice, which may contribute to variations in behaviour across the species. But even within an individual, stellate cells also showed differences in information processing. In fact, the properties of the stellate cells within each mouse varied along a continuum. This discovery rules out several previous theories on how stellate cells form the modules that support navigation.</p><p>The work by Pastoll et al. helps to understand how the brain supports thinking and memory. In the long term, these findings could also have implications for treating brain disorders, as they suggest that variations between people in the properties of their neurons could lead to variations in drug response. Researchers may need to take inter-individual differences into account when planning experiments, and ultimately when designing drugs.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>entorhinal cortex</kwd><kwd>synaptic integration</kwd><kwd>presynaptic function</kwd><kwd>multi-vesicular release</kwd><kwd>synaptic vesicle</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100010269</institution-id><institution>Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council (BBSRC)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>200855/Z/16/Z</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Nolan</surname><given-names>Matthew F</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100010269</institution-id><institution>Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council (BBSRC)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>BB/1022147/1</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Nolan</surname><given-names>Matthew F</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000268</institution-id><institution>Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>BB/H020284/1</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Nolan</surname><given-names>Matthew F</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100004440</institution-id><institution>Wellcome</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>200855/Z/16/Z</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Nolan</surname><given-names>Matthew F</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Setpoints that determine the integrative properties of neurons in the medial entorhinal cortex are established at a population level and differ between animals.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The concept of cell types provides a general organizing principle for understanding biological structures including the brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Regev et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Zeng and Sanes, 2017</xref>). The simplest conceptualization of a neuronal cell type, as a population of phenotypically similar neurons with features that cluster around a single set point (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Wang et al., 2011b</xref>), is extended by observations of variability in cell type features, suggesting that some neuronal cell types may be conceived as clustering along a line rather than around a point in a feature space (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Cembrowski and Menon, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">O'Donnell and Nolan, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Correlations between the functional organization of sensory, motor and cognitive circuits and the electrophysiological properties of individual neuronal cell types suggest that this feature variability underlies key neural computations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Adamson et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Angelo et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Fletcher and Williams, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Garden et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Giocomo et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Kuba et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">O'Donnell and Nolan, 2011</xref>). However, within-cell type variability has typically been deduced by combining data obtained from multiple animals. By contrast, the structure of variation within individual animals or between different animals has received little attention. For example, apparent clustering of properties along lines in feature space could reflect a continuum of set points, or could result from a small number of discrete set points that are obscured by inter-animal variation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). Moreover, although investigations of invertebrate nervous systems show that set points may differ between animals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Goaillard et al., 2009</xref>), it is not clear whether mammalian neurons exhibit similar phenotypic diversity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). Distinguishing these possibilities requires many more electrophysiological observations for each animal than are obtained in typical studies.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Classification and variability of neuronal cell types.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Neuronal cell types are identifiable by features clustering around a distinct point (blue, green and yellow) or a line (orange) in feature space. The clustering implies that neuron types are defined by either a single set point (blue, green and yellow) or by multiple set points spread along a line (orange). (<bold>B</bold>) Phenotypic variability of a single neuron type could result from distinct set points that subdivide the neuron type but appear continuous when data from multiple animals are combined (modular), from differences in components of a set point that do not extend along a continuum but that in different animals cluster at different locations in feature space (orthogonal), or from differences between animals in the range covered by a continuum of set points (offset). These distinct forms of variability can only be made apparent by measuring the features of many neurons from multiple animals.</p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-52258-fig1-v4.tif"/></fig><fig id="fig1s1" position="float" specific-use="child-fig"><label>Figure 1—figure supplement 1.</label><caption><title>A quantitative adaptation of the gap statistic clustering algorithm.</title><p>(<bold>A–C</bold>) Logic of the gap statistic. (<bold>A</bold>) Simulated clustered dataset with three modes (k = 3) (open gray circles) (upper) and the corresponding simulated reference dataset drawn from a uniform distribution with lower and upper limits set by the minimum and maximum values from the corresponding clustered dataset (open gray diamonds).

The MEC contains neurons that encode an animal’s location through grid-like firing fields (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Fyhn et al., 2004</xref>). The spatial scale of grid fields follows a dorsoventral organization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Hafting et al., 2005</xref>), which is mirrored by a dorsoventral organization in key electrophysiological features of SCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Boehlen et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Dodson et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Garden et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Giocomo et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Giocomo and Hasselmo, 2008a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Pastoll et al., 2012a</xref>). Grid cells are further organized into discrete modules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Stensola et al., 2012</xref>), with the cells within a module having a similar grid scale and orientation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Barry et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Gu et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Stensola et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Yoon et al., 2013</xref>); progressively more ventral modules are composed of cells with wider grid spacing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Stensola et al., 2012</xref>). Studies that demonstrate dorsoventral organization of integrative properties of SCs have so far relied on the pooling of relatively few measurements per animal. Hence, it is unclear whether the organization of these cellular properties is modular, as one might expect if they directly set the scale of grid firing fields in individual grid cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Giocomo et al., 2007</xref>). The possibility that set points for electrophysiological properties of SCs differ between animals has also not been considered previously.</p><p>Evaluation of variability between and within animals requires statistical approaches that are not typically used in single-cell electrophysiological investigations. Given appropriate assumptions, inter-animal differences can be assessed using mixed effect models that are well established in other fields (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Baayen et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Geiler-Samerotte et al., 2013</xref>). Because tests of whether data arise from modular as opposed to continuous distributions have received less general attention, to facilitate detection of modularity using relatively few observations, we introduce a modification of the gap statistic algorithm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Tibshirani et al., 2001</xref>) that estimates the number of modes in a dataset while controlling for observations expected by chance (see 'Materials and methods' and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplements 1</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s5">5</xref>). This algorithm performs well compared with discreteness metrics that are based on the standard deviation of binned data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Giocomo et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Stensola et al., 2012</xref>), which we find are prone to high false-positive rates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1—figure supplement 4A</xref>). We find that recordings from approximately 30 SCs per animal should be sufficient to detect modularity using the modified gap statistic algorithm and given the experimentally observed separation between grid modules (see 'Materials and methods' and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplements 2</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">3</xref>). Although methods for high-quality recording from SCs in ex-vivo brain slices are well established (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Pastoll et al., 2012b</xref>), typically fewer than five recordings per animal were made in previous studies, which is many fewer than our estimate of the minimum number of observations required to test for modularity.</p><p>We set out to establish the nature of the set points that establish the integrative properties of SCs by measuring intra- and inter-animal variation in key electrophysiological features using experiments that maximize the number of SCs recorded per animal. Our results suggest that set points for individual features of a neuronal cell type are established at the level of neuronal cell populations, differ between animals and follow a continuous organization.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Sampling integrative properties from many neurons per animal</title><p>Before addressing intra- and inter-animal variability, we first describe the data set used for the analyses that follow.

To minimize this possibility, we standardized our procedures for tissue preparation (see 'Materials and methods'), such that slices were of consistent high quality as assessed by low numbers of unhealthy cells and by visualization of soma and dendrites of neurons in the slice. Several further observations are consistent with comparable quality of slices between experiments. First, if the condition of the slices had differed substantially between animals, then in better quality slices, it should be easier to record from more neurons, in which case features that depend on tissue quality would correlate with the number of recorded neurons. However, the majority (10/12) of the electrophysiological features were not significantly (p&gt;0.2) associated with the number of recorded neurons (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp12">Supplementary file 12</xref>). Second, analyses of inter-animal differences that focus only on data from animals for which &gt;35 recordings were made, which should only be feasible with uniformly high-quality brain slices, are consistent with conclusions from analysis of the larger dataset (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp13">Supplementary file 13</xref>). Third, the conditional R<sup>2</sup> values of electrophysiological features of L2PCs are much lower than those for SCs recorded under the same experimental conditions (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>), suggesting that inter-animal variation may be specific to SCs and cannot be explained by slice conditions.

To evaluate modularity, we used datasets with n ≥ 34 SCs (N = 15 mice, median age = 37 days, age range = 18–43 days). We focus initially on rheobase, which is the property with the strongest correlation to dorsoventral location, and resonant frequency, which is related to the oscillatory dynamics underlying dorsoventral tuning in some models of grid firing (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Burgess et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Giocomo et al., 2007</xref>).

These values of p<sub>detect</sub> were not significantly different from the proportions expected given the false positive rate of 0.1 in the complete absence of clustering (p=0.28 and 0.66, binomial test).

This does not differ significantly from the proportion expected by chance when no modularity is present (p&gt;0.05, binomial test). Consistent with this, the average proportion of datasets evaluated as modular across all measured features was 0.072 ± 0.02 (± SEM), which is similar to the expected false-positive rate. By contrast, the properties of grid firing fields previously recorded with tetrodes in behaving animals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Stensola et al., 2012</xref>) were detected as having a modular organization using the modified gap statistic (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s5">Figure 1—figure supplement 5</xref>). For seven grid-cell datasets with n ≥ 20, the mean for p<sub>detect</sub> is 0.86, with 95% confidence intervals of 0.42 to 0.996. We note here that discontinuity algorithms that were previously used to assess the modularity of grid field properties (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Giocomo et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Stensola et al., 2012</xref>) did indicate significant modularity in the majority of the intrinsic properties measured in our dataset (N = 13/15 and N = 12/15, respectively), but this was attributable to false positives resulting from the relatively even sampling of recording locations (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1—figure supplement 4A</xref>). Therefore, we conclude that it is unlikely that any of the intrinsic integrative properties of SCs that we examined have organization within individual animals resembling the modular organization of grid cells in behaving animals.</p></sec><sec id="s2-6"><title>Multiple sources of variance contribute to diversity in stellate cell intrinsic properties</title><p>Finally, because many of the measured electrophysiological features of SCs emerge from shared ionic mechanisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Dodson et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Garden et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Pastoll et al., 2012a</xref>), we asked whether dorsoventral tuning reflects a single core mechanism and whether inter-animal differences are specific to this mechanism or manifest more generally.</p><p>Estimation of conditional independence for measurements at the level of individual neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>) or individual animals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>) was consistent with the expectation that particular classes of membrane ion channels influence multiple electrophysiologically measured features. The first five dimensions of a principal components analysis (PCA) of all measured electrophysiological features accounted for almost 80% of the variance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref>). Examination of the rotations used to generate the principal components suggested relationships between individual features that are consistent with our evaluation of the conditional independence structure of the measured features (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D and A</xref>). When we fit the principal components using mixed models with location as a fixed effect and animal identity as a random effect, we found that the first two components depended significantly on dorsoventral location (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7E</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp14">Supplementary file 14</xref>) (marginal R<sup>2</sup> = 0.50 and 0.09 and adjusted p=1.09×10<sup>−15</sup> and 1.05 × 10<sup>−4</sup>, respectively).

In the crab stomatogastric ganglion, inter-animal variation correlates with circuit performance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Goaillard et al., 2009</xref>). Accordingly, variation in intrinsic properties of SCs might correlate with differences in grid firing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Domnisoru et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Gu et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Rowland et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Schmidt-Hieber and Häusser, 2013</xref>) or behaviors that rely on SCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Kitamura et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Qin et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Tennant et al., 2018</xref>). It is interesting in this respect that there appear to be inter-animal differences in the spatial scale of grid modules (Figure 5 of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Stensola et al., 2012</xref>). Modification of grid field scaling following deletion of HCN1 channels is also consistent with this possibility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Giocomo et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Mallory et al., 2018</xref>). Alternatively, inter-animal differences may reflect multiple ways to achieve a common higher-order phenotype. According to this view, coding of spatial location by SCs would not differ between animals despite lower level variation in their intrinsic electrophysiological features.

This has implications for experimental design and model building as the distribution of replicates from the same animal will differ from those obtained from different animals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Marder and Taylor, 2011</xref>). An important future goal will be to distinguish causes of inter-animal variation. Many behaviors are characterized by substantial inter-animal variation (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Villette et al., 2017</xref>), which could result from variation in neuronal integrative properties, or could drive this variation. For example, it is possible that external factors such as social interactions may affect brain circuitry (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Wang et al., 2011a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Wang et al., 2014</xref>), although these effects appear to be focused on frontal cortical structures rather than circuits for spatial computations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Wang et al., 2014</xref>).

Each experimenter aimed to sample recording locations evenly across the dorsoventral extent of the MEC, and for most animals, each experimenter recorded sequentially from opposite extremes of the dorsoventral axis. Each experimenter varied the starting location for recording between animals.

Features of interest were included as fixed effects and animal identity was included as a random effect. All reported analyses are for models with the minimal a priori random effect structure, in other words the random effect was specified with uncorrelated slope and intercept. We also evaluated models in which only the intercept, or correlated intercept and slope were specified as the random effect. Model assessment was performed using Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) scores. In general, models with either random slope and intercept, or correlated random slope and intercept, had lower AIC scores than random intercept only models, indicating a better fit to the data. We used the former set of models for all analyses of all properties for consistency and because a maximal effect structure may be preferable on theoretical grounds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Barr et al., 2013</xref>). We evaluated assumptions including linearity, normality, homoscedasticity and influential data points. For some features, we found modest deviations from these assumptions that could be remedied by handling non-linearity in the data using a copula transformation. Model fits were similar following transformation of the data. However, we focus here on analyses of the untransformed data because the physical interpretation of the resulting values for data points is clearer.</p><p>To evaluate the location-dependence of a given feature, p-values were calculated using a χ<sup>2</sup> test comparing models to null models with no location information but identical random effect specification. To calculate marginal and conditional R<sup>2</sup> of mixed effect models, we used the MuMin package (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bartoń, 2014</xref>). To evaluate additional fixed effects, we used Type II Wald χ<sup>2</sup> test tests provided by the car package (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Fox and Weisberg, 2018</xref>). To compare mixed effect with equivalent linear models, we used a χ<sup>2</sup> test to compare the calculated deviance for each model. For clarity, we have reported key statistics in the main text and provide full test statistics in the Supplemental Tables.

The gap statistic estimates the number of clusters (k<sub>est</sub>) that best account for the data in any given dataset (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A-C</xref>). However, this estimate may be prone to false positives, particularly where the numbers of observations are low. We therefore introduced a thresholding mechanism for tuning the sensitivity of the algorithm so that the false-positive rate, which is the rate of misclassifying datasets drawn from continuous (uniform) distributions as ‘modular’, is low, constant across different numbers of cluster modes and insensitive to dataset size (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1D-G</xref>). With this approach, we are able to estimate whether a dataset is best described as lacking modularity (k<sub>est</sub> = 1), or having a given number of modes (k<sub>est</sub> &gt; 1). Below, we describe tests carried out to validate the approach.</p><p>To illustrate the sensitivity and specificity of the modified gap statistic algorithm, we applied it to simulated datasets drawn either from a uniform distribution (k = 1, n = 40) or from a bimodal distribution with separation between the modes of five standard deviations (k = 2, n = 40, sigma = 5) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2A</xref>). We set the thresholding mechanism so that k<sub>est</sub> for each distinct k (where k<sub>est</sub> ≥2) has a false-positive rate of 0.01. In line with this, testing for 2 ≤ k<sub>est</sub> ≤ 8 (the maximum k expected to occur in grid spacing in the MEC), across multiple (N = 1000) simulated datasets drawn from the uniform distribution, produced a low false-positive rate (P(k<sub>est</sub>)≥2 = ~0.07), whereas when the data were drawn from the bimodal distribution, the ability to detect modular organization (p<sub>detect</sub>) was good (P[k<sub>est</sub>]≥2 = ~0.8) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2B</xref>). The performance of the statistic improved with larger separation between clusters and with greater numbers of data points per dataset (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2C</xref>) and is relatively insensitive to the numbers of clusters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2D</xref>). The algorithm maintains high rates of p<sub>detect</sub> when modes have varying densities and when sigma between modes varies in a manner similar to grid spacing data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Analysis of extracellular recording data from other laboratories</title><p>Recently described algorithms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Giocomo et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Stensola et al., 2012</xref>) address the problem of identifying modularity when data are sampled from multiple locations and data values vary as a function of location, as is the case for the mean spacing of grid fields for cells at different dorsoventral locations recorded in behaving animals using tetrodes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Hafting et al., 2005</xref>). They generate log-normalized discontinuity (which we refer to here as lnDS) or discreteness scores, which are the log of the ratio of discontinuity or discreteness scores for the data points of interest and for the sampling locations, with positive values interpreted as evidence for clustering (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Giocomo et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Stensola et al., 2012</xref>). However, in simulations of datasets generated from a uniform distribution with evenly spaced recording locations, we find that the lnDS is always greater than zero (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1—figure supplement 4A</xref>). This is because evenly spaced locations result in a discontinuity score that approaches zero, and therefore the log ratio of the discontinuity of the data to this score will be positive. Thus, for evenly spaced data, the lnDS is guaranteed to produce false-positive results. When locations are instead sampled from a uniform distribution, approximately half of the simulated datasets have a log discontinuity ratio greater than 0 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1—figure supplement 4A</xref>), which in previous studies would be interpreted as evidence of modularity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Giocomo et al., 2014</xref>). Similar discrepancies arise for the discreteness measure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Stensola et al., 2012</xref>). To address these issues, we introduced a log discontinuity ratio threshold, so that the discontinuity method could be matched to produce a similar false-positive rate to the adapted gap statistic algorithm used in the example above. After including this modification, we found that for a given false-positive rate, the adapted gap statistic is more sensitive at detecting modularity in the simulated datasets (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1B</xref>).</p><p>To establish whether the modified gap statistic detects clustering in experimental data, we applied it to previously published grid cell data recorded with tetrodes from awake behaving animals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Stensola et al., 2012</xref>). We find that the modified gap statistic identified clustered grid spacing for 6 of 7 animals previously identified as having grid modules and with n ≥ 20. For these animals, the number of modules was similar (but not always identical) to the number of previously identified modules (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s5">Figure 1—figure supplement 5</xref>). By contrast, the modified gap statistic does not identify clustering in five of six sets of recording locations, confirming that the grid clustering is likely not a result of uneven sampling of locations (we could not test the seventh as location data were not available). The thresholded discontinuity score also detects clustering in the same five of the six tested sets of grid data. From the six grid datasets detected as clustered with the modified gap statistic, we estimated the separation between clusters by fitting the data with a mixture of Gaussians, with the number of modes set by the value of k obtained with the modified gap statistic. This analysis suggested that the largest spacing between contiguous modules in each mouse is always &gt;5.6 standard deviations (mean = 20.5 ± 5.0 standard deviations). Thus, the modified gap statistic detects modularity within the grid system and indicates that previous descriptions of grid modularity are, in general, robust to the possibility of false positives associated with the discreteness and discontinuity methods.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We thank Vanessa Stempel for comments on the manuscript, Tor Stensola and Edvard Moser for sharing published data, and Lukas Solanka and Lukas Fischer for help with building the large cage.

interests of transparency, eLife publishes the most substantive revision requests and the accompanying author responses.</p></boxed-text><p><bold>Acceptance summary:</bold></p><p>In this study, the authors examined the electrophysiological properties of entorhinal cortical layer II stellate cells along the dorsal-ventral axis both within and across animals. They confirm, as previously reported, that a number of stellate cell biophysical features differ along this axis. Using sophisticated statistical methods, the authors then ask if these features follow a continuum pattern or a modular pattern along the dorsal-ventral axis. This has been an important question in the field since a discrete modular/clustered distribution of grid cell spacing was first described (Barry et al., 2007) and later work showed discrete modules (populations) of neurons with shared features of grid cell spacing, orientation, and elliptical shape (Stensola et al., 2012). The authors of the current paper systematically show that even with large numbers of neurons from single animals (N&gt;35) they do not find evidence of modular/clustered patterns in the intrinsic properties of entorhinal stellate cells. The authors' findings add to the notion that the module cell organization of grid cells may reflect microcircuit activity. This is an important and rigorous paper that provides an important addition to the field and contributes to our understanding of the generation of spatial coding and circuits in the MEC.</p><p><bold>Decision letter after peer review:</bold></p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Inter-and intra-animal variation of integrative properties of stellate cells in the medial entorhinal cortex&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Laura Colgin as the Senior Editor. The following individuals involved in review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Michael E. Hasselmo (Reviewer #2); Andrea Burgalossi (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The authors have also studied the inter-animal variability among stellate cell excitability. They find that there is considerable inter animal variability, which is not unexpected given that there are a number of uncontrollable factors such as social interaction between animals as the authors allude to in their discussion. A number of studies have also reported that neuronal properties differ between animals at a single cell level in diverse regions (e.g. Villette et al., 2017). One possible issue for this variability, which the authors should address, is the fact that the slice quality, and therefore cell quality, might differ substantially between animals, even if this procedure is performed by the same experimenter. In particular, slight changes in cutting angles might impact factors such as the number of dendrites that are retained or cut off. Additional analyses on this front should be performed and considered in the discussion. Further, the synaptic connections onto the cells might also be variable between slices. I note that there are no glutamate or GABA receptor inhibitors included and thus baseline synaptic activity might be different between slices which might impact electrophysiological properties.</p><p>2) Given that the larger housing does have an effect on cell properties (Figure 4) it would be important to perform further analysis to determine if the number of objects that were in the cages within a specified area were the same in the larger housing versus standard cages. Additional objects in cages has been proposed to be an important factor in altering the properties of, for example, dentate gyrus adult new-born neurons.</p><p>3) The reviewers noted several discussion points that should be included in the Discussion section or relevant Results sections:</p><p>a) It is accepted that stellate cells are directly or indirectly involved in the generation of grid cell firing. However, grid cells are still a minority of all units recorded in MEC (and even in L2). By far, the most abundant functional cell type are non-grid spatial neurons (e.g. Diehl et al., 2017). Additional discussion on this point in relation to how their findings impact grid cell models should be considered.</p><p>b) One conclusion from the present work is that the intrinsic properties of stellate cells are not modularly organized – hence, the anatomical/cellular correlate of the functional grid cells modules remains to be elucidated. However, the L2 calbindin-positive neurons are indeed modularly organized, since they are anatomically clustered. This is an important organization principle of MEC L2 should at least be discussed (or commented upon) in the discussion.</p><p>c) Could the authors include a distribution of recordings along the medial-lateral axis?</p><p>d) Supplementary file 6: The physiological properties of neurons along the mediolateral dimension were also analyzed in Yoshida, Jochems and Hasselmo, 2013. This article should be cited and discussed. In addition, Figure 2, the apparent absence of dorsoventral differences in AHP differs from previous data showing a significant dorsoventral gradient of spike frequency adaptation and mAHP in the work by Yoshida et al., 2013. They should address this apparent difference in results.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.52258.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The authors have also studied the inter-animal variability among stellate cell excitability.

We’re not aware of previous studies that have systematically explored inter-animal variation in the intrinsic properties of mammalian neurons.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>One possible issue for this variability, which the authors should address, is the fact that the slice quality, and therefore cell quality, might differ substantially between animals, even if this procedure is performed by the same experimenter. In particular, slight changes in cutting angles might impact factors such as the number of dendrites that are retained or cut off. Additional analyses on this front should be performed and considered in the discussion.</p></disp-quote><p>To address the possibility of variation in slice quality we now highlight in the results the standardisation of the slicing procedure and several observations that argue against there being substantial differences in slice quality (paragraph two subsection “Inter-animal differences remain after accounting for additional experimental parameters”).</p><p>We appreciate the possibility that variation in slice angle could in principle alter the number of proportion of dendrites that are cut off. This appears unlikely to be an issue for several reasons:</p><p>1) Our method for preparation of sagittal slices involves hemi-section along the midline of the brain and then gluing the cut surface of the brain to the cutting block. Because the midline of the brain serves is a reliable guide for orientation, variation is minimal. This is in contrast with preparation of horizontal slices for which there is no obvious landmark to use for orientation and is therefore harder to make reproducible.</p><p>2) The same experimenter (HP) prepared all of the slices.</p><p>3) After each patch-clamp experiment we took images of the slice. While the images were primarily to enable assessment of the dorsoventral location of the recorded neurons, they did not suggest any substantial variation in slice angle.</p><p>4) Stellate cells dendrites are oriented in all directions from the soma. Therefore we expect the number of dendrites to be independent of the slicing angle. In other ongoing work we have found this to be the case.</p><p>We have modified the Materials and methods section to highlight how are dissection procedure minimises potential issues related to variation in the slice angle (subsection “Slice preparation”).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Further, the synaptic connections onto the cells might also be variable between slices. I note that there are no glutamate or GABA receptor inhibitors included and thus baseline synaptic activity might be different between slices which might impact electrophysiological properties.</p></disp-quote><p>To address possible roles of glutamate or GABA receptor inputs we have carried out additional experiments.</p><p>To detect tonic and phasic GABA receptor mediated synaptic inputs we have recorded spontaneous synaptic activity and the holding current at a potential of -70 mV in conditions in which the Cl<sup>–</sup> equilibrium potential is 0 mV (symmetrical intra- and extracellular Cl<sup>-</sup>concentration) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig1">Author response image 1</xref>). This is different to our standard recording conditions but is designed to maximise the amplitude of any GABA-A receptor mediated effects. In these conditions we find that application of GABA-A receptor antagonists abolishes spontaneous inhibitory synaptic currents but causes only a very small tonic outward current (6.4 +/- 14.7 pA). Consistent with this, we did not find any detectable change in input resistance when we applied blockers of GABA-A receptors to stellate cells (control: 31.6 ± 3.6 MΩ, GABAzine: 31.9 ± 4.1 MΩ, p = 0.89, n = 6, N = 5). Similar experiments using blockers of AMPA and NMDA suggest there is very little tonic glutamatergic input to stellate cells in our standard slice conditions (change in holding current: 8.5 +/- 13.8 pA; control input resistance: 30.0 ± 5.8 MΩ, input resistance in NBQΧ and D-APV: 31.4 ± 5.6 MΩ, n = 2, N = 2).</p><p>These data argue against baseline synaptic activity explaining our results. We now address this in the Materials and methods.</p><fig id="respfig1"><label>Author response image 1.</label><caption><title>Absence of a tonic GABA-A receptor mediated input to entorhinal cortex stellate cells.</title><p>(<bold>A–B</bold>) Continuous voltage-clamp recording of spontaneous synaptic activity from a stellate cell in control conditions (<bold>A</bold>) and during perfusion of GABAzine to block GABA-A receptors (<bold>B</bold>).

Additional objects in cages has been proposed to be an important factor in altering the properties of, for example, dentate gyrus adult new-born neurons.</p></disp-quote><p>This is an interesting idea. There were 10 – 15 plastic objects and 8 cardboard rolls in the large cages. The standard cages contained one cardboard roll and did not contain plastic objects. The area ratio of the large cage to a standard cage is approximately 39:1 (standard cage dimensions of 20 x 37 cm; floor area of 0.074 m<sup>2</sup> vs 2.88 m<sup>2</sup> for the large cage). Therefore, while there were more objects in the large cage, their density was slightly lower (up to 1/0.125 m -2 vs 1/0.074 m<sup>2</sup>). We now add this information to the Materials and methods (subsection “Mouse strains”).</p><p>We appreciate the idea of investigating whether the number or density of objects influences intrinsic properties of stellate cells or other neurons. However, our experiments aimed to test whether the excitable properties of stellate cells are modifiable by an environment that would maximise activation of ventral grid cells. Because we did not attempt to systematically vary the number of objects in the large maze we are not able to analyse the effect of the number of objects separately from the size of the cage. This could be an important question for future studies. We note that because our data suggest that effect sizes when addressing this question are likely to be quite small, obtaining adequate statistical power will likely require a large scale study with many more animals in each experimental group than we use here. To address the reviewers’ point in the manuscript we have modified the Discussion to consider the role of the number of objects (paragraph three subsection “A conceptual framework for within cell type variability”).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) The reviewers noted several discussion points that should be included in the Discussion section or relevant Results sections:</p><p>a) It is accepted that stellate cells are directly or indirectly involved in the generation of grid cell firing. However, grid cells are still a minority of all units recorded in MEC (and even in L2). By far, the most abundant functional cell type are non-grid spatial neurons (e.g. Diehl et al., 2017). Additional discussion on this point in relation to how their findings impact grid cell models should be considered.</p></disp-quote><p>We have modified the Discussion to highlight this point (subsection “Implications of continuous dorsoventral organisation of stellate cell integrative properties for grid cell firing”).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>b) One conclusion from the present work is that the intrinsic properties of stellate cells are not modularly organized – hence, the anatomical/cellular correlate of the functional grid cells modules remains to be elucidated. However, the L2 calbindin-positive neurons are indeed modularly organized, since they are anatomically clustered. This is an important organization principle of MEC L2 should at least be discussed (or commented upon) in the discussion.</p></disp-quote><p>We now mention this possibility in the Discussion (subsection “Implications of continuous dorsoventral organisation of stellate cell integrative properties for grid cell firing”).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>c) Could the authors include a distribution of recordings along the medial-lateral axis?</p></disp-quote><p>Because our experiments used para-sagittal slices we only obtained two slices per hemisphere that contained the MEC. To show the distribution of data between these slices we now include a figure comparing properties from slices containing the more medial with the more lateral parts of the MEC (Figure 4—figure supplement 1, referred to on p 5, subsection “Inter-animal differences remain after accounting for additional experimental parameters”).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>d) Supplementary file 6: The physiological properties of neurons along the mediolateral dimension were also analyzed in Yoshida, Jochems and Hasselmo, 2013. This article should be cited and discussed.</p></disp-quote><p>We apologise for overlooking the study by Yoshida and colleagues. We now cite this study (Results and Discussion section). We have added Discussion of the mediolateral organisation of SC properties (subsection “Implications of continuous dorsoventral organisation of stellate cell integrative properties for grid cell firing”).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In addition, Figure 2, the apparent absence of dorsoventral differences in AHP differs from previous data showing a significant dorsoventral gradient of spike frequency adaptation and mAHP in the work by Yoshida et al., 2013. They should address this apparent difference in results.</p></disp-quote><p>Differences between the results from Yoshida et al. and the results we present here likely result from different stimulus waveforms used to drive action potential firing. In Yoshida et al. spike frequency adaptation was measured in response to step currents that generated spike trains with frequency &gt; 20 Hz and the action potential AHP was measured from a baseline membrane potential of -60 mV after triggering a single spike with a 1ms current step. In contrast, we measured action potentials activated during injection of a positive current ramp. Because we were using a current ramp we were unable to quantify adaptation. Moreover, the maximum spike frequency reached during the ramp was typically &lt; 10 Hz (e.g. Figure 1C). Across this lower frequency range stellate cells show very little spike frequency adaptation (cf. Nolan et al., 2007, Pastoll et al., 2012). The dorsoventral gradient in the duration of AHPs reported by Yoshida et al. following single action potentials is consistent with our previous results in conditions similar to those used here (cf. Pastoll et al., 2012). We’re not sure why we don’t see the dorsoventral gradient in AHP amplitude reported by Yoshida et al., but this may reflect different driving forces for currents generating AHPs at the different baseline membrane potentials in each experiment (-60 mV in Yoshida et al. and approximately -40 mV here). Because the mechanisms by which SCs generate their AHP is not well understood it is difficult to speculate further. Therefore, because the two studies do not measure the AHP in the same way, and given that differences are likely to be technical and not related to the main hypotheses of the experiments in the study, we have not added any further discussion of the differences to the manuscript.</p></body></sub-article></article>
