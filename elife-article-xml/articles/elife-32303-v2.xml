However, these changes have mostly been studied by bulk measurements on many cells. Here we use single-cell mRNA sequencing to examine the transcriptional consequences of influenza virus infection. We find extremely wide cell-to-cell variation in the productivity of viral transcription – viral transcripts comprise less than a percent of total mRNA in many infected cells, but a few cells derive over half their mRNA from virus. Some infected cells fail to express at least one viral gene, but this gene absence only partially explains variation in viral transcriptional load. Despite variation in viral load, the relative abundances of viral mRNAs are fairly consistent across infected cells. Activation of innate immune pathways is rare, but some cellular genes co-vary in abundance with the amount of viral mRNA. Overall, our results highlight the complexity of viral infection at the level of single cells.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.32303.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>When viruses infect cells, they take over the cell’s machinery and use it to express their own genes. This process has mostly been studied by looking at the average outcome of infection when many viruses infect many cells. However, it is less clear what happens in individual cells. For example, does the virus take over every cell to make lots of viral gene products, or do some cells produce far more viral gene products than others?</p><p>Russell et al. have now used a new technique called single-cell RNA sequencing to look at how well influenza virus genes were expressed in hundreds of individual mammalian cells. The goal was to work out how the outcome of infection varied between different cells.</p><p>One way to quantify variability – also known as heterogeneity – is by using a statistical measure called the Gini coefficient. This statistic is often used to assess the inequality in incomes across a nation.In the hypothetical situation where everyone earned the same income, the Gini coefficient would equal zero; while if only one person had all the income and all others had none, the value would be very close to one. In reality, countries fall somewhere in between these two extremes. In the United States for instance, the Gini coefficient for income is 0.47. When Russell et al. worked out the Gini coefficient for the amount of viral genes expressed in different cells, the value was at least 0.64. This indicates that there is more unevenness in viral gene expression for influenza than there is income inequality in the United States.</p><p>So, what characterizes the “Bill Gates” cells and viruses that have the highest viral gene expression? Influenza viruses sometimes fail to express some of their genes. Russell et al. found that this failure often led to “poor” viruses that were less productive than “rich” viruses that expressed all the critical genes. However, the results suggest that there are also other factors that contribute a lot to the heterogeneity.</p><p>Real influenza virus infections are usually started by very few viruses, so this new understanding of the variability that occurs when individual viruses infect individual cells might prove important for understanding the properties of infections at larger scales too.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>single-cell RNAseq</kwd><kwd>influenza virus</kwd><kwd>defective particle</kwd><kwd>interferons</kwd><kwd>stochasiticity</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd><kwd>Virus</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000057</institution-id><institution>National Institute of General Medical Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01GM102198</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Bloom</surname><given-names>Jesse D</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000060</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>AI127897</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Bloom</surname><given-names>Jesse D</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100001021</institution-id><institution>Damon Runyon Cancer Research Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>DRG-2227-15</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Russell</surname><given-names>Alistair B</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000861</institution-id><institution>Burroughs Wellcome Fund</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Young Investigator in the Pathogenesis of Infectious Diseases</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Bloom</surname><given-names>Jesse D</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000893</institution-id><institution>Simons Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Faculty Scholar Award</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Bloom</surname><given-names>Jesse D</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000011</institution-id><institution>Howard Hughes Medical Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Faculty Scholar Award</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Bloom</surname><given-names>Jesse D</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund7"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100009633</institution-id><institution>Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>DP2OD020868</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Trapnell</surname><given-names>Cole</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund8"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>William Keck Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Keck Foundation Grant</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Trapnell</surname><given-names>Cole</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund9"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000879</institution-id><institution>Alfred P.

For instance, cells infected with influenza virus at high multiplicity of infection (MOI) express an <italic>average</italic> of 50,000 to 100,000 viral mRNAs per cell, corresponding to 5% to 25% of all cellular mRNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Hatada et al., 1989</xref>). Infection can also trigger innate-immune sensors that induce the expression of cellular anti-viral genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Killip et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Iwasaki and Pillai, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Crotta et al., 2013</xref>). This anti-viral response is another prominent transcriptional signature of high-MOI influenza virus infection in bulk cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Geiss et al., 2002</xref>).</p><p>However, initiation of an actual influenza infection typically involves just a few virions infecting a few cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib97">Varble et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Poon et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Sobel Leonard et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">McCrone et al., 2017</xref>). The dynamics of viral infection in these individual cells may not mirror bulk measurements made on many cells infected at high MOI. Over 70 years ago, Max Delbruck showed that there was a <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf1"><mml:mo>∼</mml:mo></mml:math></inline-formula>100-fold range in the number of progeny virions produced per cell by clonal bacteria infected with clonal bacteriophage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Delbrück, 1945</xref>). Subsequent work has shown similar heterogeneity during infection with other viruses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib105">Zhu et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Schulte and Andino, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Combe et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Akpinar et al., 2015</xref>), including influenza virus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Heldt et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>In the case of influenza virus infection, targeted measurements of specific proteins or RNAs have shed light on some factors that contribute to cell-to-cell heterogeneity. The influenza virus genome consists of eight negative-sense RNA segments, and many infected cells fail to express one more of these RNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Heldt et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Dou et al., 2017</xref>) or their encoded proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Brooke et al., 2013</xref>). In addition, activation of innate-immune responses is inherently stochastic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Shalek et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Shalek et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bhushal et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Hagai et al., 2017</xref>), and only some influenza-infected cells express anti-viral interferon genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Pérez-Cidoncha et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Killip et al., 2017</xref>). However, the extent of cell-to-cell variation in these and other host and viral factors remains unclear, as does the association among them in individual infected cells.</p><p>Here we use single-cell mRNA sequencing to quantify the levels of all cellular and viral mRNAs in cells infected with influenza virus at low MOI. We find extremely large variation in the amount of viral mRNA expressed in individual cells. Both co-infection and activation of innate-immune pathways are rare in our low-MOI infections, and do not appear to be the major drivers of cell-to-cell heterogeneity in viral transcriptional load. Individual infected cells often fail to express specific viral genes, and such gene absence explains some but certainly not all of the cell-to-cell heterogeneity. A variety of cellular genes, including ones involved in the oxidative-stress response, co-vary with viral transcriptional load. Overall, our work demonstrates remarkable heterogeneity in the transcriptional outcome of influenza virus infection among nominally identical cells infected with a relatively pure population of virions.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Strategy to measure mRNA in single virus-infected cells</title><p>We performed single-cell mRNA sequencing using a droplet-based system that physically isolates individual cells prior to reverse transcription (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib104">Zheng et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Macosko et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Klein et al., 2015</xref>). Each droplet contains primers with a unique <italic>cell barcode</italic> that tags all mRNAs from that droplet during reverse-transcription. Each primer also contains a <italic>unique molecular identifier (UMI)</italic> that is appended to each mRNA molecule during reverse transcription. The 3’ ends of the mRNAs are sequenced and mapped to the human and influenza virus transcriptomes to determine transcript identities. This information is combined with that provided by the UMIs and cell barcodes to quantify the number of molecules of each mRNA species that have been captured for each cell.</p><p>Infected cells will express viral as well as cellular mRNAs – however the cell barcodes and UMIs cannot distinguish whether a cell was initially infected by one or multiple viral particles.

It is therefore important to establish a threshold for identifying truly infected cells. We can do this by taking advantage of the fact that roughly half the infecting virions bear synonymous barcodes. Reads derived from lysed cells will be drawn from both wild-type and synonymously barcoded viral transcripts. However, most cells are infected by at most one virion, and so the reads from truly infected cells will usually derive almost entirely from one of the two viral variants. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref> shows the fraction of viral reads in individual cells from each viral variant, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref> indicates the fraction of viral reads from the most abundant variant in that cell. Most cells with large amounts of viral mRNA have viral transcripts exclusively derived from one viral variant – indicating non-random partitioning as expected from viral infection. However, cells with a small amount of viral mRNA often have viral transcripts from both variants, as expected from the random partitioning associated with simple mRNA leakage. Finally, a few cells with large amounts of viral mRNA have viral transcripts from both variants, likely reflecting co-infection.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig4" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.32303.009</object-id><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><title>Synonymous barcodes on the viral mRNAs distinguish true infections from cells that contain viral mRNAs derived from leakage of lysed cells.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Cells with at least two viral mRNAs for which the barcode could be called, arranged in order of increasing influenza transcript counts.

These annotation thresholds are conservative, and may miss some true low-level infections. However, it is important that the analyses below are restricted to cells that are truly infected with virus, so we accepted the possible loss of some low-level infections in order to avoid false positives. In addition, the synonymous viral barcodes only identify co-infections by viruses with different barcodes – since the barcodes are at roughly equal proportion, we expect to miss about half of the co-infections. Since we annotate about <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf14"><mml:mo>∼</mml:mo></mml:math></inline-formula>10% of the infected cells as co-infected by viruses with different barcodes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>), we expect another <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf15"><mml:mo>∼</mml:mo></mml:math></inline-formula>10% of the infected cells to also be co-infected but not annotated as so by our approach.

The fraction of viral mRNA per infected cell follows a roughly exponential distribution, with many cells having few viral transcripts and a few cells having many.

One way to quantify the heterogeneity of a distribution is to calculate the Gini coefficient (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Gini, 1921</xref>), which ranges from 0 for a completely uniform distribution, to one for a maximally skewed distribution. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4—figure supplement 3</xref> shows the Gini coefficients for the distribution of viral mRNA across infected cells for each sample. The Gini coefficients are <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf18"><mml:mo>≥</mml:mo></mml:math></inline-formula>0.64 for all samples. As a fun point of comparison, these Gini coefficients indicate that the distribution of viral mRNA across infected cells is more uneven than the distribution of income in the United States (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Alvaredo, 2011</xref>).</p><p>One possible source of heterogeneity in the amount of viral mRNA per cell is variability in the timing of infection. If some cells are infected earlier in the experiment than others, then they might have substantially more viral mRNA. However, several lines of evidence indicate that this is not the major cause of heterogeneity across cells. First, the sample for which the infection inoculum was never removed (8 hr-2) only shows slightly more heterogeneity than samples for which the inoculum was washed away after one hour (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4—figure supplement 3</xref>), despite the fact that the potential time window for infection is much longer in the former sample. Second, in an independent experiment, we performed completely synchronized infections by pre-binding virus to cells on ice and then washing away unbound virus before bringing the cells to 37<inline-formula><mml:math id="inf19"><mml:msup><mml:mi/><mml:mo>∘</mml:mo></mml:msup></mml:math></inline-formula>C (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Dapat et al., 2014</xref>). As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s4">Figure 4—figure supplement 4</xref>, flow cytometry staining found that the heterogeneity in the levels of individual viral proteins was not markedly different for these synchronized infections than in the absence of pre-binding and washing. Finally, viral mRNA expression from the secondary spread of virus from infected cells does not appreciably occur during the timeframes of our experiments, since <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref> does not show the pervasive presence of mixed barcodes that would occur in this case. Therefore, variability in the timing of infection is not the dominant cause of the cell-to-cell heterogeneity in our experiments.</p><p>Notably, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref> shows that there are co-infected cells with both low and high amounts of viral mRNA, suggesting that the initial infectious dose does not drive a simple continuous increase in viral transcript production. In support of this view, we used flow cytometry to quantify the levels of individual viral proteins in cells infected at various MOIs or for which we could delineate co-infection status (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s5">Figure 4—figure supplement 5</xref>). This analysis shows that sub-populations of cells that express similarly low and high levels of viral proteins persist across a wide range of infectious doses, although co-infection can influence the relative proportion of infected cells that fall into these sub-populations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s5">Figure 4—figure supplement 5</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Absence of viral genes partially explains cell-to-cell variability in viral load</title><p>The influenza genome is segmented, and cells can fail to express a viral mRNA if the encoding gene segment is not packaged in the infecting virion or fails to initiate transcription after infection. Indeed, several groups have reported that the majority of infected cells fail to express at least one viral gene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Brooke et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Heldt et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Dou et al., 2017</xref>). We wondered if the absence of specific viral genes might be associated with reduced amounts of viral mRNA within single infected cells. In particular, transcription of influenza virus mRNAs is performed by the viral ribonucleoprotein (RNP) complex, which consists of the three proteins that encode the tripartite polymerase (PB2, PB1, and PA) as well as nucleoprotein (NP) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Huang et al., 1990</xref>). Each viral gene segment is associated with one RNP in incoming infecting virions, but secondary transcription by newly synthesized RNPs requires the presence of the viral genes encoding each of the four RNP proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib100">Vreede et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Eisfeld et al., 2015</xref>). This secondary transcription is a major source of viral mRNAs, as evidenced by the fact that blocking synthesis of the RNP proteins reduces the amount of viral mRNA by several orders of magnitude in bulk cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>).</p><p>We examined the total amount of viral mRNA versus the expression of the genes from each viral segment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s3">Figure 5—figure supplement 3</xref>). Note that influenza virus expresses ten major gene transcripts from its eight gene segments, as the M and NS segments are alternatively spliced to produce the M1/M2 and NS1/NEP transcript, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Dubois et al., 2014</xref>). However, an inherent limitation of current established single-cell mRNA sequencing techniques is that they only sequence the 3’ end of the transcript (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib104">Zheng et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Macosko et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Klein et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Cao et al., 2017</xref>).

However, we observe cells that lack each of the other non-RNP genes but still derive <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf25"><mml:mo>≈</mml:mo></mml:math></inline-formula>40% of their mRNAs from virus, suggesting that none of the other genes are important for high levels of viral transcription. These results are statistically supported by <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>, which shows that absence of any RNP gene but <italic>not</italic> any other viral gene is associated with reduced amounts of viral mRNA. However, gene absence clearly does not explain all of the variability in viral gene expression, since even cells expressing all viral genes exhibit a very wide distribution in the amount of viral mRNA that they express. Specifically, at both 8 and 10 hr, the amount of viral mRNA in individual cells expressing all eight viral genes still ranges from <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf26"><mml:mo>&lt;</mml:mo></mml:math></inline-formula>1% to <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf27"><mml:mo>&gt;</mml:mo></mml:math></inline-formula>50% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s3">Figure 5—figure supplement 3</xref>). Furthermore, the actual distribution of viral mRNA per infected cell (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>) does not match the mostly bi-modal shape expected under a simple model where RNP gene absence and Poisson co-infection are the only factors (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig5sdata2">Figure 5—source data 2</xref>), indicating that there are additional sources of variability beyond whether cells have full complement of RNP genes.</p><p>We also quantified the fraction of infected cells that completely failed to express a given gene. We limited this analysis to examining the presence/absence of the non-RNP genes in cells expressing all four RNP genes, since we might fail to detect viral transcripts that are actually present at low levels in RNP-deficient cells due to the lower viral burden in these cells. At the 8- and 10 hr time points, between 5% and 17% of cells fail to express any one of the four non-RNP genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig5sdata1">Figure 5—source data 1</xref>). The absence of a given gene appears to be an independent event, as the probability of observing all four non-RNP genes in a cell is well predicted by simply multiplying the probabilities of observing each gene individually (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig5sdata1">Figure 5—source data 1</xref>). If we extrapolate the frequencies at which cells lack non-RNP genes to the RNP genes, then we would predict that 35–50% of infected cells express mRNAs from all eight genes. This estimate of the frequency at which infected cells express mRNAs from all eight gene segments is slightly higher than previous estimates of 13% (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Brooke et al., 2013</xref>) and 20% (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Dou et al., 2017</xref>). At least one difference is that Brooke et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Brooke et al., 2013</xref>) stained for proteins whereas we examined the expression of mRNAs – it is likely that some cells contain mutated viral genes that fail to produce stable protein even when mRNA is expressed.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>The relative amounts of different viral mRNAs are more consistent across cells</title><p>The results above show that the amount of viral mRNA in infected cells varies over several orders of magnitude.

To address this question, we focused on cells that derived <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf28"><mml:mo>&gt;</mml:mo></mml:math></inline-formula>5% of their mRNA from virus, since estimates of relative viral gene expression will be less noisy in cells with more viral mRNAs.</p><p>In contrast to the extreme variability in the total viral mRNA per cell, the fraction of this viral mRNA derived from each gene is much more consistent across cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>).

The relative levels of each viral mRNA in our cells are similar to prior bulk measurements made by Northern blots (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Hatada et al., 1989</xref>), which also found an expression hierarchy of M <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf29"><mml:mo>&gt;</mml:mo></mml:math></inline-formula> NS <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf30"><mml:mo>≫</mml:mo></mml:math></inline-formula> NP <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf31"><mml:mo>&gt;</mml:mo></mml:math></inline-formula> NA <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf32"><mml:mo>&gt;</mml:mo></mml:math></inline-formula> HA <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf33"><mml:mo>≫</mml:mo></mml:math></inline-formula> PB2 <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf34"><mml:mo>∼</mml:mo></mml:math></inline-formula> PB1 <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf35"><mml:mo>∼</mml:mo></mml:math></inline-formula> PA. The cell-to-cell consistency in the relative expression of different viral genes is even tighter if we limit the analysis only to cells that express all eight viral genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>). Therefore, with the exception of complete gene absence, the factors that drive the dramatic cell-to-cell variability in the amount of viral mRNA have roughly similar effects on all viral genes in a given cell.

(2010)</xref> report as having been identified multiple times in genome-wide screens for factors affecting influenza virus replication. One possible explanation is that most of the cell-to-cell heterogeneity in our experiments might arise from viral segment absence or mutations, pure stochasticity, or more subtle alterations in host-cell state – not due to changes in expression of the type of single large-effect genes that are usually identified in genome-wide knockdown/knockout studies.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>We have quantified the total transcriptome composition of single cells infected with influenza virus. While we observe a general increase in the amount of viral mRNA over time as expected from bulk measurements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Hatada et al., 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Shapiro et al., 1987</xref>), there is wide variation in viral gene expression among individual infected cells.</p><p>The most obvious form of heterogeneity is the complete failure of some infected cells to express one or more viral genes, which we estimate occurs in about half the infected cells in our experiments. The absence of some viral genes in some infected cells has been noted previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Brooke et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Heldt et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Dou et al., 2017</xref>), and our work provides a holistic view by quantifying the total viral transcriptional load as a function of the level of each mRNA. We find that cells lacking expression of any of the four genes that encode the viral RNP express much less total viral mRNA, consistent with prior bulk studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib100">Vreede et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Eisfeld et al., 2015</xref>). Interestingly, the <italic>reason</italic> some cells fail to express some viral genes remains unclear. The prototypical influenza virion packages one copy of each of the eight gene segments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Noda et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Hutchinson et al., 2010</xref>), but some virions surely package fewer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Brooke et al., 2014</xref>). However, it is also possible that much of the viral gene absence is due to stochastic loss of viral RNPs after infection but prior to the initiation of viral transcription in the nucleus.</p><p>The absence of viral genes only partially explains the cell-to-cell variation in amount of viral mRNA, which still varies from <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf41"><mml:mo>&lt;</mml:mo></mml:math></inline-formula>1% to <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf42"><mml:mo>&gt;</mml:mo></mml:math></inline-formula>50% among cells expressing all the viral genes. It is likely that other viral genetic factors explain some of this remaining heterogeneity. The 3’-end sequencing strategy used in our experiments detects the presence of a viral gene, but does not identify whether that gene contains a mutation that might hinder viral replication. However, viral mutations are also unlikely to explain all the observed heterogeneity, since current consensus estimates of influenza virus’s mutation rate suggest that the typical virion in a stock such as the one used in our experiment should contain less than one mutation per genome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Parvin et al., 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Suárez et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Suárez-López and Ortín, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Nobusawa and Sato, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bloom, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Pauly et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>The rest of the heterogeneity must be due to some combination of cellular factors and inherent stochasticity. Some features of the cellular transcriptome co-vary with the amount of influenza mRNA. In particular, the viral load in individual cells is associated with the expression of genes involved in response to cellular stresses, including oxidative stress. It will be interesting to determine if these cellular transcriptional signatures are simply a consequence of the stress imposed by viral replication, or if their stronger activation in some cells is a causative factor that promotes viral transcription. However, it also would not be surprising if a substantial amount of the cell-to-cell heterogeneity cannot be ascribed to pre-existing features of either the viral genome or cellular state. Apparently stochastic heterogeneity is a common feature of many processes at a single-cell level (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Cai et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Raj et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Buganim et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Shalek et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Avraham et al., 2015</xref>) – especially when those processes are initiated by very small numbers of initial molecules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Elowitz et al., 2002</xref>), as is the case for low-MOI viral infection.</p><p>Our data do suggest that the factors driving the heterogeneity in viral transcriptional load exert relatively concordant effects on all viral genes in a given cell. Specifically, despite the extreme heterogeneity in total viral mRNA per cell, the relative levels of the viral mRNAs are reasonably consistent across cells, and generally reflective of classical bulk measurements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Hatada et al., 1989</xref>). Therefore, despite the stochasticity inherent in initiating transcription and replication of each gene from a single copy carried by the incoming virion, as long as a gene is not completely lost then the virus possesses mechanisms to control its relative expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Shapiro et al., 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Hatada et al., 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Perez et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Heldt et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Chua et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>One factor that surprisingly does <italic>not</italic> appreciably contribute to the heterogeneity in our experiments is activation of innate-immune interferon pathways. Only one of the hundreds of virus-infected cells expresses any detectable interferon, despite the fact that a number of cells fail to express the influenza-virus interferon antagonist NS1. It is known that interferon activation is stochastic at the level of single cells in response to both synthetic ligands (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Shalek et al., 2013</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Shalek et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bhushal et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Hagai et al., 2017</xref>) and actual infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Rand et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Pérez-Cidoncha et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Avraham et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Killip et al., 2017</xref>). But interferon expression is a prominent transcriptional signature of high-MOI influenza virus infection of bulk cells, including in the epithelial cell line and at the time-points used in our experiments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Geiss et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Sutejo et al., 2012</xref>). So it is notable how rarely single cells express interferon. Interferon expression would surely be more common at later times or with a viral stock passaged at higher MOI, since paracrine interferon signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Crotta et al., 2013</xref>) and accumulation of defective viral particles enhance innate-immune detection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Tapia et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">López, 2014</xref>). However, the early events of physiological influenza infection involve just a few virions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib97">Varble et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">McCrone et al., 2017</xref>), and so it is interesting to speculate whether rare events such as interferon activation during the first few cycles of viral replication could contribute to heterogeneity in the eventual outcome of infection.</p><p>Overall, our work shows the power and importance of characterizing cellular infection at the level of single cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Avraham et al., 2015</xref>). Viral infection can involve heterogeneity in the genetic composition of the incoming virion, the host-cell state, the bi-modality of innate-immune activation, and the inherent stochasticity of molecular processes initiated by a single copy of each viral gene. In our experiments with short-timeframe and low-MOI infections with a relatively pure stock of influenza virus, we find only a minor role for innate-immune activation, but a substantial role for heterogeneity in the complement of viral genes that are expressed in individual cells and at least some contribution of host-cell state. Our current experiments are not able to quantify the role of other possibly important factors such as mutations in viral genes, but we suspect that they may also contribute. Future extensions of the approaches described here should enable further deconstruction of the sources of cell-to-cell heterogeneity during viral infection, thereby enabling a deeper understanding of how the bulk features of infection emerge from processes within individual virus-infected cells.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Cell lines and viruses</title><p>The following cell lines were used in this study: the human lung epithelial carcinoma line A549 (ATCC CCL-185), the MDCK-SIAT1 variant of the Madin Darby canine kidney cell line overexpressing human SIAT1 (Sigma-Aldrich 05071502), and the human embryonic kidney cell line 293T (ATCC CRL-3216).

Wild-type and synonymously barcoded virus were mixed to an estimated ratio of 1:1 based on prior, exploratory, single-cell analyses (data not shown). At the initiation of our experiment, the wells for all time points were changed from D10 to influenza growth media. Cells were then infected with 0.3 HA-expressing units of virus per cell (as determined by flow cytometry). The infections were performed in order of time point: first the 10 hr time point, then the 8 hr, and then the 6 hr time point. At one hour after infection, the media for each time point was changed to fresh influenza growth media. Note that the HA-expressing units were calculated without this additional washing step, and so likely represent an overestimate of our final infectious dose (consistent with the fact that fewer than 30% of cells appear infected in the single-cell sequencing data). All cells were then harvested for single-cell analysis concurrently – ensuring all had spent equivalent time in changed media .

We then determined the threshold fraction of viral mRNA at which the mean purity no longer increased as a function of the amount of viral mRNA.

As is apparent from <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>, only the 10 hr sample and the 8 hr-2 sample have the excess of mixed barcodes among cells with low amounts of viral mRNA. The likely reason is that these samples have more total viral mRNA (and so there is more available mRNA to be acquired from lysed cells); in addition, there is always some experimental variability in the amount of cell lysis during the 10X sequencing process, and these samples may simply have the most. So the above threshold procedure is appropriate for those two samples.

This procedure is expected to be conservative, and may miss some truly infected cells with very low amounts of viral mRNA. For subsequent analyses, we retained all infected cells and a subsample of uninfected cells (the greater of 50 or the number of infected cells for that sample). The rationale for subsampling the uninfected cell is that the vast majority of cells are uninfected, and we did not want these cells to completely dominate the downstream analyses. Cells were classified as co-infected if both viral variants had an RNA level that exceeded the threshold, and if the minor variant contributed at least 5% of the viral mRNA.</p><p>For the semi-supervised t-SNE clustering, we used Monocle’s cell hierarchy function to bin cells into those with no viral mRNA, <bold>&lt;</bold>2% viral mRNA, between 2% and 20% viral mRNA, and <bold>&gt;</bold>20%.

We also only considered cellular genes in the differential gene analysis, since viral gene expression will tautologically co-vary with the amount of viral mRNA. Additionally, because influenza virus has the capacity to degrade or prevent the synthesis of host mRNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bercovich-Kinori et al., 2016</xref>) and contributes significantly to the total number UMIs in some cells, we calculate size factors (a scalar value representing efficiency of UMI capture) based on cellular transcripts alone. Finally, we assigned all cells a ceiling fraction of mRNA from virus of 25% so that a few extremely high-expressing cells did not dominate. Cellular genes with expression that co-varied with the fraction of viral mRNAs in a cell were then determined using the Monocle differentialGeneTest, after removing variance explained by sample to sample variation. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref> shows all genes that were significantly associated with the fraction of mRNA from virus at a false discovery rate of 0.1.

Your article has been reviewed by two peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Arup Chakraborty as the Senior Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>Your manuscript describes the use of a novel single cell RNAseq method to examine heterogeneity in viral mRNA production within single cells infected with single influenza A virions. You report that viral mRNA levels, as a proportion of total cellular mRNA, can vary significantly between infected cells, and this variability cannot be simply explained by the activity of innate anti-viral defenses. Further, correlating the levels of specific host transcripts with viral transcript levels allows you to identify pathways that tend to correlate with viral levels.</p><p>The strengths of the paper include the description of a novel method for leveraging single cell cRNAseq to quantify heterogeneity and stochasticity in viral gene expression during infection. This is a really important question for the field, and the approaches detailed here will likely by adopted by other groups studying other viruses. The authors do a good job of accounting for many of the pitfalls inherent in the experimental execution and data analysis. The manuscript is well written, and does an especially effective job of visually presenting complex datasets.</p><p>The main shortcoming of the paper is that it provides very little in the way of new information. As the authors clearly and honestly point out, most of the findings in this paper are simply confirming observations made in older papers. Additionally, the findings are purely descriptive, and provide little insight into the mechanisms that may give rise to the observations.</p><p>We believe that addressing the points below would help ameliorate some of the shortcomings of the paper.</p><p>Major comments:</p><p>1) There are some obvious sources of variability that haven't been suitably discussed.</p><p>- The first is variation in the timing of the early stages of infection. No steps appear to have been taken to synchronize infection, or to limit secondary spread of the virus within the cultures. Could heterogeneity in the timing of binding/entry/fusion/trafficking explain a lot of the variation observed?</p><p>- Another potential contributor is the cell cycle status of the infected cells. Did the host transcript data shed light on whether cell cycle status influenced viral transcription levels? This is especially important to address given that some of the genes showing association with the viral burden are cell-cycle related.</p><p>- In assessing to what extent lack of RNP expression accounts for the viral mRNA expression variability (subsection “Absence of viral genes partially explains cell-to-cell variability in viral load”, second paragraph), we think it is important to take into account potential extracellular contamination. Specifically, it would be more convincing if the analysis omitted cells with mixed wildtype/synonymous clones.</p><p>- As the variability of the viral RNA load appears to be the central result of the manuscript, it would be useful to:a) Employ a statistic to quantify the variability (e.g. entropy or Gini index);b) Use simple models to illustrate how much variability can be accounted for by simple effects, such as expected Poisson co-infection frequency, or the likelihood of attaining full complement of RNP genes.</p><p>2) While the silent tagging method used to address co-infection is clever and appreciated, the issue is not fully settled. The dismissal of co-infection as a factor influencing cell-to-cell variation in the last paragraph of the subsection “Single cells show an extremely wide range of expression of viral mRNA”, is based on too few cells to draw any conclusions, and thus needs to be tempered. Also, there is likely to be a significant amount of cryptic co-infection with identical barcode viruses (expected to be similar to that of mixed barcodes, ~10%) that could influence measured heterogeneity. These points should be made in the text.</p><p>3) The analysis of host cell transcripts positively or negatively associated with high viral mRNA expression is pretty minimal. Do the host genes identified here match up with the results of previous studies that screened for host pro- and anti-viral factors (reviewed in Watanabe et al., 2010)? Also, targeted gene knockdown or over-expression experiments could help establish the causality underlying these relationships.</p><p>4) All analysis of viral gene expression seems to be at the segment level. How do different transcripts expressed from the same gene segment compare (i.e. NS1 and NEP)?</p><p>5) The determination of the minimum required influenza fraction (Figure 4) is based on sound logic; however, we are concerned that the observed results do not fully align with this model. Specifically, while the 10hr experiment looks reasonable, the distributions of wildtype/synonymous mixed cells in other experiments do not appear to show the same trend (most notable for 6hr and 8hr samples, where almost no mixed cells are observed at low fractions). In that regard, using the 10hr dataset to estimate thresholds for all of the other samples does not seem appropriate.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.32303.045</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Summary:</p><p>[…] The main shortcoming of the paper is that it provides very little in the way of new information.

Thank you for recognizing the power of the approach and our efforts to fully describe the pitfalls and effectively present the complex datasets.</p><p>As you note, our approach does not uncover any truly new biological phenomenon, and (as you also note) we honestly describe how our results end up mostly confirming older observations made using more indirect methods. However, there is substantial value to explicitly observing these processes in single cells, even if the findings are mostly in line with existing circumstantial evidence from bulk studies or less comprehensive single-cell approaches (e.g., flow cytometry). Also, the extremeness of the heterogeneity across cells is surprising even in light of all that was previously known.</p><p>We have revised our manuscript in response to the many helpful suggestions from the reviewers. As you will see, we have addressed all the major questions and suggestions.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Major comments:</p><p>1) There are some obvious sources of variability that haven't been suitably discussed.</p><p>- The first is variation in the timing of the early stages of infection. No steps appear to have been taken to synchronize infection, or to limit secondary spread of the virus within the cultures. Could heterogeneity in the timing of binding/entry/fusion/trafficking explain a lot of the variation observed?</p></disp-quote><p>This is an important point. We did not synchronize infection, although for our 8-hour samples, we washed the cells one hour after infection for one sample (8hr) but not the other (8hr-2) in order to evaluate the importance of infection timing. The heterogeneity was similar between these two samples, as demonstrated by the new quantification method (Gini coefficients) suggested by the reviewers in a later comment.</p><p>We have also performed new experiments where we synchronized infection by pre-binding virus on ice, washing it away, and then raising the temperature. Analysis of this experiment by flow cytometry staining is in the new Figure 4—figure supplement 4, and shows that these synchronized infections look similar to ones that are neither synchronized nor washed.</p><p>Finally, the barcoded viruses (Figure 4B) provide strong evidence against secondary infection, since secondary infection would tend to lead to mixed-barcode cells because there would be many of progeny viruses of both barcodes.</p><p>In addition to adding Figure 4—figure supplement 4, we have added the following text related to this point:</p><p>“One possible source of heterogeneity in the amount of viral mRNA per cell is</p><p>variability in the timing of infection. […] Therefore, variability in the timing of infection is not the dominant cause of the cell-to-cell heterogeneity in our experiments.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>- Another potential contributor is the cell cycle status of the infected cells. Did the host transcript data shed light on whether cell cycle status influenced viral transcription levels? This is especially important to address given that some of the genes showing association with the viral burden are cell-cycle related.</p></disp-quote><p>We have expanded the analysis to specifically look at cell-cycle related genes. A geneset analysis (Figure 9—source data 2) finds that the G2-M cell-cycle checkpoint is associated with viral mRNA, with the expression of genes in this pathway typically expressed at lower levels in cells with more viral mRNA. This analysis is now discussed in the second-to-last paragraph of the Results.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>- In assessing to what extent lack of RNP expression accounts for the viral mRNA expression variability (subsection “Absence of viral genes partially explains cell-to-cell variability in viral load”, second paragraph), we think it is important to take into account potential extracellular contamination. Specifically, it would be more convincing if the analysis omitted cells with mixed wildtype/synonymous clones.</p></disp-quote><p>This is a good suggestion. We have re-performed the analyses omitting the co-infected cells with mixed viral barcodes. These new analyses are in Figure 5—figure supplement 3 and Figure 5—figure supplement 5. The results remain essentially unchanged from the ones analyzing the full set of cells that are shown in main panels of Figure 5A, B.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>- As the variability of the viral RNA load appears to be the central result of the manuscript, it would be useful to:a) Employ a statistic to quantify the variability (e.g. entropy or Gini index);b) Use simple models to illustrate how much variability can be accounted for by simple effects, such as expected Poisson co-infection frequency, or the likelihood of attaining full complement of RNP genes.</p></disp-quote><p>The idea of quantifying the variability in viral mRNA across infected cells is a good one. We have done this using the Gini coefficient. The results are in Figure 4—figure supplement 3, and are referred to in the text related to that figure. As a fun point of comparison, the Gini coefficients for the variability of viral mRNA across cells (≥0.64 for all samples) exceed the Gini coefficient for the unevenness of income distribution in the United States.</p><p>We have also simulated the expected distribution under a simple model where the heterogeneity is due only to Poisson co-infection and whether or not a cell has the full complement of RNP genes. This simulation and its results are in Figure 5—source data 2. The simulation gives a Gini coefficient as large as the actual one, but the shape of the simulated distribution is essentially bimodal, whereas the actual distribution is much more continuous and broad. Therefore, there are also other sources of heterogeneity that broaden the distribution beyond what is due only to RNP presence / absence and co-infection.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) While the silent tagging method used to address co-infection is clever and appreciated, the issue is not fully settled. The dismissal of co-infection as a factor influencing cell-to-cell variation in the last paragraph of the subsection “Single cells show an extremely wide range of expression of viral mRNA”, is based on too few cells to draw any conclusions, and thus needs to be tempered. Also, there is likely to be a significant amount of cryptic co-infection with identical barcode viruses (expected to be similar to that of mixed barcodes, ~10%) that could influence measured heterogeneity. These points should be made in the text.</p></disp-quote><p>These are very good points. We have added the following text that clearly draws out the fact that our approach will only identify half the co-infections:</p><p>“In addition, the synonymous viral barcodes only identify co-infections by viruses with different barcodes – since the barcodes are at roughly equal proportion, we expect to miss about half of the co-infections. Since we annotate about ∼10% of the infected cells as co-infected by viruses with different barcodes (Figure 4D), we expect another ∼10% of the infected cells to also be co-infected but not annotated as so by our approach.”</p><p>The reviewers are correct that our statement about the role of co-infection in influencing cell-to-cell variation was too strong. We have clarified this statement. We have also added a figure supplement (Figure 4—figure supplement 5) which uses an independent method (flow cytometry staining of individual viral proteins) to support the fact that even at high infectious dose both low- and high-producing cells remain, although their relative proportions change. This figure supplement also supports our clarified statement that viral mRNA (or protein) production is not a simple continuous function of infectious dose, but is also affected by other sources of heterogeneity. The new text reads:</p><p>“Notably, Figure 4E shows that there are co-infected cells with both low and high amounts of viral mRNA, suggesting that the initial infectious dose does not drive a simple continuous increase in viral transcript production. […] This analysis shows that sub-populations of cells that express similarly low and high levels of viral proteins persist across a wide range of infectious doses, although co-infection can influence the relative proportion of infected cells that fall into these subpopulations (Figure 4—figure supplement 5).”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) The analysis of host cell transcripts positively or negatively associated with high viral mRNA expression is pretty minimal. Do the host genes identified here match up with the results of previous studies that screened for host pro- and anti-viral factors (reviewed in Watanabe et al., 2010)? Also, targeted gene knockdown or over-expression experiments could help establish the causality underlying these relationships.</p></disp-quote><p>We have substantially expanded the last section of the Results that focuses on cellular gene expression. We call out the gene-set enrichments, which show that genes involved in oxidative stress responses are at higher levels in cells with more viral mRNA. The possible pro-viral role of transient oxidative stress has been reported before, and we have performed new experiments (Figure 9—figure supplement 2) that directly support the idea that it is pro-viral. These new experiments therefore suggest causality for one of the host-cell factors that we identify.</p><p>We also compare the genes that we find significantly associated with viral mRNA to the 128 genes highlighted by Watanabe et al. (2010) as having been found multiple times in genomewide studies. There is no overlap. This fact is discussed in the last paragraph of the Results. We theorize that this is because most of the cell-to-cell heterogeneity during infection of “normal” (e.g., not genetically perturbed) cells is <italic>not</italic> due to changes in expression of the type of large-effect genes that are typically identified in genome-wide screens. Rather, our results would seem to suggest that a substantial amount of the heterogeneity is due to viral / stochastic factors (e.g., failure to express certain viral genes), or perhaps more subtle changes in cellular state such as transient oxidative stress.</p><p>Importantly, we do <italic>not</italic> believe that the main value of our approach is as a method to identify pro- or anti-viral genes. Our goal is to figure out the actual extent and sources of cell-to-cell heterogeneity, which may not be due to primarily alterations in the expression level of single host genes with large effects.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) All analysis of viral gene expression seems to be at the segment level. How do different transcripts expressed from the same gene segment compare (i.e. NS1 and NEP)?</p></disp-quote><p>This is an important point that we failed to adequately discuss in the original manuscript. As the reviews note, two of the influenza transcripts (M1 / M2 and NS1 / NS2) are generated from alternative splicing of gene segments. However, each pair of these transcripts share the same 3’ end. Most current single-cell mRNA sequencing strategies, including the 10X platform that we use, can only sequence the 3’ end of the transcript. The reason is that the cell barcode is appended to this end, and so Illumina sequencing can only extend to regions proximal to the 3’ end if they are still to capture the barcode (as is required for single-cell mRNA sequencing). Therefore, these techniques cannot accurately identify alternative splicing – this is simply an inherent limitation of the current techniques. We now clearly explain this fact in the following added text:</p><p>“Note that influenza virus expresses ten major gene transcripts from its eight gene segments, as the M and NS segments are alternatively spliced to produce the M1 / M2 and NS1 / NEP transcript, respectively (Dubois et al., 2014). However, an inherent limitation of current established single-cell mRNA sequencing techniques is that they only sequence the 3’ end of the transcript (Zheng et al., 2017; Macosko et al., 2015; Klein et al., 2015; Cao et al., 2017). Since the alternative spliceoforms M1 / M2 and NS1 / NEP share the same 3’ ends, we cannot distinguish them and therefore will refer simply to the combined counts of transcripts from each of these alternatively spliced segments as the M and NS genes.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) The determination of the minimum required influenza fraction (Figure 4) is based on sound logic; however, we are concerned that the observed results do not fully align with this model. Specifically, while the 10hr experiment looks reasonable, the distributions of wildtype/synonymous mixed cells in other experiments do not appear to show the same trend (most notable for 6hr and 8hr samples, where almost no mixed cells are observed at low fractions). In that regard, using the 10hr dataset to estimate thresholds for all of the other samples does not seem appropriate.</p></disp-quote><p>This is a good point. We now use the procedure in Figure 4C to call thresholds <italic>separately</italic> for each sample as the reviewers suggest. The sample-specific calling is shown in Figure 4—figure supplement 3. These new thresholds lead to a modest increase in the number of cells called as virally infected for the earlier timepoint samples. These newly called cells therefore slightly shift the quantitative values in all subsequent analyses, although the changes are very small and all results remain unchanged.</p><p>The reason that the earlier timepoints have less mixed barcodes is because these earlier samples have much less total viral mRNA – and when there is less viral mRNA in total, there is also less available to be acquired from lysed cells.</p></body></sub-article></article>
