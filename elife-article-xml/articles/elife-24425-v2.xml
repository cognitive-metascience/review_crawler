In this study, we found that cyclophilin A (CypA), a peptidyl-prolyl <italic>cis/trans</italic> isomerase, functioned as a critical positive regulator of RIG-I-mediated antiviral immune responses. Deficiency of CypA impaired RIG-I-mediated type I IFN production and promoted viral replication in human cells and mice. Upon Sendai virus infection, CypA increased the interaction between RIG-I and its E3 ubiquitin ligase TRIM25, leading to enhanced TRIM25-mediated K63-linked ubiquitination of RIG-I that facilitated recruitment of RIG-I to MAVS. In addition, CypA and TRIM25 competitively interacted with MAVS, thereby inhibiting TRIM25-induced K48-linked ubiquitination of MAVS. Taken together, our findings reveal an essential role of CypA in boosting RIG-I-mediated antiviral immune responses by controlling the ubiquitination of RIG-I and MAVS.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.24425.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.24425.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.24425.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>In mammals, an enzyme called Cyclophilin A (CypA) is found in almost all tissues and plays important roles in many biological processes including the production of proteins and inflammation.

Among these PRRs, RIG-I like receptors (RLRs) function as cytoplasmic RNA sensors that recognize viral RNA and activate a signaling pathway, which is essential for the production of type I interferons (IFNs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Kato et al., 2011</xref>). RIG-I is required for type I IFN production in response to Sendai virus (SeV), Newcastle disease virus (NDV), influenza A virus (IAV), vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV), and Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Goubau et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Kato et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Loo et al., 2008</xref>). Following ligand binding, ubiquitinated RIG-I is recruited to the mitochondria-associated membrane where it binds to MAVS (also known as IPS-1, Cardif, and VISA) to initiate innate immune signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Hou et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Kawai et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Meylan et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Seth et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Xu et al., 2005</xref>).</p><p>Cyclophilin A (CypA, encoded by <italic>PPIA</italic>) is a peptidyl-prolyl <italic>cis/trans</italic> isomerase (PPIase) that is expressed ubiquitously in all type of cells. It is the major cellular target for the immunosuppressive drug cyclosporin A (CsA) and is involved in protein folding, cell signaling, inflammation, and tumorigenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Handschumacher et al., 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30"><bold><italic>Lu et al., 2007</italic></bold></xref>). Moreover, CypA functions as an important host factor that regulates the replication of a number of viruses, including human immunodeficiency virus type I (HIV-1), hepatitis C virus (HCV), human papillomavirus (HPV), IAV, rotavirus (RV), enterovirus-71 (EV71) virus, and infectious bursal disease virus (IBDV), which expands the role of CypA in virus infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bienkowska-Haba et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Chatterji et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Towers et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">He et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Liu et al., 2012b</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Qing et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Wang et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Xu et al., 2010</xref>). It has been established that CypA interacts directly with viral protein to regulate virus replication. For example, our previous studies showed that CypA-overexpressing transgenic mice exhibited resistance to influenza A virus infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Li et al., 2016</xref>). We further found that CypA interacted with influenza A virus M1 protein and inhibited virus replication by accelerating ubiquitin-proteasome degradation of the M1 protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Liu et al., 2012b</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47"><bold><italic>Xu et al., 2010</italic></bold></xref>). Yet several lines of evidence indicate that CypA can also regulate virus replication through modulating host immune responses. For instance, CypA interacted with the newly synthesized HIV-1 CA domain and subsequently activated the transcription factor IRF3 to promote the production of type I IFNs in dendritic cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Manel et al., 2010</xref>). CypA inhibited RV replication by facilitating IFN-β production (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">He et al., 2012</xref>). However, the molecular mechanism of how CypA regulates virus-mediated type I IFN production is poorly understood.</p><p>The present study indicates that CypA promotes RIG-I mediated type I IFN production and inhibits viral replication both <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic>. We further demonstrate that CypA facilitates IFN responses through promoting K63-linked ubiquitination of RIG-I and inhibiting K48-linked ubiquitination of MAVS. Therefore, our studies identify a previously unknown mechanism that CypA promotes RIG-I-mediated type I IFN production to suppress virus replication, which adds up a new facet of CypA in host antiviral immunity.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>CypA inhibits virus replication by enhancing type I IFN production</title><p>Our previous studies have demonstrated that CypA inhibits IAV replication both <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Li et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Liu et al., 2012b</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">2009</xref>). To further investigate the impact of CypA on the replication of other RIG-I-recognized RNA viruses, such as SeV and VSV, virus growth was monitored in shRNA-based CypA-knockdown 293T cells (293T/CypA-) and wild-type (WT) 293T cells (293T/CypA+). The hemagglutination (HA) titer of SeV and median tissue culture infective dose (TCID50) of VSV in 293T/CypA- cells was strikingly increased compared with that in 293T/CypA+ cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A,B</xref>), indicating that CypA plays an inhibitory role in the replication of SeV and VSV. To confirm the role of CypA in antiviral responses in a CypA deficient system, we purchased CypA-deficient (<italic>Ppia<sup>−/−</sup></italic>) 129 mice from Jackson Laboratory and crossed them to WT 129 mice. WT, <italic>Ppia<sup>+/−</sup></italic> and <italic>Ppia<sup>−/−</sup></italic> mice were identified by PCR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>).

We further determined the effect of CypA on SeV replication in BMDMs from WT and <italic>Ppia<sup>−/−</sup></italic> mice. Consistent with the results in 293T cells, we found that the mRNA expression level of SeV M gene was higher in <italic>Ppia<sup>−/−</sup></italic> BMDMs than that in WT BMDMs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). Collectively, these data suggested that CypA inhibited the replication of RIG-I-recognized RNA viruses.<fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.24425.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>CypA promotes production of type I IFNs against virus infection.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) HA assays of SeV in 293T/CypA+ or 293T/CypA- cells infected with SeV (MOI = 1) for the indicated time periods.

We performed IFN-β promoter-driven luciferase assay in 293T cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>), and quantitative PCR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E,G</xref>) and ELISA assays (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>) in BMDMs in response to transfected Poly (I:C) or infection of SeV, VSV or IAV with the NS1R38A/K41A mutant (IAV-mut, which induces high levels of IFN-β, [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Donelan et al., 2003</xref>]), respectively. Absence of CypA remarkably decreased RIG-I-mediated production of type I IFNs and ISGs. We also obtained similar results with other cell types, such as human primary monocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1H,I</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2C,H,I</xref>), 293 T cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2A,B</xref>) and U937 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2C–G</xref>) triggered by SeV or VSV. Collectively, these findings suggested that CypA positively regulated expression of type I IFNs and ISGs against RIG-I-recognized RNA virus infection. We further examined the effect of CypA on RIG-I-independent signaling, such as encephalomyocarditis virus (EMCV)-triggered MDA5 pathway and herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1)-triggered cGAS-STING pathway. CypA promoted IFN-β and ISGs production and inhibited the replication of EMCV (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3A,B</xref>), but had no impact on HSV-1-triggered cGAS-STING pathway (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3C</xref>).</p><p>Altered host cell gene expression is a universal consequence of virus infection. When we investigated the mRNA and protein levels of CypA in BMDMs, 293T cells, U937 cells and human monocytes infected with SeV, VSV or IAV-mut, we found that CypA was highly inducible, whereas Poly (I:C) transfection or IFN-β treatment made no difference to CypA expression, (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1—figure supplement 4A–D</xref>), suggesting that the induction of CypA can be triggered by viruses and CypA is involved in cellular antiviral response. Taken together, upon virus infection, CypA expression was upregulated, which inhibited the replication RIG-I-recognized RNA virus by enhancing production of type I IFNs. In the following studies, we used SeV as a naturally occurring agent that strongly triggers antiviral immunity via RIG-I-mediated signaling pathway.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>CypA deficiency impairs antiviral responses <italic>in vivo</italic></title><p>Having known that CypA promotes type I IFN production and inhibits the replication of RIG-I-recognized RNA virus <italic>in vitro</italic>, we next sought to determine CypA-mediated antiviral responses <italic>in vivo</italic>.

We have known that RIG-I is the target of CypA, it is necessary to investigate whether CypA is involved in this process. Therefore, we first investigated the effect of CypA on ubiquitination of RIG-I. In 293T/CypA- cells, transfected CypA enhanced exogenous TRIM25-mediated K63-linked, but not K48-linked ubiquitination of RIG-I (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>) and increased the interaction between TRIM25 and RIG-I (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>). Furthermore, we observed similar results of endogenous ubiquitination of RIG-I and endogenous interaction between TRIM25 and RIG-I in BMDMs upon SeV infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B,D</xref>). It is well known that TRIM25 interacts with RIG-I-N to deliver the Lys 63-linked ubiquitin to the CARDs of RIG-I (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Gack et al., 2007</xref>). We performed coimmunoprecipitation assays to explore the CypA-binding region of RIG-I. We found that the CypA interacted with RIG-I-C (C-terminal of RIG-I) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>), indicating that CypA and TRIM25 bind to different regions of RIG-I. It is possible that the binding of CypA to RIG-I facilitates the interaction between TRIM25 and RIG-I-N. We next assessed the effect of CypA on recruitment of RIG-I to mitochondria. The cytoplasmic fraction (Cyto), mitochondrial fraction (Mito) and whole-cell lysate (WCL) from SeV-infected WT and <italic>Ppia<sup>−/−</sup></italic> BMDMs were separated for western blotting analysis. We observed that RIG-I induction was strongly decreased and much less RIG-I was found in mitochondria of BMDMs when CypA was absent (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F</xref>). We also detected the expression and location of endogenous RIG-I in 293T/CypA+ and 293T/CypA- cells that were stained with Mito-Tracker and infected with SeV by using confocal microscopy. The results confirmed that CypA promoted RIG-I induction and facilitated recruitment of RIG-I to mitochondria upon SeV infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5G</xref>), which are consistent with the results of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F</xref>. We then investigated the effect of CypA on the interaction between RIG-I and MAVS. Coimmunoprecipitation experiment indicated that CypA enhanced RIG-I-MAVS interaction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5H</xref>). More interestingly, aside from the well-known cytoplasmic distribution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Galat and Metcalfe, 1995</xref>), CypA was also detected in mitochondria and its expression level was upregulated both in mitochondria and cytoplasm against SeV infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F</xref>), a finding confirmed by an immunofluorescence assay in 293T/CypA+ cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5I</xref>), suggesting that CypA plays important roles in response to virus infection both in mitochondria and cytoplasm. Taken together, upon SeV infection, CypA increased the interaction between the E3 ubiquitin ligase TRIM25 and RIG-I and promoted K63-linked ubiquitination of RIG-I to facilitate recruitment of RIG-I to MAVS, leading to up-regulation of RIG-I signaling pathway.<fig id="fig5" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.24425.016</object-id><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><title>CypA enhances TRIM25-mediated K63-linked ubiquitination of RIG-I and facilitates recruitment of RIG-I to MAVS.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Immunoblot analysis of lysates in 293T/CypA- cells transfected for 24 hr with Flag-RIG-I, along with HA-K63-Ub, HA-K48-Ub, Myc-TRIM25, or Myc-CypA, followed by immunoprecipitation with anti-Flag beads.

Consistently, in coimmunoprecipitation experiments, we also found that CypA significantly decreased the ubiquitination of MAVS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6F</xref>). To further determine the MAVS domain responsible for CypA-regulated MAVS degradation, we tested the degradation of various MAVS truncation constructs as well as a construct of MAVS amino acids 360–540 with the substitutions K371A and K420A (360–540 KK-AA, which completely withstood MAVS degradation) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">You et al., 2009</xref>).

We speculated that CypA might compete with TRIM25 to interact with MAVS. To test this hypothesis, we performed coimmunoprecipitation experiments to analyze the interaction between TRIM25 and MAVS in the presence or absence of CypA, as well as the interaction between CypA and MAVS in the presence or absence of TRIM25. CypA-MAVS interaction was reduced in the presence of TRIM25, and TRIM25-MAVS interaction also reduced in the presence of CypA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7F</xref>). We next explored whether CypA and TRIM25 interacted with the same region of MAVS. Just as we speculated, CypA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7G</xref>) and TRIM25 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7H</xref>) both bind to MAVS amino acids 360–540. Thus, our results indicated that CypA and the E3 ligase TRIM25 competitively interacted with MAVS, thereby inhibiting ubiquitin-mediated proteasome degradation of MAVS.</p><p>It has been reported that TRIM25 targets MAVS at K7 and K10 for ubiquitination and AIP4 mediates MAVS ubiquitination at K371 and K420 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Castanier et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">You et al., 2009</xref>). Here we found that MAVS amino acids 360–540, which contains K371 and K420, is the common binding region for CypA and MAVS. Therefore, we investigated whether K371 and K420 were the ubiquitination sites for TRIM25-mediated MAVS ubiquitination. Both the MAVS mutation KK-AA (with the substitutions K371A and K420A) and KK-RR (with the substitutions K7R and K10R) distinctly reduced MAVS ubiquitination (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7I</xref>), suggesting that K371 and K420, as well as K7 and K10, are the ubiquitination sites for TRIM25-mediated MAVS ubiquitination. Collectively, CypA and TRIM25 competitively interacted with MAVS, which inhibited TRIM25-mediated MAVS ubiquitination at K371 and K420.</p><p>CypA has been shown to interact with p65 and inhibit the ubiquitin-proteasome degradation of p65, thereby promoting innate immune responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Sun et al., 2014</xref>). Our data showed that CypA targeted the upstream RIG-I and MAVS to upregulate RIG-I-mediated signaling pathway. To explore the relevance and contribution of the proposed CypA mechanisms at the level of RIG-I and MAVS, we tested the effect of CypA on IFN-β induction in <italic>RIG-I</italic>-knockout cells (293T/<italic>RIG-I</italic><sup>−/−</sup>) transfected with Flag-RIG-I or Flag-MAVS, along with CypA siRNA or control siRNA. CypA increased IFN-β expression and IRF3/p65 phosphorylation with the treatment of overexpressed RIG-I and MAVS respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7J</xref>). Then we further blocked the downstream p65 using NF-κB inhibitor (BAY-11–7082). We found that CypA still had impact on IFN-β expression and IRF3 phosphorylation when 293T/<italic>RIG-I</italic><sup>−/−</sup> were transfected with Flag-RIG-I and treated with BAY-11–7082, or when 293T/<italic>RIG-I</italic><sup>−/−</sup> were transfected with Flag-MAVS and treated with BAY-11–7082 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7J</xref>). Collectively, these data indicate that CypA is able to promote type I IFN production at the level of RIG-I and MAVS, which is independent of the downstream p65. Accordingly, CypA could inhibit SeV replication by regulating RIG-I- and MAVS-directed type I IFN production (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7K</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>CypA functions as either the primary intracellular target of the immunosuppressive drug CsA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Handschumacher et al., 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Liu et al., 1991</xref>), or as a key modulator of some biological processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30"><bold><italic>Lu et al., 2007</italic></bold></xref>). However, the roles of CypA in host antiviral immune responses are not well understood. It had been reported that CypA was highly induced in human gastric carcinoma cell line upon H9N2 influenza virus infection by using proteomics analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Liu et al., 2008</xref>). We also found that CypA was inducible in BMDMs, 293T cells, U937 cells and human monocytes infected by SeV, VSV or IAV-mut, indicating that CypA participates in cellular antiviral response. In the present study, we identified CypA as an important host factor that promotes RIG-I-mediated type I IFN production. Deficiency of CypA greatly decreases type I IFN production, which facilitates virus replication. Furthermore, CypA increased the interaction between E3 ubiquitin ligase TRIM25 and RIG-I, promoting K63-linked ubiquitination of RIG-I that facilitated recruitment of RIG-I to MAVS. Finally, CypA and TRIM25 interacted with MAVS in a competitive manner, inhibiting TRIM25-mediated K48-linked ubiquitination of MAVS at K371 and K420. Our findings demonstrated that CypA inhibited virus replication via enhancing antiviral immune responses, uncovering a different way for CypA to regulate virus infection.</p><p>The ubiquitin system has been certified to play an essential role in precisely controlling RIG-I-mediated signal transduction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Heaton et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Maelfait and Beyaert, 2012</xref>). Upon RNA virus infection, viral RNA bind to RIG-I followed by the binding of TRIM25 to deliver the K63 ubiquitin chains to RIG-I (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Gack et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Jiang et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Kowalinski et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Peisley et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Sanchez et al., 2016</xref>), then the CARD domains of RIG-I are exposed to interact with the CARD domains of MAVS. In the present study, we found that CypA increased the interaction between RIG-I and TRIM25, which facilitated K63-linked ubiquitination of RIG-I and recruitment of RIG-I from the cytosol to mitochondrion-associated MAVS, suggesting a positive role of CypA in the production of type I IFN. It has also been reported that another RIG-I binding protein, 14-3-3ε, is essential for the stable interaction of RIG-I with TRIM25, which facilitates RIG-I ubiquitination and initiation of innate immunity against hepatitis C virus and other pathogenic RNA viruses. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Liu et al., 2012a</xref>). Therefore, just like 14-3-3ε, CypA could be defined as a key mitochondrial targeting chaperone protein that is required for innate antiviral responses.</p><p>It has been established that MAVS undergoes K48-linked ubiquitination during virus infection, which mediates MAVS degradation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Liu et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Paz et al., 2009</xref>). A number of studies have showed that some host proteins, including PCBP2, IRTKS and Ndfip1, promoted E3 ligase AIP4- or Smurf-mediated MAVS ubiquitination for degradation, leading to suppressed type I IFN production (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Wang et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Xia et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">You et al., 2009</xref>). Here we found that CypA inhibited TRIM25-mediated K48-linked ubiquitination of MAVS to slow down the degradation of MAVS, thereby facilitating RIG-I-mediated type I IFN production. All these data indicated that inhibition of MAVS degradation facilitated RIG-I-mediated type I IFN production. However, a previous study suggested that the proteasomal degradation of MAVS was required to release the signaling complex into the cytosol for phosphorylation of IRF3 and subsequent production of IFN-β (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Castanier et al., 2012</xref>). In that study, MG132 was used as an inhibitor of MAVS degradation to test the effect of MAVS stability on IFN production, while MG132 is not the specific inhibitor of MAVS degradation. This is a tempting and interesting hypothesis, which remains to be further studied (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Jacobs and Coyne, 2013</xref>).</p><p>Besides CypA-regulated ubiquitination of RIG-I and MAVS, we have reported that CypA accelerates ubiquitin-proteasome degradation of the M1 protein of influenza virus and then restricts virus replication(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Liu et al., 2012b</xref>). Additionally, CypA and another PPIase, Pin1, both enhance the stability of P65 by blocking the ubiquitin-proteasome degradation, and SOCS-1 is the ubiquitin ligase for P65 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Ryo et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Sun et al., 2014</xref>). These results support the hypothesis that PPIases have some common function in regulating ubiquitination of proteins. Together, we reveal a ubiquitination-based mechanism by which CypA controls RIG-I-mediated antiviral immune responses.</p><p>CypA is widely distributed in almost all tissues. Multiple lines of evidence have revealed that CypA interacts with a large number of proteins and plays various biological roles through different mechanisms. We found that CypA-MAVS interaction was reduced in the presence of TRIM25, and TRIM25-MAVS interaction also appeared to be reduced in the presence of CypA. In addition, both CypA and TRIM25 interacted with a similar stretch of MAVS (aa 360–450) and within this region K371 and K420 were the ubiquitination target sites for TRIM25 as well as the sites that CypA targeted to stabilize MAVS. All these results suggest that CypA competes with TRIM25 for MAVS binding to inhibit TRIM25-mediated K48-linked ubiquitination of MAVS. But on the other hand, we found that CypA promoted the interaction between TRIM25 and RIG-I, which is a quite different mechanism from that at the level of MAVS. As is well known, TRIM25 interacts with RIG-I-N to deliver the Lys 63-linked ubiquitin to the CARDs of RIG-I (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Gack et al., 2007</xref>). We observed that CypA interacted with RIG-I-C, indicating that CypA and TRIM25 bind to different regions of RIG-I. We speculated that the conformation of RIG-I-N might be changed as soon as CypA interacted with RIG-I-C, then the binding site of TRIM25 was exposed, which facilitated the interaction between TRIM25 and RIG-I-N. A detailed structural study is an interesting future direction.</p><p>In conclusion, our data demonstrated that CypA regulates RIG-I signaling in two ways. On one hand, CypA promotes K63-linked ubiquitination of RIG-I and recruits more RIG-I to MAVS. On the other hand, CypA stabilizes MAVS by suppressing its ubiquitin-mediated proteasome degradation. Hence, our data further expand the biological functions of CypA in RIG-I-mediated antiviral innate immunity and provide a potential novel target for manipulating viral infection.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Cell lines and antibodies</title><p>ShRNA-based knockdown of CypA in human embryonic kidney 293T cells (CRL-3216, ATCC) has been described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Liu et al., 2012b</xref>).

Your article has been reviewed by two peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Michel Nussenzweig as the Senior Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this letter to direct your attention to key issues we feel must be considered in our decision concerning this work. We ask that you respond with details of how you would propose to address the major points specified below and an approximate timetable for the completion of his work. The editor and reviewers will consider your response and issue a recommended action.</p><p>In this manuscript Liu et al. provide data that show that cells deficient in Cyclophilin A (CypA) are impaired in type I interferon (IFN) production in response to viruses that are sensed by the intracellular RNA receptor RIG-I. The authors further demonstrate that CypA deficiency leads to increased replication of these viruses. The authors tested the interaction of CypA with RIG-I, the related sensor MDA5, and their downstream adaptor MAVS, and found that CypA binds to all three proteins. The authors provide data suggesting two apparently independent mechanisms by which CypA promotes the RIG-I-MAVS-mediated antiviral response: a) CypA promoting the interaction of the E3 ligase TRIM25 to RIG-I and subsequent K63-linked ubiquitination of RIG-I by TRIM25; and b) CypA competing with TRIM25 for MAVS binding, thereby blocking the degradative ubiquitination of MAVS by TRIM25.</p><p>Strengths of this study are the phenotypical data that demonstrate that CypA modulates the IFN-mediated antiviral response. A major weakness of the study is that the proposed mechanism(s) by which CypA facilitates IFN-mediated innate immunity is not well supported by the data, and that many of the biochemical experiments are poorly executed.</p><p>1) The authors propose two independent mechanisms by which CypA promotes RIG-I-MAVS signaling but fail to integrate these two mechanisms, nor demonstrate the relevance and contribution of each mechanism to CypA-mediated IFN induction. This is especially important as CypA has been shown to act also downstream of RLRs-MAVS (as cited by the authors in the Discussion section). As such, the authors need to demonstrate the relevance of their proposed mechanisms for IFN induction and viral replication.</p><p>2) The authors provide data showing that CypA can interact with MDA5 but they fail to follow up on these findings.</p><p>3) Furthermore, the mechanistic data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figures 5</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">6</xref>) heavily rely on overexpression experiments, and critical controls are missing in many experiments. Sometimes it is unclear from the figure labeling what was done in the experiment.</p><p>Major points that must be addressed:</p><p>1) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>: The authors propose that CypA specifically promotes RIG-I signaling, and thus inhibits viruses sensed by RIG-I. However, they also provide data showing that CypA interacts with MDA5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). The authors need to also test the replication of viruses sensed specifically by MDA5, and test cytokine induction by these viruses.</p><p>2) CypA has been previously shown to act downstream of innate sensors, thereby promoting innate immune responses. Therefore, it is essential to show the relevance and contribution of the proposed CypA mechanisms, which are proposed to be at the level of RIG-I and MAVS, to IFN induction. The authors should test the effect of CypA overexpression and knockdown on virus replication and IFN induction in RIG-I or MAVS knockout cells. Moreover, the authors should examine the effect of CypA on RLR-independent signaling, such as the cGAS-STING pathway, which should not be affected.</p><p>3) Figure 2—figure supplement 4, panels C-D: In the spleen, levels of IFN-α and IFN-β increase upto 24h whereas levels of ISGs (which are believed to be downstream of IFN-α/β) decrease. The most significant difference in ISGs between WT and PPIA KO mice is seen at 6 h – a time that precedes a significant difference in IFNa and IFNb – and is lost by 24 h when the difference in IFN between WT and PPIA KO mice is most significant. This is in contrast to what is seen in the lung (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). Can the authors explain this discrepancy and address it in the Discussion?</p><p>4) The mechanism of action of CypA i.e. its effect on ubiquitination of RIG-I and MAVS is worked out only under overexpression conditions in 293 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">7</xref>). The authors need to show the effect of CypA knockdown on endogenous RIG-I K63-ubiquitination and RIG-I-TRIM25 binding as well as endogenous MAVS ubiquitination in infected cells. In addition, to relate this mechanism to the physiological effect of CypA on SeV-induced type 1 IFN (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">2</xref>), it is important to show that endogenous CypA can trigger ubiquitination of endogenous RIG-I and MAVS upon SeV infection. One way to do this is by infecting WT and <italic>Ppia<sup>-/-</sup></italic> BMDMs with SeV, followed by i.p. for either RIG-I or MAVS and blotting with K63- or K48-linkage specific polyubiquitin antibodies.</p><p>5) How do the authors integrate their data showing CypA promoting TRIM25 binding to RIG-I, but on the other hand, CypA competing with TRIM25 for MAVS binding. Additional experiments integrating the two mechanisms need to be performed.</p><p>6) The figure labeling and legends are not sufficiently described. For example, it is unclear which antibodies were used to detect the transfected proteins. In many figures the authors transfected tagged proteins, but then just label the blots with the name of the protein. Therefore, it is unclear which antibody (presumably the antibody against the tag) was used. The authors need to label the figures correctly, indicating which antibodies were used for each IP or western blot. Furthermore, this also needs to be described in the figure legend. In particular, in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>, the amount of CypA in whole cells lysates in the rightmost lane is quite low compared to other samples. This lane (i.p: IRF3, blot: CypA) is an important specificity control to show that CypA specifically interacts with RIG-I, MDA-5 and MAVS which are involved in CypA-regulated production of type 1 IFN, and does not associate non-specifically with other RIG-I pathway components under overexpression conditions in 293 cells. The authors should replace this with an experiment where CypA levels in lysates are equivalent across samples. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">6E,F</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">7D</xref>: A blot for HA in the lysates needs to be included to show equivalent transfection of HA-tagged Ub, K63-Ub and K68-Ub across samples.</p><p>7) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref>: In the confocal images, one expects MAVS to be primarily on the mitochondria but its staining appears to be homogeneous and a punctate distribution is not seen – it isn't clear why, but this could be due to antibody non-specificity or lack of adequate image resolution, both of which can confound a colocalization experiment. Similarly, it isn't clear that the cells being imaged are productively infected with SeV. If so, one would expect RIG-I and MDA-5 to also be at least partly mitochondrial / punctate in virus infected cells. To convincingly show by confocal imaging that CypA colocalizes with RIG-I, MDA-5 or MAVS after SeV infection, the authors should show representative images of CypA localization relative to that of RIG-I, MDA-5 and MAVS in uninfected cells.</p><p>8) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E</xref>: It is unclear what this figure shows as it seems that no MAVS was co-transfected, or endogenous MAVS pulled down. The authors need to show also the WCLs showing HA-Ub expression.</p><p>9) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7E</xref>: CypA-MAVS interaction is reduced in presence of TRIM25, but TRIM25-MAVS interaction does not appear to be reduced in presence of CypA. So, although the authors present evidence that both CypA and TRIM25 interact with a similar stretch of MAVS i.e. aa 360-450 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7F-G</xref>) and within this region aa K371 and K420 are the ubiquitination target sites for TRIM25 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7H</xref>) as well as the sites that CypA targets to stabilize MAVS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6G</xref>), the blot in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7E</xref> does not show that CypA competitively inhibits TRIM25 interaction with MAVS. This could just be an issue of saturating exposure on the blot, or it is possible that CypA somehow inhibits the ubiquitin ligase activity of TRIM25 rather than its interaction with MAVS per se. The authors should clarify and either change the blot or reword the text (particularly in the second paragraph of the subsection “CypA stabilizes MAVS by inhibiting TRIM25-mediated K48-linked ubiquitination of MAVS”, but also in other places where a 'competitive interaction' is mentioned) accordingly.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were requested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for resubmitting your work entitled &quot;Cyclophilin A-regulated ubiquitination is critical for RIG-I-mediated antiviral immune responses&quot; for further consideration at <italic>eLife</italic>.

We will further explore the molecular mechanism of CypA in MDA5 signaling in future.

Moreover, the authors should examine the effect of CypA on RLR-independent signaling, such as the cGAS-STING pathway, which should not be affected.</italic> </p><p>a) CypA has been shown to interact with p65 and inhibit the ubiquitin-proteasome degradation of p65, thereby promoting innate immune responses (Sun et al., PloS ONE, 2014,9: e96211). Our data showed that CypA targeted the upstream RIG-I and MAVS to upregulate RIG-I-mediated signaling pathway. To explore the relevance and contribution of the proposed CypA mechanisms at the level of RIG-I and MAVS, we tested the effect of CypA on IFN-β induction in RIG-I knockout cells (293T/RIG-I<sup>-/-</sup>) transfected with Flag-RIG-I or Flag -MAVS, along with CypA siRNA or control siRNA. CypA increased IFN-β expression and IRF3/p65 phosphorylation with the treatment of overexpressed RIG-I and MAVS respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7J</xref>). Then we further blocked the downstream p65 using NF-κB inhibitor (BAY-11-7082). We found that CypA still had impact on IFN-β expression and IRF3 phosphorylation when 293T/RIG-I<sup>-/-</sup> were transfected with Flag-RIG-I and treated with BAY-11-7082, or when 293T/RIG-I<sup>-/-</sup> were transfected with Flag-MAVS and treated with BAY-11-7082 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7J</xref>). Collectively, these data indicate that CypA is able to promote type I IFN production at the level of RIG-I and MAVS, which is independent of the downstream p65. Accordingly, CypA could inhibit SeV replication via RIG-I- and MAVS-directed signaling pathways (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7K</xref>).</p><p>b) We have tested the effect of CypA on cGAS-STING pathway triggered by herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1). The results showed that HSV-1-triggered cGAS-STING pathway could not be influenced by CypA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3C</xref>).</p><p><italic>3) Figure 2—figure supplement 4, panels C-D: In the spleen, levels of IFN-α and IFN-β increase upto 24h whereas levels of ISGs (which are believed to be downstream of IFN-α/β) decrease. The most significant difference in ISGs between WT and PPIA KO mice is seen at 6 h – a time that precedes a significant difference in IFNa and IFNb – and is lost by 24 h when the difference in IFN between WT and PPIA KO mice is most significant. This is in contrast to what is seen in the lung (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). Can the authors explain this discrepancy and address it in the Discussion?</italic> </p><p>There could be two main reasons for this discrepancy: First, the cell type and innate immune response in the spleen are quite different from those in the lung. It has been reported that the induction of ISGs is both tissue and time specific, and the expression profiles of ISGs (such as OAS, Mx-1 and PRK) triggered by IFN-α in the lung and spleen (Röll et al. BMC Genomics, 2017, 18:264) are similar with those of IFIT1, IFIT2 and Ccl5 in our studies. Second, ISGs expression in the spleen might be induced rapidly after SeV infection through an IFN-independent signaling pathway, and is functionally important for controlling viral replication before the onset of more robust and sustained IFN activation. A previous study has demonstrated that peroxisomal MAVS triggers an IFN-independent signaling pathway that promotes ISG expression after virus infection (Dixit E, et al. Cell. 2010; 141:668–681). In the present study, we found that CypA could inhibit proteasome degradation of MAVS. Therefore, it is possible that CypA might promote peroxisomal MAVS-mediated ISG expression. The exact mechanism need to be further studied.</p><p><italic>4) The mechanism of action of CypA i.e. its effect on ubiquitination of RIG-I and MAVS is worked out only under overexpression conditions in 293 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figures 5</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">7</xref>). The authors need to show the effect of CypA knockdown on endogenous RIG-I K63-ubiquitination and RIG-I-TRIM25 binding as well as endogenous MAVS ubiquitination in infected cells. In addition, to relate this mechanism to the physiological effect of CypA on SeV-induced type 1 IFN (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">2</xref>), it is important to show that endogenous CypA can trigger ubiquitination of endogenous RIG-I and MAVS upon SeV infection. One way to do this is by infecting WT and Ppia<sup>-/-</sup> BMDMs with SeV, followed by i.p. for either RIG-I or MAVS and blotting with K63- or K48-linkage specific polyubiquitin antibodies.</italic> </p><p>The reviewers’ suggestion is greatly appreciated. We have further confirmed the effect of CypA on endogenous ubiquitination of RIG-I (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>) and MAVS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7E</xref>) as well as RIG-I-TRIM25 binding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>) in WT and <italic>Ppia<sup>-/-</sup></italic> BMDMs infected by SeV.</p><p><italic>5) How do the authors integrate their data showing CypA promoting TRIM25 binding to RIG-I, but on the other hand, CypA competing with TRIM25 for MAVS binding. Additional experiments integrating the two mechanisms need to be performed.</italic> </p><p>We are greatly appreciated for the reviewers’ suggestion to let us make an in-depth analysis of our results. CypA is widely distributed in almost all tissues. Multiple lines of evidence have revealed that CypA interacts with a large number of proteins and plays various biological roles through different mechanisms. We found that CypA-MAVS interaction was reduced in the presence of TRIM25, and TRIM25-MAVS interaction also appeared to be reduced in the presence of CypA. In addition, both CypA and TRIM25 interacted with a similar stretch of MAVS i.e. aa 360-450 and within this region aa K371 and K420 were the ubiquitination target sites for TRIM25 as well as the sites that CypA targeted to stabilize MAVS. All these results suggest that CypA competes with TRIM25 for MAVS binding to inhibit TRIM25-mediated K48-linked ubiquitination of MAVS. But on the other hand, we found that CypA promoted the interaction between TRIM25 and RIG-I, which is a quite different mechanism from that at the level of MAVS. As is well known, TRIM25 interacts with RIG-I-N to deliver the Lys 63-linked ubiquitin to the CARDs of RIG-I (Gack et al. Nature, 2007, 19;446(7138):916-920). To further explore the binding mechanisms of CypA, RIG-I and TRM25, we performed coimmunoprecipitation assays to determine the CypA-binding region of RIG-I. We found that CypA interacted with RIG-I-C, indicating that CypA and TRIM25 bind to the different domain of RIG-I respectively. We speculated that the conformation of RIG-I might be changed as soon as CypA interacted with RIG-I-C, then the binding site of TRIM25 was exposed, which facilitated the interaction between TRIM25 and RIG-I-N. The detail structural study is an interesting future direction.</p><p><italic>6) The figure labeling and legends are not sufficiently described.
