erythrocytes by <italic>Plasmodial</italic> merozoites is a composite process involving the interplay of several proteins. Among them, the <italic>Plasmodium falciparum</italic> Cysteine-Rich Protective Antigen (PfCyRPA) is a crucial component of a ternary complex, including Reticulocyte binding-like Homologous protein 5 (PfRH5) and the RH5-interacting protein (PfRipr), essential for erythrocyte invasion. Here, we present the crystal structures of PfCyRPA and its complex with the antigen-binding fragment of a parasite growth inhibitory antibody. PfCyRPA adopts a 6-bladed β-propeller structure with similarity to the classic sialidase fold, but it has no sialidase activity and fulfills a purely non-enzymatic function. Characterization of the epitope recognized by protective antibodies may facilitate design of peptidomimetics to focus vaccine responses on protective epitopes. Both in vitro and in vivo anti-PfCyRPA and anti-PfRH5 antibodies showed more potent parasite growth inhibitory activity in combination than on their own, supporting a combined delivery of PfCyRPA and PfRH5 in vaccines.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.20383.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.20383.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.20383.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Malaria is one of the deadliest infectious diseases worldwide, killing over 400,000 people a year. About 200 million people are infected every year, placing a huge social and medical burden especially on developing countries. Microscopic parasites known as <italic>Plasmodium</italic> are responsible for causing this disease. <italic>Plasmodium</italic> parasites have a complex life cycle involving both mosquito and mammal hosts. This includes a stage where the parasites infect the mammal’s red blood cells, which causes the symptoms of the disease. In 2012, a team of researchers discovered that a protein called CyRPA forms a group (or ‘complex’) with several other proteins to allow the parasites to enter red blood cells.</p><p>Developing a vaccine is one of the most promising approaches to prevent malaria. Vaccines help the body to recognise and fight an invading microbe by triggering an immune response that results in the production of proteins called antibodies, which can bind to specific molecules on the surface of the microbe. If the microbe later enters the body, these antibodies can be produced quickly to eliminate the microbe before it causes disease. However, efforts to develop a highly effective vaccine against malaria have so far been unsuccessful.</p><p>Favuzza et al. – including some of the researchers involved in the 2012 work – used a technique called X-ray crystallography to investigate the three-dimensional structure of the CyRPA protein. The experiments show that an antibody is able to bind to a region of CyRPA – a designated ‘protective epitope’ – that is similar in the CyRPA proteins of all <italic>Plasmodium falciparum</italic> strains. These antibodies can prevent the parasite from entering the red blood cells, and vaccines containing CyRPA may therefore be effective at protecting individuals from malaria. The findings of Favuzza et al. also suggest that using CyRPA in combination with another protein in the complex called RH5 could make the vaccine more powerful as it would make it harder for the parasite to become resistant.</p><p>The next step following on from this work is to design a vaccine containing protective CyRPA epitopes that triggers an immune response in mammals that is strong enough to reduce the numbers of parasites in the blood. A future challenge will be to develop a vaccine that combines several proteins involved in different stages of the parasite’s life cycle to provide full protection against malaria.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.20383.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.20383.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>CyRPA</kwd><kwd>Malaria vaccine candidate</kwd><kwd>sialidase</kwd><kwd>crystal structure</kwd><kwd>β-propeller</kwd><kwd>invasion inhibitory antibody</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd>&lt;i&gt;P. falciparum&lt;/i&gt;</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Uniscientia Stiftung</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Pluschke</surname><given-names>Gerd</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The structure of the promising malaria blood-stage vaccine candidate antigen PfCyRPA and the characterization of a protective epitope are facilitating research on its essential role in parasite invasion, and will guide future epitope-focused vaccine design.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>According to the World Health Organization 2015 Malaria Report (who.int/malaria/publications/world_malaria_report/en), malaria is estimated to have caused 214 million clinical cases and 438,000 deaths in 2015. The disease is transmitted by female <italic>Anopheles</italic> mosquitoes and caused by parasitic protozoans of the genus <italic>Plasmodium</italic>, of which <italic>P. falciparum</italic> and <italic>P. vivax</italic> are the most prevalent and <italic>P. falciparum</italic> is causing the <italic>most</italic> often fatal and medically most severe form of malaria. Debilitating clinical symptoms associated with the infection are caused by the multiplication of the asexual blood-stage parasites in erythrocytes. One of the most promising targets for malaria vaccine development is therefore at the stage where merozoites invade erythrocytes.</p><p>Invasion of host erythrocytes by merozoites is a complex process, conceptually divisible into four phases: (1) initial recognition of and reversible attachment to the erythrocyte membrane by the merozoite; (2) junction formation leading to irreversible attachment of the merozoite, parasitophorous vacuole formation, and release of the <italic>Plasmodium</italic> rhoptry-microneme secretory organelles; (3) invagination of the erythrocyte membrane around the merozoite, accompanied by the shedding of the merozoite’s surface coat; (4) closing of the parasitophorous vacuole and resealing of the erythrocyte membrane mark the completion of merozoite invasion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Pinder et al., 2000</xref>). The initial recognition and the active invasion of erythrocytes depend on specific molecular interactions between parasite ligands and receptors on the host erythrocyte membrane. Although several ligand-receptor interactions have already been identified, the entire network of molecular interactions involved in invasion is not yet fully disentangled. In addition, <italic>P. falciparum</italic> merozoite proteins are antigenically highly diverse and in part functionally redundant, to facilitate parasite escape from host immune surveillance and to ensure erythrocyte invasion via alternative pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Cowman et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>Most efforts in malaria blood stage vaccine research and development have historically concentrated on immuno-dominant, polymorphic antigens that contribute to the invasion of red blood cells by merozoites. Despite major efforts, blood-stage vaccines based on merozoite surface antigens have so far shown limited efficacy in clinical trials (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Halbroth and Draper, 2015</xref>). Extensive antigenic polymorphism represents one major hurdle for the development of an effective blood-stage malaria vaccine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Takala et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Dzikowski and Deitsch, 2009</xref>). Therefore, the identification of new candidate antigens that are able to induce broad strain-transcending immunity and that are not susceptible to ‘vaccine resistance’ has become a recent research focus.</p><p>Availability of pathogen genomes is facilitating the discovery of novel vaccine candidate antigens through ‘reverse vaccinology’ approaches (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Rappuoli, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Donati and Rappuoli, 2013</xref>). Sequencing and annotation of the <italic>P. falciparum</italic> genome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Gardner et al., 2002</xref>) has supported the identification of new blood-stage vaccine candidate antigens (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Conway, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Proietti and Doolan, 2014</xref>), among which the <italic>P. falciparum</italic> Cysteine-Rich Protective Antigen (PfCyRPA) has a number of noteworthy properties. While PfCyRPA is highly conserved among a plethora of <italic>P. falciparum</italic> isolates, it also is poorly immunogenic in the context of natural exposure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Dreyer et al., 2012</xref>). Moreover, PfCyRPA-specific monoclonal antibodies (mAb) inhibit parasite growth both in vitro and in vivo by blocking merozoite invasion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Dreyer et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Favuzza et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>PfCyRPA is a 42.8 kDa protein of 362 residues with a predicted N-terminal secretion signal. Orthologs of PfCyRPA have been found in the genomes of the human malaria parasite <italic>P. vivax</italic> and the primate pathogens <italic>P. knowlesi</italic>, <italic>P. cynomolgi</italic>, and <italic>P. reichenowi</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>), but not in the sequenced genomes of other <italic>Plasmodium</italic> species. <italic>P. falciparum</italic> PfCyRPA shares on average 42% sequence identity with its orthologs, but within different <italic>P. falciparum</italic> isolates PfCyRPA is highly conserved: just 13 dimorphic amino acid positions (highlighted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>) were found in 227 <italic>P. falciparum</italic> field isolates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Manske et al., 2012</xref>), and only a single variant (Arg399 instead of Ser399) was found at a frequency of greater than 2%.</p><p>PfCyRPA is part of a multi-protein complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Reddy et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Volz et al., 2016</xref>) including also the PfRH5-interacting protein PfRipr and the reticulocyte binding-like homologous protein PfRH5, which binds to the erythrocyte receptor basigin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Baum et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Crosnier et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chen et al., 2011b</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">2014</xref>). PfRH5, PfCyRPA, and PfRipr colocalize during parasite invasion at the junction between merozoites and erythrocytes. The complex seems to be required both for triggering Ca<sup>2+</sup> release and establishment of tight junctions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Volz et al., 2016</xref>). While merozoites deficient in PfCyRPA or PfRH5 can still bind to erythrocytes, they do not attach irreversibly and cannot invade the host cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Volz et al., 2016</xref>). Like PfCyRPA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Dreyer et al., 2012</xref>), PfRH5 induces invasion-blocking antibodies that are effective across common genetic variants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Douglas et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bustamante et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Douglas et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>‘Structural vaccinology’, a combination of immunological, structural, and bioinformatics approaches, is increasingly used for the design of improved vaccine antigens (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Dormitzer et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Cozzi et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Malito et al., 2015</xref>). To this end, the crystal structures of PfRH5 in complex with basigin and neutralizing inhibitory mAb have been determined (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chen et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Wright et al., 2014</xref>). Here, we describe the crystal structure of the promising vaccine candidate PfCyRPA alone and in complex with the antigen-binding fragment (Fab) of the parasite growth inhibitory mAb c12 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Dreyer et al., 2012</xref>). The structure of PfCyRPA represents a step toward elucidating its biological function. Furthermore, definition of the specific epitope–paratope interactions from the crystal structure of the PfCyRPA/c12 complex will support rational design of an epitope-focused PfCyRPA-based candidate vaccine.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Fine specificities of anti-PfCyRPA antibodies</title><p>The finding that PfCyRPA and PfRH5 form a complex essential for parasite invasion prompted us to investigate the fine specificities of previously generated parasite inhibitory and non-inhibitory anti-PfCyRPA mAbs. The 16 anti-PfCyRPA mAbs available for analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Dreyer et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Favuzza et al., 2016</xref>), showed six distinctive reactivity patterns with seven overlapping recombinant protein fragments of PfCyRPA, assigning them to the epitope groups A – F, with groups A, B, C, and F comprising the parasite inhibitory and groups D and E the non-inhibitory mAbs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). All mAbs bound to the full-length PfCyRPA (without the signal sequence; fragment 1). mAbs belonging to epitope group A exclusively bound this fragment, indicating that they recognize conformational epitopes not present in any of the shorter PfCyRPA sequence stretches. Lack of binding to fragments 2 and 7 indicates that the epitope may comprise sequences from both ends of the polypeptide chains. Epitope group B antibodies, including mAb c12, bound only to fragments 1, 2, and 3. Epitope group F mAbs bound to fragments 1, 2, and 5, but not to fragment 3, indicating that in contrast to group B, residues located in the sequence stretch between aa 181–251 are required for their binding. The single mAb c04 constitutes the epitope group C showing binding to fragment 7 (only in IFA, not confirmed by Western blotting analysis). The non-inhibitory mAbs clustered into the distinct epitope groups D and E.<fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.20383.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Binding of anti-PfCyRPA mAbs to fragments of PfCyRPA.</title><p>Binding of 16 mAbs to PfCyRPA fragments (black bars) expressed on the cell surface of HEK cells as assessed by Western blotting analysis and live-cell immunofluorescence staining.

Either mAbs showed potent inhibitory activity, consistently reducing parasite growth of all four tested <italic>P. falciparum</italic> strains in a concentration-dependent manner and to the same extent as the well characterized inhibitory anti-MSP-1 mAb 12.10 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Blackman et al., 1990</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). When combining the anti-PfCyRPA c12 mAb with the anti-RH5 BS1.2 mAb, we found a significantly enhanced inhibitory activity: while mAbs c12 and BS1.2 at a concentration of 250 µg/mL inhibited growth by 21% ± 2.2% and 31% ± 4.6%, respectively, the combination of both mAbs (250 µg/mL each) inhibited growth by 59% ± 1.4%; (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>).

PfCyRPA adopts a six-bladed β-propeller structure that buries the disulfide bonds and the Trp residues. Each blade of the propeller is constructed by a four-stranded anti-parallel β-sheet (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). The five disulfide bonds in PfCyRPA are located within blades 2–6 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>), stabilizing each individual blade. The first blade has no disulfide bond; it is formed by β-strands from the N- and C-terminal regions of PfCyRPA, potentially enabling conformational changes in PfCyRPA by opening and closing. A domain alignment search (DALI; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Holm and Rosenström, 2010</xref>]) for related structures revealed that PfCyRPA adopts a heavily modified sialidase/neuraminidase fold.

A cut-off of 2% signal intensity was applied to separate highly populated from less populated fragments. Masses that correspond to two proteolytic peptides connected by disulfide bonds were repeatedly found (parentheses) when using different proteases. An equal sign (=) signifies a disulfide bond and a minus sign (− ) signifies a skipped cleavage. For instance, the first disulfide bond between Cys48 and Cys64 was identified four times in the LysC hydrolysate: K2 = K3 corresponds to the mass of the second and third expected proteolytic fragment linked by a disulfide bond. K2 = K3–4 is the second expected LysC peptide (K2) disulfide-linked to a larger peptide (K3–K4) that still contains a LysC cleavage site but this site was not recognized by the enzyme. The same reasoning applies to K2 = K3–5, where two LysC cleavage sites were not recognized. An asterisk (*) denotes a disulfide bond in a peptide. The K2-4* fragment has a mass corresponding to an un-cleaved and disulfide-linked peptide with two intact LysC cleavage sites that were not recognized.

Actinase E treatment was not necessary to crystallize the PfCyRPA/c12 complex, however. We determined the crystal structure of the PfCyRPA/c12 complex at a resolution of 4.0 Å by molecular replacement using the individual high-resolution structures of c12 and PfCyRPA as search models (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>). Despite the limited resolution, novel molecular features were visible in the electron density maps of the complex, providing confidence in the relative orientation of PfCyRPA and c12 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>). First, the electron density visible for PfCyRPA after molecular replacement with c12 was used as a search model for structure determination of PfCyRPA alone (see Materials and methods). This strategy would have been impossible had the placement of c12 been wrong. Second, a loop region that is absent in the PfCyRPA search model due to Actinase E proteolysis (see above) exhibits omit electron density in the PfCyRPA/c12 complex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>). Third, consistent with the similar conformations of the CDR loops in the individual c12 Fab structures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>) there are negligible conformational changes in the c12 CDR loops when bound to PfCyRPA. Similarly, the epitope conformation in PfCyRPA is very similar in the unbound and complexed form. Minor adjustments of side-chains were required during rebuilding of the complex structure. While the resolution of the PfCyRPA/c12 complex is limited and many side-chains lack clear electron density, as is typical for this resolution, knowledge of the relative orientation of PfCyRPA with respect to c12 in the complex is sufficient for designing peptidomimetics to target the immune response to the protective epitope.<fig-group><fig id="fig5" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.20383.013</object-id><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><title>Structure of the PfCyRPA/c12 complex.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Overview showing that the majority of the interface is made by interactions between the light chain of c12 and blade 2 of PfCyRPA.

The most frequent amino acid dimorphism of PfCyRPA at position 339 is thus located outside the epitope recognized by mAb c12, consistent with the observation that mAb c12 binds to <italic>P. falciparum</italic> independent of the PfCyRPA variant they express (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Dreyer et al., 2012</xref>). mAb c12 buries a total surface area of 950 Å<sup>2</sup> on PfCyRPA with the major contributor being the light chain, which buries 520 Å<sup>2</sup>, while the heavy chain buries only 430 Å<sup>2</sup>. The surface complementarity coefficient Sc of the complex is 0.67, a typical value for antibody-antigen interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Lawrence and Colman, 1993</xref>); a value of one would denote perfect complementarity. The light chain also forms more potential hydrogen bonds to PfCyRPA than the heavy chain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>). Seven hydrogen bonds are possible between PfCyRPA and the c12 light chain. Each side-chain of light chain CDR1 residues 50-RND-52 can form a hydrogen bond with the side-chains of PfCyRPA residues Asp66, Asn45, and Tyr78, respectively. A particularly large contribution to complex stability may stem from a salt bridge between PfCyRPA residue Asp66 and CDR1 residue Arg50, which by mutagenesis was found to be true (see below), a further confirmation that the PfCyRPA/c12 complex structure is correct. In addition, the heavy chain contributes significantly to antigen binding. Tyr120 of heavy chain CDR3 can engage in two hydrogen bonds with the side-chains of PfCyRPA residues Asp92 in blade two and Tyr144 in blade 3, thus establishing a mini-network that bridges blades 2 and 3. Together with heavy chain CDR3 residue Tyr122, Tyr120 also forms numerous van der Waals interactions with Asn91, Lys95, Glu96, and Phe136, Tyr144, Asn145, and Asn146 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B and C</xref>). A complete listing of the derived potential interactions is available in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2-data">Supplementary file 2</xref>, which due to the limited resolution of the complex structure must remain tentative. What is clear from the structure is that mAb c12 recognizes a discontinuous epitope that contains at least 17 residues distributed over four PfCyRPA sequence stretches (marked in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>).</p><p>The epitope extracted from the complex structure matches the binding pattern of mAb c12 to the PfCyRPA fragments in our epitope analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>): only fragments 1–3 containing all the seventeen interaction sites were recognized by mAb c12. Furthermore, fragment 4, lacking three out of these 17 residues (Tyr144, Asn145, and Asn146) and fragments 5 and 6, lacking four residues (Asn45, Val46, Pro47, and Asp66), were not recognized by mAb c12.</p><p>The PfCyRPA epitope recognized by mAb c12 was further verified by mutagenesis.

When Asp66 was changed to Lys, a capture ELISA detected significantly weaker binding of the mAb c12 to the Asp66Lys variant of PfCyRPA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>). As expected, the Asp66Lys replacement did not affect binding of the control mAb SB1.6 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>), which belongs to the unrelated epitope group F and is expected to engage in crucial interactions with PfCyRPA residues located between residues 181 and 251 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>).<fig id="fig6" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.20383.016</object-id><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><title>Identification of Asp66 as a key contact residue for PfCyRPA/c12 interaction.</title><p>mAb binding to purified wild-type PfCyRPA and an Asp66Lys single amino acid sequence variant was analyzed by capture-ELISA experiments.

Recent studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Reddy et al., 2015</xref>) have placed PfCyRPA in a ternary complex with PfRH5 and PfRipr that as a whole is essential for erythrocyte invasion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Volz et al., 2016</xref>). Like PfRH5 and PfRipr (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Baum et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chen et al., 2011b</xref>), PfCyRPA is refractory to genetic disruption (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Reddy et al., 2015</xref>), and loss of PfCyRPA or PFRH5 function in conditionally expressing mutants blocks parasite growth due to the inability of merozoites to invade erythrocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Volz et al., 2016</xref>). Here, we show that antibodies against PfRH5 and PfCyRPA have additive parasite growth inhibitory activity. Inclusion of both antigens into a multivalent subunit vaccine therefore represents an attractive strategy to prevent emergence of escape mutants. While an ortholog of PfCyRPA is also present in the genome of the human parasite <italic>P. vivax</italic>, an ortholog of PfRH5 has only been found so far in the genome of <italic>P. reichenowi</italic>, a chimpanzee malaria parasite closely related to <italic>P. falciparum</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Otto et al., 2014</xref>). This may indicate a function of PfCyRPA beyond its role as a protein-binding platform in the ternary complex with PfRH5 and PfRipr. While it has been claimed that PfCyRPA anchors the ternary complex through a GPI anchor to the parasite membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Reddy et al., 2015</xref>), recent results are not consistent with this suggestion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Volz et al., 2016</xref>). This inconsistency suggests that additional proteins might be involved in anchoring the complex to the parasite membrane and that PfCyRPA has an essential function other than that of an anchor. Further functional studies are required to elucidate the molecular mechanisms how the ternary complex is involved in the triggering of Ca<sup>2+</sup> release and the establishment of tight junctions between the merozoite and the erythrocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Volz et al., 2016</xref>). In this context, it may be relevant that the five sequential disulfide bonds of PfCyRPA are in blades 1–5, leaving blade 6 of the β-propeller structure without such a local stabilization. Blade six is constructed by β-strands from the N- and the C-terminus, and in principle could act as a gate to allow PfCyRPA to undergo substantial conformational changes.</p><p>Structural vaccinology defines epitopes from antigen-antibody complex crystal structures and thus allows the design of surrogate antigens that elicit protective humoral immune responses.

The epitope recognized by mAb c12 is monomorphic and, like PfCyRPA in general, little immunogenic in the natural context. Focusing the vaccine-induced immune response on this PfCyRPA epitope may confer a strong protective effect.</p><p>Malaria vaccine candidates based on single-antigens have been uniformly unsuccessful and an effective subunit vaccine will likely have to include antigens from more than one stage of the parasite life cycle (pre-erythrocytic, liver stage, and blood stage components), as well as sexual blood-stage gametocyte or mosquito-stage parasite antigens as transmission-blocking components.

With the availability of structural analyses for both PfCyRPA and PfRH5 in complex with an inhibitory antibody, a structure-based approach is now possible.

Complex-containing fractions were pooled and analyzed for homogeneity by asymmetric flow field-flow fractionation with static multi-angle light scattering (SEC/AF4-MALS). For the expression of the Asp66Lys PfCyRPA variant and PfRH5, FreeStyle 293 F cells were cultured in suspension in serum-free medium (FreeStyle 293 Expression Medium, Thermo Fisher Scientific) at 37°C in a humidified incubator with 5% CO<sub>2</sub> in 125 mL shake flasks. Cells were diluted 1:2 with fresh culture medium and transfected at 10<sup>6</sup> cells/mL with 0.5 mg/L expression plasmid using the 293fectin transfection reagent (Thermo Fisher Scientific). 72 hr post-transfection, cells were removed by centrifugation, and the His<sub>6</sub>-tagged recombinant Asp66Lys PfCyRPA variant was purified by immobilized metal ion affinity chromatography on a HisTrap HP column (1 mL volume; GE-Healthcare) equilibrated with 50 mM Na-phosphate buffer pH 7.2, 500 mM NaCl. After washing the column with the same buffer containing 20 mM imidazole, the protein was eluted (isocratic elution) with 500 mM imidazole over five column volumes.</p><p>FreeStyle 293 F cells were tested and shown to be free of mycoplasma using MycoAlert Mycoplasma detection kit (Lonza; LT07-318). Identity of cells was confirmed using STR-PCR (Qiagen; Investigator Idplex Pkus Kit, 381625) from genomic DNA purified using High Pure PCR Template Kit (Roche Applied Science 11796828001). The obtained profile was compared to the database available from DSMZ and found to match the HEK293 profile.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Expression of PfCyRPA fragments on the surface of HEK cells</title><p>293 HEK cells (ATCC, CRL-1573) expressing PfCyRPA fragments on the cell surface were generated essentially as described previously by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Dreyer et al.

Briefly, DNA sequences coding for the fragments of PfCyRPA were amplified by PCR from the BVM_PFD1130W_FLAG_GP_His plasmid (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Dreyer et al., 2010</xref>). These expression vectors allow the anchoring of the protein of interest on the cell surface via the transmembrane domain of mouse glycophorin-A (GP). In addition, they contain the secretion signal of bee-venom melittin (BMV), a FLAG tag located extracellularly, and a His<sub>6</sub>-tag located in the cytosol. The 293 HEK cells were transfected with the different expression vectors using JetPEI transfection reagent (PolyPlus) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Transient transfectants were harvested 48 hr post-transfection.

Peptides were separated on a Waters BEH130 C18 1.7 µm UPLC column (0.3 × 150 mm<sup>2</sup>) by a 5–45% gradient of acetonitrile in water containing 0.1% HCOOH at a flow rate of 10 µL/min over 90 min and eluted into the mass spectrometer.

If not stated otherwise crystals were cryo-protected with paraffin oil and vitrified in liquid N<sub>2</sub>. A non-glycosylated variant of PfCyRPA (residues Asp29–Glu362, N145Q/N322Q/N338Q) did not yield well-diffracting crystals unless pre-treated with proteases. 1 mg/mL PfCyRPA in 50 mM Tris/HCl pH 7.4, 150 mM NaCl was diluted 1:1 with 10 mM HEPES/NaOH pH 7.5, 500 mM NaCl, subjected for 16 hr to a panel of twelve proteases (Hampton Research Proti-Ace Kit) at a final concentration of 0.01 mg/mL, and analyzed by reducing SDS-PAGE (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>). Of the proteases that changed the apparent molecular mass of PfCyRPA, subtilisin and proteinase K produced multiple bands, while Glu-C, elastase, and thermolysin produced a single band of slightly smaller apparent molecular mass. The thermolysin-treated PfCyRPA was subjected to crystallization, yielding triclinic crystals upon mixing of 120 nL 7.3 mg/mL PfCyRPA in 50 mM Tris/HCl pH 7.4, 150 mM NaCl with 80 nL of precipitant consisting of 0.2 M LiOAc and 20% (w/v) PEG 3350. These crystals are consistent with four molecules per unit cell but did not diffract X-rays beyond a resolution of 3.3 Å. Actinase E-treatment of PfCyRPA results in a different proteolysis pattern with two bands of apparent molecular mass 17 kDa and 20 kDa (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>). Thin, plate-shaped monoclinic crystals diffracting to a maximum resolution of about 2.5 Å were obtained from mixing of 100 or 140 nL 15 mg/mL Actinase E-treated PfCyRPA in 50 mM HEPES/NaOH pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl with 100 nL and 60 nL precipitants consisting of 0–0.5 M MgCl<sub>2</sub> and 20–25% PEG 3350. Crystals of the same habit were also obtained from 7.6 mg/mL PfCyRPA mixed with 19% PEG 3350, 0.3 M MgCl<sub>2</sub> and additional 5 mM CaCl<sub>2</sub>, SrCl<sub>2</sub>, and BaCl<sub>2</sub>. Data collected from crystals grown in the presence of the heavier cations were tested for anomalous and isomorphous information content for phasing, which turned out to be negative.</p><p>Fab of mAb c12 crystallized from several conditions and its structure was determined in three crystal settings. Crystals were obtained by mixing of 80 nL 16.6 mg/mL c12 in 20 mM bis-Tris propane/HCl pH 7.0, 200 mM NaCl with 120 nL of precipitants consisting of 1.6 M sodium citrate pH 6.5 (hexagonal crystal form) or 0.1 M HEPES/NaOH pH 7.0, 20% w/v PEG 8000 (monoclinic and orthorhombic crystal forms). Monoclinic crystals were cryo-protected with reservoir solution supplemented with 20% glycerol.</p><p>Needle-shaped crystals of the PfCyRPA/c12 complex were obtained by mixing 120 nL of a 15.1 mg/mL solution in 50 mM Tris/HCl pH 7.4, 150 mM NaCl with 80 nL reservoir consisting of 0.1 M Sodium citrate pH 5.5, 17 % w/v PEG 5000 MME, 0.2 M NDSB-201 (non-detergent sulfobetaine). Cryo-protection was achieved with reservoir solution supplemented with 20% ethylene glycol.</p><p>Diffraction data were collected at Swiss Light Source beamline PX-II on a Pilatus 6M single photon counting detector using 1 Å radiation over a total range of at least 180° in fine slicing mode (Δϕ = 0.25°). Data were indexed, integrated, and scaled with XDS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Kabsch, 2010</xref>), except for data from the hexagonal form of c12, which was integrated with MOSFLM and scaled with AIMLESS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">The collaborative computational project number 4, 1994</xref>). The high-resolution limit was chosen as the shell where the correlation coefficient for half datasets CC<sub>1/2</sub> dropped below 70%. Data sets were tested for internal symmetry by self-Patterson and self-rotation function analyses (not shown). Twinning was excluded based on L-values and second moments. Data collection and also refinement statistics are collected in S1 Table.</p></sec><sec id="s4-10"><title>Structure determination and refinement</title><p>The presence of a short sequence motif in PfCyRPA that is characteristic for sialidases suggested that a six-bladed β-propeller might serve as a molecular replacement model. However, all attempts using several hundred β-propeller structures as search models both with and without loop regions and/or as poly-Ala models were unsuccessful. Sialidases often contain structural Ca<sup>2+</sup> ions, which prompted co-crystallization of PfCyRPA with the earth alkali cations Ca<sup>2+</sup>, Sr<sup>2+</sup>, and Ba<sup>2+</sup> for SIRAS phasing, but none of these provided useful derivatives. Attempts to phase the PfCyRPA diffraction data by sulfur-SAD were also unsuccessful. Packing density estimations indicated two molecules of PfCyRPA in the monoclinic asymmetric unit. The PfCyRPA data could be phased by molecular replacement using the unexplained electron density of the PfCyRPA/c12 complex (see below) as a search model. The volume of density was separated using a mask, placed in a large cubic cell, and back transformed to yield structure factor amplitudes, which were then used in a PHASER (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">The collaborative computational project number 4, 1994</xref>) molecular replacement search for two molecules. The solution had a non-random log-likelihood gain of LLG = 175 and the orientations of the two entities replicated the 180° two-fold NCS (non-crystallographic symmetry) estimated from the self-rotation function. Density averaging using PARROT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">The collaborative computational project number 4, 1994</xref>) and the NCS operator defined by the two PHASER solutions resulted in manually interpretable electron density maps. The final model has a discontinuity at Asp189, which is consistent with cleavage of a surface loop by Actinase E. A symmetry-related PfCyRPA occupies the space liberated by the cleaved loop, explaining the necessity of the proteolytic pre-treatment for crystal formation in this setting. The model was refined using automatically generated NCS restraints excluding diverging surface loop regions. 99.5% of all residues are in the favored regions of the Ramachandran plot. The hexagonal dataset of c12 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Supplementary file 1</xref>) was phased by molecular replacement using a homology model generated from the c12 sequence in MOE (Chemical Computing Group) as the search model. Separate searches for the variable and constant parts of the Fab were performed in PHASER, which, as anticipated, placed the V<sub>H</sub>V<sub>L</sub> and C<sub>H</sub>C<sub>L</sub> domain boundaries close to each other to generate a complete Fab. The final model has 99.2% of all residues in the favored regions of the Ramachandran plot. The monoclinic and orthorhombic c12 datasets were phased using the refined hexagonal c12 structure as molecular replacement search model. Both structures have 98% of their main-chain torsion angles in the favored region of the Ramachandran plot. Elbow angles were calculated with PHENIX (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Adams et al., 2010</xref>).</p><p>According to the Matthews parameter, the 4 Å dataset collected from the PfCyRPA/c12 crystal has enough space per asymmetric unit to harbor a single complex. Molecular replacement readily placed c12, and initial maps calculated from this partial solution revealed additional electron density at the tips of the Fab (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>), which occupied a volume large enough to host PfCyRPA. The density resembled a β-propeller but was not interpretable due to the limited resolution of the data. However, this density provided enough phasing power to solve the 2.5 Å PfCyRPA structure (see above), showing that the placement of the Fab was correct. The same arrangement of V<sub>H</sub>V<sub>L</sub> and C<sub>H</sub>C<sub>L</sub> was obtained when using the V<sub>H</sub>V<sub>L</sub> and C<sub>H</sub>C<sub>L</sub> parts of the Fab as separate search models, indicating that the elbow angle of c12 does not change upon binding to PfCyRPA. The final model of PfCyRPA was used to complete the molecular replacement phasing of the PfCyRPA/c12 complex (log-likelihood gain of &gt;1260), density for which is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2</xref>. A loop region not present in the PfCyRPA model could be traced in the electron density of the complex (Panel B in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>), establishing confidence in the correctness of the molecular replacement solution. The model of the complex was refined according to established protocols for lower resolution structures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">DeLaBarre and Brunger, 2006</xref>), that is using simulated annealing, group ADP values, automatically assigned TLS definitions, secondary structure restraints, and external restraints provided by the higher resolution individual structures of PfCyRPA and c12. No real-space refinement was applied during building and refinement of the PfCyRPA/c12 complex. Strong geometric restraints were applied throughout model building of the PfCyRPA/c12 complex. All models were built with COOT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Emsley et al., 2010</xref>) and refined with PHENIX (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Adams et al., 2010</xref>).</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We thank Marcello Foggetta and Martin Siegrist for cell transfection.

Your article has been favorably evaluated by Wenhui Li (Senior Editor) and four reviewers, one of whom, Stephen C. Harrison (Reviewer #4), is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Matthew K Higgins (Reviewer #2).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you consider preparing a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>CyRPA is an important red cell invasion protein that forms a complex with RH5 and RIPR. <italic>P. falciparum</italic> parasites use this complex to engage the host cell receptor, basigin, during parasite invasion of red cells. CyRPA and RH5 are both candidate vaccine immunogens, as antibodies directed against these proteins potently neutralize parasites. This manuscript extends our knowledge of antibody neutralization by showing that single monoclonals against CyRPA and RH5 act additively to provide enhanced neutralization. This result suggests that combined use of both proteins may be beneficial for vaccine development.</p><p>The authors report the structure of CyRPA at 2.5 Å resolution, which shows that it has a neuraminidase fold but lacks sialidase activity, thus indicating a non-enzymatic function. The authors also describe a structure of CyRPA bound with the Fab of neutralizing antibody c12, at to a reported 3.6 Å resolution, and validate the interaction site using a single point mutant and truncation analysis. For the most part the antibody data and the structure of CyRPA alone appear to be well done, but the reviewers have substantive concerns with the structure of CyRPA in complex with c12. Both structures are timely and relevant for the future of malaria vaccines, and the manuscript would have been suitable for publication in <italic>eLife</italic> were the structural results for the c12 complex more solid. If the structure with c12 has problems, the vaccine development focus of the manuscript is not justified and the manuscript less compelling overall. There are also concerns about the experiments on additivity of antibodies directed against RH5 and CyRPA, the other novel claim. We invite the authors to consider responding with a revised manuscript (and appropriate experiments and computations) to the concerns summarized below. We caution that relatively extensive new information will be required for a favorable outcome.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The expression of fragments of a single domain, even if it turns out to be one that is sequential in its fold (a β-propeller), generally gives unfolded polypeptide chain. Unless the fragments in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> have the correct S-S bonds within the blades that are present (are the chosen limits at positions between blades?), then they can only define linear epitopes – likely to be the least interesting ones. Moreover, in the cases in which there is no binding, have the authors demonstrated that the fragment is even expressed on the cell surface?</p><p>2) In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref> the GIA data are shown simply as 'yes' or 'no'. The GIA assays used throughout seem to diverge from the standardised GIA assay in the NIH GIA reference laboratory used by many studies. This divergence makes it hard to compare how inhibitory the mAbs are when compared with other mAbs from published studies. The selling point for this paper is the ability to use this information for 'structural vaccinology' but without a real quantitative comparison of the mAbs used with the best from other studies, it is hard to know whether this c12 mAb is worth recapitulating in a vaccination attempt. More standardised and quantitative GIA would be important to make this conclusion. Indeed, the data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> do suggest that rather high concentrations of these mAbs are required to see an inhibitory effect.</p><p>3) Because the CyRPA is a conserved protein across several Plasmodium species as well as <italic>P. falciparum</italic> isolates, at least one reviewer would have liked to see data showing whether the inhibitory mAb inhibits strains other than 3D7. There is no mention of the specificity or the istotype of the control mAbs. Finally, it is important to show that mAbs specific for proteins other than RH5 do not have the same additive effect with anti-PfCyRPA. That control is missing here.</p><p>4) A key point for vaccine development is to show sterilizing immunity by targeting RH5 and CyRPA. In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>, however, the authors do not show the sterilizing immunity that would be expected if the 2.5 mg CS1.2 and 2.5 mg c12 combination was tested. Was this performed? If not, why not? Since the authors have shown previously that c12 inhibits invasion, the only novelty here is the combination.</p><p>5) The authors seem to have little experience with relatively low resolution structures, and their description of the refinement of the complex between Fab and PfCyRPA as &quot;unsatisfactory&quot; (subsection “Characterization of the epitope recognized by the parasite growth inhibitory anti-PfCyRPA mAb c12”, second paragraph) undermines confidence in the rest of the analysis, as one wonders whether the crystallographers involved (who are they?) really know how to look at a lower resolution map and how to avoid the pitfalls. Since both structures have been refined at quite high resolution, and since even the CDR loops of the Fabs do not vary much from crystal form to crystal form, it seems quite odd that the complex is so poorly determined. Specific points to consider are some red flags from data reduction statistics. Using the CC1/2 as the resolution cutoff criterion gives Rmeas of 59.5 in the outer bin (high for a low symmetry space group like P21) and I/sig(I) of 0.4 (and only 2.6 for the entire dataset).

Since the authors have shown previously that c12 inhibits invasion, the only novelty here is the combination.</italic> </p><p>While sterilizing immunity is an optimal effect of a vaccine, evidence generated so far for malaria indicates that this goal may be too ambitious for a single stage malaria vaccine. Classical passive transfer studies with serum antibodies from adults from malaria endemic areas by Cohen and others (e.g. Cohen et al., Nature 1961, 192:733–737 and Sabchareon et al., Am J Trop Med Hyg. 1991, 45(3):297-308), have shown that antibodies can reduce parasitemia considerably, but cannot confer sterile immunity. Maintenance of a basal parasitemia, which does not cause severe disease symptoms, is even considered by some experts in the field as desirable in order to confer booster effects.</p><p>In fact, we observe with anti-PfCyRPA and anti-PfRH5 antibodies a saturation effect without reaching sterile immunity. For investigating synergistic and additive effects, we had to use limited antibody concentrations.</p><p>Our results demonstrated that anti-PfCyRPA and anti-PfRH5 antibodies have an additive parasite growth inhibitory effect, justifying the combination of both antigens in a subunit vaccine. This is indeed highly relevant for vaccine development since the incorporation of the two vaccine components would help in preventing escape variant selection.</p><p><italic>5) The authors seem to have little experience with relatively low resolution structures, and their description of the refinement of the complex between Fab and PfCyRPA as &quot;unsatisfactory&quot; (subsection “Characterization of the epitope recognized by the parasite growth inhibitory anti-PfCyRPA mAb c12”, second paragraph) undermines confidence in the rest of the analysis, as one wonders whether the crystallographers involved (who are they?) really know how to look at a lower resolution map and how to avoid the pitfalls.</italic> </p><p>The crystallographer in charge is M. Rudolph (trained with Ingrid Vetter, Ilme Schlichting, and Ian A. Wilson). The reviewer is correct that low resolution structures are not regular cases for us. We have tested various refinement strategies recommended by the PHENIX, CNS, BUSTER, and CCP4 developers. The refinement strategy that returned the best model, judged by R<sub>free</sub> and the all-atom clash score (7.8) was similar to what was applied for other lower resolution structures, e.g. in Bradley et al. (2016; PMID 26725118) and Corbett et al. (2010; PMID 20723757): rigid body refinement of individual domains during molecular replacement, imposition of secondary structure restraints during positional refinement, and TLS and group ADP refinement for B-values. Additionally, the high resolution structures were used as reference models during refinement. The resulting PfCyRPA/c12 structure has much improved (~2% in R<sub>free</sub>), and we have removed the part “…and unsatisfactory refinement statistics of this structure…” in the manuscript.

Also, the molecular replacement solution, judged by the same result using two different approaches, must be correct. Another strong argument for the correctness of the molecular replacement solution of the complex is the fact that when placing only the Fab, the remaining electron density, although uninterpretable, could be used as a search model for phasing the PfCyRPA data. We are convinced that this phasing strategy would not have been possible had the Fab been placed wrongly. This has been emphasized in the Methods section by stating: “Molecular replacement readily placed c12, and initial maps calculated from this partial solution revealed additional electron density at the tips of the Fab (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>), which occupied a volume large enough to host PfCyRPA. […] The same arrangement of Fv and Fc was obtained when using the Fv and Fc parts of the Fab as separate search models, indicating that the elbow angle of c12 does not change upon binding to PfCyRPA.”</p><p>The Methods section has been expanded to make it clear that model building and refinement were done carefully:</p><p>“The final model of PfCyRPA was used to complete the molecular replacement phasing of the PfCyRPA/c12 complex (log-likelihood gain of &gt;1260), density for which is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2</xref>.

The usual resolutions of the datasets obtained is about 8 Å, and merging of data from several crystals in order to obtain higher multiplicity and better I/σ at least in the low resolution bins was unsuccessful, as judged by high merging R-values. Processing of datasets from isomorphous crystals was performed using the 4 Å dataset as a reference to avoid indexing ambiguities that would impede merging.</p><p>We would love to get better data, but currently we are unable to provide them. The biological question answered by the PfCyRPA/c12 complex structure was where the epitope of this neutralizing antibody on PfCyRPA was.
