However, a number of bacterial pathogens are resistant to the antimicrobial activities of macrophages and can grow within these cells. Macrophages have other immune surveillance roles including the acquisition of cytosolic components from multiple types of cells.

We found that viable <italic>Francisella tularensis</italic>, as well as <italic>Salmonella enterica</italic> bacteria transferred from infected cells to uninfected macrophages along with other cytosolic material through a transient, contact dependent mechanism. Bacterial transfer occurred when the host cells exchanged plasma membrane proteins and cytosol via a trogocytosis related process leaving both donor and recipient cells intact and viable.

In doing so, these bacteria can avoid being recognized and killed by the host’s immune system. However, the ability of the bacteria to grow within the cell is constrained by the limited space and nutrients that are available inside the infected cell. The current theory is that most of these bacteria eventually kill the cell they have infected and are released into the body so that they can infect other host cells. However, since some host cells can exchange material with their neighbors, it is also possible that the bacteria may be able to travel directly between host cells without leaving the safety of the cell environment.</p><p>Macrophages are immune cells that patrol the body to identify and destroy damaged host cells, bacteria and other microbes. Macrophages are also able to interact with neighboring healthy cells through a process called trogocytosis (“trogo” is essentially Greek for nibble). During this process, the membranes of the two participating cells briefly fuse and some of the proteins in the membranes are transferred from one cell to the other. Afterwards, the two cells separate but retain the membrane proteins they acquired from the other cell. The purpose of trogocytosis is poorly understood, but it is thought to help the host to develop immune responses against microbes and tumors.</p><p>Steele et al. investigated whether infected mouse and human cells can transfer bacteria to healthy macrophages during trogocytosis. The experiments show that two types of bacteria – called <italic>Francisella tularensis</italic> and <italic>Salmonella enterica</italic> – can transfer from infected cells to macrophages via trogocytosis. Furthermore, the cells of mice infected with <italic>F. tularensis</italic> were more likely to undergo trogocytosis, which suggests that the bacterium may promote and use this process to spread throughout tissues in the body.</p><p>Together, Steele et al.’s finding show that some bacteria can hijack a naturally occurring cellular process to move between host cells without re-entering the space that surrounds cells, or damaging either the donor or recipient cell.The next steps following on from this work are to find out how much trogocytosis contributes to the spread and progression of disease. A future goal is to understand the molecular mechanism of trogocytosis so it may be possible to develop drugs that can inhibit the spread of the bacteria in patients.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.10625.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.10625.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>trogocytosis</kwd><kwd>cell to cell spread</kwd><kwd>francisella tularensis</kwd><kwd>salmonella typhimurium</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd><kwd>Other</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>National Instutes of Health Award</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>AI082870</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kawula</surname><given-names>Thomas H</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>UNC Graduate School Dissertation Award</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Steele</surname><given-names>Shaun</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Live intracellular bacterial pathogens can transfer from infected cells to uninfected macrophages upon cell-to-cell contact.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>All intracellular pathogens enter and replicate inside some type of host cell. At the earliest stage of disease only a limited number of host cells will be infected. In order to successfully continue propagation intracellular pathogens must continually infect new susceptible cells. Most of these organisms are thought to infect a cell, replicate, re-enter the extracellular space and start the process over again. However, re-entering the extracellular space exposes the pathogen to antibodies, complement, and other extracellular antimicrobial factors that can inhibit their growth or block their entry into new cells. It is therefore not surprising that certain intracellular pathogens have evolved mechanisms to transfer directly from infected to uninfected cells. The majority of intracellular bacterial pathogens that are known to transfer directly from cell to cell do so through a process known as actin based motility. While there are modest variations in the specific mechanisms employed by individual species, in general the process is pathogen driven through the expression of effector proteins that nucleate and polymerize host cell actin in a manner that physically propels the bacteria into a neighboring cell (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Ireton, 2013</xref>).</p><p>There are, however, natural host cell processes that transfer cytosolic material that could be exploited by intracellular pathogens to facilitate direct cell to cell spread. Many recent studies have demonstrated that host cells can exchange cytosolic or membrane materials with neighboring cells through contact-dependent mechanisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Joly and Hudrisier, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Rogers and Bhattacharya, 2013</xref>). The exchange of cytosolic components occurs in different contexts across a wide range of distinct cells types, and there are several morphologically distinct mechanisms that exchange cytosolic material, including nanotubes, gap junctions, cytonemes and synapses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Onfelt et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Rogers and Bhattacharya, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Kanaporis et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Roy et al., 2014</xref>). The different exchange mechanism morphologies are associated with the transfer of specific types of material. For example, gap junctions are selectively permeable to ions and small molecules while nanotubes can transfer functional organelles from a donor to a recipient cell (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Onfelt et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Kanaporis et al., 2011</xref>). Certain viral pathogens are known to transfer directly from cell to cell by exploiting one or more of these natural cellular processes. For example, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) transfers between cells via tunneling nanotubes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Sowinski et al., 2008</xref>), whereas Human T-lymphotophic virus (HTLV-1) can spread directly from infected to uninfected T-cells through virological synapses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Igakura et al., 2003</xref>).</p><p>The exchange of plasma membrane proteins between eukaryotic cells occurs through a mechanism termed trogocytosis (trogo = Greek for nibble) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Joly and Hudrisier, 2003</xref>). For trogocytosis to occur two cells form a transient intimate interaction during which the membranes appear to fuse. The cells eventually separate, with each participant cell having acquired plasma membrane components from the partner cell. The transferred membrane proteins retain their orientation and their function until they are recycled via normal membrane turnover. In certain mouse tissues, over half of the cells have undergone detectable trogocytosis at any given time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Yamanaka et al., 2009</xref>). In immune cells, trogocytosis leads to a variety of acquired functions that likely impact infection and immunity. For example, trogocytosis improves T cell signaling in response to antigens and dendritic cells can activate T cells after acquiring antigens from neighboring cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Osborne and Wetzel, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Rosenits et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Wakim and Bevan, 2011</xref>). Trogocytosis has been implicated as a critical factor in several pathologies including cancer biology, tissue engraftment, and vaccination efficacy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Li et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Chow et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Chung et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Zhang et al., 2008</xref>). Trogocytosis can occur without the transfer of cytosolic material (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Puaux et al., 2006</xref>), but it is unclear if the presumptive transient membrane fusion that occurs during certain types of cytosolic transfer also results in trogocytosis.</p><p>Although mammalian cells exchange intracellular and membrane material, there is a major gap in our knowledge about how these transfer mechanisms impact the infectious process of intracellular pathogens. Foreign material including beads and <italic>Mycobacterium bovis</italic> have been shown to transfer directly between macrophages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Onfelt et al., 2006</xref>). But it is unclear how prevalent these transfer events are, how they influence pathogenesis, and if these transfer events benefit the pathogen (through cell to cell spread), the host (via immune detection or pathogen destruction upon transfer), or some combination of each. These questions are important because direct cell to cell transfer via cytosolic exchange could be a critical part of the infectious life-cycle for certain intracellular pathogens. For example, an estimated 60% of cells infected by HIV occur through direct viral transfer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Iwami et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>To investigate how cytosolic transfer affects intracellular pathogens, we used the macrophage-tropic, facultative intracellular bacterium <italic>Francisella tularensis</italic> as a model pathogen. Importantly, <italic>F. tularensis</italic> has not been shown to transfer between cells and lacks homologs of proteins that other bacteria use to transfer between cells. But the rapid spread of <italic>F. tularensis</italic> to new cells and cell types during infection suggests that direct cell to cell transfer may occur (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Hall et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Roberts et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Lindemann et al., 2011</xref>). Here, we demonstrate that live <italic>F. tularensis</italic> bacteria transfer directly from infected cells to macrophages via a contact and cytosolic exchange dependent mechanism. Direct bacterial transfer appears to occur frequently both in vitro and in a mouse infection model. Bacterial transfer was cell type specific and correlated strongly with trogocytosis, specifically the exchange of functional major histocompatibility complex I (MHC-I). Lastly, we observed similar transfer events during infections with <italic>Salmonella enterica</italic> or fluorescent beads, suggesting that trogocytosis-associated cell to cell transfer may be a commonly exploited phenomenon.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title><italic>Francisella tularensis</italic> transfers between macrophages during cytosolic exchange</title><p><italic>Francisella tularensis</italic> is a highly infectious zoonotic bacterial pathogen that is capable of invading and replicating in numerous cell types including, but not limited to, epithelial cells and macrophages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Hall et al., 2008</xref>).

To test if the transferred bacteria could sustain infection, we infected approximately 1% of a BMDM population then added soy lecithin to inhibit cell to cell contact dependent bacterial transfer. We monitored bacterial viability over 3 days. Cells that cannot directly transfer bacteria will lyse after peak infection (~24 hr), releasing their bacteria into antibiotic containing media. If the bacteria in the untreated cells survive transfer and are able to proliferate, bacterial viability should be higher in these samples than samples treated with soy lecithin at time points after peak infection. We found that both wild-type and transfer-inhibited cells reached peak infection at 24 hr post inoculation, but the lecithin treated samples had significantly fewer viable bacteria compared to untreated samples at 48 and 72 hr post inoculation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>).

This cytosolic exchange mechanism is associated with trogocytosis, which is classically defined as the exchange of plasma membrane proteins between two cells. Given that lecithin inhibited both plasma membrane protein and bacterial transfer suggests that trogocytosis and cytosolic exchange are linked with respect to the mechanism of bacterial cell to cell transfer. The bacteria are viable after transfer and can use direct cell to cell transfer to sustain infection without entering the extracellular space. During infections, trogocytosis-associated transfer is a likely mechanism for <italic>F. tularensis</italic> dissemination. Alveolar macrophages are essentially the only cell type initially infected by <italic>F. tularensis</italic> following intranasal inoculation in mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Roberts et al., 2014</xref>). Prior to peak infection dendritic cells become infected with <italic>F. tularensis</italic> and these newly infected cells traffic to the draining lymph node (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Bar-Haim et al., 2008</xref>). We postulate that direct cell to cell transfer is the mechanism for the bacteria to transfer from alveolar macrophages to these dendritic cells. Subsequent transfer events may also contribute to systemic dissemination from the lymph node.</p><p>An important question is why certain bacterial species evolved mechanisms to transfer between cells if bacteria can already transfer through cytosolic exchange. In a confluent monolayer of primary cells, only 10–20% of macrophages became infected with <italic>F. tularensis</italic> via trogocytosis-associated transfer in a 6 hr interval (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). The efficiency of transfer is probably far lower in an infected host because fewer cells are infected and the concentrations of macrophages are much lower. Bacteria that encode mechanisms such as actin based motility likely increase the rate of cell to cell spread. Additionally, certain bacterial species use actin based motility to transfer between epithelial and endothelial cells, whereas <italic>F. tularensis</italic> does not (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Makino et al., 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Heinzen et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Reed et al., 2014</xref>). It is possible these transfer mechanisms evolved so that these bacteria can transfer between cells types that do not undergo trogocytosis-associated transfer or to increase the rate of transfer.</p><p>Bacterial transfer through a trogocytosis-like process is limited to specific recipient cell types, suggesting that this transfer mechanism is a host mediated event. The spread of bacteria aids in expanding the replicative niche and possibly dissemination. So why would the host undergo a process that is so potentially deleterious? In cancer biology, trogocytosis of pMHC-I and pMHC-II results in a cytotoxic T cell response to the tumor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Dolan et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Zhang et al., 2008</xref>). The immune system may use a similar tactic during infection. Epithelial cells transfer whole antigen to macrophages and dendritic cells to initiate a T cell response via cytosolic exchange (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Ramirez and Sigal, 2002</xref>). Trogocytosis-associated transfer may be the mechanism for this antigenic dissemination. Our work focused on macrophages because <italic>F. tularensis</italic> primarily infects this cell type. However, macrophages are not an ideal cell type to stimulate an adaptive immune response. Future work on trogocytosis-associated transfer in dendritic cells or in the context of adaptive immunity may reveal an important immunological function for this process.</p><p>An unexpected observation from our work was that the rate of trogocytosis increased during infection in primary cells and in a mouse infection model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>). These results suggest that infected cells expressed a signal of some kind that initiated, enhanced, or stabilized trogocytosis. This signal is likely not soluble or generalizable because the frequency of trogocytosis only increased in infected cells, not neighboring uninfected cells in the same experimental sample. Trogocytosis is an important immunological process with broad consequences on host engraftment, vaccine efficacy, immune regulation and tumor recognition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Chow et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Zhang et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Li et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Gu et al., 2012</xref>). Our results indicate that a bacterial stimulus increases the rate of trogocytosis. Future efforts to discern the bacterial products or processes responsible for trogocytosis up-regulation may lead to a specific tool to manipulate trogocytosis.</p><p>Trogocytosis-associated bacterial transfer is likely beneficial to both the host and macrophage-tropic pathogens depending on the context. Based on our results, we postulate that trogocytosis-associated transfer benefits certain pathogens early during infection by enhancing dissemination, but could also help initialize or propagate a T cell response that eventually clears the pathogen. Future studies on how this process impacts pathogenesis will likely improve our understanding of how bacteria spread in the host and how the innate immune system acquires antigen to initiate the adaptive immune response.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Bacterial growth</title><p><italic>Francisella tularensis</italic> subsp. <italic>tularensis</italic> Schu S4 was obtained from Biodefense and Emerging Infectious Research Resources Repository (BEI Resources) and <italic>Francisella tularensis</italic> subsp. <italic>holartica</italic> live vaccine strain (LVS) expressing GFP was generated as described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Hall et al., 2008</xref>).

Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a guest Reviewing Editor and Richard Losick as the Senior Editor. The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the guest Reviewing editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>The authors have tested the hypothesis that intracellular pathogens that can replicate within macrophages exploit cytosolic transfer to facilitate bacterial spread. Here they show that viable <italic>Francisella</italic> transfer from infected macrophages to uninfected macrophages along with other cytosolic material through a transient, contact dependent mechanism. The authors describe this as a trogocytosis related process that leaves both donor and recipient cells intact and viable. The mouse results suggest that this process is strongly associated with infection in a mammalian host.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Address the reviewers’ concerns about the lack of specificity of lecithin. Does lecithin restrict bacteria to the originally infected population? Does lecithin impair plasma membrane protein transfer under the authors' experimental conditions? Alternatively, the use of more specific means to impair trogocytosis would substantiate this aspect of the study.</p><p>2) Provide evidence that the propidium iodide assay reliably detects non-viable bacteria and is not subject to a high level of false-negatives due to PI accessibility issues.</p><p>3) Rewrite the manuscript to increase clarity. For example, the explanation of experiments is too short and it is often not clear why and how the experiments are being done.</p><p>4) Improve the statistical analyses and the descriptions of these analyses.</p><p>5) Extend the Introduction.</p><p>6) The authors should discuss clearly that the mechanism of bacterial transfer is different from classical trogocytosis in which no cytosolic transfer is described.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were requested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for resubmitting your work entitled &quot;Trogocytosis-Associated Cell to Cell Spread of Intracellular Bacterial Pathogens&quot; for further consideration at <italic>eLife</italic>.

Does lecithin restrict bacteria to the originally infected population? Does lecithin impair plasma membrane protein transfer under the authors' experimental conditions?

This is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>. Lecithin also inhibits plasma membrane protein transfer (trogocytosis). We have added these data to the revised manuscript (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2B</xref>). We screened over 50 compounds looking for non-lethal treatments that inhibited cell-to-cell spread and/or trogocytosis. Soy lecithin was the only non-toxic product we found that inhibited these events without also destroying the host cell cytoskeleton.</p><p> <italic>2) Provide evidence that the propidium iodide assay reliably detects non-viable bacteria and is not subject to a high level of false-negatives due to PI accessibility issues.</italic> </p><p>We used an intracellular growth impaired mutant △FTT-0924 (Brunton et al. 2015. <italic>Infec</italic> Immun. 83(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">8</xref>):3015-2) as a control for propidium iodide access and binding to dead intracellular bacteria.

Specifically to this point we added a clear classical definition/description of trogocytosis in the Introduction (third paragraph), and added a comment in the Discussion to the effect that our data suggest that cytosolic exchange may be linked mechanistically to trogocytosis (first paragraph). The latter point has been speculated, but never tested.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were requested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p><italic>The manuscript has been improved but there are some remaining issues that need to be addressed before acceptance, as outlined below: 1) It is very important that you show that pretreatment of BMMs with lecithin does not affect uptake, hence replication of Francisella.

This information is in the “Bacterial transfer inhibition assay” Methods sections (first paragraph), and we have clarified this detail in the Results section (subsection “Viable bacteria transfer between cells to propagate infection”).</p><p><italic>In addition, for <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>, you need to clarify what you are scoring as &quot;infected cells&quot; (these details were not provided): cells with replicating bacteria?

If infected cells were scored regardless of intracellular bacterial numbers, then it shows a lack of cell-to-cell spread in the presence of lecithin.</italic> </p><p>Infected cells were identified by flow cytometry as described in the corresponding Materials and methods section. In theory a cell scored as infected could have as few as one bacterium, and we have established that this procedure is sensitive enough to detect such cells (Hall et al. Infection and Immunity 76 (12): 5843-5852. doi:10.1128/IAI.01176-08). We did however set a conservative gate based on mean fluorescence intensity that was significantly above background to ensure that we counted only infected cell. Thus, as suggested by the reviewer, the results confirm our conclusion that lecithin significantly blocked cell-to-cell spread.
