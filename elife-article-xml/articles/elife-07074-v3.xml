The wrinkly spreader morph of <italic>Pseudomonas fluorescens</italic> arises repeatedly during experimental evolution. The mutational causes reside exclusively within three pathways. By eliminating these, 13 new mutational pathways were discovered with the newly arising WS types having fitnesses similar to those arising from the commonly passaged routes. Our findings show that parallel genetic evolution is strongly biased by constraints and we reveal the genetic bases. From such knowledge, and in instances where new phenotypes arise via gene activation, we suggest a set of principles: evolution proceeds firstly via pathways subject to negative regulation, then via promoter mutations and gene fusions, and finally via activation by intragenic gain-of-function mutations. These principles inform evolutionary forecasting and have relevance to interpreting the diverse array of mutations associated with clinically identical instances of disease in humans.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.07074.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.07074.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.07074.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Different living things often develop similar strategies to adapt to the environments in which they live. Sometimes two species that share a common ancestor independently evolve the same trait by changing the exact same genes. This is called ‘parallel evolution’, and it has led some scientists to ask: are there certain traits that can only evolve in a limited number of ways? Or are there other ways to evolve the same trait that, for some reason, are not explored?</p><p>Experimentally, investigating these questions is challenging, but parallel evolution occurs in the laboratory as well as in the wild. Many commonly studied organisms—such as fruit flies or bacteria—can be used in relevant studies, because they can be grown in large numbers and then exposed to identical environments. However, if this method fails to find a new way that a trait can evolve, it doesn't mean that alternative mechanisms do not exist.</p><p>Lind et al. used a different approach that instead relies on removing all of the known pathways that can be mutated to produce a given trait and then seeing if that trait can still evolve via mutations elsewhere. The experiments involved a bacterium called <italic>Pseudomonas fluorescens</italic> that can evolve to grow flattened and wrinkled colonies (instead of smooth, round ones) when it has to compete for access to oxygen.</p><p>Previous experiments had shown that the evolution of the so-called ‘wrinkly spreader’ form can be caused by mutations in one of three biological pathways. But <italic>P</italic>. <italic>fluorescens</italic> can survive unharmed without these pathways, which enabled Lind et al. to ask if there might be other ways that this trait could evolve. Bacteria without these three pathways were engineered and then grown under oxygen-deprived conditions. This experiment produced 91 new mutants that each had the wrinkly spreader phenotype. Further experiments revealed that together these mutants represented 13 previously unrecognized ways that the ‘wrinkly spreader’ phenotype can evolve.</p><p>The new rare mutants had similar fitness as the previously known, common ones—so this cannot explain why they hadn't been seen before. Lind et al. instead suggest a set of principles to explain why these newly discovered pathways are rarely mutated and how genetic constraints can bias the outcome of evolution. Further work could investigate whether these principles can help us to predict the course of evolution in other biological contexts, such as in the evolution of antibiotic resistance.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.07074.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.07074.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author keywords</title><kwd><italic>Pseudomonas fluorescens</italic> SBW25</kwd><kwd>parallel evolution</kwd><kwd>evolutionary rule</kwd><kwd>diguanylate cyclase</kwd><kwd>bacterial evolution</kwd><kwd>genetic constraint</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Other</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001509</institution-id><institution>Royal Society of New Zealand</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Marsden Fund Council</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Rainey</surname><given-names>Paul B</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funder had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.3</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Genetic architecture governs the evolvability of adaptive paths providing a framework for evolutionary forecasting.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Prediction of evolutionary change from a set of first principles, even in the most elementary of biological systems, has proven difficult (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">de Visser and Krug, 2014</xref>). This is due in part to the stochastic nature of mutation, but also to lack of understanding of the molecular properties of gene products and their interactions, that is, the processes underpinning development of phenotypes—including genetic and developmental constraints—which are themselves a product of the genotype-to-phenotype map (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Pigliucci, 2010</xref>).</p><p>The ubiquity of parallel genetic evolution, observed both in nature and in laboratory experiments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Flowers et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Gerstein et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Meyer et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Zhen et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Herron and Doebeli, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Stern, 2013</xref>) shows that evolution can be highly reproducible. While repeated evolution of similar traits is considered evidence of adaptive evolution, it also suggests the possibility that evolution may be governed by rules that if understood, would lead to a more predictive science (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hansen, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bull and Molineux, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Stern and Orgogozo, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">de Visser and Krug, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Neher et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>Not all explanations for parallel evolution necessitate the existence of underlying rules. If evolution proceeds via a single route—because there is no other—then there is no reason to suppose that evolution is anything other than idiosyncratic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Jost et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Zhen et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Vogwill et al., 2014</xref>). Should evolution proceed along a single pathway when multiple are available and yet the fitness of the phenotype from the common path is superior, then—other than the pleasure of discovery—there is no dilemma to solve. If, however, evolution proceeds along a single pathway and yet that pathway is just one of a number of possible routes to a range of phenotypes with equivalent fitness, then determining the underlying causes becomes a matter of interest. Unfortunately opportunities for discovery of such pathways are limited (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Gompel and Prud'homme, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Stern, 2013</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>).<fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.07074.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Determining the causes of parallel evolution.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) A selective challenge repeatedly leads to a phenotypic adaptation with the same mutational solution represented by red circles.

The outcome of evolution in each population—propagated under identical conditions—can then be determined. Discovery of a novel solution would indicate the existence of at least two pathways—moreover, the relative fitness of types can be determined. While in principle straightforward, progress requires the analysis of many thousands of replicate populations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Desai, 2013</xref>)—or molecules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Ellington, 1994</xref>)—and even if possible, failure to find an alternate route would not mean that one does not exist.</p><p>An alternative approach is to take an experimental system where the most common genetic (mutational) pathways to a particular adaptive phenotype can be identified and then eliminated without deleterious effects on fitness of the ancestral type (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Heineman et al., 2009</xref>). Thus evolution can be re-run from different starting genotypes that differ in the spectrum of pathways available to evolution (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). If the same phenotypic solution can arise from a genotype devoid of the typically used genetic route, then it is clear that evolution has more options at its disposal than are typically realized.</p><p>Precisely this approach was taken previously using experimental populations of <italic>Pseudomonas</italic>. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">McDonald et al. (2009)</xref> revealed the existence of three commonly used mutational routes to a single adaptive ‘wrinkly spreader’ (WS) phenotype, but showed that additional, less frequently utilized pathways existed (the nature of these pathways was not determined). Here, beginning with the ancestral type devoid of the three known routes to WS, we propagated multiple independent populations and identified 91 new WS mutants with similar fitness to the common WS types. A combination of genetics and genome sequencing revealed ten new single mutational step routes and three additional paths requiring two or more mutations. Our data provide an explanation for why the newly discovered pathways are rarely followed, provide a set of hierarchical principles, and show how genetic constraints can bias the outcome of evolution.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Experimental rationale</title><p>The <italic>Pseudomonas fluorescens</italic> SBW25 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Silby et al., 2009</xref>), hereafter ‘SBW25’, experimental system of adaptive radiation has been extensively studied (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Rainey and Travisano, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Spiers et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Bantinaki et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">McDonald et al., 2009</xref>) and has several features that makes it ideal for addressing the question of bias in evolutionary pathways. Every time the ancestral SM genotype of SBW25 is placed in a nutrient-rich static microcosm, metabolism-driven depletion of oxygen imposes strong selection for mutants that colonize the oxygen replete air–liquid interface (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). The most successful of various mat-forming types (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Ferguson et al., 2013</xref>) display a wrinkled morphology on agar plates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>) and are known collectively as wrinkly spreaders (WS). In a previous experiment, the mutational origins of 26 independent WS genotypes were unravelled (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">McDonald et al., 2009</xref>). All mutations resided in one of three pathways (Wsp, Aws, and Mws). Each pathway harbours a di-guanylate cyclase (DGC) responsible for production of cyclic-di-GMP (c-di-GMP). When the cognate DGC is constitutively activated, cells over-produce an acetylated cellulose polymer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Spiers et al., 2002</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">2003</xref>)—the proximate cause of the WS phenotype (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">McDonald et al., 2009</xref>). That evolution followed just three pathways was unexpected given that the SBW25 genome carries 39 putative DGCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">McDonald et al., 2009</xref>).

All 22 (7 unique) base pair substitutions (BPSs) were clustered in the region 1223–1340 of the open reading frame upstream of the DGC domain. Further disruptive mutations within PFLU0085 were identified including in-frame deletions (20 mutants, 3–477 bp) and a 141-bp duplication—all in the same 1223–1340 region—suggesting that a wide variety of disruptive mutations within a small window can produce WS. This implicates 1223–1340 as a negative regulator of the downstream DGC domain.</p><p>Four other genes harboured intragenic mutations, but these were less common, suggesting a smaller target size less consistent with a negative regulatory role. One mutation (R321L) was found in PFLU0956 close to the third predicted transmembrane helix preceding the DGC domain. A similar pattern was evident at PFLU3448 where two mutations affecting the same amino acid (A200V and A200T) were identified. This residue resides close to the last of seven predicted transmembrane helices. At PFLU3571, two mutations were identified—both with W13R substitutions in the first of two transmembrane helices. A third mutation in PFLU3571 was found in the C-terminal end of the HAMP domain close to the N-terminal part of the DGC domain. The relative rarity of these mutations compared to those in PFLU0085 suggests a reduced target size that is again inconsistent with a negative regulatory role. More likely, these mutations bring about changes in protein–protein interactions, changes in localization of diguanylate cyclases in the cell, or alterations in the relative orientation of domains. All such alterations could reasonably activate production of c-di-GMP (and thus cellulose) without increasing catalytic rate. The fourth gene—that encoding PFLU5960—contained a mutation (D160G) in the DGC domain itself. The affected amino acid is close to the active site (amino acids 200–205) based on a Phyre2 structure prediction model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Kelley and Sternberg, 2009</xref>) of the protein (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2-data">Supplementary file 1</xref>). Such a mutation likely increases catalytic activity of the imperfect GSDEF site.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>Promoter mutations</title><p>Mutations were found in the upstream region of three DGC-encoding genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Figure 3—source data 1</xref>). The most common was associated with PFLU0956 where six BPSs and three indels in the −54 to −59 region relative to the start codon were identified. Six BPSs and one 14 bp duplication were found upstream of PFLU5698 and two indels were found upstream of PFLU1349. In all cases, the position of the mutation indicates no impact on the ribosomal binding site. The effect of a subset of these promoter mutations on transcription is described below.</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>Gene fusions</title><p>For three loci, deletion mutations caused fusions between an open reading frame encoding a DGC domain and an upstream gene. Such mutations could lead to an increase in transcription by promoter capture, or may change the functional or regulatory connections of the protein resulting in activation of the associated DGC. For PFLU0183, eight deletions were identified: each generating an in-frame fusion with a putative fatty acid desaturase (PFLU0184) located upstream. Eight deletions generating in-frame fusions were also found between PFLU4306 and PFLU4305. PFLU4306 encodes a DGC domain protein and the upstream gene encodes a putative L-lactate dehydrogenase. A third example was defined by a single mutation that fused the GGDEF domain protein PFLU4308 to PFLU4313—the latter located upstream of the DGC and encoding a hypothetical protein. This last fusion involved deletion of four intervening genes. For two of the loci WS-generating mutations arose at frequencies similar to those in promoters, suggesting that gene fusions and promoter capture play a major evolutionary role in gene and/or protein evolution.</p></sec><sec id="s2-6"><title>Double and triple mutations</title><p>Remarkably, double mutations in the same two genes, PFLU0458 and PFLU4744 were found in three independent WS mutants.

This mimics the situation where a random WS mutant occurs in a population and rises to high frequency without clonal interference from other WS mutants. The second assay involved a 1:1 competitive fitness assay in which each reconstructed WS type was directly pitted against one of the most fit and common of the WS mutants previously described—the so named LSWS type (WspF S301R)—also marked with GFP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">McDonald et al., 2009</xref>). This assay focused on competitive performance at the air–liquid interface—a realistic situation given that several WS mutants are likely to be present in the large populations (≈10<sup>10</sup> cells) used in the evolution experiments. Thus the two assays focus on different aspects of the adaptive radiation that are not necessarily directly correlated, for example, a mutant can be superior in initial attachment, but grow slowly at the air–liquid interface.

Of particular relevance is the complex network of functional and regulatory connectivities that define the genotype-to-phenotype map.

For the most part, WS types arising via the new pathways do not differ in fitness relative to known WS types and therefore their rarity cannot be attributed to a selective disadvantage. Genetic constraints, however, provide plausible explanations—certain pathways have a greater capacity than others to translate mutation into phenotypic variation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). While bias is well known to arise as a consequence of localized mutational hotspots, the spectrum of mutations underpinning different routes to WS suggests a minor influence of any such bias (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Figure 3—source data 1</xref> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">McDonald et al., 2011</xref>]).

Despite underlying molecular similarity only three are routinely travelled: Wsp, Aws, and Mws. The newly discovered mutational spectra allow proposals regarding probable mechanisms for activation of the pathways specific to each DGC and with this a more complete understanding of why genetic evolution prefers certain pathways over others.</p><p>From a purely genetic perspective there are no surprises: loss-of-function mutations are vastly more common that gain-of-function mutations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Gompel and Prud'homme, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Lee et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Herron and Doebeli, 2013</xref>) and thus those pathways containing DGCs subject to negative regulation will, by virtue of target size (a product of length of DNA and function), translate mutation into WS variation more efficiently than those pathways containing DGCs subject to other forms of regulation. But our detailed analysis makes possible a finer scale of resolution.</p><p>In common with the previously known Wsp, Aws, and Mws pathways, PFLU0085 also appears—on the basis of the spectrum of DGC-activating mutations—to be subject to negative regulation. That WS arising via the PLU0085 are not detected when the founding genotype is ancestral SM is readily understood based on the small mutational target (∼117 nucleotides) and the fact that mutations within this region cannot disrupt the reading frame else DGC activity be lost.</p><p>The second most common set of routes to WS, with 5–40 fold fewer mutations per gene compared to PFLU0085, are those involving promoter mutations and gene fusions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). It is not clear why promoter mutations were only found for a minority of the 39 DGC domain-containing proteins. Possibly this reflects the need for mutations to generate a high level of transcription, but it is also consistent with the fact that regulation of many DGC-containing proteins is post-translational (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Goymer et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Jenal and Malone, 2006</xref>).</p><p>The high frequency of gene fusions is surprising given the relatively few reports of this kind of mutational event in experimental evolution studies, with the notable exception of promoter capture that was central to the evolution of an <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> mutant that gained the ability to grow on citrate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Blount et al., 2012</xref>). The loss of genetic material through beneficial gene fusions could contribute to deletional bias over evolutionary timescales as observed in bacteria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Mira et al., 2001</xref>) and presents a selectionist alternative to reductive evolution by genetic drift or loss of biosynthetically expensive genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Moran, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Lee and Marx, 2012</xref>). Moreover, beneficial promoter capture events can create new protein domain combinations and provide raw material for the evolution of genes with novel functions, even if initially selected only because of a difference in transcriptional regulation.</p><p>The third most common mutation route to WS involves rare activating mutations that differ from intragenic negative regulators in that only specific base pair substitutions can lead to activation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). Effects at the molecular level are unknown, but it appears that mutations modifying the active site are rare, given that only one mutation was found in proximity to the catalytic site. Assuming that any of the newly discovered pathways are used at a frequency that is at least 10-fold lower than for the common pathways to WS, it is possible to estimate that only one in one thousand activating mutations would directly modify the active site (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). This strongly supports the theory that the majority of advantageous mutations are likely to occur in regulatory regions, including promoters and regulatory proteins, or in the case of intragenic mutations, primarily in regions peripheral to the main catalytic domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">McAdams et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Wray, 2007</xref>).</p><p>WS types arising as a consequence of two mutations arose at a similar frequency as the rare activating mutations. Such double (and triple) mutants are unexpected given the seeming improbability of such events based on estimates of the genome mutation rate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Drake et al., 1998</xref>). Nonetheless their detection is not uncommon (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Drake, 2007</xref>) and they have been explained by the existence of transient phenotypic mutators in the population due to transcriptional or translational errors in the expression of key genes involved in replication or DNA repair (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Ninio, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Drake, 2007</xref>). This suggests that once the third most common pathways involving single mutations have been realized, the same evolutionary principles can be applied to double mutations starting with double mutations in negative regulators, followed by double mutations in one negative regulator and one promoter mutation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>).</p><p>Taken together our findings provide the clearest evidence yet that the network of regulatory interactions and connectivities that define the genotype-to-phenotype map directly affects the translation of mutation into phenotypic variation and that this can profoundly bias the course of genetic evolution. This has a number of implications. Firstly, our findings contribute to the growing number of studies that show that parallel phenotypic evolution is often underpinned by parallel genetic changes (see [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Stern, 2013</xref>] <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref> for a summary) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Jost et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Blount et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Gerstein et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Meyer et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Zhen et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Herron and Doebeli, 2013</xref>). However, whereas it is common to attribute such genetic parallelism to selection, our work suggests the need for caution: genetic architecture can be a significant contributory factor. It is even conceivable, within the bounds of population parameters, such as population size and mutation rate, that certain high fitness phenotypes are never realized because of genetic bias.</p><p>Secondly, the WS-based experimental system has allowed discovery of pathways that evolution would rarely ever follow and suggests a hierarchical set of rules. These rules are consistent with the concept of ‘target size’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hansen, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Gompel and Prud'homme, 2009</xref>), which can be formulated more specifically in terms of size of the gene and the likelihood that changes generate viable phenotypes. The latter depends on the opportunity for loss-of-function mutations to generate adaptive phenotypes, which, in turn, depends on the function of the gene. But it is clear that while evolution will proceed most readily via loss-of-function mutations (where possible), other kinds of genes that afford a much reduced target size cannot be overlooked. As we demonstrate, there exists opportunity for promoter mutations, gene fusions, and activating mutations to also contribute to new phenotypes, but with a greatly reduced likelihood.</p><p>The existence of multiple genetic routes to a particular phenotypic end point is, given growing evidence of redundancy and evolvability in regulatory systems, possibly more common than currently appreciated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Gompel and Prud'homme, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Heineman et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Stern, 2013</xref>). If so, then the kinds of mutational patterns unraveled here may be evident elsewhere. We cautiously suggest that in addition to relevance for interpreting patterns of mutation underlying numerous studies of parallel and convergent evolution in natural and laboratory populations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Jost et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Blount et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Gerstein et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Meyer et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Zhen et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Herron and Doebeli, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Stern, 2013</xref>), our findings may also have value in understanding the spectrum of rare and common genetic variants underlying specific human diseases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Gibson, 2011</xref>). In the context of cancer, the mutational heterogeneity of different cancer types is well documented and it is possible that the common (and less common) mutational trajectories (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Yates and Campbell, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Lawrence et al., 2014</xref>) make sense in light of constraints due to genetic architecture.</p><p>We have made little of our findings in terms of the regulatory networks underpinning c-di-GMP synthesis and cellulose expression in bacteria—including mechanisms of DGC activation—but the degree of redundancy (under one set of laboratory conditions) and capacity for evolutionary change by recruitment of different DGC-containing proteins and pathways is remarkable. The evident flexibility suggests that evolutionary rearrangement of interacting modules likely occurs in natural populations—it also underpins recent experimental findings on the evolution of multicellular life cycles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Hammerschmidt et al., 2014</xref>). Indeed, such facility for re-wiring may partly explain the diverse modular arrangement of both DGC domain-encoding genes and DGC-containing operons found among even closely related strains of a single species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Jenal and Malone, 2006</xref>).</p><p>The hierarchical rules for the evolution of new WS phenotypes revealed through the analysis of experimental <italic>Pseudomonas</italic> populations may be sufficiently general for them to be applied to other biological settings where an adaptive challenge can be solved by mutational gene activation. Such settings include the evolution of antibiotic resistance, the evolution of virulence in pathogens and the emergence of complex traits in eukaryotic populations. However, the relevance of these principles remains to be tested. This could occur via a priori predictions of mutational routes for specific populations in given selective contexts. If robust, then the claim to have moved closer to a more predictive theory of genetic evolution will have substance.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Strains and media</title><p>All strains used are <italic>P. fluorescens</italic> SBW25 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Silby et al., 2009</xref>) or derivatives thereof except for <italic>E. coli</italic> strains used for strain construction and transposon mutagenesis (<italic>E. coli</italic> DH5-α λ<sub>pir</sub>, <italic>E. coli</italic> SM10 λ<sub>pir</sub> IS-Ω-kan/hah, <italic>E. coli</italic> pRK2013). <italic>P. fluorescens</italic> strains were grown in King's medium B (KB) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">King et al., 1954</xref>) at 28°C and <italic>E. coli</italic> strains were grown in lysogeny broth (LB) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bertani, 1951</xref>) at 37°C.

For a few mutants that consistently failed to produce suppressors, were difficult to phenotypically distinguish from the ancestor or had low conjugation efficiency; we used genome sequencing to find the mutations. Genomic DNA was prepared using the Wizard Genomic DNA purification kit (Promega), sequenced by the Australian Genome Research Facility using Illumina HiSeq2000 and assembled against the reference <italic>P. fluorescens</italic> SBW25 genome using Geneious 5.5.6 (Biomatters).

Mutations found in the double and triple mutants (PFLU0458 I835S, PFLU0621 -51C &gt; T; PFLU0458 E45*, PFLU4744 S39N; PFLU4414 Y652fs, PFLU4443 E398*, PFLU4744 I44T) were reconstructed individually and then combined. We used a two-step allelic replacement method to transfer the mutations into the ancestral background as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Rainey, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Bantinaki et al., 2007</xref>). In summary, PCR (Phusion High-Fidelity DNA polymerase, Thermo Scientific) was used to amplify an approximately 1000-bp region surrounding each mutation, and the product was subsequently cloned into the pCR8 plasmid and sequenced. The cloned fragment from pCR8 was then moved to the pUIC3 suicide vector and mobilized into <italic>P. fluorescens</italic> SBW25 where it integrates into the chromosome by homologous recombination. After non-selective growth in KB, 10 mg/l tetracycline was added to inhibit the growth of cells that had lost the pUIC3 insert. After 2 hr 1000 mg/ml cycloserine was added to kill growing cells and enrich for cells that had lost pUIC3 with the tetracycline resistance marker and incubated for 4 hr at 28°C. Suitable dilutions were then plated on agar plates with X-gal to allow screening for loss of the <italic>lacZ</italic> gene on pUIC3. White colonies were confirmed to be tetracycline sensitive and single colonies were isolated. The region containing the desired mutation was then sequenced in a number of colonies, with both the ancestral and wrinkly phenotype to exclude picking bias and confirm that the wrinkly phenotype was linked to the mutation.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Construction of competition strains</title><p>We used the wild-type SBW25 and a previously described high fitness WS mutant LSWS (<italic>wspF</italic> A901C, S301R) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Bantinaki et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">McDonald et al., 2009</xref>) to construct Green Fluorescent Protein (GFP) expressing strains for use in competition experiments to determine the relative fitness of the alternative WS. These strains were genetically tagged in the chromosome with a mini-Tn<italic>7</italic> transposon expressing GFP and a gentamicin resistance marker (miniTn7(Gm)P<sub>rrnB</sub> P1 gfp-a) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Lambertsen et al., 2004</xref>) that was transferred from <italic>E. coli</italic> by conjugation together with the pUX-BF13 plasmid carrying the transposase genes.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Competition fitness assay</title><p>Competitive fitness was determined relative to the LSWS strain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Spiers et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Goymer et al., 2006</xref>) (SBW25 <italic>wspF</italic> A901C, S301R) marked with GFP. Strains were grown for 16 hr, shaking, in KB at 28°C before they were mixed at equal volumes diluted 6 times and grown for 4 hr at the same conditions to ensure that the strains were in the same physiological state before the competition started. The initial ratios of alternative WS to LSWS GFP were determined by counting 100,000 cells using flow cytometry (BD FACS Canto) detecting GFP fluorescence on the 488 nm laser with 530/30 bandwidth filter. Suitable dilutions of the initial population were plated on KB agar plates to determine viable counts. The mix of alternative WS and LSWS was diluted 1000-fold in KB and incubated for 24 hr, static at 28°C. Final viable counts and ratios were determined in the same way. After incubation for approximately 40 hr at 28°C, viable counts were determined and the stability of the WS phenotypes and GFP marker was determined. This was possible as most WS types have slightly different colony morphologies, which allow us to determine if the GFP marker was lost and the emergence of smooth ancestral types is easily detected. Rarely, smooth colonies were found and if they made up more than 5% of the total population, the competition data were discarded for that microcosm. The number of generations was determined by ln(final population/initial population)/ln(2). Selection coefficients were calculated using the regression model s = [ln(R(t)/R(0))]/[t], as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Dykhuizen, 1990</xref>) where R is the ratio of alternative WS mutant to LSWS GFP and t is the number of generations. Control experiments with LSWS vs LSWS GFP were performed to compensate for the fitness cost (s = 0.06 ± 0.01) of the miniTn7 with the GFP marker. For each strain, the competition assay was performed in quadruplicates at a minimum of two separate occasions.</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>Invasion fitness assay</title><p>Invasion fitness was measured relative to the smooth (SM) ancestral SBW25 mini-Tn7 GFP. Invasion strains were grown in KB for 24 hr shaking and then mixed 1:100 with the SM GFP strain and a 1000-fold dilution of this mix was used to inoculate 6 ml static microcosms. After 48 hr at 28°C, the ratio of unmarked WS to GFP marked SM was determined by flow cytometry as described above. Viable counts on KB plates of initial and final populations were performed to calculate the number of generations during the invasion growth. The stabilities of the GFP marker and colony morphologies were confirmed and data from microcosms with &gt;5% wrinkly GFP or smooth unmarked were discarded. Selection coefficients relative to the ancestral SBW25 strain were calculated as described above with compensation for the cost of the GFP marker determined by control invasion experiments with SBW25 vs SBW25 GFP. The averages presented are the result of at least two independent experiments with quadruplicates for each strain.</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>Quantitative RT-PCR</title><p>Total RNA was isolated from reconstructed WS mutants with mutations in upstream promoter regions or fusions to other open reading frames using the SV Total RNA Isolation system (Promega).

Your article has been favorably evaluated by Detlef Weigel (Senior editor) and three reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors. One of the three peer reviewers, Jim Bull, has agreed to share his identity.</p><p>The Reviewing editor and the other reviewers discussed their comments before we reached this decision, and the Reviewing editor has assembled the following comments to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Lind et al. use the <italic>Pseudomonas fluorescens</italic> unshaken microcosm experimental evolution system to deeply profile different mutations that can give rise to the wrinkly spreader phenotype. Neither the trick of knocking out one pathway to see how evolution can still achieve a given phenotype nor the target-size argument for predicting evolutionary pathways are especially new. For example, the Barry Hall studies of evolved beta galactosidase used the former approach. There are also multiple examples of profiling the steps in evolving new metabolic capabilities in the 1984 Mortlock “Microorganisms as model systems for studying evolution” volume that follow the ‘target-size’ paradigm of a regulatory mutation knocking out a repressor first to achieve overexpression, followed by rarer refinement mutations at specific sites in an enzyme that change its specificity.</p><p>The strength of this study is in the depth with which the authors have been able to find so many different solutions to the problem of activating cyclic-di-GMP production to achieve the wrinkly spreader phenotype. It's quite interesting that there are so many different di-guanylate cyclases that can be co-opted with just a single mutation, in so many different ways. They also present nice data showing that some newly revealed WS mutations confer similar fitness advantages to the normally dominant versions, and that the putative promoter mutations do increase mRNA levels (sometimes by extremely large amounts). There are many types of evolutionary pathways revealed here, and the text also interprets them for the reader e.g., the type of mutation(s) involved and whether they destroy a function or create a new function, and what that function is. The literature on experimental evolution is actually pretty poor about noting the difference between evolution of new or altered function, versus evolution to destroy a function, but this paper makes the distinction clear; that is just one of its many attributes. Another is the fact that the selection leads to a single phenotype with a clear adaptive interpretation; many studies of experimental evolution have described the DNA bases of favored changes yet fail to connect them to a clear beneficial phenotype.</p><p>Major comments:</p><p>1) I am not sure about the “general principles” quoted in the Abstract. These “principles” sounded so detailed as to miss important mutation types that happened not to occur in this system. For example, the evolution of antibiotic resistance through horizontal gene transfer, or evolution via chromosome duplication through chromosomal mis-segregation. Maybe, the general principle is what the authors wrote in their Discussion: the observed frequency of an evolutionary strategy is determined by the probability of the particular type of mutation and the fitness advantage conferred by such a mutation. Thus, loss-of-function mutations in non-essential genes will be far more common than reduction-of-function mutations in essential genes, which will be more common than gain-of-function mutations (unless it is through chromosome duplication or horizontal gene transfer, which can occur at a high frequency).</p><p>2) In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>, the relative advantage of a mutant over SM does not translate quantitatively to the relative advantage of the mutant over WspF S301R. Please discuss this.</p><p>3) In the subsection headed “Fitness of double and triple mutants”, the authors state: “In the invasion assay all mutants, except the PFLU0458 E45*, invaded the SM population successfully (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>).” However according to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>, the fitness of PFLU0458 E45* is similar to that of PFLU4443 PFLU4414 or PFLU4443 E398*. Thus, this seems like a contradiction.</p><p>4) It would be a nice addition to the paper if there were a summary figure or discussion that attempted to put everything that they now know about this system on a common scale of mutational rarity. If they observed 1,000,000 WS mutants, how many would they expect to be in each of the dominant and these lesser categories? (At least to a first approximation.) It also would be helpful to color or symbol code the different mutations by type so that this aspect could be more easily followed from <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref> to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4 fig5">Figures 4 and 5</xref>.</p><p>5) The presentation of the paper could be improved with a big table. As it stands, the paper falls into a presentation mode that is common when there are many data to summarize: a shopping list of case studies is described in the text, one by one. The conceptual framework of the presentation in this manuscript is clear, but there is too much detail to follow. I thus suggest that a big summary table be created that groups the mutations under the different classifications that are described. The table can include subcategories, details of the type of mutation, the gene affected, etc. But it should enable the reader to see everything at a glance. Then, if some cases require further explanation, the text can do that. But getting the shopping list out of the text will allow the paper to focus on the points of general interest. Incidentally, that kind of table is the very type that could make it into a textbook, a worthy goal of any paper. (If need be, perhaps the data could be broken into two tables.)</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.07074.019</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>Lind et al. use the</italic> Pseudomonas fluorescens <italic>unshaken microcosm experimental evolution system to deeply profile different mutations that can give rise to the wrinkly spreader phenotype.

Indeed, numerous studies have exploited mutational compensation for defective phenotypes as a way of obtaining insight into the genetic and phenotypic bases of traits. However, there are important differences between these studies and the work presented in our paper.</p><p>Firstly, we do not remove the biochemical activity required for the phenotype, but instead successively peel away regulatory pathways that stand to activate the structural component (in our case the <italic>wss</italic> operon required for the WS phenotype) upon mutation. In our work, removing commonly traversed mutational pathways does not have a deleterious effect on fitness: this cannot be said for the beta galactosidase case where a new biochemical function must evolve to compensate for a lost function.</p><p>Secondly, there is a difference in motivation between the standard “compensatory mutation” experiment and our work. For the most part others have been interested in compensatory evolution (underpinned by spontaneous mutation, or in vitro mutagenesis) as a means of restoring a lost function in the hope that new knowledge functional knowledge will emerge. For us the motivation comes from recognition that the standard explanation for parallel evolution (strong selection) is but one of a number of possible explanations for the repeated occurrence of the same phenotypic and even genotypic solutions to a common selective challenge. The problem, as others and we have pointed out, is to come up with an experimental model along with a sensible design to rigorously address the question as to the number of pathways that evolution (in a given context) can follow. This in and of itself is no trivial matter. To the best of our knowledge we have performed a unique experimental analysis and one that we hope will interest the evo-devo community, as much as to the field of experimental microbial population biology.</p><p><italic>1) I am not sure about the</italic> “<italic>general principles</italic>” <italic>quoted in the Abstract.

This has also been color-coded by mutational category. Even though we agree that there are plenty of details about the mutations in the text, we find it difficult to significantly reduce this without a negative impact on the credibility of the paper’s conclusions. Because the suggested classifications are based on interpretation of the mutational patterns (and not biochemical or biophysical data) it will not be possible for the reader to evaluate our claims without detailed descriptions and interpretations about the context of mutations in each gene. As this section is about 10% of the text in the article, we believe a further reduction would lead to a minor improvement in readability while seriously impacting the credibility of our conclusions.</p></body></sub-article></article>
