Frequently co-opted to pattern new structures, the pathway is conserved among eumetazoans yet flexible and pleiotropic in its effects. The Hedgehog receptor, Patched, is transcriptionally activated by Hedgehog, providing essential negative feedback in all tissues. Our locus-wide dissections of the <italic>cis</italic>-regulatory landscapes of fly <italic>patched</italic> and mouse <italic>Ptch1</italic> reveal abundant, diverse enhancers with stage- and tissue-specific expression patterns. The seemingly simple, constitutive Hedgehog response of <italic>patched/Ptch1</italic> is driven by a complex regulatory architecture, with batteries of context-specific enhancers engaged in promoter-specific interactions to tune signaling individually in each tissue, without disturbing patterning elsewhere. This structure—one of the oldest cis-regulatory features discovered in animal genomes—explains how <italic>patched/Ptch1</italic> can drive dramatic adaptations in animal morphology while maintaining its essential core function. It may also suggest a general model for the evolutionary flexibility of conserved regulators and pathways.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi"

Hedgehog (Hh) pathway is broadly conserved among bilaterians, from its basic signal transduction mechanism to the DNA-binding specificity of its effector molecules, the zinc finger transcription factors of the Gli family (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Briscoe and Thérond, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Hallikas et al., 2006</xref>). Hh signaling is used for cell-cell communication in many contexts during development, and is maintained into adulthood to control tissue homeostasis. Disruption of signaling has been directly linked to several human cancers such as medulloblastoma and basal cell carcinoma in addition to developmental disorders including spina bifida, exencephaly and cleft lip/palate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Barakat et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Scales and de Sauvage, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Teglund and Toftgård, 2010</xref>). The Hh pathway itself is highly pleiotropic, regulating many different cell fate decisions in different cellular contexts, but the vast majority of the direct transcriptional targets of Hh/Gli respond to signaling in a strictly limited, tissue- and stage-specific pattern (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Barolo and Posakony, 2002</xref>). A very small number of target genes, such as <italic>patched</italic> in flies and <italic>Ptch1, Gli1,</italic> and perhaps <italic>Hhip1</italic> in vertebrates, all of which encode components or modifiers of the Hh pathway itself, seem to respond to Hh signaling in a universal, constitutive manner (or nearly so), to the extent that the expression of these target genes is sometimes considered diagnostic for the presence of Hh signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Epstein, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Shahi et al., 2015</xref>). Although the regulation of these 'universal' target genes, which respond to Hh/Gli in most or all signaling contexts, has been studied to some extent—for example, an enhancer of <italic>Drosophila patched</italic> was the first direct Hh/Gli target discovered in any organism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Alexandre et al., 1996</xref>)—the basis of a constitutive response to Hedgehog/Gli, or to any pleiotropic signaling pathway, is not understood. One could imagine a simple 'master' response element that is universally activated by a given signal in all developmental and adult stem-niche contexts where that signal is present. But while efforts have been made to synthesize such generic response elements by multimerizing binding sites, with varying degrees of success (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Barolo, 2006</xref>), so far no such element has been found in nature.</p><p>Here we examine the regulation of the <italic>patched</italic> gene, a universal transcriptional target of Hh/Gli signaling in <italic>Drosophila</italic>, and its mouse ortholog <italic>Ptch1</italic>, which has an equally universal response to signaling. The Hh receptor Patched (Ptc) normally inhibits the function of Smoothened, blocking signal transduction and favoring the production of the repressor isoform of the Ci/Gli transcription factor (Gli<sup>R</sup>). This inhibition is relieved upon binding of Hh ligand to Ptc, allowing the activator isoform (Gli<sup>A</sup>) to accumulate. Ptc is expressed broadly, keeping the Hh pathway silent in the absence of ligand, but it is also directly transcriptionally activated by Gli in all Hh-regulated tissues, where it moderates signal levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). This constitutive negative feedback circuit, which is conserved from flies to mammals and is essential for normal development, has been extensively studied in <italic>Drosophila</italic>, especially in the contexts of the developing wing and embryonic ectoderm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Alexandre et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Briscoe and Thérond, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Chen and Struhl, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Milenkovic et al., 1999</xref>). A previously characterized promoter-proximal enhancer of <italic>Drosophila patched</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Alexandre et al., 1996</xref>), referred to here as <italic>ptc<sup>prox</sup></italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>), contains three optimal consensus Gli binding sites which are required to activate expression in Hh-responsive wing cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C–E</xref>), but was not examined in other developmental contexts.<fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.13550.002</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>The promoter-proximal Hedgehog/Gli-responsive enhancer of <italic>patched</italic> is not sufficient to respond to Hh signaling in the embryo.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Summary of the conserved Hh-Gli-Ptc pathway feedback loop.

Our previous work has demonstrated that high-affinity Gli motifs identical to those in <italic>ptc<sup>prox</sup></italic> (GACCACCCA) can repress enhancer activity in embryos, even in Hh-responding cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Ramos and Barolo, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">White et al., 2012</xref>). These results presented a potential paradox: the same Gli motifs that have been shown to repress transcription in embryonic stripes are also found in an enhancer of <italic>patched</italic>, a gene which is directly activated by Hh/Gli in those same cells. Two explanations that could reconcile these results were (1) that optimal Gli motifs can either activate or repress transcription in the same cells, depending on their <italic>cis</italic>-context, or (2) that the <italic>ptc<sup>prox</sup></italic> element is not a universally Hh/Gli-responsive enhancer. To distinguish between these possibilities, we examined the <italic>ptc<sup>prox </sup></italic>enhancer in the embryonic ectoderm, and found that it fails to respond to Hh/Gli in this context (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F,G</xref>). This is also consistent with reports that a larger 3.2 kb fragment including <italic>ptc<sup>prox</sup></italic> is also insufficient for a complete embryonic response, but larger fragments that include extensive 5’ sequences are sufficient to drive <italic>ptc</italic>-like embryo patterns (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Forbes et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Millard and Martin, 2008</xref>). Because the promoter-adjacent cluster of conserved, optimal Gli motifs produces a tissue-restricted expression pattern, it is not sufficient to explain the universal Hh response of the <italic>patched</italic> gene (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C–G</xref>), suggesting that the control region for embryonic stripe expression is located elsewhere in the locus. We then set out to identify the enhancer module responsible for <italic>ptc</italic> expression in embryonic ectodermal stripes and to characterize its Hh/Gli response, hypothesizing that it may depend on lower-affinity Gli inputs than the <italic>ptc<sup>prox</sup></italic> element.</p><p>Our findings, described below, show that the seemingly simple constitutive Hh response of <italic>patched</italic> is controlled by an unexpectedly complex multi-modular system of enhancers spread across the <italic>ptc</italic> locus. The mouse <italic>Ptch1</italic> locus seems to be regulated by a very similar overall structure, making this an uncommonly ancient <italic>cis</italic>-regulatory strategy in the animal genome, perhaps as old as the Hh-Gli-Ptc negative feedback circuit itself. We propose that this regulatory structure, in which many context-specific Hh-responsive enhancers together produce a 'simple' constitutive response pattern, can explain why <italic>patched</italic> is an important locus for morphological divergence: it allows Hh signaling levels to be adjusted independently in each tissue and stage, without disturbing pathway activity in other developmental and stem cell contexts.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>The universal Hh response of <italic>patched</italic> is mediated by a large array of stage- and tissue-specific enhancers</title><p>For this study, we created a nomenclature of sequence fragments by dividing the 5’ intergenic sequences into regions A through Z (with A containing the <italic>ptc</italic> transcription start site) and the first intron into regions 1A through 1I, and then naming each sequence fragment after the 5’- and 3’-most regions included in that fragment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>): for example, the <italic>ptc<sup>prox</sup></italic> enhancer, which spans fragments D, C, and B, will be referred to in the rest of this report as module DB. To reduce bias in our search and to account for the possibility of multiple embryonic enhancers, we independently tested overlapping fragments of the large 5’ intergenic region and the large first intron of <italic>ptc</italic> as single-copy, targeted-insertion reporter transgenes in which GFP was driven by the <italic>ptc</italic> promoter (fragment BA) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). We focused on the 5’ intergenic and first-intron sequences of <italic>ptc</italic> in this functional analysis because the other four introns of <italic>ptc</italic> are short (&lt;350 bp) and poorly conserved and the 3’ neighboring gene is located less than 700 bp downstream of <italic>ptc</italic>.<fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.13550.003</object-id><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>The universal Hedgehog response of <italic>patched</italic> is mediated by a large array of tissue- and stage-specific enhancers.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) The <italic>ptc</italic> genomic locus.

These Ci/Gli motifs were then altered by overlap extension PCR to abolish Ci binding (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3</xref> for in vitro binding assays). Mutating Ci/Gli motifs in each embryonic stripe enhancer of <italic>ptc</italic> severely reduced its Hh responsiveness in vivo (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>), demonstrating that low- to moderate-affinity Gli motifs—which account for most or all of the Ci/Gli sites in these modules (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3</xref>)—are required for strong activation in the embryonic ectoderm. Enhancer 1EH contains one optimal GBS (GACCACCCA), but targeted mutation of this motif did not have a strong effect on enhancer activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3G</xref>, compare to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>).</p><p>To test whether the low affinity of Gli sites in these enhancers contributed to transcriptional activation, we converted two of the low-affinity motifs in both the 1EH module and the VT module to optimal GACCACCCA motifs. Because this two-site optimization increased Ci binding to those sites in vitro (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3</xref>), and augmented the Gli1-responsiveness of the enhancer modules in mammalian cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3M</xref>), we conclude that the sequence alteration improves Ci/Gli binding as predicted. In vivo, however, the Gli-optimized 1EH and VT enhancers are significantly less active in the embryonic ectoderm than their wild-type counterparts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref> compare to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>). Though perhaps counterintuitive, this finding is consistent with our group's previous reports that optimizing Ci/Gli motifs in Hh-regulated embryonic ectodermal enhancers of the <italic>wingless</italic> and <italic>stripe</italic> genes causes a decrease in enhancer activation in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">White et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Ramos and Barolo, 2013</xref>). Interestingly, this effect appears to be tissue-/stage-dependent: optimizing two Gli motifs in the VT module decreases its activity in the embryonic ectoderm, as described above, but the same alteration conversely causes an increase of enhancer activity in the wing disc (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3J'</xref>), where VT is normally weakly active (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3H'</xref>). These results suggest that there is no level of Gli occupancy that allows optimal activity of this <italic>ptc</italic> enhancer in both the embryonic segments and the wing disc. Thus, nonconsensus Gli motifs can influence both the strength and the stage/tissue specificity of transcriptional responses to Hedgehog signaling.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>Multiple wing disc enhancers of <italic>patched</italic> depend on Gli motifs of varying affinities to synergistically activate gene expression in response to Hh</title><p>The <italic>ptc</italic> response to Hh/Gli in the wing, as in the embryonic ectoderm, is distributed across many regions of the locus; in fact, most of the enhancers we tested in vivo had some activity in wing imaginal discs, though not all drove a strong or strictly <italic>ptc</italic>-like expression pattern. We examined a few of these enhancers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>)—all of which correspond to regions of accessible chromatin in wing discs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">McKay and Lieb, 2013</xref>)—in greater detail with respect to their direct Gli inputs, using GFP reporters with a minimal TATA+Inr 'hspmin' promoter. All of these wing stripe enhancers depend on Gli motifs for full activity in the wing imaginal disc (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). However, the number and quality of Gli motifs in these modules bears no obvious relationship to the strength of enhancer activity in Hh-responding cells.

Taking these results altogether, we conclude that, while Gli motif quality plays a role in Hh/Gli responsiveness (positively or negatively, depending on the developmental context), it is not in itself a good indicator of which enhancers will be the most strongly active in a given tissue. Note that of the five wing enhancers examined here, the two with the highest expression levels in wings (HF and YU) have relatively few and/or low-quality Gli motifs, which nevertheless make significant contributions to their activity.</p><p>We were intrigued to learn from the above analysis that the canonical <italic>patched</italic> wing enhancer <italic>ptc<sup>prox</sup></italic>/DB, with its cluster of optimal Gli motifs, drives relatively weak expression in vivo (though it is strongly responsive to Hh/Gli in vitro).

We first addressed this by testing a nested set of fragments from the -5.5 kb region upstream of <italic>ptc,</italic> all containing the 3 proximal optimal GBS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref>, <italic>top).</italic> All of the fragments (DB, GB, HB, and JB, in order of increasing size) drove <italic>ptc</italic>-like stripes in the wing, but while the anterior-posterior positions of these stripes were the same, the levels and dorsal-ventral extents of gene expression increased greatly with the addition of 5’ flanking sequence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4G</xref>). 5’ sequences containing relatively few and weak Gli motifs provided significant boosts to gene expression in the wing: for example, compare GB to DB, and HB to GB (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4G</xref>). We next examined the direct contribution of the three optimal Gli sites (located within region D) to the in vivo activity of the nested fragments DB, GB, and JB. In all cases, mutating these three Gli sites (while leaving any other Gli motifs intact) significantly reduced peak gene expression in the wing stripe (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4K</xref>) (Student’s t-test; p&lt;0.0015). However, the relative contribution of those three sites, measured as reduction of expression of a 3xGli-mutant enhancer compared to wild-type, decreased as more <italic>cis</italic>-regulatory context was included—from a 99.9% reduction in module DB, to a 62% reduction in module GB, to a 26% reduction in module JB (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4K</xref>). When taken out of their native sequence context and tested as a synthetic reporter, three optimal Ci/Gli sites are not capable of activating gene expression in the wing, though they can strongly synergize with other activator binding sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Ramos and Barolo, 2013</xref>).</p><p>By breaking down module JB into smaller, non-overlapping sub-fragments (JI, H, GE, and DB; see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref>), we were able to test the individual contributions of these regions, with very different predicted Gli binding patterns, to gene activation. Note that of these fragments, only module DB contains the cluster of three optimal Gli motifs. All of these modules were sufficient to drive expression in the wing disc, and as with the more distal <italic>patched</italic> wing enhancers examined above, little or no correlation between predicted Gli affinity and in vivo expression levels was observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4G</xref>). In general, transcriptional synergy among sub-fragments was observed in vivo, such that the activity of a large fragment (JB, HB, GB) was greater than the sum of the individual activities of its constituent sub-fragments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4H–J</xref>).</p><p>The above findings suggest that, even in the wing, the promoter-proximal cluster of optimal Gli sites makes a relatively minor (though significant) contribution to the Hh/Gli response of <italic>patched</italic>, and that inputs from many additional <italic>cis-</italic>regulatory regions, some of which contain relatively few and/or weak Gli motifs, are integrated to produce the final pattern of transcriptional activation in this tissue.</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>An unusual tissue- or stage-specific Polycomb/Trithorax response element (PRE) alters the output of <italic>patched</italic> enhancers</title><p>In addition to the multi-modular complexity of the <italic>ptc</italic> locus, we found evidence of higher-level control of gene expression via specialized enhancer-promoter interactions.

Hi-C topographical domain mapping and ChIP-seq occupancy data for the chromatin insulator/boundary factor CTCF indicate that both <italic>Ptch1</italic> and <italic>patched</italic> are flanked by a nearby 3’ boundary (associated with a closely neighboring downstream gene) and a far more remote 5’ boundary (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Dixon et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Wang et al., 2012</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A,D,E</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>). In both fly and mouse, all mapped enhancers fall within this topographical domain; they rely on Gli sites across a wide range of affinities; they appear to also require additional tissue-specific transcription factor inputs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD6-data">Supplementary file 2</xref>); and they act through a PcG-bound, H3K27me3-marked promoter. This combination of regulatory mechanisms, ranging in scale from the single binding site to the locus as a whole, allows independent tuning of <italic>ptc/Ptch1</italic> expression—and therefore of Hh signaling levels—in individual tissues, without disrupting overall signaling required for normal development and adult tissue homeostasis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A,D,E</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>This study, which examines the regulation of an essential developmental gene at the locus-wide level, demonstrates for the first time how a constitutive pathway-responsive gene is precisely regulated in diverse developmental contexts. This regulation consists of two major modes of control: First, <italic>ptc</italic> must be broadly active to inhibit Smoothened activity, preventing the inappropriate activation of Hh target genes and subsequent faulty patterning, developmental defects, and disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Katoh and Katoh, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Barakat et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Scales and de Sauvage, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Teglund and Toftgård, 2010</xref>). Our reporter-based analysis of the locus has identified a promoter-proximal 5' sequence, region B, which in conjunction with the core promoter acts as the likely controller of the basal, signal-independent mode of <italic>ptc</italic> expression.</p><p>Second, <italic>ptc</italic> must be able to respond to Hh/Gli signaling in many developmental and stem-niche contexts. We show here that this is not accomplished by a master Hh/Gli response element, but rather by a collection of Gli-regulated enhancers spread across the <italic>ptc</italic> gene locus. These remote, tissue- and sub-tissue-specific enhancers work synergistically and are integrated with additional information from promoter-proximal sequences and the core promoter, responding to Hh signaling differently in each stage and tissue type. The basis for the tissue-specific activity of the numerous enhancers of <italic>ptc</italic> has not been directly examined yet, but in some cases we have identified likely candidate selector inputs by a combination of sequence motif searching and DNA conservation analysis (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD6-data">Supplementary file 2</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D,E</xref>).</p><p>At least in some enhancer modules, we find that the quality/affinity of Gli binding motifs in these enhancers is extremely important for proper patterning, to the extent that optimizing Gli motifs in certain enhancers can cripple enhancer activity. Previous studies from our group and others have shown that low-to-moderate-affinity transcription factor binding sites can be important for limiting the response of a target gene to a pleiotropic, broadly active transcription factor or pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Swanson et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Crocker et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Farley et al., 2015</xref>; additional references within). Our results with embryonic stripe enhancers of the <italic>ptc</italic> gene, however, point to a different type of regulatory control by weak binding sites, in which the occupancy of a transcription factor is modulated to an optimal level of activation within a tissue. The fact that optimal activation is achieved via suboptimal Gli binding sites in the <italic>Drosophila</italic> embryo may reflect the fact that Ci/Gli acts both as an activator and as a repressor through the same binding sites. Considering that the area and duration of Hh production in embryonic segments is vastly lower than that in larval/pupal wings, where half of the organ produces Hh protein for most of the developmental period of the animal, it is to be expected that the Gli<sup>A</sup>:Gli<sup>R</sup> ratio may be significantly lower in Hh-responsive cells in the embryonic segments than in late-larval wing discs. If so, the relatively high concentration of Gli<sup>R</sup> in Hh-responding embryonic cells may create selective pressures favoring lower Gli occupancy, as we have argued previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Parker et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">White et al., 2012</xref>). Alternatively (or in addition), other mechanisms, such as overlapping binding specificities for non-Gli transcription factors, could play a role in the sub-optimization of Gli motifs observed here.</p><p>Our results from transgenic mouse reporter constructs and Gli ChIP-seq experiments suggest that the same large-scale <italic>cis</italic>-regulatory strategy at work in the fly locus is also present in vertebrates—at least to the extent that many enhancers, with widely varying levels of Gli input, act in combination but in a tissue-specific manner to independently adjust <italic>Ptch1</italic> expression levels in each cell type, giving the illusion of a universal response to Hh signaling but in fact representing a complex array of context-limited responses. However, we do not mean to propose that the specific <italic>cis</italic>-regulatory sequences that regulate <italic>patched</italic> and its orthologs are conserved across such large evolutionary distances. Individual <italic>patched</italic> enhancers show no obvious sequence conservation from insects to mammals—unsurprisingly, given that most <italic>ptc</italic>-expressing, Hh/Gli-regulated organs present in modern animals did not exist at the time of the protostome-deuterostome divergence. Rather, we propose that <italic>patched</italic> and its orthologs share an ancient regulatory structure composed of relatively young enhancers. Based on our motif analyses and mutational studies, we propose that <italic>patched</italic> enhancer evolution likely involved both tuning of Gli occupancy and the co-option of tissue-specific inputs to produce new aspects of the <italic>patched</italic> expression pattern over time. This elaboration of new sub-patterns would not be necessary if <italic>patched/Ptch1</italic> were regulated by a unified 'master' Hedgehog response element; under such a simple regulatory scheme, new domains of <italic>patched</italic> expression would appear automatically whenever Hh signaling were activated in new contexts. By contrast, our analysis suggests that a robust response to Hh/Gli in both embryonic segment-polarity stripes and in larval wing stripes may not be achievable by the same enhancer module, perhaps due to conflicting requirements for Gli occupancy, or perhaps for other reasons whose basis in <italic>cis</italic>-regulatory logic is not yet clear.</p><p>The <italic>cis</italic>-regulatory architecture discovered here is also a remarkably ancient example of a direct transcriptional linkage and gene regulatory strategy in animals. Notch regulation of Hes/Hey genes is a circuit of comparable age, but its conservation is limited to the presence of CSL-family binding sites controlling orthologous target genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Rebeiz et al., 2012</xref>), with no evidence of a larger shared gene-regulatory structure. Conversely, while the collinear structure of animal Hox gene clusters predates the Bilateria, the upstream regulators of Hox genes do not appear to be shared between protostomes and deuterostomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Duboule, 2007</xref>). Our results suggest that the locus-wide multi-modular structure by which <italic>patched</italic> responds to Hh/Gli to provide feedback inhibition is an unusually old <italic>cis-</italic>regulatory strategy. This strategy has the potential advantages of transcriptional precision and robustness ascribed to regulation by ‘shadow’ enhancers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Frankel et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Perry et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Barolo, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Wunderlich et al., 2015</xref>), but more importantly it allows for the independent modulation of signaling levels in a stage- and tissue-specific manner, without disturbing pathway activity in other contexts.</p><p>Our model has significant implications for the evolution of cell signaling pathways and their target genes and tissues. For example, it helps to explain two reported cases of morphological divergence caused by changes at the vertebrate <italic>Ptch1</italic> locus: modifications to an intronic enhancer of <italic>Ptch1</italic> produced major developmental adaptations in the bovine limb (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Lopez-Rios et al., 2014</xref>), while sequence variation upstream of <italic>Ptch1</italic> is linked to cichlid craniofacial diversification (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Roberts et al., 2011</xref>). In both cases, Hh signaling levels in other developmental contexts (for example, the spinal cord) were apparently unaffected by the adaptation, indicating that the affected enhancer module is stage/tissue-specific. Our conserved structure with flexible enhancers model of <italic>patched</italic> regulation is also consistent with the finding that, while zebrafish <italic>ptch1</italic> resembles its mouse and fly orthologs in having multiple Gli-bound regions, few such sites are conserved among vertebrates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Peterson et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Wang et al., 2013</xref>). Thus, while the <italic>cis</italic>-regulatory structure of <italic>patched</italic> appears to have ancient roots, it is also highly flexible, allowing a core component of the Hedgehog pathway to function as an adaptable tissue-specific modifier of pathway activity and as a substrate for morphological evolution.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Transcription factor binding site prediction and ranking</title><p>Matrix similarity scores were calculated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Quandt et al., 1995</xref>) using in vitro Ci/Gli binding data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Hallikas 2006</xref>).

Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by Janet Rossant as the Senior Editor and Reviewing Editor.</p><p>The reviewers are all very enthusiastic about the paper and its insights into gene regulatory architecture and want to see it published without delay. One reviewer suggested some additional transgenic experiments which could add to the paper. However, the consensus was that these were not necessary for publication, unless you happen to have the data in hand. Thus we ask that you respond to the minor comments below. We have included the comment on additional experiments for your information and comment only.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>Lorberbaum et al. present a detailed analysis of <italic>Patched</italic> and <italic>Ptch1</italic> gene regulation in flies and mice, respectively. Patched is a core component of the important hedgehog signaling pathway. It inhibits the action of Smoothened, which is required for the synthesis of activator forms of the transcriptional effectors Ci and Gli. This repression is relieved by Hedgehog-Patched interactions, leading to the induction of a variety of target genes, including Patched itself.</p><p>Past studies led to the view that Patched is regulated by simple upstream activator elements consisting of a linked Gli/Ci binding sites. Here, the authors elegantly demonstrate that this is not the actual mechanism of Patched regulation. Instead, the locus contains a series of upstream and downstream enhancers that mediate restricted induction in specific tissues at different times and in response to a variety of different signals, including Hedgehog.</p><p>This is an excellent paper. The scope of the analysis, which includes both flies and mice, is unusually broad. The findings are striking and convincing, and the analysis is thoughtful and penetrating. The paper was a pleasure to read. This type of work lays the foundation for future studies into the basis for synergy between enhancers, the relationship between binding site affinity and tissue specificity and expression level, and regulatory evolution at the locus level.</p><p>Suggested new experiments (not necessary for publication):</p><p>1) A key aspect of this article is the identification and characterization of the ptc proximal promoter (region BA) that drives tonic low levels of expression in a broad manner. This is particularly relevant because such Hh-independent expression is required to prevent ectopic pathway activation in the absence of the ligand. As this is also the case for <italic>Ptch1</italic>, it would be important to assay if equivalent or similar constructs containing the <italic>Ptch1</italic> proximal and core promoter are also able to drive low/broad expression of the reporter in mouse transgenic embryos (by lacZ staining or qPCR). The analysis of the <italic>Ptch1</italic> locus shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref> is not addressing this important aspect.</p><p>2) The authors should compare what is the impact of the endogenous promoter on the expression driven by the DB element (that is, compare the pattern and levels driven by DB-hspmin and a DA reporter construct). This data could be added to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref> and would address the effect of the endogenous promoter on an enhancer with clustered, high-affinity Gli motifs.</p><p>Minor points (need to be addressed):</p><p>1) In relation with <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>, GFP expression driven by the ptcBA transgene in the wing disc is difficult to visualize. The GFP quantification plot – currently shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3M</xref>- should be moved to the main figure.</p><p>2) It is not always clear how the different mutated constructs were made. A table with all the mutations introduced (original and mutated GBS) should be provided. For example, in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>, it is not clear which motif(s) have been altered in enhancers DB, HF, VT, YU and ZY. This is important to provide for potential follow-up studies.</p><p>In addition, the sequences of the main regions tested should be provided as supplementary data and the GBS color-annotated according to predicted affinity.</p><p>3) If possible, colors should be consistent, in particular for enhancers that are described in several figures. For example, ZY is green in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>, brown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref> and orange in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>.</p><p>4) What is exactly the Ptc-prox construct shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>? Does it contain a hspmin promoter?</p><p>5) Given that the nomenclature is complicated, the text should be carefully proofed for mistakes. For example, in the second to last sentence of the subsection “Bypassing enhancer-promoter specificity reveals diverse sub-patterns among segmentation stripe enhancers of <italic>patched</italic>” it should read LK instead of VT. The legend for <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref> should also be clarified, as the authors state in the text that the ptc promoter lacks a TATA box.</p><p>6) Introduction, first paragraph. It took me a few reads through these sentences to understand the contrast of patterned vs. constitutive targets. Maybe there is a way to clarify this further? Perhaps simply state that patterned targets respond in a subset of cells with an active Hh pathway, whereas universal targets respond in all Hh active cells.</p><p>A priori, there are two extreme possibilities (which is explained more clearly later in the paper). The universal pattern is either encoded by a bunch of separate enhancers, one or more for each tissue, or the universal pattern is encoded by a single regulatory element that is expressed in multiple contexts. The results of the paper demonstrate the first scenario, but it might be nice to set up these two possibilities at the outset to give some context.</p><p>7) Introduction, second paragraph. This set up was a little hard for me to follow on the first read, as it contains a lot of specific results. I would suggest a new paragraph here (starting at &quot;We wondered[…]“, laying out what you will test beyond what is already known. First, the central question is whether the ptc(prox) enhancer sufficient to drive the universal expression pattern. Then, you hypothesize no, based on previous results where placing high affinity Gli sites into embryonic ectoderm enhancers isn't sufficient to turn them on. You then test this hypothesis by examining expression of ptc(prox) in the embryonic ectoderm.</p><p>8) Results, first paragraph. I suggest &quot;In this study, we define a nomenclature[…] “rather than &quot;we determined the nomenclature&quot;, which could be confused for uncovering an existing nomenclature.</p><p>9) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2K</xref>'-N'. What is the purpose of the greyscale half of the images? Perhaps to show the quantification more clearly? This should be clarified in the figure legend.</p><p>10) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>. Using a greyscale heatmap to indicate the affinity of the predicted Gli sites is clever. But it is difficult to see on the schematics of each enhancer. You could consider using a colored background for the enhancer and superimposing the white to black sites on top of it. As long as the background is a mid-tone (not too dark and not too light), this will make the sites pop.</p><p>11) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>. The expression patterns in the mouse embryos are quite difficult to see in this figure. They are small relative to the amount of space devoted to the functional genomics data. Though I can understand why it's appealing to keep them aligned, I suggest breaking the alignment to give them more space. Also, the colored thermometer shapes are not explained in the legend. Do they represent binding sites? If so, the visual convention for binding sites has changed from the heatmaps for the <italic>Drosophila</italic> enhancers, which is confusing. The heatmap representation conveys more information, so I suggest changing this figure to that convention in both panels.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.13550.030</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>Suggested new experiments (not necessary for publication):</italic></p><p><italic>1) A key aspect of this article is the identification and characterization of the ptc proximal promoter (region BA) that drives tonic low levels of expression in a broad manner.

You could consider using a colored background for the enhancer and superimposing the white to black sites on top of it. As long as the background is a mid-tone (not too dark and not too light), this will make the sites pop.</italic></p><p>We have spent a lot of time working on the best way to visuallyindicate binding motif affinity. In earlier drafts of our figures, enhancer diagrams had colored backgrounds, exactly as the reviewer suggests. However, because the indicated motifs range from dark to light, most background tones mask the medium-gray sites, which are the ones most relevant to this report (see examples, below). Also, this effect depends on the background color used, with the result that the same site looks different in different enhancers. The advantage of the white background is that, by the visual logic of the greyscale heatmap, white represents the lowest, or background, affinity. Thus Gli motifs fade into the white background as their predicted affinity decreases.<fig id="fig7" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.13550.023</object-id><label>Author response image 1.</label><caption><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.13550.023">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.13550.023</ext-link></p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="x-tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-13550-resp-fig1-v2"/></fig></p><p><italic>11) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>. The expression patterns in the mouse embryos are quite difficult to see in this figure. They are small relative to the amount of space devoted to the functional genomics data. Though I can understand why it's appealing to keep them aligned, I suggest breaking the alignment to give them more space. Also, the colored thermometer shapes are not explained in the legend. Do they represent binding sites? If so, the visual convention for binding sites has changed from the heatmaps for the Drosophila enhancers, which is confusing. The heatmap representation conveys more information, so I suggest changing this figure to that convention in both panels.</italic></p><p>We have significantly revised <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref> in response to these suggestions. We haveenlarged the mouse embryo images in panel A, breaking the horizontal alignment as suggested by the reviewer. We chose to use red for all Gli motifs in this figure, rather than the red+greyscale of other figures, for the sake of consistency and simplicity within this complex summary diagram. In addition to all the other information presented in these panels, indicating affinity with a range of colors would (in our opinion, after much experimentation) be visually overwhelming. However, we have followed the reviewer’s excellent suggestion and replaced the “thermometer” shapes with simple bands, consistent with the visual logic of previous figures in which binding motifs are vertical bands. These changes are reflected in revisions to the text and figure legend.</p></body></sub-article></article>
