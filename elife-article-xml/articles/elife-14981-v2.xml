elongation factor (NELF). Here we discern the functional architecture of human NELF through X-ray crystallography, protein crosslinking, biochemical assays, and RNA crosslinking in cells. We identify a NELF core subcomplex formed by conserved regions in subunits NELF-A and NELF-C, and resolve its crystal structure. The NELF-AC subcomplex binds single-stranded nucleic acids in vitro, and NELF-C associates with RNA in vivo. A positively charged face of NELF-AC is involved in RNA binding, whereas the opposite face of the NELF-AC subcomplex binds NELF-B. NELF-B is predicted to form a HEAT repeat fold, also binds RNA in vivo, and anchors the subunit NELF-E, which is confirmed to bind RNA in vivo. These results reveal the three-dimensional architecture and three RNA-binding faces of NELF.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.14981.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.14981.001</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>gene transcription</kwd><kwd>RNA polymerase II</kwd><kwd>gene regulation</kwd><kwd>promoter-proximal pausing</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100004410</institution-id><institution>European Molecular Biology Organization</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>ALTF 745-2014</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Vos</surname><given-names>Seychelle M</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100004410</institution-id><institution>European Molecular Biology Organization</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>ALTF 1261-2014</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Caizzi</surname><given-names>Livia</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001659</institution-id><institution>Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>GRK1721</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Herzog</surname><given-names>Franz</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000781</institution-id><institution>European Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>StG 638218</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Herzog</surname><given-names>Franz</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000781</institution-id><institution>European Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>TRANSIT</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Cramer</surname><given-names>Patrick</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001659</institution-id><institution>Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>SFB860</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Cramer</surname><given-names>Patrick</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-7"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001663</institution-id><institution>Volkswagen Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Cramer</surname><given-names>Patrick</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The structural architecture of the 4-subunit, RNA-binding human negative elongation factor NELF is derived by a combination of X-ray crystallography and protein crosslinking.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Transcription of eukaryotic protein-coding genes by RNA polymerase II (Pol II) is not only regulated during the initiation phase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Hahn and Young, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Sainsbury et al., 2015</xref>) but also during elongation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Jonkers and Lis, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Li and Gilmour, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Yamaguchi et al., 2013</xref>).

Such promoter-proximal pausing is a key event during post-initiation regulation of transcription (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Muse et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Zeitlinger et al., 2007</xref>). Genes involved in cellular responses, differentiation, and reprogramming are subject to regulation at the step of promoter-proximal pausing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Williams et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Min et al., 2011</xref>).</p><p>Promoter-proximal pausing requires the DRB sensitivity-inducing factor (DSIF), a heterodimer of subunits Spt4 and Spt5 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Wada et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Yamaguchi et al., 1999b</xref>). DSIF binds over the active site cleft of the Pol II elongation complex to encircle nucleic acids bound in the cleft (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Martinez-Rucobo et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Klein et al., 2011</xref>). Promoter-proximal pausing also employs the negative elongation factor (NELF) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Pagano et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Yamaguchi et al., 1999a</xref>), which comprises the four subunits NELF-A, -B, -C (or its variant -D, which lacks nine N-terminal amino acid residues), and -E (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Narita et al., 2003</xref>).</p><p>DSIF and NELF assemble early with transcribing Pol II, which leads to stable promoter-proximal pausing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Henriques et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Wu et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Yamaguchi et al., 1999a</xref>).

Pol II pause release relies on a kinase complex called positive transcription elongation factor b (P-TEFb) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Chiba et al., 2010</xref>). P-TEFb phosphorylates DSIF, NELF and the Pol II C-terminal domain (CTD), which encodes 52 heptapeptide repeats (consensus sequence Y<sub>1</sub>S<sub>2</sub>P<sub>3</sub>T<sub>4</sub>S<sub>5</sub>P<sub>6</sub>S<sub>7</sub>) that are variably phosphorylated during the transcription cycle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Buratowski, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Cheng and Price, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Fujinaga et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Yamada et al., 2006</xref>).</p><p>DSIF, P-TEFb and NELF are differentially conserved among eukaryotes. DSIF is the most widely conserved complex with homologs present in most eukaryotes and even prokaryotes. P-TEFb homologs are found in most eukaryotes, whereas NELF conservation is more limited. For example, NELF homologs have not been identified in model organisms such as <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana, Saccharomyces cerevisiae,</italic> and <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Narita et al., 2003</xref>).</p><p>NELF was identified as a complex that cooperates with DSIF to repress Pol II elongation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Yamaguchi et al., 1999a</xref>). NELF apparently requires a preformed Pol II-DSIF elongation complex for stable binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Missra and Gilmour, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Narita et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Yamaguchi et al., 2002</xref>). NELF binding efficiency and the rate of transcription elongation define the position of Pol II pausing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Li et al., 2013</xref>). NELF is associated with chromatin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Wu et al., 2005</xref>) and represses transcription elongation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Wu et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Yamaguchi et al., 2002</xref>). The NELF-E subunit contains a RNA recognition motif (RRM) domain that binds RNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Pagano et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Rao et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">2008</xref>), and this may contribute to pausing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Yamaguchi et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Fujinaga et al., 2004</xref>). NELF is required for the regulation of the heat stress gene <italic>hsp70</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Wu et al., 2003</xref>), immediate early genes such as <italic>junb</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Aida et al., 2006</xref>), and expression of genes of the human immunodeficiency virus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Natarajan et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Zhang et al., 2007</xref>). It was recently suggested that NELF binds to enhancer RNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Schaukowitch et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>Despite the central role of promoter-proximal pausing in gene regulation, the molecular mechanisms for Pol II pausing are unknown. Elucidating this mechanism requires structural information of the NELF complex. Here we show that regions of human NELF-A and NELF-C form a highly conserved core subcomplex with a novel fold. One side of this NELF-AC subcomplex exhibits a conserved binding face for single-stranded nucleic acids. RNA binding experiments in human cells reveal that NELF-B, NELF-C, and NELF-E associate with RNA in vivo. Our data provide the first structural model of NELF and extend our understanding of its RNA binding surfaces.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>NELF subcomplex NELF-AC</title><p>In a long-standing effort to obtain structural information on the intrinsically flexible NELF complex, we delineated regions in human NELF subunits that form soluble subcomplexes amenable to structural analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>, Materials and methods).

NELF-C adopts a horseshoe-like structure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). NELF-C consists of 22 α-helices (α1’-α22’) and a small two-stranded β-sheet (β1’-β2’, residues 367–379) that protrudes from the surface. The C-terminal half of NELF-C (helices α14’-α19’) forms three HEAT repeats (H1-H3). The HEAT repeat region shows structural similarity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Holm and Rosenstrom, 2010</xref>) to the C-terminal repeat domain (CTD)-interacting domain (CID) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Meinhart and Cramer, 2004</xref>) and the polyadenylation factor symplekin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Xiang et al., 2010</xref>).

Subunit NELF-A forms a highly conserved helical ‘N-terminal domain’ (helices α1–α5, residues 6–110) that resembles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Holm and Rosenstrom, 2010</xref>) the fold of the HIV integrase-binding domain present in human PC4 and SFRS1-interacting protein (PSIP1) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Cherepanov et al., 2005</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>).

NELF-B is the only subunit of the NELF complex with no available structural information. We first used our crosslinking data to determine the relative architecture of NELF-B. Intrasubunit crosslinks reveal three distinct modules that we identify as the N-terminal, middle, and C-terminal regions. The N-terminal region of NELF-B (85–291) forms extensive crosslinks within itself and with the C-terminal region (438–519). The C-terminal region also crosslinks considerably with itself. The middle region (291–438) forms intrasubunit crosslinks within but not outside of the module, suggesting that it may act as a hinge between the N- and C- terminal regions.</p><p>We next used the program I-TASSER to generate homology based models of NELF-B (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Kelley et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Yang et al., 2015</xref>). I-TASSER predicted that NELF-B forms a HEAT repeat fold (C-score = -2.31, best template structure is 1B3U – human PP2A). The model is supported by our crosslinking data, suggesting a strong curvature of the HEAT repeat fold, as observed for a HEAT repeat protein folding around its interaction partner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Cingolani et al., 1999</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1D</xref>).</p><p>NELF-B crosslinks with NELF-AC via its N- and C- terminal regions. The crosslinks primarily map to a single face of NELF-AC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). Two NELF-A residues present in the NELF-AC crystal structure, K55 and K166 form crosslinks with NELF-B residues K72, K278, K487 and K85 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>). NELF-C primarily crosslinks to the N-terminal region of NELF-B (K85, K92, K126, K146) via α helices 12’ and 13’ and helices 18’ and 19’ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>). Interestingly, one N-terminal residue of NELF-C that is not present in our crystal structure (K125) forms three crosslinks with NELF-B (K85, K278, and K497). NELF-B and -E crosslink extensively, consistent with biochemical interaction data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Narita et al., 2003</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref>). The N-terminus and the RRM domain of NELF-E (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Rao et al., 2006</xref>) (residues 257–335, PDB ID: 2JX2) crosslink to both the N- and C-terminal regions of NELF-B. We also detect an intrasubunit crosslink between NELF-E residues K260 and K332, which are located on the same face of the RRM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1E</xref>), supporting the general conservation of the fold in the complex.</p><p>With respect to crosslinks between NELF-E and NELF-C, two lysines in the non-crystallized N-terminal region of NELF-C (K66 and K125) form several crosslinks with NELF-E, including its RRM domain. Regions of NELF-C in the vicinity of helices 18’ and 19’, which are also responsible for some of the detected crosslinks between NELF-B and -C, crosslink with the NELF-E N-terminal region and the RRM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figures 3G</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">4A</xref>). No crosslinks were detected between the crystallized region of NELF-A and NELF-E (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3H</xref>). The region directly following the crystallized portion of NELF-A (190–255) forms multiple crosslinks with the rest of the NELF complex. Given that NELF-A (190–255) is highly susceptible to proteolysis and is predicted to be the primary region associating with Pol II, the multiple interprotein crosslinks formed by NELF-A (190–255) with NELF-B, -C, and -E are likely favored by flexibility within the molecule when Pol II is absent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Narita et al., 2003</xref>).</p><p>Our crosslinking data suggest the 3D topology for the entire NELF complex. The NELF-AC subcomplex interacts with NELF-B primarily through contacts made by NELF-C and the N-terminal region of NELF-B. The opposite face of NELF-AC remains solvent exposed in the complex. NELF-B with its predicted heat repeats forms a cradle around the N-terminal region of NELF-E, tethering the RRM domain to the rest of the complex. Taken together, NELF is a modular, flexible, multivalent complex with many interaction faces for both nucleic acids and protein partners.</p></sec><sec id="s2-6"><title>NELF-AC binds single-stranded nucleic acids</title><p>Analysis of the surface of the NELF-AC structure showed that the face opposite of where we detected NELF-BE crosslinks contains four positively charged patches (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A–C</xref>, bottom view). Patch 1 consists of NELF-A residues R65 and R66 and NELF-C residues R291 and K315. Patch 2 encompasses NELF-C residues K371, K372, and K374, and patch 3 contains NELF-C residues K384 and K388. Patch 4 is composed of NELF-A residues K146, K161, K168, and R175, and NELF-C residues R419 and R506. These patches are well conserved among metazoans, and are partially conserved in <italic>Dictyostelium</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). Our crosslinking MS data revealed that all positive patches, except for patch 3 (NELF-C K384, K388), were devoid of crosslinks with NELF-B or -E indicating that surface patches 1, 2, and 4 are not involved in subunit contacts. In addition to the four positive patches, the NELF-AC surface contains a conserved polar patch (patch 5) that is formed by NELF-A residues K166, R167, K170, L174, E177, K181, and S182, and residues E491, K494, D498, D526, S528, R531, Y532, T535 and E536 that protrude from NELF-C helices α18’ and α20’ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>). Interestingly, three lysines in this region (NELF-A K166, K181, NELF-C K494) crosslink to NELF-B.</p><p>The positively charged patches of NELF-AC suggested that the subcomplex may associate with nucleic acid. To investigate this, we used fluorescence anisotropy titration assays (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>, Materials and methods). We first assessed NELF-AC binding to 25-nt, single-stranded (ss) DNA and ssRNA oligonucleotides bearing a 5’ FAM label. Two random sequences with either 44% or 60% GC content were employed. Interestingly, we detected moderate binding of NELF-AC to the ssDNA and ssRNA with 60% GC content. Fitting the resulting binding curves by linear regression analysis gave apparent K<sub>d</sub>’s in the low micromolar range (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl3">Table 3</xref>). The addition of competitor tRNA did not affect NELF-AC association with the 60% GC ssDNA/ssRNA indicating that the interaction is specific (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1A</xref>). In contrast, we found that the 44% GC content RNA failed to associate significantly with the NELF-AC complex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>). Additionally, NELF-AC did not associate with nucleic acid duplexes composed of the 60% GC sequence (DNA or DNA-RNA hybrids, not shown), suggesting that RNA and DNA binding by the subcomplex may be sequence and structure dependent.<fig-group><fig id="fig5" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.14981.014</object-id><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><title>NELF-AC binds single-stranded nucleic acids.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Binding of wild type (WT) NELF-AC to 10 nM fluorescently labeled ssRNA or ssDNA with 60% GC content as monitored by the change in relative fluorescence anisotropy.

generated NELF-AC variants in which lysine and arginine residues in the patches were substituted with methionine and glutamine, respectively. Indeed, single-stranded nucleic acid binding to the 60% GC RNA and DNA constructs was impaired in variants with mutations in three or four of the positively charged patches (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl3">Table 3</xref>). The strongest RNA binding defects are associated with mutations to patches 1 and 4, whereas mutations to patch 2 appear to have a greater impact on ssDNA association.</p><p>We also tested whether single-stranded nucleic acids corresponding to known Pol II in vivo pause sites could associate with NELF-AC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1C</xref> inset). A ssRNA oligonucleotide with a sequence corresponding to a promoter-proximal transcript from the <italic>junB</italic> gene bound NELF-AC with a K<sub>d</sub> of ~8.0 ± 0.9 µM, whereas ssDNA corresponding to the non-template strand in this region bound more weakly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Aida et al., 2006</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1C</xref>).

To expand our understanding of NELF association with the TAR RNA stem loop, we performed fluorescence anisotropy binding experiments with our collection of NELF variants and a 5’ FAM labeled TAR stem loop. Binding experiments performed with the WT NELF complex revealed strong association between NELF and the TAR RNA stem loop (146 ± 30 nM), similar to affinities reported by the Lis group for the isolated human NELF-E RRM and the TAR stem loop (200 ± 10 nM) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Pagano et al., 2014</xref>). Interestingly, NELF complexes lacking the NELF-E RRM or NELF-E retained the ability to associate with the TAR stem loop albeit with a ≈6–10-fold reduction in binding affinity (869 ± 140 nM NELF ∆RRM, NELF-ABC 1.32 ± 0.18 µM). To determine which subcomplex of NELF is responsible for the non-RRM mediated association with the TAR stem loop, we tested binding of NELF-AC and NELF-BE (1–138) to the TAR stem loop. NELF-BE (1–138) modestly associated with the TAR stem loop (5.6 ± 1.0 µM) whereas NELF-AC showed little association (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D</xref>).

Our biochemical experiments demonstrate that NELF additionally binds to single-stranded nucleic acids via NELF-B and NELF-AC in vitro. To determine whether NELF-B or NELF-AC can also associate with RNA in vivo, we performed photoactivatable-ribonucleoside-enhanced crosslinking and immunoprecipitation experiments in Jurkat and 293FT cells. Cells were treated for 16 hr with 4-thiouridine (4sU) to label RNA and enhance crosslinking efficiency. RNA was crosslinked to associated proteins using UV light at a wavelength of 365 nm prior to immunoprecipitation with subunit-specific antibodies.

To close this gap, we report here the crystal structure of the conserved core NELF subcomplex NELF-AC and the architecture of the 4-subunit, complete NELF complex. We further show that NELF-B and NELF-AC bind single-stranded nucleic acids in vitro, and that NELF-B and NELF-C, in addition to NELF-E, associate with RNA in vivo. These results provide an important step in understanding NELF function and provide the basis for a mechanistic analysis of the role of NELF in promoter-proximal pausing.</p><p>From our structural, biochemical and in vivo data, we propose an architectural model for the NELF complex. In the complex, NELF-AC binds to the N-terminal region of NELF-B. The N-terminal region of NELF-E is sandwiched in between the N- and C- termini of NELF-B, anchoring the flexible NELF-E RRM domain to the rest of the complex. Strong RNA binding by the NELF-E RRM may initially recruit NELF to RNA and secondary binding events by NELF-B and NELF-C may further stabilize the complex on nucleic acid. Future structural studies are required to determine the nucleic acid binding surfaces of NELF-B and to determine how RNA snakes from the NELF-E RRM through the rest of the complex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>). It is also likely that RNA-binding involves major conformational changes.<fig id="fig9" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.14981.024</object-id><label>Figure 9.</label><caption><title>Model of NELF architecture and RNA binding regions.</title><p>The NELF-AC crystal structure, crosslinking data, and in vivo experiments reveal the overall architecture of NELF.

Such gene specificity may be explained by differences in promoter-proximal DNA regions. How can DNA sequence influence pausing? First, certain sequences may lead to DNA-RNA hybrids that favor Pol II pausing by slowing down the elongation rate, similar to DNA sequences that influence pausing of bacterial RNA polymerase or <italic>Drosophila</italic> Pol II (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Larson et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Vvedenskaya et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Greive and Hippel, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Nechaev et al., 2010</xref>). DNA sequence also affects binding of proteins such as GAGA factor and estrogen receptor, which both are reported to recruit NELF to specific genes to induce pausing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Aiyar et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Li et al., 2013</xref>). Second, nascent RNA may bind to NELF with different affinities, influencing the efficiency of NELF recruitment to pause sites. Indeed, we observed that nucleic acid binding of NELF-AC may depend on the nucleic acid sequence, and it is known that the RNA-binding activity of the NELF-E RRM domain is sequence-dependent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Pagano et al., 2014</xref>).

The NELF interaction with CBC is involved in the appropriate 3’ processing of histone mRNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Narita et al., 2007</xref>). Similarly, processing of U1, U2, U4, and U5 snRNAs is dependent on NELF and Integrator (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Yamamoto et al., 2014</xref>). Future work is required to determine which RNAs associate with NELF in cells and if this binding activity is independent of NELF’s role in promoter proximal pausing.</p><p>We note that nucleic acid binding alone may explain recruitment of NELF to certain genes and its association with promoter-proximal regions, but is insufficient to explain Pol II pausing, which additionally requires a change in the elongation behavior of Pol II. This may involve a conformational switch in the polymerase that may be triggered or stabilized by NELF binding to the Pol II surface. Analysis of this intricate mechanism awaits structural studies of functional complexes comprising Pol II, DSIF, NELF and additional factors.

Further, I am concerned that the signals shown don't appear to depend much on UV irradiation (especially in 293FT cells, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1C</xref>).

The suggestions have led to a much improved manuscript. We present several new experiments in the manuscript including crosslinking-mass spectrometric analysis with the full-length (FL) NELF tetramer produced in insect cells, RNA binding experiments with the FL NELF tetramer, and in vivo experiments after NELF-B overexpression. Our conclusions could be expanded with the new data. Additional information concerning the figures has been added to the text and figure legends to make things clearer for the reader. We have addressed the points raised by the reviewers.</p><p><italic>Essential revisions:</italic></p><p><italic>1) The authors identified novel RNA binding sites in NELF-C, but it is unclear whether this interaction actually occurs in the context of tetramer (the authors observed RNA-crosslinking to NELF-C only when over-expressing NELF-C, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1F</xref>) and whether this interaction is important for the NELF function.

It would be important to include this data in this manuscript, ideally as <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>.</italic></p><p>We have performed a number of additional experiments to address this important point. Fluorescence anisotropy experiments were performed with the complete NELF complex and subcomplexes of NELF containing NELF-ABC or NELF-ABC and an -E variant lacking the RRM. These experiments reveal that NELF binds to RNA using regions outside of the well-characterized NELF-E RRM. Introduction of NELF-C patch mutations in the tetramer reduce RNA association of the complex, further supporting NELF-C dependent RNA interactions within the tetramer. We also find that NELF-B binds to RNA with a similar affinity as measured for NELF-AC. As advised by the referees, we performed additional crosslinking-MS experiments with the complete NELF complex purified from insect cells. This data is now reported in the manuscript and indeed indicates that in the context of the tetramer, the reported RNA binding face of NELF-C is not involved in contacts between other subunits.</p><p><italic>2) It was unclear to the reviewers whether the authors were arguing for sequence specificity in the RNA binding of NELF-C (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>).

Indeed, we observe that NELF-AC prefers to bind certain RNA sequences. We have added evidence to confirm this point. Use of another random 25 nt RNA/DNA sequence resulted in no detectable binding by the NELF-AC complex. This data has now been incorporated as panel 5B. Further, the HIV-1 TAR RNA was previously shown to be a preferred substrate for the <italic>Drosophila</italic> and human NELF-E RRM (Pagano et al., 2014, Yamaguchi et al., 2002, Fuijnaga et al., 2004) in vitro. To expand upon these findings, we tested whether the stem loop of the HIV-1 TAR RNA associates with NELF through regions outside of the RRM. Indeed, we find that NELF associates with the TAR stem loop in the absence of NELF-E. From our data, it appears that NELF-B in complex with a fragment of -E modestly associates with the RNA. In contrast, NELF-AC does not associate with the TAR RNA, further suggesting that its ability to associate with RNA is sequence-dependent.</p><p>We made sure the conclusions reflect correctly what is observed. We had performed binding experiments with substrates that correspond to pausing sequences of <italic>JunB</italic> and <italic>c-Fos</italic> and determined binding constants that are similar to those obtained with the 60% GC random sequence. That we observe interactions with these sequences in vitro does not mean that NELF-AC associates with these sequences in vivo. We only interpret these data to mean that NELF-AC has a propensity to associate with sequences associated with the <italic>JunB</italic> or <italic>c-Fos</italic>. We have moved these figures to the supplementary material.</p><p><italic>3) The data supporting an interaction of NELF-C with RNA in cells is not very strong. First, the bands for NELF-C/D are not well separated from NELF-B, making it totally possible that they are in fact detecting NELF-B interactions with RNA rather than NELF-C. This is a serious caveat. Further, I am concerned that the signals shown don't appear to depend much on UV irradiation (especially in 293FT cells, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1C</xref>). Can the authors find a more convincing way to demonstrate NELF-C interactions with RNA</italic> in vivo<italic>? This would really strengthen the manuscript</italic>.</p><p>We thank the reviewers for spotting this and share their concerns. NELF-B and -C are of similar MW (66kDa versus 65kDa) and are thus difficult to separate by SDS-PAGE. Unfortunately, we are limited in the number of available technologies for detecting protein•RNA interactions in vivo. PAR-CLIP is well suited but is limited by the availablility of good antibodies to immunoprecipitate (IP) specific complexes or proteins. We attempted to IP NELF-C specifically, but the IP failed with several different antibodies. We also tried to IP NELF-B specifically, but this also failed. We performed PAR-CLIP in several cell lines with the NELF-E IP (HeLa, K562, Jurkat, 293FT). In K562 and HeLa cells, low abundance of the NELF complex and other RNA binding contaminants, respectively, stymied our attempts to orthogonally test whether we could detect a signal for NELF-B/C.</p><p>Therefore, to determine whether NELF-B could contribute to the radiolabeled signal, we performed in vitro binding experiments with NELF-B and found that it indeed associates with RNA (see point 1). This indicates that in our IP from Jurkat cells, the signal we detect can be attributed to either NELF-B or NELF-C or both. We have noted this in the text.</p><p>We also performed overexpression experiments in 293FT cells with NELF-B and detect a signal for NELF-B. Further, we have observed that 293FT cells show less signal after UV exposure than Jurkat cells. UV irradiation enhances the RNA crosslinking to proteins but the efficiency of crosslinking might differ for each cell line. It is possible that Jurkat cells possess more RNA bound NELF than 293FT, resulting in a more intense signal after UV irradiation. Taken together, we hope the reviewers appreciate the technical limitations of investigating RNA binding to NELF subunits in vivo, and agree that we show convincingly that NELF-B and -C bind RNA in cells, but certainly there is in vivo RNA binding outside of NELF-E.</p><p><italic>4) The authors should provide a final model of the NELF architecture with and without RNA. The authors may also consider performing protein-protein cross linking (as in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>) in the presence of RNA to understand the architecture of the tetramer bound to RNA, and to better understand the protein-RNA cross linking result.</italic></p><p>We have provided a model of NELF architecture with and without RNA as <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>. We performed protein•protein cross linking of NELF in the presence of a TAR RNA substrate as suggested by the referees. From these data, we detect fewer protein-protein crosslinks, indicating that the RNA reduces the flexibility of some protein regions. We also observe changes in the intraprotein crosslinks when RNA is present, indicating conformational changes in NELF upon RNA binding. We currently lack an atomic model of NELF-B and the N-terminus of NELF-E, which makes it difficult to know exactly how NELF interacts with RNA. We have thus decided to not present the new crosslinking MS data in the current manuscript. We have added more to the Discussion section to describe potential roles for RNA binding by the NELF complex.</p><p><italic>[Editors' note: further revisions were requested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</italic></p><p><italic>In the revised version of Vos et al. the authors do a nice job of clarifying the manuscript and addressing reviewer concerns.
