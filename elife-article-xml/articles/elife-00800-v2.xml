Ammonium uptake is mediated by ammonium transporters, whose regulation is poorly understood. While transport can easily be characterized in heterologous systems, measuring transporter activity in vivo remains challenging. Here we developed a simple assay for monitoring activity in vivo by inserting circularly-permutated GFP into conformation-sensitive positions of two plant and one yeast ammonium transceptors (‘AmTrac’ and ‘MepTrac’). Addition of ammonium to yeast cells expressing the sensors triggered concentration-dependent fluorescence intensity (FI) changes that strictly correlated with the activity of the transporter. Fluorescence-based activity sensors present a novel technology for monitoring the interaction of the transporters with their substrates, the activity of transporters and their regulation in vivo, which is particularly valuable in the context of analytes for which no radiotracers exist, as well as for cell-specific and subcellular transport processes that are otherwise difficult to track.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.00800.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.00800.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.00800.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Ammonium provides a vital source of nitrogen for bacteria, fungi and plants, and is produced by animals as a waste product of metabolism. High levels of ammonium can be toxic, so all organisms need to control their uptake or excretion of this substance. Ammonium transporters, which are highly conserved from bacteria to plants to humans, are essential for this process but, along with transporters in general, they are hard to study. Their activity can be examined in vitro by expressing them in heterologous systems—that is, in cells other than those in which they are naturally found. But in vivo studies must rely on indirect techniques such as monitoring radioactive isotopes or membrane potentials, and these cannot distinguish between the activity of ammonium transporters and uptake of ammonium through other routes.</p><p>One approach that has been successful in other fields is the use of fluorescent proteins that can signal conformational changes—such as those that occur when a transporter is activated—by a shift in fluorescence. Green fluorescent protein (GFP) is a commonly used fluorescent indicator, and a particularly useful variant is ‘circularly permutated GFP’. This is GFP in which parts of the amino acid sequence have been rearranged without fundamentally changing the overall structure or function of the protein. Circularly permutated GFP can be fused to another protein in such a way that a conformational change in the second protein triggers a change in fluorescence that can be detected by fluorescence spectroscopy or microscopy.</p><p>Now, De Michele et al. have applied this approach to the study of both plant and yeast ammonium transporters. They constructed a library of fusion proteins made up of circularly permutated GFP and an ammonium transporter from the plant <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic>—and found one version that functioned normally as a transporter but also produced a detectable change in fluorescence that correlated precisely with transporter activity.</p><p>De Michele et al. then used the same method to produce fluorescent indicator fusion proteins of two more ammonium transporters—a second isoform from <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> and one from yeast. These fluorescent sensors should be a great boon to researchers studying the ammonium transport system. Moreover, this approach could in theory be applied to other transporter proteins that are currently difficult to study, and so could help to open up research into a variety of transport processes.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.00800.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.00800.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author keywords</title><kwd>transport</kwd><kwd>conformation</kwd><kwd>biosensor</kwd><kwd>ammonium</kwd><kwd>GFP</kwd><kwd>fluorescent probe</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>A. thaliana</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>National Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>MCB-1021677</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Frommer</surname><given-names>Wolf B</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>DOE BER Office of Science</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>DE-AC02-05CH11231</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Loqué</surname><given-names>Dominique</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>AN 676/1</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Andrade</surname><given-names>Susana LA</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>A modified form of Green Fluorescent Protein integrated into an ammonium transporter provides a sensor that can be used to monitor transport activity in vivo.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Transport proteins play critical roles in cellular uptake and release as well as subcellular distribution of ions and metabolites. Due to their hydrophobic nature the characterization of transporters is challenging, and activity measurements typically depend on the use of radiotracers and heterologous expression systems. One of the major breakthroughs for characterizing channels has been the development of electrophysiology tools, enabling characterization of electrogenic transport in live cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Neher and Sakmann, 1992</xref>). However, patch clamping has largely been limited to the analysis of processes at the cell membrane, or cells at the surface of sliced tissues. A new level of insight was provided by fluorescent proteins enabling us to observe cellular processes in living cells of intact tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Tsien, 2006</xref>). Fluorescence Resonance Energy Transfer (FRET) sensors have allowed us to monitor analyte levels and dynamics in live cells with minimal invasive methods (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Okumoto et al., 2012</xref>). Particular FRET sensors can even be used to monitor biophysical processes such as membrane potential or tension between molecules in live cells, as well as the conversion of substrates of enzyme reactions by proteases and kinases. Yet to date, we have not been able to directly follow the activity of transporters and to monitor their regulation in vivo.</p><p>We rationalized that it may be possible to create transport activity sensors by monitoring structural rearrangements in a transporter with the help of environmentally sensitive genetically encoded fluorophores. Based on the pioneering work of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Miyawaki et al. (1997)</xref>, FRET can be used to probe conformational rearrangements and has widely been exploited to develop genetically encoded sensors for small molecules. An alternative, again developed by Tsien's lab (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Baird et al., 1999</xref>), is the use of circularly permutated GFP variants as reporters for conformational rearrangements, which have been exploited to create sensors for small molecules such as calcium, zinc and maltose (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Baird et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Marvin et al., 2011</xref>). Circularly-permutated versions of GFP (cpGFP) have successfully been used to monitor structural rearrangements of calmodulin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Baird et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Nagai et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Nakai et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Wang et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Akerboom et al., 2009</xref>). cpGFP is a protein in which the β-barrel structure has been rearranged in a way that ligand-induced conformational changes can influence the chromophore environment and consequentially the fluorescent properties of a chimeric sensor. Depending on pH, GFP and its variants have two excitation maxima (λ<sub>ex</sub> ∼ 395 and 475 nm) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Tsien, 1998</xref>). Protein-cpGFP fusions, in which structural rearrangements affect the state of the chromophore as well as the hydrogen bonds between the chromophore and the surrounding β-barrel, can in principle be exploited to develop sensors that monitor transporter activity. Here we tested the hypothesis that ammonium transporters can effectively report transporter activity in live cells when fused to cpGFP.</p><p>Ammonium transport is key to nitrogen nutrition of bacteria, fungi and plants. Although mammals are unable to assimilate ammonium into amino acids, ammonium transporters play key roles in renal ammonium secretion and male fertility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Biver et al., 2008</xref>). Transporters for ammonium are conserved in bacterial, fungal, plant and animal genomes. Ammonium transport is electrogenic and is mediated by high affinity ammonium transporters of the AMT/MEP/Rhesus protein superfamily (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Marini et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Ninnemann et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Tremblay and Hallenbeck, 2009</xref>). The genome of the plant Arabidopsis contains six AMT paralogs, four of which (AMT1;1, 1;2, 1;3, and 1;5) are partially redundant and together essential for ammonium acquisition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Yuan et al., 2007</xref>).</p><p>In plants, ammonium acquisition is highly regulated and is subject to feedback inhibition, potentially as a means of preventing accumulation of ammonium to toxic levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Wang et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Kronzucker et al., 2001</xref>). Recent results show that ammonium-triggered phosphorylation of a critical threonine in the cytosolic C-terminus of AMT1;1 leads to inhibition of ammonium transport by allosteric regulation in the trimeric transporter complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Loqué et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Lanquar et al., 2009</xref>). The close homolog AMT1;3, also functions as an electrogenic high-affinity ammonium transporter involved in nitrogen uptake in Arabidopsis roots (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Gazzarrini et al., 1999</xref>). AMT1;3 functions in homo- and hetero-trimeric complexes with the coexpressed AMT1;1 and is allosterically regulated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Yuan et al., 2013</xref>). AMT1;3 not only functions as a transporter, but in addition controls root architecture by a process similar to the one found for the yeast MEP2 transceptor (dual function <underline>trans</underline>porter and re<underline>ceptor</underline>), a protein that mediates ammonium transport and regulates pseudohyphal growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Boeckstaens et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Lima et al., 2010</xref>). The term transceptor had been introduced by Thevelein to describe the dual function of the general amino acid permease Gap1p or the phosphate transporter Pho84p in transport and signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Kriel et al., 2011</xref>).</p><p>Most of the progress in the ammonium transport field has been made with the help of yeast and <italic>Xenopus laevis</italic> oocytes as heterologous expression systems. By contrast, in planta studies mostly rely on the use of either stable isotopes (<sup>15</sup>N), or radiotracer analogs (<sup>14</sup>C-methylammonium). Monitoring ammonium-induced depolarization of membrane potential has successfully been deployed in plants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Wang et al., 1994</xref>), yet it can not differentiate between transport mediated by individual AMTs and non-selective cation channels. Therefore, it has not been possible to identify the networks that regulate the substrate-triggered feedback inhibition of ammonium uptake in plant roots. Thus there is a need for new tools that enable us to monitor transport activity in intact root tissues.</p><p>Here we created an activity sensor by inserting cpGFP into a cytosolic loop of the Arabidopsis ammonium transporter AMT1;3. Thorough characterization demonstrates that the chimera reports processes that occur in the transport cycle, although at present it is not possible to differentiate substrate binding or steps in the transport cycle. We project that this approach is transferable to other proteins, a notion supported by the successful creation of additional sensors for the Arabidopsis paralog AMT1;2 as well as the distantly related yeast ammonium transceptor MEP2.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Identification of suitable fluorophore insertion sites</title><p>To engineer a transporter that reports substrate-dependent changes in conformation, we inserted fluorescent proteins (FP) into <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic> AMT1;3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). Monomeric teal fluorescent protein (mTFP), Venus or a modified circularly permutated GFP (mcpGFP), which had successfully been employed to create highly sensitive, single-fluorophore sensors for calcium and maltose (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Tian et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Marvin et al., 2011</xref>), were inserted into intracellular loops of AMT1;3. The functionality of the transporter fusions was tested by complementation of ammonium uptake deficiency in a yeast mutant lacking endogenous ammonium transporters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Marini et al., 1997</xref>). AMT1;3 activity was extremely sensitive to manipulation of loops 7–8 and 9–10 or the cytosolic C-terminus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). However, modification of loop 5–6 (L5–6, position K233) by insertion of either two amino acid residues (encoded as part of the restriction site <italic>XbaI</italic>) or mcpGFP was tolerated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). In contrast, mTFP or Venus insertions inhibited transport activity. Interestingly, L5–6 is located between the two pseudo-symmetric halves of the protein and connects two transmembrane helices (TMH-V and -VI) that contain residues postulated to be directly involved in recruitment, gating and substrate translocation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Andrade et al., 2005</xref>). Moreover, TMH-V has been proposed to oscillate during substrate transport (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Andrade et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Inwood et al., 2009</xref>). L5–6 thus may be a prime location for detecting structural rearrangements through readout of a conformation-sensitive FP.<fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.00800.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Design of fusion constructs.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Topological representation of AMT1;3 by HMMTOP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Tusnady and Simon, 2001</xref>).

However, it is known that the cpGFP-based sensors for calcium and maltose are exquisitely sensitive to modifications in the linker sequences connecting to the respective binding proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Wang et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Akerboom et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Marvin et al., 2011</xref>). To explore whether linker modification would affect the ability of the chimera to detect structural rearrangements of AMT1;3 during transport, we created 24 variants by altering the linkers connecting AMT1;3 and mcpGFP, exploiting information generated during optimization of calcium and maltose sensors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Wang et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Akerboom et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Marvin et al., 2011</xref>). All 24 variants maintained transport activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>); importantly some variants showed a FI response to addition of 1 mM NH<sub>4</sub>Cl (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). The variant showing the strongest response (40% FI change) was named AmTrac (Ammonium Transporter coupled to mcpGFP). In AmTrac, mcpGFP had been inserted into position 233 of AMT1;3, centrally located in the cytosolic loop L5–6 and flanked via linker sequences containing Leu-Glu and Phe-Asn at the N- and C-terminus, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C,D</xref>). To explore the tolerance of L5–6 of AMT1;3 to mcpGFP insertion, we varied the insertion position in the loop (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). Both transport activity and fluorescence response were highest in variants with mcpGFP inserted in central positions of L5–6, with a clear correlation between activity and FI change (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). Loop length also proved to be critical. In variants with incremental deletions in the middle of L5–6 around the insertion point of mcpGFP, deletion of four or more residues abolished transport activity and the fluorescence response (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). Importantly, all variants that responded to ammonium with a FI change were functional transporters, indicating that AmTrac reports transport activity. Fluorescent variants that were able to mediate transport but showed no FI change (such as AMT1;3-mcpGFP-233) were used as control sensors to exclude potential effects of other parameters such as intracellular ammonium, proton accumulation or depolarization on the FI change.<fig id="fig2" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.00800.004</object-id><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Development of AmTrac.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Growth of the yeast Δ<italic>mep1,2,3</italic> mutant transformed with fusion variants on solid media containing 2 mM NH<sub>4</sub>Cl or 1 mM arginine (growth control) as the sole nitrogen source for 3 days.

To test the reversibility of the sensor response directly, we recorded the FI of single cells trapped in a microfluidic device and exposed to ammonium pulses. AmTrac responses were detectable in single cells, were concentration-dependent, and were readily reversible, demonstrating that AmTrac can be used in vivo to quantify ammonium transport activity and to observe kinetics of the chimeric transporter in response to substrate availability (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>).</p><p>The unique selectivity of AMT1 for ammonium over potassium was retained for FI responses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>).

Furthermore, addition of equimolar concentrations of sodium, potassium, calcium, magnesium, manganese or zinc did not trigger a change in FI (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>).

Interestingly, the majority of the brightest variants carried a Ser residue instead of a Glu in the position immediately preceding the mcpGFP insertion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>).

Alternatively, accumulation of intracellular ammonium, and not its transport, could affect mcpGFP fluorescence. Since the <italic>Δmep1,2,3</italic> yeast strain lacks endogenous ammonium transporters, ammonium uptake in these cells depends on episomally expressed transporters. AmTrac mutants unable to transport ammonium also prevent intracellular ammonium accumulation. To discriminate between the hypotheses that AmTrac reports conformational states of the transporter or responds to accumulation of ammonium in the cytosol, AmTrac and AmTrac-D202N, -G460D, -T464D mutants were expressed in wild type yeast carrying endogenous ammonium transporters (MEPs; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>).

They offer new tools for genetic screens, for example, for identifying regulatory networks, or they can be used for screening chemical libraries to identify new drugs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bermejo et al., 2013</xref>). The existing tools, that is, FRET sensors for small molecules allow us to monitor steady state levels and dynamic changes of analytes such as ions, signaling compounds, metabolites and substrates of proteases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Okumoto et al., 2012</xref>). Combined with information on the cellular and subcellular localization of receptors, enzymes and transporters, they can be used to obtain a first picture of the signaling and metabolic networks. However, tools for measuring the activity of transporters in vivo have been limited to electrophysiology, which can not differentiate between transporter isoforms, and is difficult to use for measuring transporter activity in cells in live tissues or even subcellular compartments. Here we developed a prototype for such activity sensors using the important class of ammonium transporters conserved from archaebacteria to higher plants and metazoa, including the human Rhesus factors. We made use of the effect of conformational rearrangements in AMTs/MEPs transceptors on the fluorescence emitted by circularly permutated mcpGFPs that have been inserted into an intracellular loop of the transporters. These fluorescence-based sensors report the activity of the transporter in vivo and can be used to quantify the activity of a specific transporter in vivo. Information on the activity of transporters is relevant for determining the regulation of individual isoforms in live cells, to identify and characterize regulators, to monitor transport in cells otherwise inaccessible to transport measurements, and to characterize subcellular transport processes in living tissues. At the same time these novel sensors may help to record structural rearrangements that occur when transporter bind their ligands or which occur during the transport cycle. We show here that, in contrast to the interpretation of results from crystallization studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Khademi et al., 2004</xref>), AMTs and MEPs both change conformation during transport, and thus most probably do not function as ‘passive gas channels’. The nature of the conformational changes, which here are monitored in ensembles, will require crystallization of the transporter in different states, as recently achieved for a variety of transporters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Forrest and Rudnick, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Shimamura et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Jiang et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Krishnamurthy and Gouaux, 2012</xref>).</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>AmTrac provides an activity proxy</title><p>To create sensors that report substrate binding, a circularly-permutated form of GFP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Tian et al., 2009</xref>) was inserted into the center of the cytosolic loop in AMT1;3 (and AMT1;2 and MEP2) at the pseudo-symmetry axis between the two antiparallel repeats of the transporter. The characteristics of the AmTrac fluorescence response, namely (i) the indistinguishable transport and fluorescence response kinetics, (ii) the reversibility, (iii) the tight link between transport activity for the FI response, (iv) the correlated shifts in affinity for ammonium transport and FI response, and (v) the restoration of the FI response by reconstitution of transport activity in suppressor mutants, strongly indicate that AmTrac sensors measure processes that occur during the transport cycle, or are intimately and quantitatively connected to transport activity. Since binding of the substrate to the transporter is part of the transport cycle, our data do not exclude the possibility that the sensors report extracellular binding of ammonium and therefore measure extracellular ammonium levels rather than activity.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>The role of substrate binding and the transport cycle for signaling through transceptors</title><p>AMTs have been suggested to function as both transporters and receptors for ammonium (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Lima et al., 2010</xref>). Other transporters with a dual function as transporters and signaling proteins include UhpT from <italic>E. coli</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Schwöppe et al., 2003</xref>), Pho84p and GAP1p from <italic>Saccharomyces</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Thevelein and Voordeckers, 2009</xref>) and Chl1 from Arabidopsis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Ho et al., 2009</xref>). The mechanism by which signaling is transmitted is unclear, specifically how substrate binding or conformational rearrangements during the transport cycle are necessary for triggering the receptor activity. Recent work by the Thevelein group has shed some light on the relative role of binding vs transport in this process. Some transporter-like receptors, such as the glucose transporter-like SNF3p and RGT1p from <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic>, appear to be unable to transport, suggesting that binding is sufficient for triggering a conformational rearrangement that is detected by intracellular signaling proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Thevelein and Voordeckers, 2009</xref>). The yeast Pho84 phosphate transceptor functions both in phosphate transport and mediates activation of the protein kinase A pathway. The finding that phosphate analogs that do not appear to be transported retain signaling activity is consistent with the hypothesis that a complete transport cycle is not required for signaling. However, further analyses suggested that ligand binding is insufficient for signaling, therefore the authors concluded the receptor activity is triggered by specific conformational rearrangements that occur during a specific phase of the transport cycle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Popova et al., 2010</xref>). Mutations in the presumed proton-binding site severely reduced transport but not signaling, demonstrating that transport and signaling activities are separable (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Samyn et al., 2012</xref>). Combined analysis of the action of amino acid analogs and mutagenesis of the putative binding site of the amino acid transceptor GAP1 on transport and signaling have indicated that, similar as in PHO84, signaling requires a ligand-induced conformational change that corresponds to a step in the transport cycle but does not appear to require a the full cycle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Van Zeebroeck et al., 2009</xref>). It is therefore conceivable that the fluorescent change observed in the fluorescent ammonium sensors presented here is due to either (i) ammonium binding, (ii) a specific set of steps in the transport cycle, or (iii) the full transport cycle of the transporter.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Insights into the transport mechanism of AMTs</title><p>Crystal structures of AMTs from <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Khademi et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Zheng et al., 2004</xref>) and <italic>Archaeoglobus fulgidus</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Andrade et al., 2005</xref>) did not reveal obvious conformational differences when generated in the presence or absence of ammonium; observations that led to the proposition that AMTs are rigid gas channels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Khademi et al., 2004</xref>). Electrophysiological studies challenged the hypothesis that AMTs transport the uncharged form ammonia by demonstrating that plant AMTs are electrogenic and show minimal or no ammonia conductivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Mayer et al., 2006</xref>). The transport of the charged form of ammonium is further supported by the finding that mutations in the pore release the transporter from a gating control, leading to massively increased transport capacity and an up to 100-fold increase in the K<sub>m</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8A</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Loqué et al., 2009</xref>).</p><p>Moreover, we provided evidence for the existence of open and closed states by demonstrating an allosteric feedback inhibition of transport activity by phosphorylation of residues in the <italic>trans</italic>-activating cytosolic C-terminus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Loqué et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Lanquar et al., 2009</xref>). The fluorescence response of AmTrac variants and MepTrac supports the hypothesis that AMT1;3, AMT1;2 and MEP2 undergo conformational changes during transport. Our results are consistent with the hypothesis that TMH-V and -VI of AMT move relative to each other as a result of ammonium binding or during ammonium translocation, thus affecting the conformation of L5–6 and thereby gating the inserted mcpGFP.</p></sec><sec id="s3-4"><title>Potential to transfer the concept to other transporters, receptors, and enzymes</title><p>cpGFP has successfully been deployed to monitor conformational changes in a variety of proteins, for example, calmodulin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Baird et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Nagai et al., 2001</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Nakai et al., 2001</xref>), metal ion binding domains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Baird et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Mizuno et al., 2007</xref>), a periplasmic sugar binding protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Marvin et al., 2011</xref>), PKG isoforms for measuring cGMP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Nausch et al., 2008</xref>), and a voltage sensing domain of a protein phosphatase (Ci-VSP) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Gautam et al., 2009</xref>). While none of the sensors measures activity, they report ensemble changes in conformational states of the respective proteins.

LeuT carries a substrate-binding site at the interface of the two repeats and undergoes a transport cycle for which multiple states have been identified (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Forrest and Rudnick, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Rudnick, 2011</xref>). Similarly, the transport pore of the AMTs is located between the two pseudo-symmetric halves, with TMH-V and -VI (connected by L5–6) carrying key residues for ammonium translocation. Our data are consistent with the occurrence of structural rearrangements during transport; crystal structures for different states will be required to determine the conformational state during transport.</p></sec><sec id="s3-5"><title>Conclusion</title><p>In summary, we developed an in vivo reporter of activity states for a set of ammonium transporters. The combination of two ammonium transport activity sensors from different organisms will be useful for dissecting endogenous control mechanisms, because heterologous proteins are not expected to be subject to the same regulatory control and can thus serve as references. As a next step, we will deploy AmTrac and MepTrac in both Arabidopsis roots and in yeast to study their regulation in vivo and to identify regulators. The measurement of flux through a transporter by reporting state changes, as shown here, might be applicable to other transporters or enzymes for monitoring in vivo fluxes, for example, in the context of neurotransmission. Such in vivo flux analyses will aid in understanding the mode of action of proteins and may serve as tools for drug discovery.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s5" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s5-1"><title>DNA constructs</title><p>All transporter and sensor constructs were inserted in the yeast expression vector pDRf1-GW, containing the f1 replication origin, GATEWAY cassette, PMA1 promoter fragment, ADH terminator, and the URA3 cassette for selection in yeast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Loqué et al., 2007</xref>).

Your article has been favorably evaluated by a Senior editor, Detlef Weigel, a Reviewing editor, and 2 reviewers.</p><p>The following individuals responsible for the peer review of your submission want to reveal their identity: Richard Aldrich (Reviewing editor), and Christopher Miller and Jonathan Javitch (peer reviewers).</p><p>The Reviewing editor and the two reviewers discussed their comments before we reached this decision, and the Reviewing editor has assembled the following comments to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>The manuscript describes the development, refinement, and optimization of a set of GFP-based fluorescent reporters for a transport-active state of an AMT-family ammonium transporter from Arabidopsis. The experiments convincingly show that the fluorescent intensity of these reporters – circularly permuted GFP constructs fused to AMT1;3 – changes according to the level of extracellular NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup> in the 0.1 mM range, and that this signal nicely tracks the NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup> transport activity as measured directly by voltage-clamp methods in oocytes heterologously expressing the transporter. Thus, the authors argue, we now have a convenient, quantitative reporter for AMT transport activity that may be used in live-cell imaging. Furthermore, they point out, NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup> transport is generally inaccessible to direct measurement, since there is no radioactive isotope or other standard means of following uptake. Since NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup> is a key substrate in plant physiology, these reporters represent an important technical advance. Despite the fact that the reviewers are not convinced that the sensors report transport as opposed to binding, they feel that the approach and the ability to report NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup> concentration represent an important advance.

While we are convinced that these reporters can be used to track extracellular NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup> concentration seen by AMT transporters in these plant cell membranes, we are not at all convinced that the signal reports transport activity, which the authors repeatedly conflate with substrate binding. On the other hand, they may be correct in equating the two for the following reason.

It has therefore been dubbed a “transceptor”, an evocative term familiar to plant aficionados but not to the general reader. The protein, in its “receptor” mode, is therefore thought to undergo a conformational change upon NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup> binding, leading to signal transduction; this is the conformational change the reporters are presumably reporting. But this need not be equivalent to transmembrane movement of substrate, which necessarily involves a steady-state cycling of the protein through multiple conformations (inward-facing, empty – inward-facing, substrate bound, outward-facing, substrate bound, inward occluded, etc.).

It is correct that our data do not allow us to discriminate between binding and conformational rearrangements in the transport cycle. We would argue that the strict correlation of fluorescence response and ability to transport, even in quantitative terms, supports the fact that we see activity, but since the two are expected to be coupled, we have here not separated them. We had actually left out a whole discussion of this aspect, and we had left out important data from studies performed by Thevelein on the role of binding versus transport in his “transceptors”. While we have currently no reason to believe that what we detect is the “receptor function” in our proteins, the discussion on how they determined the role of binding versus transport cycle for the signaling function is very informative. We have therefore added a paragraph in the Discussion that addresses this (“The role of substrate binding and the transport cycle for signaling through transceptors”):</p><p>“AMTs have been suggested to function as both transporters and receptors for ammonium (Lima, 2010). Other transporters that may have a dual function as transporters and signaling proteins include UhpT from <italic>E. coli</italic> (Schwöppe, 2003), Pho84p and GAP1p from <italic>Saccharomyces</italic> (Thevelein, 2009) and Chl1 from Arabidopsis (Ho, 2009). The mechanism of the receptor function is unclear, specifically whether substrate binding or conformational rearrangements during the transport cycle are necessary for triggering the receptor activity. Recent work by the Thevelein group has shed some light on the relative role of binding versus transport in this process. Some transporter-like receptors, such as the glucose transporter-like SNF3p and RGT1p from <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic>, appear to be unable to transport, suggesting that binding is sufficient for triggering a conformational rearrangement that is detected by intracellular signaling proteins (Thevelein, 2009). The yeast Pho84 phosphate transceptor functions both transport as phosphate transporter and mediates activation of the protein kinase A pathway. The use of phosphate analogs which do not appear to be transported retain signaling activity, consistent with the hypothesis that for signaling to occur, a complete transport cycle is not required. However, further analyses suggested that ligand binding is insufficient for signaling, therefore the authors concluded the receptor activity is triggered by specific conformational rearrangements that occur during a specific phase of the transport cycle (Popova, 2010). Mutations in the presumed proton-binding site severely reduced transport but not signaling, demonstrating that transport and signaling activities are separable (Samyn, 2012). Combined analysis of the action of amino acid analogs and mutagenesis of the putative binding site of the amino acid transceptor GAP1 on transport and signaling have indicated that, similar as in PHO84, signaling requires a ligand-induced conformational change that corresponds to a step in the transport cycle but may not the full cycle (Van Zeebroeck, 2009).”</p><p>It is therefore conceivable that the fluorescent change observed in the fluorescent ammonium sensors presented here is due to either (i) ammonium binding; (ii) a specific set of steps in the transport cycle; or, (iii) the full transport cycle of the transporter.</p><p><italic>The paper must clearly state and explain that the sensors report transport activity</italic> or <italic>ammonium binding (or both)</italic>.</p><p>We agree with the reviewers that we cannot differentiate between the two (three) possibilities.

No one, so far, has been able to separate transport and receptor functions. Moreover, AMT1;2 has, at least for now, not been shown to be a “transceptor”. But we fully agree with the Reviewers that we have no data, beyond our tight correlation between fluorescence output and transport activity (even quantitative in some cases), that clearly show whether the effect is caused by binding or a specific conversion during a predicted transport cycle or requires the full transport cycle. And we only see two states; whether there are additional states remains to be shown. We therefore followed the reviewers’ advice and cautioned statements throughout, and added a full paragraph to the Discussion that discusses this question, specifically in the context of “transceptors”, for which Thevelein has over the past years provided very interesting data regarding the binding versus transport cycle question. We apologize for having omitted this important discussion, and we are grateful for the opportunity to address this in the revised manuscript.</p><p><italic>The authors write</italic>:</p><p><italic>“Together these data strongly support the hypothesis that AmTrac measures ammonium concentrations and/or reports conformational state changes of the transporter.</italic>”</p><p><italic>This is the one place where the authors seem to entertain the possibility of binding (ammonium concentrations on the outside), but the rest of the text assumes transport as the explanation.

In the case of Gcamp5, apparently dimerization plays a role. So we tried to stay away from speculation. We would also like to mention that the cpGFP is inserted on the cytosolic side of the membrane; thus it will not be affected by extracellular ammonium. Therefore, as the reviewers suggest, even if protonation is the direct cause of response, it still may need a conformational change (triggered by either binding or transport).</p><p><italic>These concerns are not seen as a deficiency of the reporters, which may be quite valuable in studies of ammonium handling in these plants.

To reiterate, the term “transceptor” was first used by Johan Thevelein in the context of the yeast Gap1P general amino acid permease, and then extended to the Pho84 phosphate transporter of yeast, as well as the plant nitrate transporter Chl1 (and now is widely used in both fields). A classical protein acting as transporter and receptor is the UDP-glucose sensor UhpC. The term simply contracts transporter and receptor into one word, reflecting the dual function of these proteins. The simplest hypothesis is that conformational changes during the transport cycle are monitored by intracellular proteins and these changes are used as information for triggering signaling cascades. Whether this is binding in the outward open state, a set of steps in the transport cycle, or the full cycle is currently being investigated. Data for Gap1p and Pho84 support the notion that the full transport cycle is not required, but that binding is insufficient. Whether AmTrac and MepTrac provide a fluorescence change upon ammonium addition because it might also function as a transceptor is unclear.</p><p>It will be interesting to test whether inactivation of by a regulatory protein (e.g., a kinase that phosphorylates T460) will block the fluorescent response. This is likely, given that a phosphomimic mutation leads to a loss of the fluorescent response. If this is the case, one could argue that AmTrac is an activity sensor.</p><p>So far, we have not been able to decouple the fluorescent response from transport activity, but it will be interesting to search for mutations that retain the fluorescent response but are transport-inactive.</p></body></sub-article></article>
