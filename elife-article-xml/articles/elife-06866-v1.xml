We elucidate a p110α-independent role of homodimerized p85α in the positive regulation of PTEN stability and activity. p110α-free p85α homodimerizes via two intermolecular interactions (SH3:proline-rich region and BH:BH) to selectively bind unphosphorylated activated PTEN. As a consequence, homodimeric but not monomeric p85α suppresses the PI3K pathway by protecting PTEN from E3 ligase WWP2-mediated proteasomal degradation. Further, the p85α homodimer enhances the lipid phosphatase activity and membrane association of PTEN. Strikingly, we identified cancer patient-derived oncogenic p85α mutations that target the homodimerization or PTEN interaction surface. Collectively, our data suggest the equilibrium of p85α monomer–dimers regulates the PI3K pathway and disrupting this equilibrium could lead to disease development.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.06866.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.06866.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.06866.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Many cancers arise due to genetic mutations that allow cells to proliferate uncontrollably. Cell proliferation and many other cell processes can be regulated through a signaling pathway that involves an enzyme called PI3K. This ‘heterodimeric’ enzyme is made up of two protein subunits, one of which is called p85α and inhibits the other subunit of the enzyme (known as p110) to prevent uncontrolled cell proliferation. At the same time, p85α stabilizes p110 and allows the PI3K pathway to be briefly activated when appropriate. Many cancer cells contain mutations in the gene that encodes p85α that prevent the protein from inhibiting p110. This results in the activation of PI3K and promotes cancer formation. A protein called PTEN is a key inhibitor of the PI3K pathway. Common mutations to the <italic>PTEN</italic> gene in cancer cells stop the PTEN protein working efficiently, or prevent PTEN production.</p><p>Recent research has revealed that two molecules of p85α that are free from p110 can bind to each other to form a ‘homodimer’. Cheung et al. have now used biochemical, cell biological and computational methods to investigate the role of these p85α homodimers. This revealed that p85α homodimers stop PTEN being broken down by binding to it. As a consequence, there is enough PTEN in the cell to inhibit the PI3K pathway.</p><p>By examining the mutations present in cancer patients, Cheung et al. next identified mutations that prevent the p85α protein from forming homodimers, or that prevent the homodimers from interacting with PTEN. PTEN therefore degrades and cannot inhibit the PI3K pathway, which allows the cells to proliferate. Methods that increase p85α homodimer formation or enhance the ability of p85α homodimers to bind to PTEN may therefore provide new approaches for developing cancer treatments. More generally, it appears that maintaining the correct balance between the amount of p85α in the form of p110-bound heterodimers and p110-free homodimers in a cell may be important for preventing diseases involving the PI3K pathway.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.06866.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.06866.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author keywords</title><kwd>PI3K</kwd><kwd>mutation</kwd><kwd>PTEN</kwd><kwd>cancer</kwd><kwd>p85</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000054</institution-id><institution>National Cancer Institute (NCI)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Uterine SPORE, NCI 2P50 CA098258-06</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Mills</surname><given-names>Gordon B</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000054</institution-id><institution>National Cancer Institute (NCI)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Cancer Target Discovery and Development grant, NCI U01 CA168394</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Mills</surname><given-names>Gordon B</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000054</institution-id><institution>National Cancer Institute (NCI)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Uterine SPORE career development grant, NCI P50CA098258</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Cheung</surname><given-names>Lydia WT</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.3</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The p85α homodimer plays a role in the PI3K pathway by regulating PTEN function.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) pathway is a master regulator of many cellular processes. Activation of the class 1A PI3K is gated, in part, by the p85α regulatory subunit, which contains a Src homology 3 (SH3) domain, two proline-rich (PR) regions (PR1 and PR2) separated by a Rho-GAP/BCR-homology (BH) domain, and two Src homology 2 (SH2) domains (nSH2, cSH2) flanking an inter-SH2 (iSH2) domain. The interaction of p85α nSH2-iSH2-cSH2 fragment with the p110 catalytic subunit represses p110 activity allosterically and also stabilizes p110 against degradation, creating a pool of stable but quiescent p110 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Yu et al., 1998</xref>). Upon receptor tyrosine kinase activation, p85α undergoes phosphorylation/dephosphorylation events that alleviate p110 inhibition resulting in p110-mediated production of PI(3,4,5)P3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Cuevas et al., 2001</xref>). Strikingly, <italic>PIK3R1</italic>, the gene coding for p85α, is the twelfth most frequently mutated gene across all cancers. Indeed, somatic mutations of the p85α:p110α interface disrupt the inhibitory action of p85α on bound p110α leading to PI3K pathway activation in cancers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Miled et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Jaiswal et al., 2009</xref>). However, <italic>PIK3R1</italic> mutations outside the nSH2-iSH2-cSH2 fragment are relatively common in cancers, particularly endometrial cancer. The mechanisms underlying the transforming activity of these mutations remain to be elucidated and may provide novel biomarkers or therapeutic opportunities.</p><p>Although the best-characterized role of p85α is p110-dependent, interaction of p85α with other proteins via its SH3 and BH domains has been proposed to mediate p110-independent functions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Jimenez et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chamberlain et al., 2010</xref>). We and others have also shown that the BH domain binds to the tumor suppressor PTEN to promote PTEN protein stability and that at least one <italic>PIK3R1</italic> somatic mutation interferes with this process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Chagpar et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Cheung et al., 2011</xref>). Moreover, intermolecular interactions between the SH3 domain and the PR region of p85α contribute to p85α homodimerization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Harpur et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Cheung et al., 2011</xref>). However, the function of p85α homodimers remains to be elucidated. In this study, we demonstrate that p110α-free p85α homodimers positively regulate PTEN and that this regulatory mechanism is disrupted by mutations in a subset of endometrial cancers. Together, our findings suggest that the relative abundance of p110α-bound p85α monomer and p110α-free p85α homodimer is critical in PI3K pathway regulation.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>The p85α PR1:SH3 domain interaction contributes to stabilization of the p85α homodimer and PTEN binding, whereas PR2 contributes to PTEN binding but not to homodimer formation</title><p>Previous analyses suggested that the region encompassing SH3-PR1-BH of p85α mediates p85α homodimerization and binding to PTEN (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Harpur et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Chagpar et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Cheung et al., 2011</xref>). However, how each motif contributes to homodimerization and the orientation of the homodimer remain unknown. Using analytical ultracentrifugation (AUC) and microscale thermophoresis (MST), we demonstrated that purified recombinant full-length p85α homodimerized with a micromolar dissociation constant <italic>K</italic><sub><italic>d</italic></sub> in absence of other proteins under reducing conditions (<italic>K</italic><sub><italic>d</italic></sub> was 7 ± 0.7 μM and 3.9 ± 0.2 μM for AUC and MST, respectively) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1 fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplements 1, 2</xref>). AUC and MST also showed that the SH3-PR1-BH-PR2 fragment retained the full capacity to dimerize (<italic>K</italic><sub><italic>d</italic></sub> was 0.53 ± 0.03 μM and 0.44 ± 0.03 μM for AUC and MST, respectively). The difference in dimerization <italic>K</italic><sub><italic>d</italic></sub> between the N-terminal fragment and full-length p85α might indicate an additional entropic penalty arising upon full-length dimerization and/or weak intramolecular interactions occurring between the SH3-PR1-BH-PR2 and the nSH2-iSH2-cSH2 fragments in the monomer, which have to be displaced to allow dimerization.</p><p>The isolated SH3 domain does not form stable dimers in size-exclusion chromatography (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Harpur et al., 1999</xref>) and none of the available p85α SH3 crystal structures ([PDB 3I5S (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Batra-Safferling et al., 2010</xref>), 3I5R (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Batra-Safferling et al., 2010</xref>), 1PHT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Liang et al., 1996</xref>]) contains quaternary assemblies predicted to be stable in solution by the PISA algorithm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Krissinel and Henrick, 2007</xref>), suggesting that SH3:SH3 contacts do not have a major role in p85α homodimerization. We therefore asked if the p85α homodimer could be stabilized by SH3:PR1 interactions in trans. p85α PR1 (residues 79–99) contains a canonical class I PXXP SH3-interacting motif ([<bold>R</bold>/<bold>K</bold>]XX<bold>P</bold>XX<bold>P</bold>; <bold>R</bold><sup>93</sup>PL<bold>P</bold><sup>96</sup>VA<bold>P</bold><sup>99</sup>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Ladbury and Arold, 2011</xref>). Indeed, our isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) analyses showed that the synthetic p85α PR1 peptide PKPRPP<bold>R</bold>PL<bold>P</bold>VA<bold>P</bold> bound purified recombinant p85α SH3 with a <italic>K</italic><sub><italic>d</italic></sub> of 24 μM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3M</xref>). p85α SH3 bound p85αΔSH3 (residues 86–742, comprising PR1 to cSH2) with a similar <italic>K</italic><sub><italic>d</italic></sub> of 17 μM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3N</xref>), demonstrating that the p85α SH3 domain binds PR1 also in the context of an almost complete p85α, in agreement with previously published qualitative data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Harpur et al., 1999</xref>). The linker between SH3 and PR1 in p85α is too short for an SH3:PR1 interaction to occur in <italic>cis</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3O</xref>), indicating that the SH3:PR1 interaction would need to form in <italic>trans</italic> in the p85α homodimer.

Co-immunoprecipitation analysis showed that mutations in prolines (denoted as PR1mut) or basic residues (PR1mut') in PR1 decreased p85α homodimerization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). Consistent with our hypothesis that homodimerized p85α binds PTEN, PR1mut, and PR1mut' decreased the association of p85α with PTEN (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). Interestingly, both PR2mut (proline residues mutated) and PR2mut' (basic residues mutated) decreased binding to PTEN without affecting p85α dimerization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>), suggesting that PR2 contributes directly to PTEN binding rather than to p85α homodimerization. Accordingly, PTEN binding was further decreased by combined mutations of PR1 and PR2 (PR1+PR2mut and PR1+PR2mut'), which however did not decrease p85α homodimerization compared to PR1 mutations alone. These observations were replicated in p85α knockout mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1—figure supplement 4A</xref>) and more importantly in PTEN knockout MEFs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1—figure supplement 4B</xref>), indicating that the p85α homodimer is able to form in the absence of PTEN.</p><p>We next mutated p85α SH3 residues predicted to mediate binding to PR1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>).

Mutations of E19 and E20, which situate on the SH3 RT loop and may contribute to long-range electrostatic interactions with PR1 (e.g., K88 and R90), also decreased p85α homodimerization and PTEN binding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). The D21A/W55A and E19A/E20A mutations further decreased p85α homodimerization and hence PTEN binding when combined with PR1+PR2mut (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>).

The spatial separation of p85α homodimerization from p110α interaction sites is further supported by our observations that a truncation p85α mutant, A360*, which lacks the nSH2-iSH2-cSH2 fragment to bind p110α, displayed comparable p85α homodimerization and PTEN binding to wild-type (WT) p85α (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1—figure supplement 4C</xref>). It is noteworthy that none of the mutations in PR1 disrupted binding to PTEN without affecting p85α homodimerization, consistent with a causal link between homodimerized p85α and PTEN binding. Together, these results suggest that a canonical SH3:PR1 interaction in trans contributes to the formation of the homodimeric p85α platform for PTEN binding, whereas PR2 contributes to binding to PTEN through an alternative mechanism and potentially by direct PTEN binding.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>The p85α BH:BH domain interaction contributes to stabilization of the p85α homodimer</title><p>The p85α BH-PR2 fragment (residues 105–319) forms BH:BH domain dimers in two different crystal forms, suggesting that this dimer arrangement is not an artifact of a particular crystallization condition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Musacchio et al., 1996</xref>). The crystallographic dimer is stabilized by M176 that inserts into a hydrophobic pocket formed mainly by L164', I177', V181' (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>). The BH:BH interface in the crystal structure is highly conserved in vertebrates. As experimental support for this BH dimer, we found that a M176A mutation decreased p85α homodimerization and PTEN binding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>). In contrast, mutation of D178, which was predicted to contribute to BH:BH dimer formation only minimally in our model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>), did not diminish p85α homodimerization.</p><p>In each monomer, the BH:BH association buries only 527 Å<sup>2</sup> of the total solvent-accessible area of 9000 Å<sup>2</sup>, suggesting that the BH:BH interaction alone is insufficient for stable p85α homodimerization. Indeed, we measured a much lower affinity for p85α PR1-BH (AUC: 163 μM; MST: 23 μM) than for constructs containing the SH3-PR1-BH region (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1 fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplements 1C and 2L</xref>). Together with the decrease in p85α homodimerization that occurred with combined mutations of PR1 and M176 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>), these data support a model wherein the p85α homodimer is stabilized by both SH3:PR1 and BH:BH interactions. The length of the SH3-BH linker is sufficient for SH3:PR1 interactions in trans within the context of the crystal-derived BH:BH dimer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Appendix figure 3</xref> in <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1">Appendix 1</xref>). Collectively, our data are consistent with a molecular model for the p85α homodimer in which the SH3 domain binds PR1 in trans through a canonical class I interaction, while simultaneously the two BH domains associate through an interface centered on M176 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1H</xref>). The contribution of the BH domain in the homodimerization of p85 appears to be important, because p85β, which has a completely conserved SH3 ligand-binding site, an almost identical sequence in the PR1 motif and an 80% identity in the nSH2-iSH2-cSH2 fragment, homodimerized and interacted with PTEN to a lesser degree than p85α (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s5">Figure 1—figure supplement 5A</xref>). Indeed, the p85α and p85β BH domains share only 30% identity, and in particular the region that mediates BH dimerization in p85α is not conserved in p85β, neither in sequence nor in the published crystallographic structure (p85α: PDB 1PBW and p85β: PDB 2XS6) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s5">Figure 1—figure supplement 5B</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Disruption of p85α homodimerization is associated with decreased stability of PTEN through ubiquitination</title><p>Our previous data suggested that p85α homodimerization and PTEN binding contribute to increased PTEN stability by inhibiting ubiquitination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Cheung et al., 2011</xref>). We therefore investigated whether p85α mutants that alter formation of p85α homodimers and/or PTEN binding affect PTEN ubiquitination and stability. WT p85α markedly decreased PTEN ubiquitination compared with LacZ control and more importantly with each of the homodimer-disrupting mutants (R18A, E19A/E20A, D21A/W55A, and R66A in SH3; PR1mut, PR1mut’ in PR1; M176A in BH) and PTEN binding-disrupting mutants (PR2mut and PR2mut') (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A–C</xref>). Ubiquitinated PTEN in cells expressing the mutants was less than that in cells expressing LacZ because there was more PTEN-bound homodimer present in the mutant cells. PR1+PR2mut and PR1+PR2mut' increased ubiquitinated PTEN compared with single mutations, suggesting cooperativity between PR1 and PR2 in preventing PTEN ubiquitination. Further, the increased PTEN ubiquitination in the presence of these mutants was associated with decreased PTEN protein levels and hence activation of the PI3K pathway as indicated by increased AKT phosphorylation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D–F</xref>).

The differences in AKT phosphorylation in presence of mutant or WT p85α raised the possibility that feedback or feedforward signaling mechanisms contributed to the observed changes in PTEN interactions and stability. We therefore examined whether these regulatory mechanisms affect the interaction between PTEN and WT p85α or the PR1+PR2mut. S6K but not Rictor siRNA altered AKT phosphorylation suggesting the existence of S6K-mediated but not mTORC2-mediated feedback in the KLE cell line, although the siRNAs decreased the expression of the proteins by 80% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1B,C and 1F,G</xref>).

Interference with mTOR or AKT signaling by inhibitors also did not alter the interaction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1J,K</xref>).

Consistent with a previous study showing that p85α preferentially binds unphosphorylated PTEN (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Rabinovsky et al., 2009</xref>), we found that p85α increased levels of unphosphorylated PTEN to a greater extent than that of phosphorylated PTEN (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D–F</xref>). Intriguingly, p85α also increased PTEN phosphatase activity towards soluble PIP<sub>3</sub> substrate in a recombinant cell-free system (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G</xref>). This increase in phosphatase activity was recapitulated when PTEN was immunoprecipitated from WT p85α-transfected cell lysates indirectly using anti-p85α antibodies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2H</xref>) or directly using anti-PTEN antibodies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>).

The PIP<sub>3</sub> substrate of PTEN is located on the cell membrane with unphosphorylated PTEN exhibiting stronger membrane association than phosphorylated PTEN (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Odriozola et al., 2007</xref>). While p85α globally increased PTEN levels in the cytosol, membrane, and nucleus, p85α markedly increased unphosphorylated PTEN, but not phosphorylated PTEN, in the membrane (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2I</xref>). Moreover, binding of recombinant PTEN to large multilamellar vesicles (LMVs), which represent model membranes used to assess protein-membrane association (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Fukuda et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Davletov et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Lee et al., 1999</xref>), was increased in the presence of p85α (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2J</xref>). Of note, the recombinant PTEN was predominantly in the unphosphorylated form. Together, these data suggest that p85α homodimers likely increase PTEN activity and membrane association of PTEN, in particular unphosphorylated active PTEN.</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>p85α homodimer decreases PTEN binding to the E3 ligase WWP2</title><p>The ubiquitin-proteasome pathway consists of a cascade of reactions with the substrate specificity being largely defined by E3 ubiquitin ligases. Therefore, we attempted to identify the PTEN E3 ligase that is regulated by the p85α homodimer. Consistent with previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Wang et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Maddika et al., 2011</xref>), PTEN interacted with WWP2 and to a lesser extent with NEDD4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). The E3 ligases c-cbl and cbl-b, which bind p85α (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Fang et al., 2001</xref>), did not bind PTEN. Importantly, WT p85α decreased the binding of PTEN to WWP2 without a demonstrable effect on NEDD4 binding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). Mutations in PR1 or PR2 increased interactions between PTEN and WWP2, suggesting that homodimerized p85α decreases PTEN ubiquitination by preventing WWP2 from binding PTEN. Again, siRNA and/or inhibitor-based interference with S6K, mTORC2, and AKT signaling had no effect on the interaction of PTEN with WWP2, suggesting that the increase in PTEN:WWP2 association is directly linked to the failure of the p85α mutants to bind PTEN, and not to indirect effects on other PI3K pathway components (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>). Indeed, both p85α (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>) and WWP2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Maddika et al., 2011</xref>) bound to the PTEN phosphatase domain (residues 14–187), suggesting that p85α and WWP2 may compete for PTEN binding. A competition model is supported by the observation that WWP2 dose-dependently decreased the interaction between p85α and PTEN (Left, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>) and p85α-induced PTEN stabilization (Right, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>).

In contrast, p85α PR1+PR2mut (which does not bind PTEN efficiently) failed to reverse the effect of WWP2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref>). As an additional support of the competition model, siRNAs that target endogenous p85α or WWP2 decreased the interaction of PTEN with WWP2 or p85α, respectively, in an endometrial cancer cell line HEC1A that expresses high levels of p85α and WWP2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>).

Given p85α homodimerization is a key regulator of PTEN and PI3K pathway activation status, mutations that affect p85α homodimerization or association with PTEN would be expected to increase PI3K pathway activation and tumorigenesis.

I177 is a key residue of the BH:BH hydrophobic core. Substitution of the bulky hydrophobic isoleucine by a smaller and partly polar residue would be predicted to weaken homodimerization. Indeed, I177N decreased homodimer formation, decreased PTEN binding, increased ubiquitinated PTEN, and increased phosphorylated AKT consistent with PI3K pathway activation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A–C</xref>). I177N also promoted interleukin-3 (IL3)-independent survival of the IL3-dependent BaF3 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Jaiswal et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Cheung et al., 2011</xref>), consistent with the oncogenic potential of the mutant.

It has been suggested that p110-free p85 sequesters the adaptor protein insulin receptor substrate (IRS) through an nSH2-iSH2-cSH2 fragment-mediated interaction, thereby competing with the p85:p110 heterodimer for IRS binding and limiting the extent of insulin-induced PI3K signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Luo et al., 2005</xref>). Our results herein suggest an additional but compatible mechanistic model of how free p85α negatively regulates the PI3K pathway.</p><p>Our data support a model in which stable p85α homodimerization requires a simultaneous SH3:PR1 interaction in trans and a BH:BH interaction around residue M176. These homodimers can form in absence of other proteins. Collectively, our results illustrate opposing functions of the p85α monomer and homodimer. As a homodimer, p85α competes with WWP2 for binding to the PTEN phosphatase domain and protects PTEN against WWP2-mediated degradation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). The p85α homodimer also enhances the activity and membrane association of PTEN. Thus, homodimeric p85α indirectly downregulates PI3K signaling. Although the p85α homodimer does not bind p110α, it remains to be ascertained whether the nSH2-iSH2-cSH2 fragment of p85α homodimer can bind phosphotyrosines in activated cell surface molecules and thereby recruit PTEN to the activation nidus. As a monomer, p85α binds p110α in a 1:1 ratio (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Layton et al., 1998</xref>). This interaction is intrinsically inhibitory but it stabilizes p110α and allows activation of the p85α:p110α complex upon stimulation, promoting propagation of ligand-dependent PI3K pathway signaling. We therefore propose that the p85α monomer–dimer equilibrium is a gatekeeper for PI3K pathway activation.<fig id="fig7" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.06866.021</object-id><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><title>Schematic working model of how homodimerized p85α promotes PTEN stabilization and lipid phosphatase activity.</title><p>Our data support a p85α homodimer model that includes intermolecular interactions between SH3:PR1 in trans and BH:BH interactions between protomers. Key contact residues at the interfaces are shown as blue lollipops.

This interaction prevents PTEN from binding to the E3 ligase WWP2, thereby inhibiting PTEN ubiquitination. The homodimerized p85α preferentially binds unphosphorylated PTEN, which has an open conformation and is more active. Independent of stabilizing PTEN protein, homodimerized p85α also enhances PTEN lipid phosphatase activity and association of unphosphorylated PTEN with the membrane where the PIP<sub>3</sub> substrates localize.

Phosphorylated PTEN is in a ‘closed’ conformation in which the phosphatase domain is auto-inhibited by the C-terminal tail. In contrast, unphosphorylated PTEN is in an ‘open’ conformation with the catalytic domain exposed, leading to increased membrane association and activity. The observation that p85α homodimers selectively target the unphosphorylated and less stable form of PTEN fits into a mechanistic model wherein in the absence of excess p85α, and thus, in the absence of p85α homodimers, the unphosphorylated and active PTEN is destabilized, allowing PI3K pathway activation initiated by p110α-bound p85α monomers. Further, our data showed that p85α can bind PTEN, promote PTEN activity and membrane binding in the absence of other proteins. Therefore, the interaction between p85α and PTEN appears to be direct and does not require the presence of other proteins, although p85α and PTEN are part of a high-molecular weight complex containing multiple other proteins.</p><p>Based on our data, we speculate that the dynamic formation of p85α homodimers plays a role in the termination of signals initiated at the activation nidus by monomeric p85α-bound p110α. There are several possible scenarios in which the dynamics of p85α homodimer formation could be altered. For example, our data in this and previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Cheung et al., 2011</xref>) suggested that p110α can disrupt p85α homodimerization by decreasing the abundance of p110α-free p85α. An increase in p110α levels, such as through <italic>PIK3CA</italic> gene amplification, might therefore decrease p85α homodimerization leading to PTEN destabilization. Secondly and intriguingly, <italic>PIK3R1</italic> also encodes for two functional splice variants, p55α and p50α, which lack the domains required for homodimerization. By sequestering p110α, p55α, and p50α could increase the amount of free p85α. Moreover, naturally occurring somatic <italic>PIK3R1</italic> mutations (I177N and E160*) and likely others disrupt p85α homodimerization, including mutations at P99 in PR1, R162*, frame shifts at Q153, D168, H180, V181, and L182 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Cheung et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Cerami et al., 2012</xref>). Further, a patient-derived p85α mutant I133N that targets the PTEN interaction interface was identified using our speculative theoretical p85α:PTEN model. The <italic>PIK3R1</italic> mutations may hence be selected, at least in part, by effects on p85α homodimer formation and PTEN destabilization. Intriguingly, the proposed p85α-binding site on PTEN also overlaps with a PTEN surface that is frequently mutated in cancers (in 30% of the missense mutations of the phosphatase domain), suggesting that some of these PTEN mutants may disrupt association with p85α therefore decreasing PTEN protein stability and activity.</p><p>In addition to predicting mutations that disrupt homodimerization or PTEN interaction interfaces, the homodimerized p85α:PTEN model also offers possible mechanistic explanations for experimental observations. For example, the region outlined by I127/I133/E137 is close to in space to PR2 and both regions could thus together constitute a binding site for PTEN, possibly explaining the cooperativity between these residues in PTEN binding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1C</xref>). The model also proposes that PTEN:BH interaction renders a site of PTEN ubiquitination K13 inaccessible, suggesting a mechanism for how p85α could protect PTEN from ubiquitination (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>). Moreover, the model predicts that the phosphorylated C-terminal tail of the ‘closed’ inactive PTEN competes with the p85α PR2 for binding to the phosphatase domain of PTEN, providing a plausible explanation for why p85α selectively binds unphosphorylated PTEN.</p><p>One key insight from our efforts to establish a speculative theoretical p85α:PTEN model was that our experimental constraints (derived from our mutational analysis, and from our observation that the PTEN:p85α association is compatible with the p85α:GTPase interaction and with PTEN catalytic activity) cannot be satisfied by a structural model in which one PTEN phosphatase domain binds simultaneously to both BH domains of the p85α homodimer. Instead, our theoretical model proposes that the PTEN phosphatase domain binds to the BH domain of only one p85α protomer, opposite to the GTPase-binding site (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref> and <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1">Appendix 1</xref>). To explain the requirement of a stable p85α homodimer for PTEN binding and protection, our model suggests that (i) although the PTEN phosphatase domain only binds to one BH molecule, the flexible N-terminal 13 residues of PTEN may interact with the second BH molecule of the dimer (in our model, PTEN residue 14 is close to and its main chain orients towards the BH:BH domain interface) and/or (ii) homodimerization allosterically affects the PTEN-binding site on BH (p85α residues I127/I133/E137 are close to the BH:BH homodimerization interface). Although our molecular model is supported by experimental data and showed strong predictive power, it remains hypothetical and we cannot exclude that other structural complexes could satisfy our constraints, or that some of the constraints are wrong. For instance, our model assumes that the PTEN:p85α(:GTPase) assembly is symmetric and homogenous. Yet, there could be other possible scenarios, for example, where only one of two p85α homodimer–bound PTEN molecules is able to reach the membrane with its catalytic site, or where only one p85α molecule of the homodimer binds to a GTPase, allowing a PTEN molecule to bind to both p85α molecules of the dimer's other side. Moreover, the contribution of flexible regions in protein interactions makes the structural modeling of these interactions necessarily more uncertain. Accordingly, uncertainty in our speculative PTEN:p85α complex model arises from the lack of precise information concerning the structure and possible interactions of the flexible regions of PTEN (the first 13 residues) and p85α (the PR2 region, and the loop between residues 123 and 130). Thus, while currently representing a useful working model for guiding and informing experimental analysis, our theoretical PTEN:p85α structure requires confirmation by an experimental structure.</p><p>In conclusion, our study suggests that the PI3K pathway activation status can be influenced by the relative levels of p110, p85α, and PTEN. These findings lend new insight to how changes in p110 levels through amplification or <italic>PIK3R1</italic> mutations could lead to PI3K pathway hyperactivation and thus contribute to diseases such as cancer. By decreasing PTEN expression and activity, these non-nSH2-iSH2-cSH2 <italic>PIK3R1</italic> mutations may affect sensitivity to particular targeted therapeutics. Indeed, p110β rather than p110α has been proposed as the primary target in cells with PTEN protein loss (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Jia et al., 2008</xref>). Targeting p85α homodimerization or the p85α:PTEN interaction may represent a new avenue for cancer treatment.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Homology modeling</title><p>The complex between p85α SH3 and p85α PR1 peptide P<sup>87</sup>KPRPPRPLPVAP was constructed based on the crystal structures of p85α SH3:HSKRPLPPLPSL (3I5R) and Fyn SH3: PPRPLPVAPGSSKT (1A0N).

We found that mutations in the GTPases binding site of p85α did not affect PTEN binding and that Cdc42 and Rab5 did not compete with PTEN for binding to p85α (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1A-B</xref>). The interaction between p85α and small GTPases can be modeled based on the available crystal structure of Cdc42 bound to Cdc42GAP (1GRN). Cdc42GAP is 22% identical to p85α BH. The structure of Cdc42-bound Cdc42GAP was superimposed onto the structure of p85α BH (rmsd: 2.48 Å; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Appendix figure 1</xref>). Using the Cdc42:Cdc42GAP positioning from this superimposition, Cdc42 was transferred to p85α BH to produce a BH:Cdc42 model. The BH:Cdc42 model produced no important clashes and put the BH arginine 151 into the position of the Cdc42GAP R305, an important residue for GAP function and interaction, thus confirming the positioning of the GTPase on BH, at least to a domain-resolution precision. We then used the structure of this BH:Cdc42 model to produce a BH:Rab5 model by using bound Cdc42 as a template for bound Rab5 (25% seq. identity). As an alternative approach, we superimposed the crystal structure of GTP analogue-bound Rab5 (1R2Q) onto GAP-bound Cdc42. Both Rab5 models were highly similar (rmsd = 1.12 Å). All obtained models of BH:GTPase are sufficiently structurally compatible and plausible (shape complementarity without steric hindrance) to serve our purpose of delineating the approximate region on BH occupied by a biologically relevant GTPase.<fig id="fig8" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.06866.022</object-id><label>Appendix figure 1.</label><caption><title>Superimposition of the crystallographic complex Cdc42GAP (light green) bound to Cdc42 (dark green) (1GRN) onto p85α BH (black) and the crystal structure of Rab5 (yellow; 1R2Q).</title><p>The GTP analogue (magenta) and the important catalytic arginine residue (blue) are highlighted.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.06866.022">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.06866.022</ext-link></p></caption><graphic xlink:href="elife-06866-app1-fig1-v1.tif"/></fig></p><p>We next tested if GTPase binding is stereochemically compatible with formation of the BH dimer.

To ascertain that this type of interaction is physically compatible with the crystallographic BH dimer, we used the program BUNCH (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Konarev et al., 2006</xref>) as a fast and convenient tool, because BUNCH produces stereochemically plausible structures, and can include symmetry and contact constraints. Because BUNCH needs a SAXS curve as input to run, we simply simulated a large array of SAXS data sets in order to run BUNCH. We used ten different simulated data sets (calculated based on models with different SH3 positions with respect to the fixed BH domain dimer) to evaluate the impact of the model used to simulate the SAXS data. For each data set, we ran BUNCH 20 times (BUNCH uses Monte Carlo and simulated annealing and hence can give different models for each run, based on the same data). We found that the impact of the model used for simulating data was small compared with the variations in models obtained using different BUNCH runs. In these models, distance constraints were imposed so that the residues of the PR1 RXXPXXP motif were positioned at the right distance with respect to the residues on SH3 with which they interact in our molecular model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Additionally, we augmented the weight of the clash penalty in BUNCH. Using these constraints, BUNCH produced stereochemically plausible solutions where the SH3 domains were positioned either close to (or in contact with) the BH domain of the same molecule (example shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>) or of the other protomer; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Appendix figure 3A–C</xref>). Moreover, the SH3 domains were either positioned towards the N-terminus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Appendix figure 3A,B</xref>), or towards the C-terminus of the BH domains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Appendix figure 3C</xref>). However, the C-terminal positioning of SH3 domains was incompatible with the interaction of GTPases with the BH domain, because the SH3-BH linker region necessarily crossed the GTPase-binding site on BH, and/or the SH3 domains clashed with the GTPase domains. Given that GTPases and PTEN can bind simultaneously, and given that PTEN binding requires the SH3:PR1 interaction, the C-terminal positioning of SH3 domains was not supported by our data. We therefore concluded that the SH3:PR1 interaction is possible within the BH:BH domain dimer framework and that the SH3 domain needs to be located at the N-terminal side of the BH:BH domain dimer.<fig id="fig10" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.06866.024</object-id><label>Appendix figure 3.</label><caption><title>(Left) distance constraints used in BUNCH.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>-<bold>C</bold>) Examples of dimeric SH3-PR1-BH models obtained by BUNCH.

Moreover, we showed that this interaction strongly depends on both PR2 and dimeric p85α. This can be explained in two ways: (1) The PTEN:p85α interaction is not a simple peptide:domain interaction between the PR2 peptide and the PTEN phosphatase domain, but also involves direct domain:domain interactions between dimeric p85α SH3-PR1-BH and PTEN. (2) The PTEN:p85α interaction is only a peptide:domain interaction between PR2 and PTEN, and the requirement for dimeric p85α is explained solely by a (flexible) cross-linking of two PTEN molecules. The combined SH3-BH-PR2:PTEN interaction from option 1 appears to be more suitable to explain all phenotypes we observe for the p85α association (protection from WWP2-mediated ubiquitination by outcompeting WWP2, enhanced membrane anchoring, increased phosphatase activity against soluble substrates). However, at this stage, we cannot categorically rule out option 2. We therefore first investigate the more likely option 1 and then evaluate option 2.</p><sec id="s7-2-1"><title>(i) Orientation of PTEN with respect to p85α</title><p>In option 1, PTEN association with p85α has to be structurally compatible with the membrane association of PTEN. The surface of PTEN that binds to membranes and the catalytic site that requires binding phospholipid head groups are known (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11">Appendix figure 4A</xref>). Based on this information, we oriented PTEN with respect to the membrane. We then used this PTEN:membrane interaction constraint to place p85α with respect to PTEN. In option 1, the requirement for a p85α dimer is justified by dimeric SH3-PR1-BH-PR2, providing a combined binding surface for PTEN. Given the symmetry of the BH domains and the distance between the PR2 regions, we expect that one PTEN binds to one p85α molecule of the homodimer and that two PTEN molecules bound to the p85α homodimer associate simultaneously with the membrane. Hence, the twofold symmetry axis of the BH dimer has to be perpendicular to the membrane plane. In a model where the p85α dimer is oriented with the SH3 domains towards the membrane, the SH3 domains, even if in close contact with the BH domains, would collide with the membrane and thus block simultaneous interaction of two bound PTEN molecules with the membrane (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11">Appendix figure 4B</xref>). As a consequence, the p85α dimer is most likely oriented with the SH3 domains pointing away from the membrane. Such an orientation would also allow simultaneous binding of GTPases and PTEN to both the p85α dimer and the membrane.<fig id="fig11" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.06866.025</object-id><label>Appendix figure 4.</label><caption><title>(<bold>A</bold>) approximate positioning of PTEN with respect to the membrane (green).</title><p>C2 residues required for membrane binding are highlighted.

We hypothesize that dimerization is required for either allosterically rearranging the PTEN binding site on the BH domain, or to allow stabilizing interactions between the second BH domain and the flexible 13 N-terminal residues of a PTEN molecule which binds with its phosphatase domain to the first BH domain. The PTEN:p85α interaction also involves PTEN R14, next to K13, a major PTEN ubiquitination site. To test this PTEN:p85α docking model, but also to test interaction option 1 (PTEN binds SH3-PR1-BH in addition to PR2) against option 2 (PTEN only binds PR2 region of p85α), we introduced the triple mutations I127A/I133A/E137A in the BH domain. The observations that this mutation on BH specifically affected PTEN binding, but not p85α dimerization, and that this mutation is synergistic with PR2 mutations support our molecular model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1D</xref>). More generally, the effect of these mutations supports interaction option 1. The observation that residues within this triple mutant affect PTEN binding eliminates the possibility that one PTEN phosphatase domain binds simultaneously to two BH domains within the dimer, because the dimensions of one PTEN phosphatase domain and the space constraints from the bound GTPase do not allow simultaneous contacts of one PTEN phosphatase domain with PR2, the three mutated residues and the two BH protomers.</p></sec><sec id="s7-2-4"><title>(iv) The suggested p85α-binding site of PTEN is highly mutated in cancer patients</title><p>Having observed that cancer patient-derived p85α mutations affect p85α dimerization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>), we asked whether patient-derived <italic>PTEN</italic> mutations would also map to the proposed p85α-binding site on PTEN.

These constraints can be summarized as (1) PTEN binds homodimeric but not monomeric p85α; (2) the dimeric BH:BH structure as observed in the crystal structure and supported by mutational analysis is maintained; (3) SH3:PR1 interactions occur in trans; (4) the PTEN:p85 complex is compatible with binding of Rab and other small GTPases to the p85α BH domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1A-B</xref>); (5) p85α SH3 positioning is compatible with simultaneous GTPase and PTEN binding; (6) p85α interacts with the phosphatase domain of PTEN; (7) the PTEN C2 domain does not contribute to binding; (8) the PTEN:p85α interaction site overlaps with PTEN residues for binding WWP2; (9) p85 homodimers bind unphosphorylated but not phosphorylated PTEN; (10) p85α-bound PTEN remains active, suggesting that the PTEN active sites can bind to membrane-bound PIP<sub>3</sub>; (11) major PTEN ubiquitination sites are protected in the PTEN:p85α interface (K13 and/or K289) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Trotman et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Guo et al., 2012</xref>); (12) p85α mutations at the p85α:PTEN interface weaken PTEN binding, but do not alter p85α homodimerization; and (13) the interface should appear biologically plausible, in terms of the surface covered and the amino acid composition. Finally, the p85α binding site on PTEN is most likely (14) a conserved region of PTEN; (15) a region predicted to be a ligand binding site, and (16) a region that is implicated in PTEN crystal packing interactions. We were able to develop a structural model that satisfies all these constraints (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>).</p><p>This ‘hybrid’ model (based on experimental and computational constraints) was corroborated by mutational analysis and correctly predicted cancer patient-derived p85α mutations that disrupt the p85α:PTEN-interacting interface (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5 fig6">Figures 5 and 6</xref>). Our attempt to construct the p85α homodimer and p85α:PTEN structural models herein may therefore allow prediction of the biochemical phenotypes of mutations that occur along the interfaces in the cancer genomes.

Feed-back or feed-forward signaling mechanisms may play a contributing role</italic>.</p><p>We agree with the reviewers that it would be interesting to examine whether the PTEN/p85 α/WWP2 interactions are subjected to changes in PI3K pathway signaling, especially through altering feedback and feedforward mechanisms. Negative feedback mediated by S6K (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Harrington et al., 2004</xref>) and positive feedback mediated by mTORC2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Humphrey et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Sarbassov et al., 2005</xref>) have been described in certain cell types and are considered to be the major feedback elements regulating the PI3K pathway. Example of feedforward signaling involves activation of mTOR, in which AKT phosphorylates mTOR directly or indirectly through inactivation of TSC1/TSC2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Hahn-Windgassen et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Sekulic et al., 2000</xref>).</p><p>To investigate whether these regulatory mechanisms could affect the interaction of PTEN with p85α or WWP2 when these molecules are altered by transfection, we suppressed S6K or mTORC2 signaling using S6K or Rictor siRNA, respectively, and rapamycin was used to inhibit mTORC1 activity in the cell line used in this study (KLE). In addition, we also targeted AKT activity using the specific AKT inhibitor MK2206. S6K siRNA increased AKT phosphorylation implicating the existence of negative feedback in KLE cells. In contrast to the suggested role in mediating a positive feedback at least in some cell lines, Rictor siRNA did not decrease phosphorylated AKT in the KLE cell line, although the siRNA decreased Rictor expression by 80%. Importantly, both S6K and Rictor siRNA had no effect on PTEN interactions with p85α or WWP2. Rapamycin and MK2206, which efficiently inhibited mTOR and AKT phosphorylation, respectively, also had no effect on these PTEN interactions with p85α or WWP. Thus, inhibition of these feedback and feedforward loops, and inhibition of different nodes of the PI3K pathway, does not affect the degree of PTEN association with p85α or WWP2, suggesting that the PTEN interactions with p85α or WWP2 are unlikely to be explained by mutant-triggered changes in PI3K downstream signaling or regulatory loops. These data and discussion are now added in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2–figure supplement 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3–figure supplement 1</xref> and in the text (in the subsections headed “Disruption of p85α homodimerization is associated with decreased stability of PTEN through ubiquitination” and “p85α homodimer decreases PTEN binding to the E3 ligase WWP2”).</p><p><italic>4) Are the biochemical interactions described for p85 in this study specific to p85α or does p85β similarly homodimerize and associate with PTEN through the indicated regions? The potential for redundancy in these mechanisms becomes important when one considers the influence of cancer-associated PIK3R1 mutations</italic>.</p><p>The extent of functional redundancy between p85α and p85β is an interesting area of investigation. Harpur et al. have reported the homodimer formation of recombinant p85β proteins using size exclusion chromatography (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Harpur et al., 1999</xref>). To further assess the reviewers' question, we used immunoprecipitation assays and observed that p85β homodimerized and interacted with PTEN but the interactions were much weaker than observed for p85α. Further, in contrast to wild type p85α, p85β did not stabilize PTEN (data are now added in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s5">Figure 1–figure supplement 5A and 5C</xref>).</p><p>The nSH2-iSH2-cSH2 fragment that binds p110 is 80% identical in sequence between p85α and p85β. In contrast, p85α and p85β share only 30% protein sequence identity between their BH domains that are critical for PTEN binding. Importantly, the BH region that mediates dimerization in p85α is not conserved in p85β, neither in sequence nor in structure (the structure of the p85β BH domain has been deposited in the PDB, accession number 2XS6, but no associated manuscript has been published to date). Accordingly, the BH domain dimer centered on M176 present in the p85α crystal is not present in the crystal lattice of p85β BH (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s5">Figure 1–figure supplement 5B</xref>). Instead, the p85β BH domain crystals contain another symmetric domain-domain interface. Therefore if the p85β BH domain contributes to stabilizing p85β homodimers, then it would do this using a different dimerization interface than p85α BH. Given that the dimeric structure of p85α BH domain is important for both PTEN binding and stabilization, these data explain our experimental observation of weak PTEN binding and lack of PTEN stabilization by p85β. Additional experiments, structure figure and discussion are now included in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s5">Figure 1–figure supplement 5</xref> and in the text (in the subsection headed “The p85α BH:BH domain interaction contributes to stabilization of the p85α homodimer”).</p><p><italic>5) The structural model was constructed through a complicated procedure described in an eight page supplement, which describes some straightforward approaches (e.g. structural homology modeling and/or superposition) and others that are more tenuous (e.g. BUNCH with synthetic SAXS data).

A triple mutation on a predicted PTEN-binding surface of the BH domain suggests that a least one of the mutated residues is located in the interface.

It is difficult to assess the overall likelihood/uniqueness of the model or whether the constraints are sufficient to exclude alternative possibilities. In the absence of direct structural data for the relevant complex, the authors should be more circumspect with respect to the presentation of the speculative model and its implications, including discussion of potential caveats and possible alternative interpretations</italic>.</p><p>Importantly, the hypothetical model presented is not used as a proof for our conclusions or indeed as a stand-alone model to explain the interactions between p85α monomers or between p85α and PTEN or WWP2, but to rather to guide and inform the experiments to be performed to elucidate the functional role of particular residues in p85α. We had emphasized this in the text and now clarify this further (e.g. in the Results, we state: “We used this structural information to build a theoretical homology model for the SH3:PR1 interaction to guide studies aimed at identifying the amino acids involved in the molecular interactions”. In the Discussion, we added the following: “while currently representing a useful working model for guiding and informing experimental analysis, our theoretical PTEN:p85α structure requires confirmation by an experimental structure”. <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1">Appendix 1</xref> also provides further clarification on this point). Indeed, the predictive power and agreement of the model with the experimental mutation analysis support the utility of the molecular modeling.</p><p>Of course, in absence of an experimental 3D structural model, our complex structure remains hypothetical, and we cannot formally exclude other structural complexes that could satisfy our constraints, or that some of the constraints are wrong. As requested, we have now included a more critical discussion of the model and described its possible shortcomings (Discussion). To be more circumspect with respect to the presentation of the speculative model, we have limited its presentation in the manuscript from three to only one figure (the original <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figures 6A-C</xref> have been reduced to the revised <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>). Additionally, to avoid risks of over-interpretation by the reader, we have now decreased the level of resolution of this figure, making it very schematic and cartoon-like in appearance.</p><p><italic>6) The</italic> K<sub>d</sub> <italic>for dimerization of the SH3-PR1-BH-PR2 fragment of p85α is 10 fold lower than for the full length protein, which is a non-trivial difference. How do the authors explain this result</italic>?</p><p>Indeed, the shorter N-terminal fragment consistently displayed a ten-fold lower dimerization <italic>K</italic><sub><italic>d</italic></sub> than the full-length protein. These differences are reproducible and significant. In AUC, these differences are also robust with respect to the model used for fitting, and the type of data acquisition (sedimentation equilibrium or velocity). Determination of the molecular basis of this observation would require complete experimental determination of structures of dimeric and monomeric p85 α (full-length and fragments thereof). Such structural analysis is non-trivial because of the size and flexibility of this multi-domain protein, and hence is beyond the scope of our manuscript.</p><p>Nonetheless, we speculate that the mildly inhibitory nature of the C-terminal nSH2-iSH2-cSH2 fragment arises from additional entropic penalty upon full-length dimerization, and/or from weak intramolecular interactions occurring between the SH3-BH fragment and the nSH2 -iSH2-cSH2 fragment in the monomer, which have to be displaced upon dimerization. This possibility has now been included in the Results section (“The difference in dimerization <italic>K</italic><sub><italic>d</italic></sub> between the N-terminal fragment and full-length p85α might indicate an additional entropic penalty arising upon full-length dimerization…”).</p></body></sub-article></article>
