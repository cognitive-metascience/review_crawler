During mammalian development, two global demethylation events are followed by waves of de novo DNA methylation. In vivo mechanisms of DNA methylation establishment are largely uncharacterized. Here, we use <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> as a system lacking DNA methylation to define the chromatin features influencing the activity of the murine DNMT3B. Our data demonstrate that DNMT3B and H3K4 methylation are mutually exclusive and that DNMT3B is co-localized with H3K36 methylated regions. In support of this observation, DNA methylation analysis in yeast strains without Set1 and Set2 shows an increase of relative 5<sup>me</sup>C levels at the transcription start site and a decrease in the gene-body, respectively. We extend our observation to the murine male germline, where H3K4me3 is strongly anti-correlated while H3K36me3 correlates with accelerated DNA methylation. These results show the importance of H3K36 methylation for gene-body DNA methylation in vivo.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.06205.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.06205.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.06205.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>In animals and other multicellular organisms, there are many different types of cells that each perform particular roles in the body. This is possible because the genetic information—which is the same in all cells—is controlled so that only a subset of all the genes within an individual cell are ‘switched on’ at a particular time.</p><p>Genetic information is contained within molecules of DNA, which are wrapped around proteins called histones. The genes in regions of DNA where these histones are packed tightly together tend to be switched off, while genes in regions of DNA that are loosely packed tend to be switched on. The level of packaging is controlled by the addition of ‘methyl’ tags to the histone proteins.</p><p>These tags can also be added directly to the DNA in a process called DNA methylation. Enzymes called methyltransferases add the tags to the DNA, which tends to switch off the gene. The locations of the methyl tags can be copied when the DNA replicates before the cell divides so that the pattern of DNA methylation can be passed on to its daughter cells. However, it is not clear how the methyltransferases are able to target particular regions for methylation.</p><p>To address this question, Morselli et al. introduced a methyltransferase called DNMT3b into yeast, a single-celled organism that does not normally add methyl tags to its DNA. The experiments show that the activity of the enzyme is affected by the presence of methyl tags on certain histone proteins. For example, a methyl tag at one particular site on a histone, called H3K4, prevents the DNMT3b enzyme from adding methyl tags to DNA. However, a methyl tag at another site called H3K36 promotes DNA methylation.</p><p>Morselli et al. found that these two histone sites had similar effects on DNA methylation in mouse sperm cells. Morselli et al.'s findings may be useful in the future development of treatments for cancer and other diseases that are caused by defects in DNA methylation.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.06205.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.06205.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author keywords</title><kwd>DNMT3</kwd><kwd>histone</kwd><kwd>H3K36me3</kwd><kwd>H3K4me3</kwd><kwd>DNA methylation</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd><kwd><italic>S. cerevisiae</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health (NIH)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01 GM095656-01A1</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Pellegrini</surname><given-names>Matteo</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health (NIH)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>GM60398</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Jacobsen</surname><given-names>Steven E</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000071</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (NICHD)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01HD058047</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Clark</surname><given-names>Amander T</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000011</institution-id><institution>Howard Hughes Medical Institute (HHMI)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Jacobsen</surname><given-names>Steven E</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100001033</institution-id><institution>Jane Coffin Childs Memorial Fund for Medical Research</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Pastor</surname><given-names>William A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Whitcome Fellowship</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Morselli</surname><given-names>Marco</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.3</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>DNA methylation deposition is dependent on the presence of H3K4me3 and H3K36me3 histone marks.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>In multicellular organisms, every cell type possesses the same genetic information, but manifests a different phenotype. Chromatin plays a fundamental role in both the establishment and maintenance of each cell's state. Many players contribute to chromatin states, including nucleosome organization, histone post-translational modifications, and non-coding RNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Chen and Dent, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Maze et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Quinodoz and Guttman, 2014</xref>). Another mechanism for maintaining the state of a cell through cell division is the methylation of cytosines at position 5 (5<sup>me</sup>C), a widespread heritable DNA modification found in prokaryotes, plants, several fungi, and animals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Iyer et al., 2011</xref>). In mammals, DNA methylation plays a fundamental role in processes such as imprinting, X-chromosome inactivation, transposon inactivation, and gene expression regulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Smith and Meissner, 2013</xref>). Dysregulation of DNA methylation is a common feature in cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Eden et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">You and Jones, 2012</xref>) and a variety of human diseases are caused by defective imprinting (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Peters, 2014</xref>).</p><p>Methylation is mainly found at symmetric CpG dinucleotides, where it is introduced by the de novo DNA methyltransferases (DNMT3a and DNMT3b) and can be copied faithfully during DNA replication by the activity of a ‘maintenance’ DNA methyltransferase, DNMT1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Law and Jacobsen, 2010</xref>). However, DNA methylation is not static throughout mammalian development. In fact, 5<sup>me</sup>C can either be lost by a passive mechanism, such as the failure to maintain DNA methylation through cell division or by an active mechanism such as the removal of methylcytosine, typically via an oxidized intermediate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Pastor et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>Demethylation and de novo methylation can occur in a locus-specific manner, typically in concert with the activation or silencing of promoters or enhancers. However, global demethylation and de novo methylation events can also occur during development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Pastor et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Seisenberger et al., 2013</xref>). For example, most DNA methylation is progressively lost between fertilization and the formation of the blastula and global de novo DNA methylation then occurs coincidently with implantation of the embryo. This de novo methylation event largely shapes the methylation pattern of the animal, with additional changes occurring in somatic tissues, which contribute to cellular identity. In the germline however, a second reprogramming event occurs. After specification of the germ cells, most DNA methylation is lost during early primordial germ cell (PGCs) development. Unlike in early embryogenesis, imprints are erased during this period. Genome-wide de novo methylation then occurs before birth in the male germline and upon oocyte maturation in females (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Smallwood et al., 2011</xref>). This de novo methylation event establishes the imprints that are inherited in the next generation.</p><p>Considering the importance of local and global de novo methylation events in imprinting, gene regulation and cellular identity, it is important to understand how the de novo DNA methyltransferases are targeted to the correct genomic regions. DNMT3 proteins do not have strong sequence preferences beyond CpG dinucleotides (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Dodge et al., 2002</xref>). We therefore sought to determine which factors are critical for the targeting of de novo DNA methyltransferases.</p><p>Active de novo DNA methyltransferases possess three different domains: the catalytic domain, found at the C-terminus of the protein, an ADD domain and a PWWP domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Law and Jacobsen, 2010</xref>). In contrast, the inactive DNMT3L possesses only a functional ADD domain. The ADD domains of all three DNMTs have been shown to preferentially bind histone 3 tails that lack methylation at lysine 4 (H3K4me0) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Ooi et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Zhang et al., 2010</xref>), and this binding has been recently shown to relieve DNMT3a auto-inhibition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Guo et al., 2015</xref>). This is consistent with the observation that genomic regions bearing H3K4 methylation are generally depleted of 5<sup>me</sup>C (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Singh et al., 2013</xref>). The PWWP domain of several proteins has been shown to bind H3K36 methylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Vermeulen et al., 2010</xref>), and indeed the DNMT3a-PWWP domain has also been shown to interact with the tri-methylated lysine 36 of histone H3 (H3K36me3) in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Dhayalan et al., 2010</xref>). The importance of these histone-binding domains in targeting DNA methyltransferase activity in vivo is still unclear. It is also possible that the PWWP domain's primary function is to bind DNA and not nucleosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Dhayalan et al., 2010</xref>). Recently, it has been reported that the PWWP domain is important in specifying the localization of DNMT3b in mouse embryonic stem cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Baubec et al., 2015</xref>).<fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.06205.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Distribution of induced DNA methylation in <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic>.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Murine DNMT3 proteins with known domains: PWWP, ADD (ATRX–DNMT3–DNMT3L), and C-5 methyltransferase domain (not functional in DNMT3L).

To address this question, we introduced DNMT3b into an organism that has no endogenous DNA methylation machinery, the budding yeast <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic>, to study the chromatin components affecting the activity of a mammalian de novo DNA methyltransferase. This system has several advantages over the study of DNA methylation in mammalian cells. Yeast has conserved histone sequences and many residues are modified at the same sites as those found in higher eukaryotes. However, unlike mammalian cells, yeast cells can be easily manipulated and the small size of their genome reduces costs associated with next-generation sequencing-based approaches. Moreover, yeast has already been used to show the importance of the N-terminus of histone H3 in targeting the DNA methylation complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Hu et al., 2009</xref>).</p><p>Our data show that the chromatin template guides the activity of DNMT3b. DNMT3b preferentially deposits methylation in linker DNA compared to nucleosomal DNA. Also, DNMT3b activity correlates positively with H3K36me3 and negatively with H3K4me3. In fact, mutation of the H3K36 methyltransferase Set2 decreases DNA methylation over regions that would normally contain H3K36me3. Thus the marks themselves, as opposed to genomic features that correlate with these marks, are responsible for targeting DNA methylation. We also demonstrate that the pattern of H3K4 and H3K36 methylation in embryonic male germ cells accurately predicts which regions undergo de novo methylation, indicating that the mechanism observed in yeast is conserved in mammals.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Ectopically expressed DNMT3b methylates yeast genomic DNA</title><p><italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> does not have any endogenous cytosine DNA methyltransferases, and its DNA is therefore unmethylated. To study the activity of a de novo methyltransferase in this organism, we introduced the murine DNMT3b under the control of the inducible GAL1 promoter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). We measured the levels of 5-methylcytosine (5<sup>me</sup>C) in these strains using whole genome bisulfite sequencing (WGBS) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Supplementary file 1A</xref>). We observed significant levels of 5<sup>me</sup>C of DNA extracted from the exponentially growing and stationary phases of the same strain culture (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2-data">Supplementary file 2A</xref>), with higher methylation levels observed in stationary phase. CpG dinucleotides were preferentially methylated, as expected from the previously characterized activity of mammalian DNMT3. The methylation levels of CpG dinucleotides range from 3.3 to 7.7%, depending on the yeast strain analyzed. These levels are about 10–20 times higher than the average of other dinucleotides levels (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2-data">Supplementary file 2A</xref>), and well above the bisulfite non-conversion rate of 0.27%, as estimated from an unmethylated lambda DNA spike-in.</p><p>Despite some level of variability, we observe methylation across the entire yeast genome (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A,B</xref>). When mapping reads to the genome we only retain those that map to a single position.

Since transcriptional elongation causes H3K36me3 deposition, we asked whether the association of transcriptional read-through with DNA methylation could explain the observed phenomenon. To test this hypothesis, we analyzed published H3K4me3 ChIP-seq data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Lesch et al., 2013</xref>) and performed H3K36me3 ChIP-seq on sorted germ cells of pooled E13.5 testis (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Supplementary file 1G</xref>). H3K4me3 at E13.5 correlates with low DNA methylation at all subsequent time points (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D,E</xref>). Genes with high H3K36me3 levels at E13.5 showed significantly elevated gene-body DNA methylation at E16.5, consistent with H3K36me3 accelerating DNA methylation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B,C,D,F</xref>). This trend was still apparent at P2.5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6F</xref>). Thus, H3K36me3 appears to direct DNA methylation in mammalian cells.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Our study aimed to identify chromatin features that affect the activity of mammalian de novo DNMTs in the establishment of DNA methylation. The expression of the murine DNMT3b in a host with no detectable levels of 5<sup>me</sup>C led to the methylation of CpG dinucleotides at different levels depending on the specific chromatin context. The presence of the H3K4me3 mark inhibits the activity of DNMT3b, while H3K36me3 promotes DNA methylation. This suggests that the activity of DNMT3B is guided by the interactions of the ADD and PWWP domains with histone tails. It has been recently shown (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Baubec et al., 2015</xref>) that in embryonic stem cells the PWWP domain is responsible for the targeting of DNMT3b to regions enriched for the H3K36me3. Similarly to our finding in yeast, the reintroduction of DNMT3b into methylation deficient DNMT1/DNMT3A/DNMT3B triple KO (TKO) ES cells partially restores 5<sup>me</sup>C levels. Methylation levels are higher at H3K36me3 sites, a trend eliminated by the ablation of the H3K36me3 methyltransferase Setd2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Baubec et al., 2015</xref>). Our findings are in agreement with the Baubec et al. observations, both in a system where other factors guiding DNA methylation are absent (yeast), and during a period of biologically important de novo DNA methylation (germ cells).</p><p>In our yeast system, we detected an anti-correlation between transcript levels and DNA methylation, while we found a positive correlation in germ cells as was shown in ES cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Baubec et al., 2015</xref>). According to our findings, the levels of DNA methylation are guided by the presence of two transcription-dependent marks: H3K4 and H3K36 methylation. The discrepancy between the findings in yeast and germ cells can be explained by the difference in the length of their genes. Yeast genes are relatively small compared to genes in higher eukaryotes so, H3K4 methylation can spread within the body of the gene, thus preventing the binding of the DNMT3-ADD domain to the N-terminus of histone H3 and reducing its activity. In contrast, in mammals, H3K4me is localized to the start of the gene, and does not spread significantly within the gene body. Hence, highly transcribed genes in mammals show a strong enrichment of H3K4me3 around the TSS and H3K36me3 into the gene-body, shaping their intragenic DNA methylation distribution.</p><p>The observation that transcriptional elongation is linked to DNA methylation has been noted in many contexts in addition to male germ cells. In mature oocytes, which have intermediate global levels of CpG methylation (∼50%), similar to male E16.5 PGCs, actively transcribed gene bodies have far higher levels of DNA methylation than less transcribed genes and intergenic regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Smallwood et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Kobayashi et al., 2012</xref>). Also, in oocytes, intragenic CpG islands show far higher DNA methylation than other CpG islands (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Smallwood et al., 2011</xref>). Transcriptional read-through is a common feature of maternally imprinted loci (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Weaver and Bartolomei, 2014</xref>) and ablation of an upstream promoter prevents proper methylation of the imprinted <italic>Gnas</italic> locus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chotalia et al., 2009</xref>). In mammalian soma, inactive X-chromosome shows higher promoter methylation, consistent with its silent state, but markedly lower intragenic methylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Hellman and Chess, 2007</xref>). Transcriptional elongation is also correlated with DNA methylation in tumor cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Jin et al., 2012</xref>). It has been suggested that transcriptional read-through could ‘open’ chromatin for DNMTs, or that heterochromatin is physically inaccessible to DNMTs. We suggest however that direct recruitment of DNMTs by H3K36me3 is the most likely mechanism for the correlation between transcriptional read-through and DNA methylation.</p><p>H3K36me3 functions both to suppress intragenic transcriptional initiation through recruitment of histone deacetylases, and to promote DNA methylation. These marks likely cooperate to induce lasting silencing of transcriptional initiation at target loci (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1</xref>). Intragenic TSSs originating at transposons have the potential to generate truncated or transposon/gene hybrid transcripts that could be deleterious to cell survival. H3K36me3 and DNA methylation could cooperate to silence these transposons in the germline and other periods of de novo methylation, and to maintain silencing through development. Moreover, where multiple TSSs exist for a gene, as in many imprinted loci, H3K36me3-mediated DNA methylation may serve to ensure the dominance of one promoter in a given cell type.<fig-group><fig id="fig7" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.06205.020</object-id><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><title>Proposed model for de novo DNA methylation establishment.</title><p>Model proposed for the targeting of DNMT3 during events of de novo 5meC establishment after genome-wide erasure of DNA methylation.

All catalytically active DNMT3-family methyltransferases in animals contain PWWP domains, and accordingly, gene body DNA methylation is observed in all animals that have retained DNMT3 enzymes. Preferential methylation of gene bodies over intergenic regions is observed for invertebrates such as honey bees (<italic>Apis mellifera</italic>), sea squirts (<italic>Ciona intestinalis</italic>), sea anemones (<italic>Nematostella vectensis</italic>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Zemach and Grafi, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Feng et al., 2010</xref>). While the relationship between relative gene expression and gene-body methylation varies across these species, there is a strong correlation between gene-body H3K36me3 in <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> genes and DNA methylation of homologous gene bodies in other invertebrates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Nanty et al., 2011</xref>). DNA methylation is also associated with gene bodies in zebrafish (<italic>Danio rerio</italic>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Zemach and Grafi, 2003</xref>) and in mammalian contexts as discussed above. Finally, some chlorophyte algae have a ‘chlorophyte-type cytosine methylase’, which evolved independently of DNMT3-family methyltransferases, which is fused to two PWWP domains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Iyer et al., 2011</xref>).

Unfortunately, many key findings have just been published on January 21 in the journal <italic>Nature</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Baubec et al. 2015</xref>). However, since your manuscript was submitted before the publication of Baubec et al., the editors decided to proceed with the review process.
