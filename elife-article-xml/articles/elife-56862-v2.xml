Upon dissociation from the V<sub>1</sub> domain, the V<sub>o</sub> domain of the eukaryotic V-ATPase can adopt a physiologically relevant auto-inhibited form in which proton conductance through the V<sub>o</sub> domain is prevented, however the molecular mechanism of this inhibition is not fully understood.

Eukaryotic V-ATPases probably evolved from the prokaryotic enzymes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Gogarten et al., 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Tsutsumi et al., 1991</xref>), termed Archaeal ATPases or V/A-ATPases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Forgac, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Kühlbrandt and Davies, 2016</xref>). The V/A-ATPase from a thermophilic bacterium, <italic>Thermus thermophilus</italic> (<italic>Tth</italic> V/A-ATPase) is a rotary ATPase that has been well characterized using both structure and single molecular observation studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Yokoyama and Imamura, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Yokoyama et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Imamura et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Iwata et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Makyio et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Toei et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Nakanishi et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Schep et al., 2016</xref>). The overall structure of <italic>Tth</italic> V/A-ATPase closely resembles that of the eukaryotic V-ATPase although it lacks some of the accessary subunits of the eukaryotic enzyme (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B,C</xref>). The <italic>Tth</italic> V<sub>1</sub> moiety is composed of four subunits with a stoichiometry of A<sub>3</sub>B<sub>3</sub>D<sub>1</sub>F<sub>1</sub> and it is responsible for ATP synthesis or hydrolysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Yokoyama et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Yokoyama et al., 1990</xref>). Upon dissociation from V<sub>o</sub>, the isolated V<sub>1</sub> moiety displays only ATP hydrolysis activity accompanied by rotation of the DF shaft. The <italic>Tth</italic> V<sub>o</sub> moiety, responsible for proton translocation across the membrane, contains a central rotor complex (<italic>d</italic><sub>1</sub><italic>c</italic><sub>12</sub>) and stator apparatus made up of the <italic>a</italic> subunit and two EG peripheral stalks (<italic>a</italic><sub>1</sub>E<sub>2</sub>G<sub>2</sub>). In the <italic>holo Tth</italic> V/A-ATPase, <italic>pmf</italic> drives rotation of the <italic>d</italic><sub>1</sub><italic>c</italic><sub>12</sub> rotor complex relative to the surrounding stator, resulting in rotation of the entire central rotor complex (D<sub>1</sub>F<sub>1</sub><italic>d</italic><sub>1</sub><italic>c</italic><sub>12</sub>) and inducing sequential conformation changes in the A<sub>3</sub>B<sub>3</sub> catalytic hexamer to produce three ATP molecules from ADP and inorganic phosphates per one rotation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>).</p><p>The eukaryotic V-ATPase is regulated by a unique mechanism involving dissociation/association of V<sub>1</sub>, that is likely to be a key factor in controlling the pH of acidic vesicles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Kane and Parra, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Sharma et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Toei et al., 2010</xref>). In yeast, glucose depletion in the culture medium induces dissociation of the V<sub>1</sub> domain from V<sub>o</sub> domain, resulting in reduced proton pumping activity of the V-ATPase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>). It is likely that dissociated V<sub>o</sub> loses the ability to translocate protons as a result of auto-inhibition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Couoh-Cardel et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Qi and Forgac, 2008</xref>). In the structure of dissociated yeast V<sub>o</sub>, the hydrophilic region of the <italic>a</italic> subunit (<italic>a</italic><sub>sol</sub>) changes its conformation to prevent rotation of the rotor complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Roh et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Mazhab-Jafari et al., 2016</xref>). The yeast <italic>a</italic><sub>sol</sub> region lies in close proximity to the <italic>d</italic> subunit, the rotor region of the isolated yeast V<sub>o</sub> component. Both the <italic>a</italic><sub>sol</sub> region and <italic>d</italic> subunit represent the trademarks of the V-ATPase family lacking in F-ATPases (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A–C</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Iwata et al., 2004</xref>). Thus, the <italic>a</italic><sub>sol</sub> region and the <italic>d</italic> subunit appear to be crucial in stabilizing the auto-inhibition structure of the dissociated V<sub>o</sub> domain.</p><p>A regulatory dissociation/association mechanism has not been reported for the bacterial V/A-ATPase, however, reconstitution experiments suggest an assembly pathway for the <italic>holo</italic> complex, in which cytosolic V<sub>1</sub> associates with membrane V<sub>o</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Kishikawa and Yokoyama, 2012</xref>). Thus, proton leak through the V<sub>o</sub> domain in <italic>Tth</italic> membranes may also be blocked by an autoinhibition mechanism similar to that in the eukaryotic enzyme. Indeed, the <italic>Tth</italic> V/A-ATPase and eukaryotic V-ATPase share very similar structures with V<sub>o</sub> moieties comprising the <italic>a</italic> and <italic>d</italic> subunits in addition to the c ring.</p><p>Structural analysis of several subunits and subcomplexes of V/A-ATPases has been successfully carried out (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Iwata et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Makyio et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Toei et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Nagamatsu et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Murata et al., 2005</xref>). Recent advances of single particle cryogenic microscopy (cryoEM) have facilitated structural analysis of the entire <italic>holo</italic> complexes of prokaryotic and eukaryotic V-ATPases in several rotational states (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Nakanishi et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Zhou and Sazanov, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Vasanthakumar et al., 2019</xref>). While several structures of the isolated yeast V<sub>o</sub> have been reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Roh et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Mazhab-Jafari et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Vasanthakumar et al., 2019</xref>), a high resolution structure of the isolated <italic>Tth</italic> V<sub>o</sub> is currently unavailable, limiting understanding of the mechanism of enzyme inhibition.</p><p>Here, we report a cryoEM structure of isolated <italic>Tth</italic> V<sub>o</sub> at 3.9 Å resolution. The V<sub>o</sub> structure reveals that the <italic>a</italic><sub>sol</sub> region and <italic>d</italic> subunit adopt distinct conformation, appropriate for inhibiting rotation of <italic>d</italic><sub>1</sub><italic>c</italic><sub>12</sub> relative to the stator <italic>a</italic> subunit. This conformation is different from that seen in the V<sub>o</sub> moiety of the complete <italic>Tth</italic> V/A-ATPase. Biochemical analysis using <italic>Tth</italic> V<sub>o</sub> reconstituted into liposomes supports inhibition of proton conductance of isolated V<sub>o</sub> with a threshold membrane potential. Our results indicate that bacterial and eukaryotic V<sub>o</sub> domains use a similar mechanism for auto-inhibition of proton conductance. This mechanism prevents proton leak from <italic>Tth</italic> cells through an intermediate assembly of the V<sub>o</sub> domain of <italic>holo</italic> V/A-ATPase under physiological conditions.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>CryoEM structures of the isolated V<sub>o</sub> domain and <italic>holo Tth</italic> V/A-ATPase</title><p>We purified both the <italic>Tth</italic> V/A-ATPase and V<sub>o</sub> domain with a His<sub>3</sub>-tagged <italic>c</italic> subunit from membranes of <italic>T. thermophilus</italic> cells using Ni-NTA resin. The purified complexes were reconstituted into nanodiscs composed of the membrane scaffold protein MSP1E3D1 and POPC lipids. For the <italic>Tth</italic> V/A-ATPase, acquisition of micrographs was carried out using the Titan Krios electron microscope equipped with a Falcon II direct electron detector. Cryo-EM micrographs of the complexes reconstituted into nanodiscs resulted in higher resolution EM maps compared to those previously reported for the LMNG solubilized preparations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Nakanishi et al., 2018</xref>). The strategy of single particle analysis for the <italic>Tth</italic> V/A-ATPase is summarized in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>. We reconstructed the 3D structure of the <italic>holo</italic> complex rotational state 1 using 71,196 polished single particle images. The final structure of the state one has an overall resolution of 3.6 Å (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). After subtracting the EM density of the membrane embedded domain from the density of the whole complex, we obtained a focused density map of A<sub>3</sub>B<sub>3</sub>D<sub>1</sub>F<sub>1</sub><italic>d</italic><sub>1</sub> with two EG peripheral stalks and the soluble arm domain of the <italic>a</italic> subunit (<italic>a</italic><sub>sol</sub>) at 3.5 Å resolution (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s5">Figure 2—figure supplement 5</xref>). This map allowed us to build an atomic model of A<sub>3</sub>B<sub>3</sub>D<sub>1</sub>F<sub>1</sub> (V<sub>1</sub>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s6">Figure 2—figure supplement 6</xref>). In our map, the obvious density of ADP-Mg was observed in the closed catalytic site, but not clearly observed in the semi-closed site, in contrast to our previously reported structure of the state 1 (PDBID: 5Y5Y). The secondary ADP in the semi-closed site shows a lower occupancy due to low affinity of the semi-closed site for the nucleotide and partial flexibility of the complex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2A</xref>). In the recent cryoEM map of <italic>Tth</italic> V/A-ATPase (PDBID: 6QUM), clear densities, likely corresponding to ADP, were observed in the cavities of the crown-like structure formed by the six β barrel domains of A<sub>3</sub>B<sub>3</sub> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Zhou and Sazanov, 2019</xref>). In contrast, these densities were not clearly visible in our structure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2B</xref>). This dissimilarity can presumably be explained by differences in the purification procedures; we purified the His-tagged <italic>Tth</italic> V/A-ATPase using a nickel column, while the authors of the previous study isolated their <italic>Tth</italic> V/A-ATPase without an affinity purification step.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>EM density map of the enzyme complex.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) The <italic>holo Tth</italic> V/A-ATPase (left) and the focused refined map of A<sub>3</sub>B<sub>3</sub>DF<italic>d</italic>(EG)<sub>2</sub><italic>a</italic><sub>sol</sub> (right).

The <italic>a</italic><sub>CT</sub> region contains eight membrane-embedded helices, MH1 to MH8. MH7 and MH8 are the highly-tilted membrane-embedded helices characteristic of rotary ATPases. The cytoplasmic hydrophilic cavity is formed by the cytoplasmic side of MH4, MH5, MH7, and MH8, and the <italic>c</italic> subunit/chain Z.

Previous studies have shown that isolated yeast V<sub>o</sub> is impermeable to protons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Couoh-Cardel et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Qi and Forgac, 2008</xref>), but it was unclear whether proton conductance is also inhibited in the isolated <italic>Tth</italic> V<sub>o</sub> domain. To investigate proton conductance through the isolated <italic>Tth</italic> V<sub>o</sub>, we reconstituted this domain into liposomes energized with a <italic>Δψ</italic> generated through a potassium ion (K<sup>+</sup>)/valinomycin diffusion potential. The pH change in the liposomes was monitored with 9-Amino-6-Chloro-2-Methoxyacridine (ACMA); the emission traces at 510 nm excited at 460 nm were recorded (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). The membrane potential was modulated by varying the external K<sup>+</sup> concentration according to the Nernst equation. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>, the isolated V<sub>o</sub> domain displays no proton conductance when the membrane potential is lower than 120 mV, defining a voltage threshold. The proton conductance through the V<sub>o</sub> increases proportionally with the membrane potential when the membrane potential exceeds 130 mV (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>). The reported membrane potential in bacterial cells varies from −75 to −220 mV depending on growth environment and method of quantification (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Lo et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bot and Prodan, 2010</xref>). Although the membrane potential of <italic>T. thermophilus</italic> under physiological conditions is unknown, we reported previously that the <italic>Tth</italic> V/A-ATPase is capable of ATP synthesis when the membrane potential exceeds −110 mV (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Toei et al., 2007</xref>).

In contrast to the V<sub>o</sub> domain, several experiments have indicated that proton conductance through the bacterial F<sub>o</sub> domain is not sensitive to any specific threshold in membrane potential (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Wiedenmann et al., 2008</xref>), whereas bacterial F<sub>o</sub>F<sub>1</sub> is sensitive to a membrane potential threshold, likely dependent on the interaction between F<sub>o</sub> and F<sub>1</sub> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Feniouk et al., 2004</xref>). In addition, proton conductance through the F<sub>o</sub> domain increases linearly with increasing <italic>Δψ</italic> loaded on the F<sub>o</sub> liposome.

In fact, salt bridges between the arginine residues (<italic>a</italic>/R563, R622 in <italic>Tth</italic> V<sub>o</sub>, <italic>a</italic>/R735, 799 in yeast V<sub>o</sub>) and the glutamate residue (<italic>c</italic>/E63 in <italic>Tth</italic> V<sub>o</sub>, <italic>c</italic>/E108 in yeast V<sub>o</sub>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Roh et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Mazhab-Jafari et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Vasanthakumar et al., 2019</xref>) are identified in isolated V<sub>o</sub> from both <italic>T. thermophilus</italic> and yeast V<sub>o</sub>.

It is still controversial whether the formation of this salt bridge represents a <italic>bona fide</italic> process of proton translocation that links deprotonation and re-protonation of glutamate residues in the <italic>c</italic> subunits.

In the case of <italic>Tth</italic> V/A-ATPase, both sides of the half-channel are open (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Zhou and Sazanov, 2019</xref>). The membrane domain of the <italic>a</italic> subunit from the isolated <italic>Tth</italic> V<sub>o</sub> is largely identical to that of the <italic>holo</italic> enzyme (r. m. s. d. = 0.82 Å for A327-E637 of the <italic>a</italic> subunit), thus the half-channels are likely also open in <italic>Tth</italic> V<sub>o</sub> as observed in the <italic>holo</italic> enzyme. This indicates that <italic>Tth</italic>V<sub>o</sub> is more proton permeable than yeast V<sub>o</sub>. This difference might be a consequence of the differences between the protein acting as an ATP synthase (<italic>Tth</italic> enzyme) and ATP driven proton pump (yeast enzyme), as previously suggested (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Krah et al., 2019</xref>). Further studies, such as computational MD simulation, are required to assess the extent of contribution of each interaction to the auto-inhibition mechanism of <italic>Tth</italic> V<sub>o</sub>.</p><p>Our structure of the isolated V<sub>o</sub> domain further reveals the mechanism of mechanical inhibition of rotation of the <italic>dc</italic><sub>12</sub> rotor complex due to strong interactions between <italic>a</italic><sub>sol</sub> and the <italic>d</italic> subunit, regions unique to V-ATPases.

Therefore, focused classification with signal subtraction of the membrane domain was carried out for the V/A-ATPase map to obtain high-quality maps and this gave a near-atomic resolution (3.5 Å resolution) map of the hydrophilic domain (A<sub>3</sub>B<sub>3</sub>DFE<sub>2</sub>G<sub>2</sub>da<sub>sol</sub>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Model building</title><p>To generate an atomic model for the isolated V<sub>o</sub> domain, each subunit of the V<sub>o</sub> complex from the previous structure of the <italic>T. thermophilus</italic> V/A-ATPase (PDBID: 5Y5X) was fitted into the density map as a rigid body. Notably the a-subunit was divided into soluble and transmembrane domains and these domains fitted into the map separately. The rigid body structures were fitted against the density map manually using the COOT software (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Emsley et al., 2010</xref>). Then, the manually fitted structures were refined using the phenix.real_space_refine program contained in the Phenix suite software (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Adams et al., 2010</xref>). These processes were performed over several rounds. The geometry of the atomic model built in this study was checked using the MolProbity tool (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Chen et al., 2010</xref>).</p><table-wrap id="table1" position="float"><label>Table 1.</label><caption><title>CryoEM data collection, refinement and model statistics.</title></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th valign="top"/><th valign="top">TthV/A-ATPase</th><th valign="top">V<sub>1</sub>EG<italic>da</italic><sub>sol</sub></th><th valign="top">Isolated V<sub>o</sub></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td colspan="4" valign="top">Data collection</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Electron microscope</td><td colspan="2" valign="top">Titan Krios</td><td valign="top">CRYOARM200</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Electron detector</td><td colspan="2" valign="top">Falcon II</td><td valign="top">K2 summit</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Magnification</td><td colspan="2" valign="top">75,000</td><td valign="top">50,000</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Voltage (kV)</td><td colspan="2" valign="top">300</td><td valign="top">200</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Electron exposure (e<sup>-</sup>/Å<sup>2</sup>)</td><td colspan="2" valign="top">91</td><td valign="top">79.2</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Defocus range (μm)</td><td colspan="2" valign="top">2.4–3.0</td><td valign="top">1.0–3.0</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Pixel size (Å)</td><td colspan="2" valign="top">1.1</td><td valign="top">1.1</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Movie No.</td><td colspan="2" valign="top">3694</td><td valign="top">5988</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Frame per movie</td><td colspan="2" valign="top">34</td><td valign="top">60</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Automation software</td><td colspan="2" valign="top">EPU</td><td valign="top">JADAS</td></tr><tr><td colspan="4" valign="top">Data processing</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Total extracted particles</td><td colspan="2" valign="top">3.5 × 10<sup>5</sup></td><td valign="top">3.14 × 10<sup>6</sup></td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Total particle after 2D</td><td colspan="2" valign="top">144,758</td><td valign="top">706,617</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Resolution (Å)</td><td valign="top">3.6</td><td valign="top">3.5</td><td valign="top">3,93</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Sharpening B-factor</td><td valign="top">−81.07</td><td valign="top">−60.25</td><td valign="top">−110.87</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">EMDB ID</td><td valign="top">30013</td><td valign="top">30014</td><td valign="top">30015</td></tr><tr><td colspan="4" valign="top">Model building and refinement</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Initial models</td><td valign="top">-</td><td valign="top">5Y5Y</td><td valign="top">5Y5X, 1V9M</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Building and refinement package</td><td valign="top">-</td><td valign="top">COOT, phenix</td><td valign="top">COOT, phenix</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Total atom No.</td><td valign="top">-</td><td valign="top">26,631</td><td valign="top">13,888</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Total residue No.</td><td valign="top">-</td><td valign="top">3418</td><td valign="top">1894</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Total chain No.</td><td valign="top">-</td><td valign="top">8</td><td valign="top">16</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Ligands</td><td valign="top">-</td><td valign="top">ADP</td><td valign="top">-</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">cc_mask</td><td valign="top">-</td><td valign="top">0.85</td><td valign="top">0.82</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Ramachandran favored</td><td valign="top">-</td><td valign="top">88.89%</td><td valign="top">92.75%</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Ramachandran outliers</td><td valign="top">-</td><td valign="top">0.03%</td><td valign="top">0.00%</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Rotamer outliers</td><td valign="top">-</td><td valign="top">11.45%</td><td valign="top">0.37%</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">c-beta deviation</td><td valign="top">-</td><td valign="top">0</td><td valign="top">0</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">CaBLAM outliers</td><td valign="top">-</td><td valign="top">5.94%</td><td valign="top">2.84%</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Clashscore</td><td valign="top">-</td><td valign="top">6.38</td><td valign="top">20.01</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">RMSD bonds (Å)</td><td valign="top">-</td><td valign="top">0.006</td><td valign="top">0.006</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">RMS angle (°)</td><td valign="top">-</td><td valign="top">0.669</td><td valign="top">0.725</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">MolProbity score</td><td valign="top">-</td><td valign="top">2.73</td><td valign="top">2.26</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">PDB ID</td><td valign="top">-</td><td valign="top">6LY8</td><td valign="top">6LY9</td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap><p>Part of the 4.7 Å resolution hydrophilic domain structure of the <italic>T. thermophilus</italic> V/A-ATPase (PDBID: 5Y5Y) was fitted into the map of A<sub>3</sub>B<sub>3</sub>DFE<sub>2</sub>G<sub>2</sub>da<sub>sol</sub>.

determined Cryo-EM structures of both the intact (holo) and membrane embedded portions of the V-ATPase from <italic>Thermus thermophilus</italic> and gives new insights and testable models for the structural and mechanism of the auto-inhibition of the complex, a long-standing open question.</p><p><bold>Decision letter after peer review:</bold></p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;The mechanical inhibition of the isolated V<sub>o</sub> from V-ATPase for proton conductance&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by two peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Olga Boudker as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Geoffry A. Davis (Reviewer #1).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>We would like to draw your attention to changes in our revision policy that we have made in response to COVID-19 (https://elifesciences.org/articles/57162). Specifically, when editors judge that a submitted work as a whole belongs in <italic>eLife</italic> but that some conclusions require a modest amount of additional new data, as they do with your paper, we are asking that the manuscript be revised to either limit claims to those supported by data in hand, or to explicitly state that the relevant conclusions require additional supporting data.</p><p>Our expectation is that the authors will eventually carry out the additional experiments and report on how they affect the relevant conclusions either in a preprint on bioRxiv or medRxiv, or if appropriate, as a Research Advance in <italic>eLife</italic>, either of which would be linked to the original paper.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>The work determined Cryo-EM structures of both the intact (holo) and membrane embedded portions of the V-ATPase from <italic>Thermus thermophilus</italic> in an attempt to understand the auto-inhibition of the membrane embedded V<sub>0</sub>. Analysis of structural differences between these forms enzyme support an interesting structural and functional mechanism for the auto-inhibition of V<sub>0</sub>.</p><p>Revisions for this paper:</p><p>Both reviews found the work to be exciting, but that some changes were needed. Their general consensus was that it should be possible to address these issues without additional experimental data, by deeper analyses of the data set already presented, together with a reworking of the Discussion. Reviewer 1 points out that the yeast V<sub>1</sub>V<sub>0</sub> structure does not, apparently, show the same structural changes attributed in this work to auto-inhibition, and some discussion of this possible discrepancy, or alternative mechanism, is needed. A related point was brought up by reviewer 2, (major comments 2 and 3) asking for a clearer comparison between the mechanistic implications of the current and yeast structures, in particular addressing the possible structural changes associated with the catalytic cycle, assembly and auto-inhibition. A deeper and broader discussion that addresses these issues should make the paper have a wider impact.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic></p><p>The manuscript by Kishikawa et al. determines the structures of both the intact (holo) and membrane-embedded portions of the V-ATPase from <italic>Thermus thermophilus</italic> in an attempt to understand the auto-inhibition of the membrane-embedded V<sub>0</sub>. Using Cryo-EM to determine the two structures, the authors have identified structural differences between the holo enzyme and isolated V<sub>0</sub>, specifically in relation to the a- and d-subunit locations, leading to their proposal that this conformational shift induces the auto-inhibition of V<sub>0</sub> through the formation of a tighter V<sub>0</sub> complex and side chain interactions that become possible with removal/loss of V<sub>1</sub>. The data and discussion provide an interesting structural model for the auto-inhibition of V<sub>0</sub> and provide a framework for testing the model.</p><p>Major comments:</p><p>From the Discussion, the authors say that the isolated V<sub>0</sub> structure &quot;clearly shows the inhibitory mechanism for preventing H<sup>+</sup> conductance.&quot; While the structural differences they present do suggest that the conformational changes in the a- and d- subunits are likely the major mechanism of auto-inhibition, it is not necessarily clearly defined, and their following sentence uses the phrase &quot;most likely&quot; which is a more appropriate description of their model. While the authors present a reasonable model for the structural changes seen between the holo V-ATPase and the isolated V<sub>0</sub> that could lead to mechanical changes (Figure 6), clear evidence that these structural changes lead to auto-inhibition are not presented.</p><p>The differences between the <italic>T. thermophilus</italic> and yeast V-ATPase structures require more discussion than provided . The mechanism of auto-inhibition proposed by the authors is primarily the conformational changes between subunits a and d. However, the yeast V<sub>0</sub> structure does not show changes in subunit d (Figure 6—figure supplement 2) and the yeast V<sub>0</sub> structure showed no differences when subunit d was not present (Mazhab-Jafari et al., 2016), leading the authors of the yeast structure to state: &quot;Consequently, the movement of the N-terminal domain of subunit a, and inhibition of proton translocation, cannot be due to interaction of the N-terminal domain of subunit a with subunit d.&quot; While the yeast V<sub>1</sub>V<sub>0</sub> structure has not been solved, and the subunit composition differences between yeast and <italic>T. thermophilus</italic> may also be involved in structural changes, it is important to adequately address this incongruence between observed datasets and the model proposed in the manuscript as it is stated as a conserved model for V-ATPases.</p><p>Figure 4 nicely shows a membrane potential activation threshold for isolated V<sub>0</sub>. However, the results of this experiment are not fully addressed in the text.</p><p>The authors cite membrane potentials measured in <italic>E. coli</italic> (-75-140 mV), although higher potentials have also been proposed (ex: -220mV, Bot and Prodan, 2010). While it is unclear what potential is biologically relevant for <italic>T. thermophilus</italic> V-ATPase, the results in Figure 4 should be addressed in relation to what they mean for auto-inhibition of V<sub>0</sub>, as their preparations appear to be capable of proton pumping at greater than ~ 120 mV driving potential. Previous work with other (F-type) ATPases have also shown voltage gating, likely dependent upon F1 and F0 interactions (Feniouk et al., 2004). The voltage threshold measured for isolated V<sub>0</sub> is similar to the threshold required to synthesize ATP in the holo enzyme (~110 mV) measured by the same group (Toei et al., 2007). It is therefore unclear from the results of Figure 4 why the experiment was performed and what the results mean relating to the auto-inhibition of V<sub>0</sub>.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>Kishikawa et al. report in the manuscript entitled &quot;The mechanical inhibition of the isolated V<sub>o</sub> from V-ATPase for proton conductance&quot; the molecular basis of closure of the V/A-type ATPase from Thermus thermophilus. The authors solve the V<sub>1</sub>V<sub>o</sub> complex (&quot;holo V/A-ATPase&quot;) and the autoinhibited V<sub>o</sub> domain (in absence of V<sub>1</sub>). They observe a different conformation of the N-terminal domain of subunit a (&quot;a<sub>sol</sub>&quot;) in either states. In addition, they carry out proton conductance experiments of the isolated V<sub>o</sub> domain, confirming that the isolated V<sub>o</sub> domain is not able to translocate protons under physiological conditions. I think that the data described in this manuscript are important and should be considered for publication in <italic>eLife</italic> after substantial revisions. The authors should add additional and revise parts of their analysis (comparison of the V<sub>o</sub> domains in the holo and isolated state) and take into account previously published literature on eukaryotic V-type ATPases, compare these data with the results obtained and draw general conclusions by these comparisons.</p><p>General comments:</p><p>English should be slightly improved throughout the whole manuscript. The paper is not well referenced, as the authors omit references in many places again to link directly to the relevant literature, which makes an evaluation complicated, as again the corresponding reference must be looked up. Furthermore, the authors neglect relevant literature. For example, they write &quot;It is likely that the dissociated V<sub>o</sub> loses the ability to translocate protons as a result of auto-inhibition.&quot; but do not refer to the relevant reference (Zhang et al., JBC, 1992; https://www.jbc.org/content/267/14/9773.short). Furthermore, previously released structural (e.g. Murata et al, 2005, Murata et al., PNAS, 2011, Abbas et al., 2020, Vasanthakumar et al., 2019, Tani et al., Microscopy, 2013) and computational (e.g. Krah et al., 2019) data on the V-ATPase are neglected, as well as early observations in evolutionary related F-type ATP synthases (e.g. Pogoryelov et al.,2010 (analogous to Murata, PNAS, 2011), Symersky et al., 2012), discussing possible mechanistic modes of action of proton translocation for these enzymes. It has also been proposed earlier that the N-terminal domain of subunit a adopts an alternative confirmation during the apo and holo state binding to V<sub>1</sub> in the micro molar range (Oot and Wilkens, 2012).</p><p>Additional major comments:</p><p>1) &quot;The side chain of d/R59 1 likely forms π-π stacking with a/R103&quot;</p><p>I would expect a repulsion due to the positive charge of both residues, instead of stabilization by &quot;π-π stacking&quot;. A closer look into the chemical environment near these residues may be required and re-modelling of the side chains may be necessary.</p><p>2) &quot;Our structure of the isolated V<sub>o</sub> suggests that the rotation of c12 rotor ring relative to the stator is mechanically hindered by a defined interaction between the a<sub>sol</sub> and d subunit.&quot;</p><p>The authors suggest that the rotor is not able to rotate because it is &quot;mechanically hindered by a defined interaction between the a<sub>sol</sub> and d subunit&quot; and thus ions (protons) cannot be transducted. However, it should be taken into account that the energy transduction of the catalytic event (hydrolysis) in eukaryotic V<sub>1</sub> drives the rotation of the c-ring and the conformational change of the N-terminal domain of subunit a may be caused by assembly/disassembly of V<sub>o</sub> and V<sub>1</sub> (see e.g. Oot and Wilkens., 2012). In addition, computational data suggest that the c-ring is locked in an ion-locked conformation while the luminal channel (in yeast V-ATPase) is not accessible (Krah et al., 2019), also discussed in the reports of the cryo-EM structures (e.g. Mazhab-Jafari et al., 2016). If this also is likely for V/A-type ATPases, would be needed to be tested (e.g. calculation of the solvent accessible surface area for the periplasmic half-channel in the isolated V<sub>o</sub> state; the holo V/A-type ATPase has been proposed to be accessible to water Zhou and Sazanov, 2019).</p><p>3) The authors further conclude: &quot;Together, the observed results strongly suggest that the a<sub>sol</sub> of the a subunit and the d subunit, absent in Fo and hallmarks structure of the V type ATPases, are key for mechanical inhibition of proton conductance through V<sub>o</sub>.&quot;. Together with the above-mentioned previously published data, I think that &quot;a<sub>sol</sub>&quot; and d may have an essential function, but likely involved in assembly of V<sub>o</sub> with V<sub>1</sub>. For further conclusions about mechanistic features, the authors should also calculate the solvent accessible surface area for both half-channels of the final models (isolated V<sub>o</sub> and V<sub>1</sub>V<sub>o</sub> complex) to study if the channels are open (accessible to water) or closed (not accessible to water and other protein residues, proton transfer via water wire or side chains (reduced side chain flexibility in a dry environment) unlikely). In addition, the authors should also present other structural differences in V<sub>o</sub> (if any) for holo (V<sub>1</sub>V<sub>o</sub>) and isolated V<sub>o</sub> state, as e.g. differences at the a/c interface (in addition to the data shown in the SI). If there are differences found in comparison to previously published data on eukaryotic V-type ATPases, these discrepancies should be discussed, taking into account that V/A-type ATPases are also able to synthesize ATP (previous work in the same lab).</p><p>4) The Discussion section should be also adapted based on the above said.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were suggested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for resubmitting your work entitled &quot;Mechanical inhibition of isolated V<sub>o</sub> from V/A-ATPase for proton conductance&quot; for further consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>.

The authors also use their structural data to compare with other available structures of V ATPases to discuss the structural similarities and differences across organisms.</p><p>The authors have presented their findings in a thoughtful, structured manner with a focus on how their findings enhance the greater understanding of this protein complex. While the discussion touches upon the evolutionary differences and significance, they authors have done an admirable job to not over-interpret the data that they have collected, but rather suggest further mechanistic studies that can help support or disprove hypotheses based on their structures. The authors have also improved the manuscript in revision by minimizing repetition of findings, which improves the structure of the manuscript.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>The manuscript by Kishikawa et al. &quot;The mechanical inhibition of the isolated V<sub>o</sub> from V/A-ATPase for proton conductance&quot; has been significantly improved and most of my concerns have been addressed. The work is important and should be published in <italic>eLife</italic>. However, there are still two issues which should be discussed/corrected :</p><p>1) The authors wrote: &quot;As the reviewer pointed out, the two arginines are generally repulsive to each other. However, as shown in the added references, in a number of cases arginine is known to be involved in the enzymatic function by interacting with each other. Furthermore, our model is supported by comparison with the model reported by Sazanov et al. (PDBID: 6QUM).&quot;</p><p>The arginine – arginine interaction is still not sufficiently described. Reference 33 is claiming that in ~90 % of the structures, which show interactions of positively charged residues are stabilized by counter charges (such as carboxylate groups).</p><p>I also had a look at the structure of the holo-V/A ATPase (pdb-ID: 6QUM). In this structure two arginine residues (aR563 and aR622) are very near, but stabilized by counter charges of aE627 and cE63. However, in case of residues aR59 and dR103 this close distance cannot be observed in the Sazanov structure (pdb ID: 6QUM). The distance of the guanidinium groups of both residues is larger than 10 Å (no interaction). In addition, in the vicinity of aR59 and aR103 several carboxylate side chains can be found, which may interact with both guanidinium groups. In addition, aR59 and aR103 are at the surface of the protein (pdb-ID: 6QUM) and thus I would expect them to be solvated if not bound to carboxylate groups.</p><p>Thus, I still think that the chemical environment around these residues should be described in detail.

These results indicate that the <italic>d</italic> subunit in eukaryotic V-ATPase also shows the conformational change between isolated V<sub>o</sub> and <italic>holo</italic> enzyme.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In addition, computational data suggest that the c-ring is locked in an ion-locked conformation while the luminal channel (in yeast V-ATPase) is not accessible (Krah et al., 2019), also discussed in the reports of the cryo-EM structures (e.g. Mazhab-Jafari et al., 2016). If this also is likely for V/A-type ATPases, would be needed to be tested (e.g. calculation of the solvent accessible surface area for the periplasmic half-channel in the isolated V<sub>o</sub> state; the holo V/A-type ATPase has been proposed to be accessible to water Zhou and Sazanov, 2019).</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewer is right, it has been suggested that in the yeast V<sub>o</sub>, the luminal half channel is closed and that the channel opens transiently during the reaction. In contrast, in the prokaryotic V/A-ATPase, it has been suggested that both sides of the half channel are open. The membrane domain of the <italic>a</italic> subunit, which mainly composes the half channels, is very similar in the isolated <italic>Tth</italic> V<sub>o</sub> to that of <italic>holo</italic> enzyme (r. m. s. d = 0.82 Å). Therefore, the half channels are mostly open in the isolated <italic>Tth</italic> V<sub>o</sub>. These differences might affect the auto-inhibition of proton translocation. Based on the comparison, we modified the manuscript and stated the issues in the Discussion section as below.</p><p>“In the isolated yeast V<sub>o</sub>, the luminal half-channel for releasing translocated protons to the lumen of acidic vesicles is closed and it is assumed to open transiently during catalysis. In the case of <italic>Tth</italic> V/A-ATPase, both sides of the half-channel are not enclosed. The membrane domain of the <italic>a</italic> subunit from the isolated <italic>Tth</italic> V<sub>o</sub> is mostly identical to that of the <italic>holo</italic> enzyme (r. m. s. d. = 0.82 Å for A327-E637 of <italic>a</italic> subunit), thus the half-channels are likely open in <italic>Tth</italic> V<sub>o</sub> as observed in <italic>holo</italic> enzyme. This indicates that <italic>Tth</italic>V<sub>o</sub> is more proton permeable than yeast V<sub>o</sub>. This difference might be derived from the difference between ATP synthesis and ATP driven proton pump, as suggested. Further studies, such as computational MD simulation, are required to assess the extent of contribution of each interaction to the auto-inhibition mechanism of <italic>Tth</italic> V<sub>o</sub>.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) The authors further conclude: &quot;Together, the observed results strongly suggest that the a<sub>sol</sub> of the a subunit and the d subunit, absent in Fo and hallmarks structure of the V type ATPases, are key for mechanical inhibition of proton conductance through V<sub>o</sub>.&quot;. Together with the above-mentioned previously published data, I think that &quot;a<sub>sol</sub>&quot; and d may have an essential function, but likely involved in assembly of V<sub>o</sub> with V<sub>1</sub>.</p></disp-quote><p>As suggested by the reviewer, this sentence (&quot;Together, the observed results……… through V<sub>o</sub>.&quot;). has been excluded in the revision. In addition, we stated contribution of the salt bridges between the stator <italic>a</italic> subunit and <italic>c</italic>-ring into the inhibition of proton conductance. Please refer to our response to the General comments. As mentioned in the last paragraph of our Discussion section, we recognize the importance of <italic>a</italic><sub>sol</sub> and <italic>d</italic> subunit for assembly with V<sub>1</sub>. however, here we focus on the conformational changes of both <italic>a</italic><sub>sol</sub> and <italic>d</italic> subunit induced by binding of V<sub>1</sub> to V<sub>o</sub> rather than on their role in the complex assembly.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>For further conclusions about mechanistic features, the authors should also calculate the solvent accessible surface area for both half-channels of the final models (isolated V<sub>o</sub> and V<sub>1</sub>V<sub>o</sub> complex) to study if the channels are open (accessible to water) or closed (not accessible to water and other protein residues, proton transfer via water wire or side chains (reduced side chain flexibility in a dry environment) unlikely). In addition, the authors should also present other structural differences in V<sub>o</sub> (if any) for holo (V<sub>1</sub>V<sub>o</sub>) and isolated Vo state, as e.g. differences at the a/c interface (in addition to the data shown in the SI). If there are differences found in comparison to previously published data on eukaryotic V-type ATPases, these discrepancies should be discussed, taking into account that V/A-type ATPases are also able to synthesize ATP (previous work in the same lab).</p></disp-quote><p>As it is indicated by the reviewer, the luminal half-channel is enclosed in the isolated yeast V<sub>o</sub> (Mazhab-Jafari et al., 2016, Krah et al., 2019). In contrast, both sides of the half-channel are open in <italic>holoTth</italic> V/A-ATPase (Zhou and Sazanov, 2019). As mentioned in the Results section (sub section “Structure comparison of the isolated V<sub>o</sub> with the <italic>holo</italic> complex”), there are no obvious dissimilarities except for the minor differences mentioned in the manuscript. Considering the high similarity between the isolated <italic>Tth</italic> V<sub>o</sub> and V<sub>o</sub> in <italic>holo</italic> enzyme, we have concluded that the half-channels are also open in the isolated <italic>Tth</italic> V<sub>o</sub>, and stated this in the Discussion section of the manuscript. Please refer to our answer to the 2) comments.</p><p>In addition, we have discussed common features and differences between the prokaryotic and eukaryotic isolated V<sub>o</sub> in the Discussion section. The reviewer 2 suggested structural comparisons of the isolated V<sub>o</sub> and <italic>holo</italic> enzymes to discuss the factors that create different functional requirements for ATP synthesis or hydrolysis. However, in our manuscript, the obtained map of V<sub>o</sub> domain in the <italic>holo</italic> enzyme was not sufficient to build an atomic model. Also, the high resolution structure of yeast V-ATPase and mammalian isolated V<sub>o</sub> are lacking. Therefore, we would like to withhold the discussion of comparison with the eukaryotic <italic>holo</italic> enzymes.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) The Discussion section should be also adapted based on the above said.</p></disp-quote><p>We rewrote the Discussion section as mentioned above.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were suggested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2:</p><p>The manuscript by Kishikawa et al. &quot;The mechanical inhibition of the isolated V<sub>o</sub> from V/A-ATPase for proton conductance&quot; has been significantly improved and most of my concerns have been addressed. The work is important and should be published in eLife. However, there are still two issues which should be discussed/corrected :</p><p>1) The authors wrote: &quot;As the reviewer pointed out, the two arginines are generally repulsive to each other. However, as shown in the added references, in a number of cases arginine is known to be involved in the enzymatic function by interacting with each other. Furthermore, our model is supported by comparison with the model reported by Sazanov et al. (PDBID: 6QUM).&quot;</p><p>The arginine – arginine interaction is still not sufficiently described. Reference 33 is claiming that in ~90 % of the structures, which show interactions of positively charged residues are stabilized by counter charges (such as carboxylate groups).</p><p>I also had a look at the structure of the holo-V/A ATPase (pdb-ID: 6QUM). In this structure two arginine residues (aR563 and aR622) are very near, but stabilized by counter charges of aE627 and cE63. However, in case of residues aR59 and dR103 this close distance cannot be observed in the Sazanov structure (pdb ID: 6QUM). The distance of the guanidinium groups of both residues is larger than 10 Å (no interaction). In addition, in the vicinity of aR59 and aR103 several carboxylate side chains can be found, which may interact with both guanidinium groups. In addition, aR59 and aR103 are at the surface of the protein (pdb-ID: 6QUM) and thus I would expect them to be solvated if not bound to carboxylate groups.</p><p>Thus, I still think that the chemical environment around these residues should be described in detail. Alternatively, this sentence could be removed from the manuscript.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer’s suggestion that the chemical environment around two arginines should be described. However, the limited resolution of our structure makes further discussion of the chemical environment difficult, and further experiments, such as mutagenesis, are needed to investigate the role of these residues. Therefore, we removed the sentence from our manuscript. And, we also modified Figure 3D along with the removal.</p></body></sub-article></article>
