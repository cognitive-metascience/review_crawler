Each hair cell contains at the apical surface a bundle of stereocilia that are organized in rows of decreasing height (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Petit and Richardson, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Schwander et al., 2010</xref>). Stereocilia are cylindrical in shape but form at their base a taper (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>) that is critical for their function because stereocilia pivot at their base during mechanical stimulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Fettiplace and Kim, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Müller and Barr-Gillespie, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Zhao and Müller, 2015</xref>). Confocal imaging of isolated bullfrog hair cells has shown that the membrane of stereocilia is spatially segregated into at least three domains including a specialized basal taper domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Zhao et al., 2012</xref>). Genetic studies combined with immunolocalization experiments have identified several proteins that are concentrated at or near the taper. Cell surface receptors such as PTPRQ, USH2A and VLGR1 form extracellular filaments near the taper and recruit several cytoplasmic proteins that might link the receptors to the cytoskeleton (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Adato et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">McGee et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Michalski et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Salles et al., 2014</xref>). Myosin motor proteins such as Myo6 and Myo7A are also localized near the taper (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Hasson et al., 1997</xref>) and may be important for protein transport or for adjusting tension between the cell membrane and the cytoskeleton. Proteins with potential roles in regulating F-actin dynamics and/or anchorage to the cell membrane such as radixin and taperin are concentrated at the taper region as well (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Pataky et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Rehman et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Salles et al., 2014</xref>). In addition, TRIOBP forms rootlets that extend from stereocilia into the cuticular plate and traverse the taper region (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Kitajiri et al. 2010</xref>). Importantly, mutations in the genes that encode proteins localized near the taper cause inherited forms of deafness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Ahmed et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Khan et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Liu et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Rehman et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Schraders et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Weil et al., 1997</xref>), thus reinforcing the concept that the taper is a specialized and functionally important subdomain within stereocilia. However, the overall organization of proteins at the base of stereocilia and the mechanisms that regulate their assembly and function are not known.<fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.14222.002</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Analysis of hearing function in <italic>Fam65b</italic>-deficient mice.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Diagram of cochlear hair cells showing the mechanically sensitive hair bundle.

However, the mechanisms by which Fam65b affects hair cell function are unclear. In some cell types, Fam65b appears to be localized at the cell membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Diaz-Horta et al., 2014</xref>), but a direct link of Fam65b to the cytoskeleton has also been proposed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Yoon et al., 2007</xref>). Accordingly, overexpression of Fam65b in C2C12 myoblasts and in HEK293 kidney cells leads to the formation of filopodia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Yoon et al., 2007</xref>), while studies in neutrophils and T-lymphocytes suggest that Fam65b can regulate RhoA activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Gao et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Rougerie et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>To further define the function of Fam65b in mechanosensory hair cells, we have studied its subcellular distribution in hair cells by stochastic optical reconstruction microscopy (STORM) and generated <italic>Fam65b</italic>-deficient mice. We show here that Fam65b is localized near the basal taper of hair-cell stereocilia where it forms oligomers by head-to-head and tail-to-tail interaction to form a circumferential ring that does not penetrate the stereociliary core. In contrast, taperin is localized throughout the stereociliary core. Biochemical data suggest that Fam65b does not bind to taperin or any of the proteins that are known to bind to taperin. Instead, using a yeast-two-hybrid screen, we have identified RhoC as a binding partner for Fam65b and show that RhoC regulates Fam65b oligomerization. Defects in Fam65b expression, oligomerization and binding to RhoC affect stereocilia development and function and cause deafness. Our findings thus reveal a striking spatial segregation of proteins within the basal domain of stereocilia, provide insights into the mechanisms that regulate protein assembly in this critical functional domain and reveal a role of Fam65b for normal stereocilia morphogenesis and function.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title><italic>Fam65b</italic>-deficient mice are deaf and show defects in hair cell function</title><p>In order to gain insights into the mechanisms by which mutations in <italic>Fam65b</italic> cause hearing impairment, we created a <italic>Fam65b</italic>-deficient mouse line.

In whole mounts of the cochlea at P5, we observed expression in OHCs and IHCs where Fam65b immunoreactivity outlined the shape of the stereociliary bundle (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>). Additional staining was observed in the microvilli on the apical surface of Hensen's cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>), which was consistent with the X-gal staining results (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A–C</xref>). We also observed staining in the microvilli of other support cells that did not stain with X-gal. The cells were presumably X-gal negative because expression levels were low and thus difficult to detect with X-gal staining. Clearly, the antibody staining signals were specific because they were not observed in <italic>Fam65b<sup>LacZ/LacZ </sup></italic>mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>). Higher resolution images showed that Fam65b was expressed in IHCs and OHCs at the basal end of stereocilia near the taper region (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>). To confirm this finding, we used injectoporation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Xiong et al., 2012</xref>) to express HA-tagged Fam65b in mechanosensory hair cells at P3. We fixed and stained the injectoporated hair cells two days later with phalloidin to reveal stereocilia and with an antibody to HA to detect HA-Fam65b. Consistent with the immunolocalization data using Fam65b antibodies, HA-Fam65b was concentrated near the base of stereocilia (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G</xref>).

Finally, to examine the colocalization of Fam65b and taperin, we again expressed by injectoporation HA-Fam65b in mechanosensory hair cells. Co-staining of the hair cells with an antibody to taperin and an antibody to HA confirmed that Fam65b and taperin were co-localized near the taper of stereocilia (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2K</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title><italic>Fam65b-</italic>deficiency affects hair bundle morphogenesis and stereociliary growth</title><p>The expression pattern of Fam65b suggested that it might regulate stereocilia development, function and/or maintenance. We therefore compared the development of the sensory epithelium in the cochlea of wild-type and <italic>Fam65b<sup>LacZ/LacZ</sup></italic> mice in whole mount cochlea using phalloidin staining combined with fluorescence deconvolution microscopy. Whole mount staining at P2 revealed that the sensory epithelium in mutant mice was patterned properly into three rows of OHCs and one row of IHCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). However, hair bundle morphology appeared abnormal in the mutants with aberrant bundle shape relative to controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). Analysis by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) confirmed that hair bundles in the mutants contained a single kinocilium as well as a bundle of stereocilia but the bundles were abnormally shaped (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). At P2 the bundles of most OHCs appeared similar in size to wild-type and formed a staircase pattern but some OHCs showed defects in hair bundle polarity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A,B</xref>).

As with deconvolution microscopy, both proteins could no longer be detected in the taper region in <italic>Fam65b<sup>LacZ/LacZ</sup></italic> mice (data not shown). These findings provide evidence that while both Fam65b and taperin are present near the taper of stereocilia, they show a distinct distribution pattern.

We also analyzed potential interactions with whirlin, a PDZ-domain protein that is localized near the base of stereocilia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Grati et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Michalski et al., 2007</xref>), and with PTPRQ, which is also present in this domain of stereocilia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Goodyear et al., 2003</xref>). We cloned full-length cDNAs for taperin, CLIC5, radixin and whirlin, fused them to HA and co-expressed them with Fam65b-GFP in HEK293 cells. For PTPRQ, we expressed the cytoplasmic domain fused to HA. Immunoprecipitation experiments did not reveal any interactions between Fam65b-GFP with HA-taperin, HA-CLIC5, HA-radixin, HA-whirlin, and HA-PTPRQcyto (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7G</xref>, and data not shown). To further confirm these findings, we also expressed HA-Fam65 and Myc-taperin in CL4 cells but did not observe an interaction between the two proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1</xref>). Similarly, we did not observe interaction between Fam65b and taperin in a two-hybrid assay where we used Fam65b as a bait and taperin as a prey (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1</xref>). These results are consistent with the distinct localization pattern of Fam65b and taperin, and suggest a compartmentalized distribution of protein complexes within the basal compartment of stereocilia. They also suggest that the Fam65b regulates taperin localization via an alternative mechanism than direct binding. Unfortunately, we could not extend our analysis of protein distribution to CLIC5, radixin and whirlin because available antibodies were not of sufficient quality for STORM (data not shown).</p></sec><sec id="s2-7"><title>Fam65b forms oligomeric structures</title><p>The ring-like distribution of Fam65b near the taper of stereocilia suggested that Fam65b might form oligomeric structures.

First, we generated full-length Fam65b constructs containing N-terminal HA and C-terminal GFP tags and expressed them alone or in combination in HEK293 cells.

Fam65b-GFP efficiently co-immunoprecipitated with HA-Fam65b (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8B</xref>), demonstrating that Fam65b has homophilic binding affinity. To map protein domains important for interactions, we next generated truncated Fam65b constructs fused to a Myc-tag. Sequence comparison of Fam65b across species revealed five highly conserved domains near the N-terminus, two highly conserved domains near the C-terminus and a less conserved central domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8A</xref>). We therefore generated Fam65b constructs containing the N-terminal or C-terminal conserved domains alone (Myc-N1, Myc-C2) or in conjunction with the less conserved central domain (Myc-N2, Myc-C1) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8A</xref>).

We hypothesized that overexpression of a Fam65b fragment containing one Fam65b binding site might disrupt homophilic interactions between Fam65b molecules thus acting as a dominant negative construct. To test this model, we first determined the extent to which interactions between full-length Fam65b-GFP with Myc-N1 was disrupted by co-expression of N2-GFP in heterologous HEK293 cells. Co-immunoprecipitation experiments demonstrated that N2-GFP significantly reduced interactions between Fam65b-GFP and Myc-N1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8H</xref>). Next we expressed by injectoporation full-length Fam65b-GFP or the dominant negative construct N2-GFP in hair cells at P2 and cultured the cells for 3 days. Cells expressing the heterologous constructs were identified by GFP fluorescence and hair bundles were visualized by staining with phalloidin-rhodamine. Significantly, while Fam65b-GFP did not affect the morphology of hair bundles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8I,J</xref>), bundle morphology was severely disrupted by overexpression of N2-GFP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8I,J</xref>).

We therefore set out to identify binding partners for Fam65b that might regulate its function and oligomerization using an unbiased yeast-two-hybrid screen. We purified RNA from the organ of Corti and generated yeast-two-hybrid libraries suitable for the identification of soluble and transmembrane proteins. We then carried out yeast-two-hybrid screens with full-length Fam65b. We screened more than 2 million transformants and identified 50 positive clones. Sequencing of the clones revealed that we had recovered RhoC 28 times and RhoA 1 time (data not shown).

To confirm our yeast-two-hybrid data, we generated HA-tagged versions of RhoA, RhoC and the related Rac1 and Cdc42 molcules and tested for interactions with Fam65b following their expression in HEK293 cells. Fam65b bound highly efficiently to RhoC, weakly to RhoA, and not at all to Rac1 and Cdc42 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9A</xref>).

Unfortunately, available antibodies for RhoC were not of sufficient quality for immunolocalization studies. We therefore expressed by injectoporation HA-tagged RhoC and Fam65b-GFP in mechanosensory hair cells at P2 and evaluated their localization two days later. Stereocilia were visualized by staining with Alexa Fluor 647 phalloidin. Remarkably, RhoC was localized near the base of stereocilia and its distribution largely overlapped with the distribution of Fam65b (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9B</xref>). We thus conclude that RhoC binds to Fam65b and shows a similar distribution in mechanosensory hair cells, at least at the level of resolution provided by deconvolution microscopy.

Fam65b might therefore act in hair cells upstream of RhoC to regulate its activity. Alternatively, RhoC might regulate Fam65b function. Rho-GTPases cycle between the active GTP bound state and inactive GDP bound state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Dvorsky and Ahmadian, 2004</xref>). Activated RhoC binds effector proteins such as Rhotekin. Following expression of Fam65b and RhoC in heterologous cells, we did not observe obvious inhibitory effect of Fam65b on interactions of RhoC with Rhotekin, suggesting that Fam65b does not regulate RhoC activity (data not shown). We therefore tested next whether RhoC might instead affect Fam65b function and determined the extent to which RhoC regulates Fam65b oligomerization. We expressed RhoC together with full-length Fam65b-GFP and Myc-Fam65b in HEK293 cells. Fam65b complexes were recovered by immunoprecipitation using a Myc antibody. Significantly, homophilic interactions between Fam65b molecules were strongly enhanced by RhoC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9C,D</xref>).</p><p>Next, we expressed full-length Fam65b-GFP with N-terminal (Myc-N1) and C-terminal (Myc-C1) fragments of Fam65b either alone or together with RhoC.

These data suggest that Fam65b acts downstream of RhoC, where RhoC regulates Fam65b oligomerization by promoting interactions between the N-termini of Fam65b molecules.</p></sec><sec id="s2-11"><title>RhoC binding to Fam65b is critical for Fam65b function in hair cells</title><p>To determine the extent to which binding of Fam65b to RhoC is critical for its function in hair cells, we generated a mutant Fam65b construct carrying two point mutations (Fam65b<sup>RL/AA</sup>) that are thought to be critical for Fam65b function (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9G</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Gao et al., 2015</xref>). Notably, the RL/AA mutation significantly abolished binding of Fam65b to RhoC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9G</xref>). We next analyzed the extent to which the RL/AA mutation affected the ability of RhoC to regulate Fam65b homophilic interactions. We expressed RhoC together with full-length Fam65b<sup>RL/AA</sup>-GFP and the N-terminal Fam65b fragment Myc-N1 in HEK293 cells and carried out co-immunoprecipitation experiments using a Myc antibody. As predicted, while RhoC strongly enhanced homophilic interactions between wild-type Fam65b-GFP and Myc-N1, it no longer enhanced interactions between Fam65b<sup>RL/AA</sup>-GFP and Myc-N1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9H,I</xref>). In fact, the mutation appeared to even reduce the basal homophilic binding activity of Fam65b that is observed without expression of RhoC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9H,I</xref>).</p><p>To evaluate the importance of interactions of RhoC with Fam65b for hair cell function, we compared the ability of wild-type Fam65b with Fam65b<sup>RL/AA</sup> to rescue the morphological hair bundle defect of <italic>Fam65b</italic>-deficient hair cells. We expressed Fam65b-GFP or Fam65b<sup>RL/AA</sup>-GFP by injectoporation in OHCs at P2 and analyzed hair bundle morphology 2 days later. The quantification of the data was facilitiated by the fact that morphological defects in hair bundles from mutant mice are exaggerated in vitro, presumably because the bundles are fragile and more easily disrupted during the culture period compared to wild-type. Thus most hair bundles in cultured OHCs are either round or fragmented, which is in stark contrast to the V-shape of the bundles of OHCs in wild-type. Following injectoporation, Fam65b-GFP was efficiently targeted to the basal region of hair cell stereocilia and rescued the morphological hair bundle defect of OHCs from <italic>Fam65b</italic>-deficient mice, which formed the typical V-shape (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9J,K</xref>). In contrast, Fam65b<sup>RL/AA</sup> could not rescue the morphological hair bundle defect in hair cells from <italic>Fam65b</italic>-deficient mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9J,K</xref>). We thus conclude that binding of Fam65b to RhoC is critical for its function in mechanosensory hair cells.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>The basal domain of stereocilia has been recognized as a specialized compartment with a distinct lipid and protein composition and a critical function in mechanotransduction because stereocilia form at their base a taper that allows them to pivot in response to mechanical stimulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Fettiplace and Kim, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Müller and Barr-Gillespie, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Zhao and Müller, 2015</xref>). Using STORM microscopy we provide here insights into the spatial arrangement of cytosolic proteins within the basal domain of stereocilia at a resolution that had not been possible with other more common fluorescence microscopy techniques. These imaging experiments combined with biochemical and functional studies also provide insights into the function of Fam65b, a protein that has been previously linked to inherited forms of deafness but whose molecular and cellular function has remained unknown. Our findings provide evidence that Fam65b oligomers form a circumferential ring-like structure in the basal domain of each stereocilium and that this structure is critical for the maintenance of the morphology of the hair bundle. In the absence of the Fam65b the taper region appears abnormally shaped and hair bundles start to form but show degenerative changes before they reach maturity. Oligomerization of Fam65b depends on binding of Fam65b to RhoC, which co-localizes with Fam65b in the basal domain of stereocilia. In contrast, taperin binds to distinct proteins and is distributed within the basal domain through the core of each stereocilium. Taperin distribution is disrupted in the <italic>Fam65b</italic>-deficient hair cells suggesting a potential functional interaction between taperin and Fam65b, but our biochemical data suggest that Fam65b and taperin do not interact directly. We therefore conclude that Fam65b has a critical function in the maintenance of the basal domain of stereocilia, and that defects in this process likely are the underlying cause of deafness in humans and mice with mutations in the <italic>Fam65b</italic> gene.</p><p>Previous studies have demonstrated that a mutation in <italic>Fam65b</italic> can lead to non-syndromic, prelingual, profound hearing loss (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Diaz-Horta et al., 2014</xref>). We show here that <italic>Fam65b</italic>-deficient mice similarly are deaf already at 4 weeks of age, the first time point analyzed. Studies with morpholinos directed against Fam65b in zebrafish suggest that Fam65b is required for normal hair cell survival. However, we did not observed defects in hair cell survival at 2 and 4 weeks after birth, suggesting that the death of hair cells is not the primary cause of the auditory phenotype in mice lacking Fam65b. The difference in cell survival observed in the previous and current study may be attributed to species-specific functions for Fam65b. In <italic>Fam65b</italic>-deficient mice, we observe defects in hair bundle morphology already in the first few days after birth suggesting that degenerative changes are manifest prior to the onset of hearing in mice. The structural defects are associated with defects in mechanotransduction, indicating functional defects in hair cells that likely cause the auditory phenotype of the mutant mice. However, it is unclear whether the defects are caused by direct effects of Fam65b that affect the transduction process, for example by affecting the stiffness of stereocilia, or if the defects are a secondary consequence of the morphological hair-bundle defects that might affect transduction secondarily, for example by affecting the integrity of tip links. Further studies with more subtle mutations in Fam65b that do not dramatically affect hair bundle morphology might be informative.</p><p>While our findings suggest that defects in hair cells are critical for the auditory phenotype caused by <italic>Fam65b</italic> mutations, we also observed Fam65b expression in the microvilli of supporting cells including Hensen’s cells and it cannot be excluded that defects in their development and function might contribute to the auditory phenotype. Regardless of the involvement of supporting cells, defects in hair bundles of hair cells are likely cell-autonomous because we can induce them by knock-down of Fam65b expression in hair cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>) and rescue them by re-expression of Fam65b in <italic>Fam65b</italic>-deficient hair cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). The acute rescue of hair cell morphology by re-expression of Fam65b at postnatal ages also suggests that defects in hair bundle morphology are likely not a secondary consequence of perturbations in an overall developmental program but are more specifically linked to a role of Fam65b in stereocilia.</p><p>Previous studies have suggested that Fam65b might be a membrane-associated protein of stereocilia. Immunolocalization studies demonstrated that Fam65b was expressed along the entire length of stereocilia but additional staining was observed as punctate aggregates in the cell body (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Diaz-Horta et al., 2014</xref>). In some of the hair cells analyzed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Diaz-Horta et al. (2014)</xref>, labeling appeared more prominent near the base of stereocilia, which is consistent with the expression pattern that we describe here. One possible explanation for the discrepancy in the findings is that the antibodies used by Diaz-Horta were raised against the N-terminus of Fam65b, which shows 70% similarity with Fam65a and Fam65c. We used an antibody to the C-terminus of Fam65b, which has very low homology with Fam65a/c. Perhaps hair cells express Fam65a,b,c and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Diaz-Horta et al. (2014)</xref> observed with their antibodies the expression of all three Fam65 proteins. Clearly, our antibody appeared to be specific for Fam65b because we observed no staining in <italic>Fam65b</italic>-deficient hair cells. It will be interesting to define in the future the extent to which Fam65a and Fam65c are expressed in hair cells.</p><p>Given the diameter of stereocilia, the resolution of the images presented previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Diaz-Horta et al., 2014</xref>) was clearly also not sufficient to distinguish between a localization of Fam65b at the membrane of stereocilia, localized internally within their core, or both. Membrane-targeting was mainly inferred previously because sequence comparison indicated that Fam65b might have a PX-BAR domain that can associate with membranes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Diaz-Horta et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Farooq and Tekin, 2014</xref>). However, this conclusion was subsequently contested (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Teasdale and Collins, 2014</xref>). Using STORM microscopy, we have now refined the localization of Fam65b within stereocilia and demonstrate that it is concentrated at their basal domain and not localized uniformly along the entire length of stereocilia. In addition, we show that Fam65b is localized in a circumferential ring near the stereociliary base and does not penetrate the core of stereocilia. The distribution of Fam65b in hair cells would be consistent with localization at the membrane but it is currently not clear whether Fam65b directly binds to the membrane or is targeted to its location within stereocilia by interaction with other proteins. One intriguing possibility is that Fam65b might contain a modified PX-BAR domain that facilitates interactions with the specific lipids that have been shown to be concentrated at the stereociliary base (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Zhao et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>Our findings also provide insights into the mechanisms by which Fam65b acts in hair cells. Previous studies have shown that Fam65b can bind to RhoA and inhibit its function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Gao et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Rougerie et al., 2013</xref>). We show here that Fam65b binds much more strongly to RhoC than to RhoA but we did not observe effects of Fam65b on RhoC activity. Instead, we show that RhoC co-localized with Fam65b in stereocilia and regulates Fam65b oligomerization. Oligomerization is driven by interactions between the N-termini of Fam65b, which are promoted by RhoC, and by interactions between the C-termini suggesting that Fam65b monomers can assemble into extended filaments. In fact, STORM imaging of Fam65b following its expression in heterologous cells (data not shown) suggests that oligomerization leads to linear filaments that can also bend into ring-like structures similar to those observed in hair cells. One interesting possibility would be that Fam65b oligomers form spring-like structures near the membrane at the base of stereocilia that affect the mechanical properties of the bundle. We are currently carrying out structural studies to address this possibility.</p><p>Intriguingly, we did not observe in our assays interactions of Fam65b with other cytoplasmic proteins that have been localized to the basal domain of stereocilia such as taperin, CLIC5, radixin and whirlin. While we cannot exclude that these proteins interact in some context, for example when they carry hair-cell specific posttranslational modifications, the findings nevertheless suggest the existence of functionally distinct protein complexes near the basal taper of stereocilia. Our STORM imaging data further provide evidence that taperin has a distribution in hair cells different from Fam65b. While both proteins are localized near the base of stereocilia, only taperin is localized within the core of stereocilia. Fam65b instead forms a circumferential ring. The diameter of the domain occupied by taperin and of the Fam65b ring are similar, raising the possibility that the two compartments show partially overlap. Unfortunately, antibodies to CLIC5 and radixin were not of sufficient quality to use them in STORM microscopy, but one might predict that CLIC5 and radixin, which are thought to form a protein complex with taperin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Salles et al., 2014</xref>), have a similar distribution at the base of stereocilia as taperin. Taperin localization is perturbed in the absence of Fam65b, suggesting that the distribution of protein complexes containing Fam65b and taperin is interdependent. Perhaps the two protein complexes are connected by a linker protein that still needs to be identified. Alternatively, the proteins might be components of distinct molecular complexes with separate function. Regardless, our data strongly suggest that Fam65b expression and oligomerization is critical for maintaining the structural organization of the basal domain of stereocilia and that mutations in Fam65b cause deafness at least in part by affecting stereocilia morphogenesis and function. Re-expression of Fam65b in <italic>Fam65b</italic>-deficient hair cells at postnatal ages rescued their morphological defects, suggesting that it might be possible to repair hair cell damage in human patients with mutations in the <italic>FAM65B</italic> gene.</p><p>In summary, our data highlight the power of STORM microscopy, combined with genetic and biochemical approaches, to provide insights into the mechanisms by which proteins regulate hair cell function. Notably, the stereocilia of hair cells contain hundreds of proteins many of which are affected in disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Krey et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Petit and Richardson, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Shin et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Wilmarth et al., 2015</xref>). However, stereocilia are small in size and it is challenging to define the function of individual proteins without precise spatial information. Our data show that STORM microscopy can be applied successfully to hair cells and will thus be a useful tool to investigate the spatial organization of proteins in stereocilia in normal and pathological conditions.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Mouse strains, ABR and DPOAE measurement</title><p>ES cells carrying a <italic>Fam65b</italic> allele in which exons 2–14 of <italic>Fam65b</italic> were substituted by a LacZ expression cassette were obtained from Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc. and used to generate <italic>Fam65b<sup>LacZ/+ </sup></italic>mice by the KOMP Repository and the Mouse Biology Program at the University of California, Davis. <italic>Fam65b<sup>LaczZ/+ </sup></italic>mice were maintained on a C57BL/6 background.

Sample was fixed for 2 hr at RT, and dissected in washing buffer (0.05 mM Hepes Buffer pH 7.2; 10 mM CaCl<sub>2;</sub> 5 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>; 0.9% NaCl). The stria vascularis, Reissner’s membrane and tectorial membrane were removed. Samples were dehydrated and processed to critical drying point in an Autosamdri-815A (Tousimis). Cochlea were mounted with carbon tape and coated with iridium (sputter coater EMS150TS; Electron Microscopy Sciences). Samples were imaged with a Hitachi S-4800-ll Field Emission Scanning Electron.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>DNA constructions, transfections, immunoprecipitations and western blots</title><p>DNA constructs are described in Supplementary Information. Expression of the constructs, immunoprecipitations, and western blots were carried out as described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Senften et al., 2006</xref>). Immunoprecipitation experiments were carried out at least 3 times to verify the reproducibility of the data. The following antibodies were used for the experiments: α- Fam65b (rabbit, Sigma); α-HA (mouse, Cell signaling); α-Myc (rabbit, Cell signaling); α-GFP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Xiong et al., 2012</xref>); α-GFP (mouse, Santa Cruz).</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Injectoporation</title><p>The experiment was performed as described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Xiong et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Zhao et al., 2014</xref>). In brief, the organ of Corti was isolated and placed in DMEM/F12 medium with 1.5 μg/ml ampicillin. For electroporation, glass electrodes (2 μm diameter) were used to deliver plasmid (500 ng/μl in 1x HBSS) to the sensory epithelium. A series of 3 pulses was applied at 1 s intervals with a magnitude of 60V and duration of 15 msec (ECM 830 square wave electroporator; BTX). For Ca<sup>2+</sup> imaging, we used G-CaMP3 (Addgene 22692). Hair cells were imaged on an upright Olympus BX51WI microscope mounted with a 60x water-immersion objective and Qimaging ROLERA-QX camera, controlled by Micro-Manager 1.3 software (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Edelstein et al., 2010</xref>). Hair bundles were stimulated with a fluid jet applied through a glass electrode (2 μm tip-diameter) filled with bath solution. Stimuli were applied using Patchmaster 2.35 software (HEKA) and 20 psi air pressure. Images were collected with a 2 s sampling rate. A series of fluid-jet stimulations (0.1, 0.3, 0.5 s) was applied (60 s intervals). Responses induced by 0.3 s fluid-jet stimulation were used for quantitative analysis.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Electrophysiology</title><p>The experiment was performed as described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Zhao et al., 2014</xref>). In brief, during recording, a Peri-Star peristaltic pump (WPI) was used to perfuse artificial perilymph (in mM): 144 NaCl, 0.7 NaH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>, 5.8 KCl, 1.3 CaCl<sub>2</sub>, 0.9 MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 5.6 glucose, and 10 H-HEPES, pH 7.4. In some recordings, Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentration was reduced to 0.02 mM. To record reverse polarity currents in OHCs from wildtype animals, 5 mM BAPTA was added to the bath solution. Borosilicate glass with filament (Sutter) was pulled with a P-97 pipette puller (Sutter), and polished with MF-830 microforge (Narishige) to resistances of 3–5 MΩ. Hair bundles were deflected with a glass pipette mounted on a P-885 piezoelectric stack actuator (Physik Instrument). The tip of the pipette was fire-polished to ~4 μm diameter to fit the shape of OHC bundles. The actuator was driven with voltage steps that were low-pass filtered at 10 KHz with a 900CT eight-pole Bessel filter (Frequency Devices). The output driving voltage to the actuator stack was monitored by an oscilloscope to ensure a rise time &lt;50 μs. The tip of the probe was cleaned in chromic acid to allow adherence to hair bundles. Whole cell recordings were carried out and currents were sampled at 100 KHz with an EPC 10 USB patch-clamp amplifier operated by Patchmaster 2.35 software (HEKA). To record macroscopic currents, the patch pipette was filled with intracellular solution (140 mM KCl, 1 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 0.1 mM EGTA, 2 mM Mg-ATP, 0.3 mM Na-GTP and 10 mM H-HEPES, pH7.2). Cells were clamped at -70 mV.</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>Data analysis</title><p>Data analysis was performed using Excel (Microsoft) and Igor pro 6 (WaveMetrics, Lake Oswego, OR). Calcium signal (△F/F) was calculated with the equation: (F-F<sub>0</sub>)/F<sub>0</sub>, where F<sub>0</sub> is the averaged fluorescence baseline at the beginning. Transduction current-displacement curves (I(X)) were fitted with a three-state Boltzmann model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Grillet et al., 2009</xref>). All data are mean ± SE. Student's two-tailed unpaired t test was used to determine statistical significance (*p&lt;0.05, **p&lt;0.01, ***p&lt;0.001).</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We thank members of the laboratory for comments and criticisms.

Most of the conclusions, based on genetic, biochemical and imaging data, are quite convincing. Nevertheless, the reviewer has several major concerns regarding the super-resolution data:</p><p>1) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3H</xref> tries to show that HA-basilin in HEK cells forms string- or ring-like structures resembling those observed in stereocilia. However, the evidence was drawn from visual display of a small, selected region at the edge of one cell where the label density and the density of localization points is extremely low. In this case, the displayed ring-like structure in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3H</xref>-iii, which contains only 9 localization points, could simply be random coincidence. The string-like structures could also be artifacts resulted from colocalization with other cellular structures. The distance between some localization points and their nearest neighbors exceed 200 nm, which is an indication that these structures, if real, are unlikely maintained by basilin oligomerization alone. The manuscript would have to show statistically significant, objective analysis as to convincingly demonstrate the existence of large-size, ordered basilin structures in HEK cells. Otherwise, the biochemistry data can support the oligomerization capability of basilin, but cannot support that basilin rings are formed by basilin oligomerization.</p><p>2) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref> uses the distinct morphology of basilin and taperin in STORM images to support that they have no direct interaction. However, judging from the two sets of single-color images, the basilin rings may still have certain degree of overlap with taperin disks. Therefore, these images by themselves cannot rule out the possibility that basilin is interacting with some of the taperins at the periphery of the taperin disks (maybe some post-translational modification?). The reviewer suggests more quantitative analysis of the STORM images: measuring the diameter of the two structures, and compare them to the diameter of the stereocilia measured in EM images. This comparison will be important to support the structural model proposed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8L</xref>. (Optional request) If high quality two-color STORM imaging of basilin and taperin can be obtained, preferably in 3D, the conclusions can be further strengthened.</p><p>3) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8B</xref> uses the colocalization of basilin-GFP and HA-RhoC in conventional fluorescence images to support their direct interaction. However, the basilin-taperin case in the same manuscript provides a perfect counter-example: colocalization in the conventional fluorescence images but no direct interaction and distinct morphology in STORM images. The reviewer thus suggests either showing STORM images of these two proteins, or changing the claims in the manuscript.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic> </p><p>The manuscript by Zhao et al. provides new insight into the role of Basilin in inner ear hair cell stereocilia morphogenesis and function While mutations in Fam65b (Basilin) had been shown to be responsible for deafness (Diaz-Horta et al., 2014), the role of this protein in hair cells has been unclear. Here the authors combine biochemical (mostly Co-IP), super-resolution microscopy and functional studies to provide insight into <italic>FAM65B</italic> (renamed &quot;Basilin&quot;), a protein previously shown to be linked to inherited forms of deafness but whose molecular and cellular function has remained unknown. The major findings are: 1) basilin is expressed at the taper end of the sensory inner hair cell stereocilia and hair bundles are disorganized in basilin deficient mice; 2) basilin forms head to head and tail to tail oligomers assembled in a ring like pattern at the base of each stereocilia; 3) oligomer formation depends on RhoC (a Rho kinase) binding which also regulates basilin activity. Interestingly, while basilin has been shown to interact with RhoA in neutrophils (Gao et al. 2015), the current work reveals only weak interaction between basilin and RhoA but highly efficient interaction with RhoC. Somewhat surprising, co-IP does not show any interaction between basilin and Cdc42 and Rac1, other Rho family members expressed in hair cells and demonstrated to play a role in cellular patterning, polarization and planar polarity (Grimsley-Myers et al., 2009; Kirjavainen et al. 2015). A major part of this report is based on Co-IPs (12 panels), which assess interaction between basilin and basilin constructs (to reveal interacting domains) with taperin, CLIC5, radixin, whirlin, RhoA, RhoC, Rac1 and Cdc42. Super-resolution microscopy demonstrates distinct localization between taperin and basilin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>) and linear or circular strings when overexpressed in HEK293 cells. The manuscript is well written and represents a compilation of a large amount of work including the generation of a basilin deficient mouse, immunolocalisation, judicious use of injectoporation with different constructs, co-Ip and Storm microscopy.</p><p>The title of the manuscript is not justified. While STORM microscopy resolves localization of basilin and taperin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref> and one panel in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>) in stereocilia and HEK cells, this finding does not represent the entirety of the work. Rather a title that encompass the new findings i.e. the role of Basilin in hair cell stereocilia and its regulation by RhoC would be more appropriate.</p><p>Co-IP results in HEK-293 cells, in particular the lack of interactions between some of the players may not reflect the situation in native hair cells. Since a large portion of the work is based on co-IP, it is important to discuss these findings critically. Co-Ip using a different cell line such as PK1-CL4 cells or pull down assay might reveal different results. In particular, the lack of interaction with CLIC5, Radixin and whirlin is puzzling in part because Taperin has been shown to interact with CLIC5 (Salles et al. 2014). Have the authors also tested interactions with PTPRQ or Myosin VI also present in the tapering region of the stereocilia?</p><p>Since Rho family members have been shown to play a role in planar polarity, is there evidence of planar polarity defects (kinocilium position or bundle orientation) in the basilin deficient mouse?</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic> </p><p>An interesting and exciting paper that utilizes an impressive suite of methodologies to provide evidence that <italic>FAM65B</italic>, thought by some to be a PX-BAR domain protein, (i) forms oligomeric ring-like structures in a Rho-C dependent at the base of hair-cell stereocilia and (ii) is required for the normal development and maintenance of hair-bundle structure in the mouse cochlea. The paper considerably extends upon the recent paper from Dias-Horta and colleagues showing that a deletion in <italic>FAM65B</italic> causes deafness in a human family and is required for the normal function and survival of hair cells in the zebrafish. Whilst the extent to which the paper reveals 'insights into the mechanisms by which proteins regulate hair cell function' remains debatable, this is an impressive body of work that certainly provides considerable insight into the ever increasing molecular complexity of the sensory hair bundle.</p><p>Additional comments:</p><p>Introduction: 'Mutation in nearly all of the genes…'. Are there mutations in genes that encode proteins that localise to the base of stereocilia that do not cause deafness?</p><p>The value of giving a protein yet another name is questionable. <italic>FAM65B</italic> appears to have quite a widespread distribution. It may be worth mentioning here that <italic>FAM65B</italic> may be a PX-BAR domain protein that could interact with lipids and regulate membrane curvature.</p><p>Aside from confusion causing by renaming, is basilin the best of names? It was originally used for a protein that was found in the basilar membrane but then dropped as the protein proved to be EMILIN-2. Many things are basally located in many structures, and then there are basal bodies, basal laminae…</p><p>Introduction: 'Basilin does not bind to taperin or any of its known binding partners'. Slightly ambiguous; rephrase.</p><p>Results first paragraph, first line: Is the ko mouse really a model for a human disease in which there is an in frame deletion in <italic>FAM65B</italic>?</p><p>Results, end of second paragraph: Are the OHCs even present, let alone functional? They disappear in the zebrafish MO knockdown so do they have hair bundles or survive to 4 weeks of age?</p><p>In the third paragraph of the subsection “Basilin expression in hair cells of the inner ear”: Is the commercially available antibody from Sigma any better than the two used by Dias -Horta et al.? Do the latter give staining in the Fam65b ko? Are these among the many antibodies that not of sufficient quality for immunolocalisation studies and/or STORM? Is there some explanation as to why Dias-Horta found localisation to the apical membrane and the membrane of stereocilia and this study does not? The 'validation' image in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref> is remarkably black. Is the right panel gain and exposure matched to that on the left? There is considerable staining of the microvilli on the apical surface of all the supporting cells, and no images are shown of the apical surface of Hensens's cells. Do the microvilli on these cells have basal tapers, and are there any subtle defects in the structure or function of these microvilli? Is any lacz staining seen in Dieters' and pillar cells if the X-gal staining time is increased? Or is the microvillar staining seen on the surfaces of all supporting cells except Hensen's cells 'non-specific'?</p><p>In the first paragraph of the subsection “Basilin deficiency affects hair bundle morphogenesis and stereociliary growth”. Indicate in figure with arrows which stereocilia are abnormally thick and large. Are the stereocilia fusing?</p><p>In the second and third paragraphs of the subsection “Basilin deficiency affects hair bundle morphogenesis and stereociliary growth” and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figures 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">4</xref>: Why or how does <italic>FAM65B</italic> affect hair bundle cohesion and growth? The TEM is not of very good quality. At best one can see the base of the tapered region in one stereocilium in the ko. Does the taper not form in the ko? This really needs to be addressed. Is taperin displaced up the stereocilia in the Fam65b ko? The apical protrusions are interesting; is this due to a loss of membrane cytoskeletal interactions at the base of the stereocilium? Are the perturbations seen really due to 'defects in bundle cohesion and growth'?</p><p>In the subsection “Defects in mechanotransduction in basilin-deficient hair cells”, transduction defects: Were the stiff probes used for the mutant hair cells fire polished to fit the distorted shape of the mutant hair bundles? The fluid jet is likely to be more suitable for direct measurements of transduction currents in the mutants. The cells in the wild type seem to have a rather broad operating range. Is the adaptation seen of the 'non-calcium dependent variety' described by Ricci and colleagues? Does it occur at positive holding potentials? What happened in the recordings where Ca<sup>2+</sup> was reduced to 0.02 mM? Also, were reverse polarity currents measured (as indicated in methods?). Considering the localisation data and the theoretical contribution of the ankle region to hair-bundle properties it is surprising that the authors have not addressed whether the stiffness or resilience of the hair bundle is altered in any way in the ko. Displacement (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B, C</xref>) is usually measured in micrometers not in micromoles.</p><p>In the last paragraph of the subsection “Defects in mechanotransduction in basilin-deficient hair cells” and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F</xref>: How many cells were rescued by HA-basilin overexpression, and how many were not? How is taperin localised in rescued cells?</p><p>In the first paragraph of the subsection “Analysis of basilin and taperin distribution in hair cells” and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>: The area boxed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref> is not that shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>. It is surprising (in light of the aim of highlighting the power of STORM) that there is no dual labelling shown. The patterns of taperin and <italic>FAM65B</italic> are distinct but, judging from the images, most likely to overlap at some point. Whilst the antibodies to taperin and <italic>FAM65B</italic> would have to be directly conjugated to different fluorophores, a comparison with the distribution F-actin or a membrane marker should be possible; the latter might help confirm the membrane association of <italic>FAM65B</italic> that is depicted in the model shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8L</xref>, but is never explicitly tested or shown. Do the authors have a reason for excluding TRIOBP from the rootlet? Is it actually absent from this narrow region?</p><p>In the subsection “Basilin oligomerization is important for its function” and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7J</xref>: Two of the cells labelled with an asterisk are not obviously expressing N2-GFP, and one of these two has a disrupted hair bundle.</p><p>In the last paragraph of the subsection “RhoC binding to basilin is critical for basilin function in hair cells” and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8J</xref>: What are the morphological criteria for rescued and non-rescued hair cells?</p><p>Discussion, fourth paragraph: Are the ring like structures seen when <italic>FAM65B</italic> is expressed in heterologous cells associated with any structures? Surely physiological studies will be also be required to reveal if <italic>FAM65B</italic> oligomers form spring-link structures at the base of the stereocilia?</p><p>Methods: Minimal details are provided for STORM analysis.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were requested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for resubmitting your work entitled &quot;Fam65B forms ring-like structures at the base of stereocilia critical for mechanosensory hair cell function&quot; for further consideration at <italic>eLife</italic>. Your revised article has been favorably evaluated by Gary Westbrook (Senior editor), Tanya Whitfield (Reviewing editor), and three reviewers. The manuscript has been improved but there are some remaining issues that need to be addressed before acceptance, as outlined below:</p><p>1) There now appear to be three different versions of the revised title – one on the cover page, one on the first page of the manuscript and one in the rebuttal letter. Please clarify which of these you propose to use.</p><p>2) For the new measurements provided for the Fam65B rings, please state what the confidence bounds represent (SD, SEM or other).</p><p>3) Reviewer 1 recommends that the HEK images (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8H</xref>) should be removed from the manuscript. This was discussed among the reviewers, and on balance, it was agreed that removing these images was the best option. The reviewers found these observations very interesting, but thought that it was better to save the data for future follow-up work. Please therefore remove panel H from <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref> and adjust the legend etc. accordingly.</p><p>4) There was no mention of TRIOBP in the text, as stated in the rebuttal.</p><p>Further detail is provided in the assessments from Reviewers 1 and 3 below, for your information. Reviewer 2 was satisfied with your response and did not have any further comments.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic></p><p>The revised manuscript has satisfactorily addressed previous concerns regarding <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref> (previous <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>, Fam65b-taperin interaction) and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9B</xref> (previous <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8B</xref>, basin-RhoC interaction). For Fam65b-taperin interaction, the measurement of their respective diameters supports the model that Fam65b may fill the entire space inside the taperin in. It is necessary, though, to describe in the methods section how the diameters are measured, and in the Results section whether the confidence bounds are standard deviations or S.E.M.</p><p>For the HEK cell STORM images in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8H</xref>, the reviewer thinks it is better to remove them. These images along do not support the oligomerization of Fam65b. If these structures were indeed Fam65b oligomers formed through the direct interaction between monomers, the localization points in the STORM images would have been much closer to each other. Instead, these structures could result from the interaction of Fam65b with other membrane or cytoskeleton structures in HEK cells. Of course, the observed sparse labeling may also be a consequence of low antibody staining efficiency, which is quite common. In either case, these STORM images do not strengthen the conclusions already supported by the biochemical analysis. The reviewer agrees with the authors that removing them does not affect the central conclusion of the manuscript.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic> </p><p>The authors have addressed most of the points raised by the reviewers well. The additional SEM data is fascinating, although it is hard to immediately understand why the thin, tapered region of the stereocilium should get longer in the absence of <italic>FAM65B</italic>. Whilst the quantitation of the diameters of the FAM65b and taperin staining patterns provide support for the structural model, these numbers are presumably derived from a subset of the FAM65b clusters seen at the base of the stereocilia; the standard errors (?) are small and judging from <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8B</xref> ring-shaped structures are very much in the minority. Some indication of the criteria used to select the images measured would be useful.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.14222.014</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>Essential revisions:</italic></p><p><italic>1) A thorough, objective and quantitative analysis of the STORM imaging data should be provided, together with appropriate statistical analysis where required, as requested by Reviewer 1. Inferences about direct interactions (between FAM65B and taperin, and FAM65B and RhoB) should be cautious unless further analysis can strengthen the evidence for these interactions.</italic></p><p>We have quantified the diameter of the Fam65b circumferential ring and the taperin dense-core-like structure at the base of stereocilia. The diameter of Fam65b structure is 229 ± 7 nm (n=41) and taperin structure is 228 ± 9 nm (n=56). While the data indicate a potential overlap between the two structures (although this is difficult to say because labeling with the antibody adds to the dimension of the labeled structure), we provide substantial new data supporting the view that Fam65b and taperin do not interact directly. We performed Co-IP experiments in HEK293 cells (already shown in the original study) and in response to the reviewers' comments now also in CL4 cells, which have been used especially by the Bartles and Berryman laboratories to study interactions between proteins important for hair cell function. We provide positive controls demonstrating that we can reveal known interactions (e.g. taperin with CLIC5). In addition, we have carried out yeast-two-hybrid assays to evaluate interactions between Fam65b and taperin but cannot detect any interactions but we identify new interactions (e.g. Fam65b with RhoC). Taken together, the findings suggest that Fam65b does not bind directly to taperin. However, the two proteins might interact via an intermediate protein. We have revised the text to explain our data more clearly.</p><p><italic>2) Likewise, the interpretation of the co-IP results in HEK-293 cells should be discussed with appropriate caution, as requested by Reviewer 2. If additional co-IP results from a different cell line are available, these should be included.</italic></p><p>As outlined above, we have performed additional Co-IP experiments in CL4 cells and carried out additional yeast-two-hybrid experiments. We include appropriate positive controls. Our data confirm the published interaction of taperin with CLIC5 but do not reveal any interaction between taperin and Fam65b. The data are included in the revised manuscript.</p><p><italic>3) A full structural analysis of the stereociliary bundle phenotype, including cohesion, growth, presence of tapers and stiffness should be provided, as requested by Reviewer 3.</italic></p><p>We have substantially expanded our analysis of the morphological phenotype of hair cells using SEM and include an additional figure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>) as well as a supplementary figure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>). In addition, we have expanded <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>. We found that the morphological phenotype in hair cells is very heterogeneous with some cells showing defects in polarity, cohesion and/or growth already during early stages of hair cell development. In addition, the taper region of stereocilia appears abnormal and we observed unusual membranous protrusions from the apical cell surface. The defects at the taper are consistent with the localization of Fam65b to this region. We provide a quantitative analysis of the morphological phenotypes by grouping the hair cells according to different parameters into four morphological classes. We also provide a quantification of hair bundle polarity defects. Overall, the findings suggest that stereocilia grow and start to form a bundle with a staircase but tapers are abnormally shaped and bundles start to deteriorate before they reach maturity.</p><p>Given the strong structural defects and variability in morphology, we did not include measurements of hair bundle stiffness. Most biophysical measures on hair-bundle stiffness that have been published were collected from non-mammalian species that have substantially longer stereocilia than mice. These measurements are extremely difficult to quantify in murine hair cells and while we attempted measurements we could not determine reliable parameters that could be applied to the morphologically abnormal hair bundles in our mutant mice.</p><p><italic>A) It was agreed that further electrophysiological analyses of the transduction currents (calcium dependency, reverse polarity) would be beyond the scope of this manuscript, and so are not required. However, the authors should acknowledge and discuss any limitations of the methods they have used.</italic></p><p>We have revised the text to outline the limitations of our approach. The experiments are very interesting but we confront a similar problem as for stiffness measurements. It is very difficult to assign primary versus secondary effects due to heterogeneous degenerative changes in hair cells.</p><p><italic>4) A comment on the presence or absence of the outer hair cells and of hair cell polarity defects in the mutant should be included.</italic></p><p>We now include a quantification of hair cell survival at 2 and 4 weeks of age (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1</xref>). There is minimal if any loss. We also have quantified hair bundle polarity at P2, when hair bundle morphology is sufficiently maintained to allow for a quantification using kinocilia as a landmark (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). We see a clear defect in polarity and include the data in the manuscript.</p><p><italic>5) Any discrepancies between the findings and those of Diaz-Horta et al. should be discussed, as requested by Reviewer 3.</italic> </p><p>Unlike Diaz-Horta in studies with zebrafish, we did not observe significant hair cell loss at 2 and 4 weeks in mice, which suggests that the hearing phenotype in our rodent model is not caused by death of hair cells. There could be a species difference in Fam65b function and/or hair cells in zebrafish might die more readily when their hair bundles show morphological abnormalities. We discuss this in the revised manuscript.</p><p>Diaz-Horta et al. reported that Fam65b is localized in murine hair cells along the length of stereocilia. However, judging from the images in the manuscript, they show high expression at the base of stereocilia and less along their lengths. We purchased the two commercial antibodies used by Diaz-Horta and found that we could not detect convincing staining for Fam65b in hair cells. This might perhaps be explained by differences in antibody batches provided by the manufacturer at different times. We would also like to point out that the two commercial antibodies used by Diaz-Horta were raised against the N-terminus of Fam65b, which shows 70% similarity with Fam65a and Fam65c. We used an antibody to the C-terminus of Fam65b, which has very low homology with Fam65a/c. Perhaps hair cells express Fam65a, b, c and Diaz-Horta observed with their batch of antibody not only Fam65b. The antibody that we used is clearly specific as it does not stain hair cells from Fam65b mutant mice. We have revised the text to discuss the discrepancy between the studies and possible explanations for the difference.</p><p><italic>6) The title should be revised, as requested by Reviewer 2, to reflect the findings of the manuscript more generally.</italic> </p><p>We have revised the title: &quot;Fam65b and RhoC cooperate to form ring-like structures at the base of stereocilia critical for mechanosensory hair cell function&quot;</p><p><italic>7) The name 'basilin' should be removed from the manuscript.

As the reviewer correctly points out, we had to image regions at the edge of cells where label-density is low. The choice was deliberate because it is impossible to reach conclusions from areas with very dense labeling because there are just too many clustered dots, which cannot be assigned to different substructures. Also, we did not mean to imply that the HEK images show that Fam65b forms ring-like structures, just beads-on-a-string like arrangements that would be consistent with oligomerization (as observed in our biochemical analysis). The arrangements of the dots is not random, reproducibly seen in many cells and does not resemble any cellular structure that we have seen for any protein in HEK cells. It is difficult to quantify the data in an unbiased manner because we cannot resolve the structures in more densely labeled areas of a cell and are thus selective in the images that we show.</p><p>We have left the images in the revised manuscript and describe them much more carefully, also pointing out the limitations associated with the figure and finding. If the reviewer considers it is the better option, we are happy to remove the image from the manuscript. Not showing the data does not affect the central conclusion of our manuscript.</p><p><italic>2) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref> uses the distinct morphology of basilin and taperin in STORM images to support that they have no direct interaction. However, judging from the two sets of single-color images, the basilin rings may still have certain degree of overlap with taperin disks. Therefore, these images by themselves cannot rule out the possibility that basilin is interacting with some of the taperins at the periphery of the taperin disks (maybe some post-translational modification?). The reviewer suggests more quantitative analysis of the STORM images: measuring the diameter of the two structures, and compare them to the diameter of the stereocilia measured in EM images. This comparison will be important to support the structural model proposed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8L</xref>. (Optional request) If high quality two-color STORM imaging of basilin and taperin can be obtained, preferably in 3D, the conclusions can be further strengthened.</italic> </p><p>We entirely agree with the reviewer that the STORM images cannot be used to rule in/out direct interactions between Fam65b and taperin. We formulated our text poorly. Our biochemical data (now extended), but not the imaging data, support that Fam65b and taperin do not interact directly.</p><p>Following the reviewer’s suggestion, we have now quantified the STORM images. The diameter of the Fam65b ring is 229 ± 7 nm (n=41) and of the taperin structure 228 ± 9 nm (n=56). While the data indicate a potential overlap between the two structures (although this is difficult to say because labeling with the antibody adds to the dimension of the labeled structure), we provide substantial new data supporting the view that Fam65b and taperin do not interact directly (new co-IPs from different cells; yeast-two-hybrid analysis). However, the similarity in diameter of the structures labeled by the two antibodies suggests that the two structures are potentially connected, perhaps by a linker protein. We discuss this now more carefully.</p><p>The antibodies we used for STORM were raised in rabbits. We tried several different antibodies and dyes, but we could not find a good combination that allowed us to carry out double-labeling for Fam65b and taperin. We are in the process of generating additional antibodies including monoclonals, but this will take substantial time.</p><p><italic>3) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8B</xref> uses the colocalization of basilin-GFP and HA-RhoC in conventional fluorescence images to support their direct interaction. However, the basilin-taperin case in the same manuscript provides a perfect counter-example: colocalization in the conventional fluorescence images but no direct interaction and distinct morphology in STORM images. The reviewer thus suggests either showing STORM images of these two proteins, or changing the claims in the manuscript.</italic> </p><p>We agree that co-localization does not mean that two proteins directly interact and we did not want to use the data as support for a direct interaction. To show that Fam65b and RhoC interact, we carried out yeast-two-hybrid analysis and Co-IP experiments. However, having identified an interaction between the two proteins in these heterologous systems, we wanted to confirm that they are present in hair cells in a similar distribution as a first step towards a validation that the biochemical data may be physiologically relevant. Clearly, the proteins are appropriately localized in hair cells to act in a common subcellular compartment. We attempted to further solidify the data and carry out STORM microscopy with RhoC antibodies but did not identify antibodies that worked with the technique. We have carefully modified the text to explain the localization data better. However, we still find that we provide significant evidence for a physical and functional interaction between Fam65b and RhoC: (i) Co-IP and yeast-two-hybrid to demonstrate direct interaction; (ii) demonstrating in cell lines that RhoC promotes Fam65b oligomerization; (iii) demonstrating in hair cells that Fam65b oligomerization and RhoC binding are critical for hair bundle morphogenesis.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p><italic>[…] The title of the manuscript is not justified. While STORM microscopy resolves localization of basilin and taperin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref> and one panel in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>) in stereocilia and HEK cells, this finding does not represent the entirety of the work. Rather a title that encompass the new findings i.e. the role of Basilin in hair cell stereocilia and its regulation by RhoC would be more appropriate.</italic></p><p>We have revised the title: &quot;Fam65b and RhoC cooperate to form ring-like structures at the base of stereocilia critical for mechanosensory hair cell function&quot;.</p><p><italic>Co-IP results in HEK-293 cells, in particular the lack of interactions between some of the players may not reflect the situation in native hair cells. Since a large portion of the work is based on co-IP, it is important to discuss these findings critically. Co-Ip using a different cell line such as PK1-CL4 cells or pull down assay might reveal different results. In particular, the lack of interaction with CLIC5, Radixin and whirlin is puzzling in part because Taperin has been shown to interact with CLIC5 (Salles et al. 2014). Have the authors also tested interactions with PTPRQ or Myosin VI also present in the tapering region of the stereocilia?</italic> </p><p>We have carried out additional experiments to strengthen the biochemical data. We have carried out immunoprecipitations in 293 and CL4 cells and we provide new yeast-two-hybrid data. The results from all experiments agree, revealing no interaction of Fam65b with taperin. As a positive control, we show that taperin interacts with CLIC5 as published. We also performed Co-IPs of the cytoplasmic domain of PTPRQ with Fam65b but did not observe an interaction. Finally, we carried out more yeast-two-hybrid screens but never identified interactions of Fam65b with proteins of the taperin/CLIC5/Whirlin complex, or with PTPRQ and MyoVI. We do not consider this a concern. The data suggest that there are several distinct protein complexes at the base, which is in agreement with the STORM images for Fam65b and taperin – clearly the proteins do not show the same distribution in hair cells. We anticipate that there might be a yet-to-be identified protein that links Fam65b to the taperin/CLIC5/Whirlin complex and we are trying to identify this protein. We also like to point out that there are other proteins such as TRIOBP that are abundant near the base of stereocilia and that form independent structures with no known biochemical link to the taperin/CLIC5/Whirlin complex.</p><p>We have revised the text and carefully address the limitations of our biochemical analysis.</p><p><italic>Since Rho family members have been shown to play a role in planar polarity, is there evidence of planar polarity defects (kinocilium position or bundle orientation) in the basilin deficient mouse?</italic></p><p>Yes, we have analyzed this.

We have included the data in the revised manuscript. Diaz-Horta et al. studied zebrafish, and there could be a species difference in Fam65b function or hair cells; zebrafish hair cells might die more readily when their hair bundles show morphological abnormalities. We discuss the differences between the two studies in the revised manuscript. We also show data for mechanotransduction recordings, revealing functional defects in the hair cells.</p><p><italic>In the third paragraph of the subsection “Basilin expression in hair cells of the inner ear”: Is the commercially available antibody from Sigma any better than the two used by Dias -Horta et al.? Do the latter give staining in the Fam65b ko? Are these among the many antibodies that not of sufficient quality for immunolocalisation studies and/or STORM? Is there some explanation as to why Dias-Horta found localisation to the apical membrane and the membrane of stereocilia and this study does not?</italic></p><p>Diaz-Horta et al. reported that Fam65b is localized in murine hair cells along the length of stereocilia. However, judging from the images in the manuscript, they show very high expression at the base of stereocilia and less along their lengths. We purchased the two commercial antibodies used by Diaz-Horta and found that we could not detect convincing staining for Fam65b in hair cells. This might have to do with the fact that we likely obtained different batches of antibody from the manufacturer. We would also like to point out that the two commercial antibodies used by Diaz-Horta were raised against the N-terminus of Fam65b, which shows 70% similarity with Fam65a and Fam65c. We used an antibody to the C-terminus of Fam65b, which has very low homology with Fam65a/c. Perhaps hair cells express Fam65a, b, c and Diaz-Horta observed with their batch of antibody not only Fam65b. We have revised the text to discuss the discrepancy between the studies and possible explanations for the difference.</p><p>In our hands, the Sigma antibody works very well and does not stain hair cells from Fam65b mutant animals. We have purchased several batches and obtained reproducible results.</p><p><italic>The 'validation' image in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref> is remarkably black. Is the right panel gain and exposure matched to that on the left?</italic></p><p>We apologize for confusing images. We now provide images with matched exposure.</p><p><italic>There is considerable staining of the microvilli on the apical surface of all the supporting cells, and no images are shown of the apical surface of Hensens's cells. Do the microvilli on these cells have basal tapers, and are there any subtle defects in the structure or function of these microvilli? Is any lacz staining seen in Dieters' and pillar cells if the X-gal staining time is increased? Or is the microvillar staining seen on the surfaces of all supporting cells except Hensen's cells 'non-specific'?</italic></p><p>Our analysis of hair bundle morphology suggests that Fam65b is not essential to form tapers but that stereocilia degenerate during their maturation. Thus, Fam65b could be present on other cell types even in microvilli without tapers.</p><p>Regarding the b-gal staining results and the immunohistochemistry, we have substantially revised the text and provide new data. The b-gal data show particular prominent expression in hair cells and Hensen's cell. However, b-gal is not a very sensitive read-out and we cannot exclude that there is weaker expression in other support cells. Using antibody staining, we see prominent labeling of hair cells but also clear signal in Hensen's cells and in some of the microvilli on the top of support cells. The staining is not seen in mutant mice, indicating that the signal is specific. We thus conclude that Fam65b is expressed in hair cells but also likely in support cells including Hensen's cells. New images for Hensen's cells are now included and we discuss the limitations of the b-gal staining data and our results more clearly.</p><p>By SEM, we have not been able to observe structural defect in microvilli of support cells and mention this now in the text.</p><p><italic>In the first paragraph of the subsection “Basilin deficiency affects hair bundle morphogenesis and stereociliary growth”. Indicate in figure with arrows which stereocilia are abnormally thick and large. Are the stereocilia fusing?</italic></p><p>We describe now in revised <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref> in detail structural defects in hair bundles. This is outlined in more detail below.</p><p><italic>In the second and third paragraphs of the subsection “Basilin deficiency affects hair bundle morphogenesis and stereociliary growth” and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figures 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">4</xref>: Why or how does FAM65B affect hair bundle cohesion and growth? The TEM is not of very good quality. At best one can see the base of the tapered region in one stereocilium in the ko. Does the taper not form in the ko? This really needs to be addressed. Is taperin displaced up the stereocilia in the Fam65b ko? The apical protrusions are interesting; is this due to a loss of membrane cytoskeletal interactions at the base of the stereocilium? Are the perturbations seen really due to 'defects in bundle cohesion and growth'?</italic></p><p>We have substantially expanded our analysis of the morphological phenotype of hair cells using SEM. We found that the morphological phenotype in hair cells is very heterogeneous with some cells showing defects in polarity, cohesion and/or growth already during early stages of hair cell development. In addition, the taper region of stereocilia appears abnormal and we observed unusual membranous protrusions from the apical cell surface. The defects at the taper are consistent with the localization of Fam65b to this region. We provide a quantitative analysis of the morphological phenotypes by grouping the hair cells according to different parameters into four morphological classes. We also provide a quantification of hair bundle polarity defects. Overall, the findings suggest that stereocilia grow and start to form a bundle with a staircase but tapers are abnormally shaped and bundles start to deteriorate before they reach maturity.</p><p>We acknowledge that we do not fully understand the cellular mechanisms by which mutation in Fam65b causes defects in hair bundles but our data suggest that it has a critical structural role at the base of stereocilia. We discuss this carefully in the revised manuscript and try to avoid over-interpretation. However, even without a detailed mechanism, we still find that our findings are a significant step forward in our understanding of Fam65b function outlining subcellular distribution, physical and functional interactions with RhoC and a clear link between Fam65b and the morphogenesis of hair bundles.</p><p><italic>In the subsection “Defects in mechanotransduction in basilin-deficient hair cells”, transduction defects: Were the stiff probes used for the mutant hair cells fire polished to fit the distorted shape of the mutant hair bundles? The fluid jet is likely to be more suitable for direct measurements of transduction currents in the mutants. The cells in the wild type seem to have a rather broad operating range. Is the adaptation seen of the 'non-calcium dependent variety' described by Ricci and colleagues? Does it occur at positive holding potentials? What happened in the recordings where Ca<sup>2+</sup> was reduced to 0.02 mM? Also, were reverse polarity currents measured (as indicated in methods?). Considering the localisation data and the theoretical contribution of the ankle region to hair-bundle properties it is surprising that the authors have not addressed whether the stiffness or resilience of the hair bundle is altered in any way in the ko. Displacement (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B, C</xref>) is usually measured in micrometers not in micromoles.</italic></p><p>Given the strong structural defects and variability in morphology, we did not include measurements of hair bundle stiffness. Most biophysical measures on hair bundle stiffness that have been published were collected from non-mammalian species that have substantially longer stereocilia than mice. These measurements are extremely difficult to quantify in murine hair cells and while we attempted measurements we could not determine reliable parameters that could be applied to the morphologically abnormal hair bundles in our mutant mice.</p><p>Similarly, we are reluctant to characterize mechanotransduction currents in great detail in the genetically modified mice that we have available because of the severe defects in hair bundle morphology. Even if we can tease out some aspects relevant for adaptation or calcium dependence, we do not know the extent to which the results provide insights into Fam65b function or are a secondary consequence of the structural defects.</p><p><italic>In the last paragraph of the subsection “Defects in mechanotransduction in basilin-deficient hair cells” and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F</xref>: How many cells were rescued by HA-basilin overexpression, and how many were not? How is taperin localised in rescued cells?</italic></p><p>We now provide a quantitative analysis of all rescue experiments shown in the manuscript. For rescue by HA-basilin expression we quantified two aspects of the phenotype, rescue of morphology and rescue of transduction. In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref> we show the quantitative data for rescue of transduction, in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8K</xref> we show the quantitative data for rescue of morphology. We have not attempted to localize taperin in the rescued cells and instead focused on the experiments suggested by the editorial summary. Should the reviewer insist, we can carry out the experiment.</p><p><italic>In the first paragraph of the subsection “Analysis of basilin and taperin distribution in hair cells” and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>: The area boxed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref> is not that shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>. It is surprising (in light of the aim of highlighting the power of STORM) that there is no dual labelling shown. The patterns of taperin and FAM65B are distinct but, judging from the images, most likely to overlap at some point. Whilst the antibodies to taperin and FAM65B would have to be directly conjugated to different fluorophores, a comparison with the distribution F-actin or a membrane marker should be possible; the latter might help confirm the membrane association of FAM65B that is depicted in the model shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8L</xref>, but is never explicitly tested or shown. Do the authors have a reason for excluding TRIOBP from the rootlet? Is it actually absent from this narrow region?</italic></p><p>We have revised the figures and text and now show matched images. Following the suggestions of several reviewers, we have now quantified the STORM images. The diameter of the Fam65b ring is 229 ± 7 nm (n=41) and of the taperin structure 228 ± 9 nm (n=56). The data indicate a potential overlap between the two structures (although this is difficult to say because laveling with the antibody adds to the dimension of the labeled structure). We discuss this now more carefully.</p><p>We tried extensively to use in STORM microscopy several different labels together with antibodies to Fam65b and taperin. We attempted to label membranes (Vybrant Dil, CM-DiI, DiO, biotin) as well as F-actin. However, we were unable to visualize double labeling with our instrumentation. For membrane staining, Vybrant DiI, Vybrant DiO, and Vybrant CM-DiI were readily taken up by supporting cells in the cochlea, but not very efficiently by the hair cells themselves; not just the stereocilia bundles, but also the apical membranes in hair cells did not stain significantly. Background was too high with biotin-based membrane staining methods. We were also looking for a good fluorophores coupled to phalloidin that could bleach with our laser illumination set-up (bleaching is critical for STORM), but using commercially available fluorophore-conjugated phalloidin we could not achieve good F-actin staining using STORM. We have more recently approached researchers at other institutions for collaborations to explore other technologies (SIM, STET) but do not yet have access to these instruments. Even without these data, we find that our studies make a substantial contribution and reveal clear differences in the distribution of taperin and Fam65b at the base of stereocilia. The diameter of the structures that we image is in good agreement with the diameter of stereocilia, suggesting localization of Fam65b near the membrane, as depicted in the diagram. Please note that we do not claim that our data show affinity of Fam65b for membranes or lipids (others have done that in the published literature). We merely depict a plausible model and have revised the text carefully to point this out.</p><p>We only excluded TRIOBP because it is more widely localized along rootlets and the figure is already crowded. However, we now mention TRIOBP in the text. It would indeed be very interesting to explore a connection between TRIOBP and Fam65b but we have not carried out experiments along these lines.</p><p><italic>In the subsection “Basilin oligomerization is important for its function” and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7J</xref>: Two of the cells labelled with an asterisk are not obviously expressing N2-GFP, and one of these two has a disrupted hair bundle.</italic></p><p>Expression in some of the displayed cells was low and did not display well in the provided image.

We also show one cell that expresses very low levels of the protein and, as expected, no morphological disruption</p><p><italic>In the last paragraph of the subsection “RhoC binding to basilin is critical for basilin function in hair cells” and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8J</xref>: What are the morphological criteria for rescued and non-rescued hair cells?</italic> </p><p>We specify this now in the text. The morphological defects of cultured Fam65b hair cells are more severe than in vivo. Most of them assume a round-shape or have strong defects in cohesion. This indicates that the bundles are likely fragile and that morphological defects are exaggerated by the dissection procedure. Following rescue by gene expression, the hair bundles show a clear organized morphology with a characteristic V-shape.</p><p><italic>Discussion, fourth paragraph: Are the ring like structures seen when FAM65B is expressed in heterologous cells associated with any structures? Surely physiological studies will be also be required to reveal if FAM65B oligomers form spring-link structures at the base of the stereocilia?</italic></p><p>As pointed out in response to the comments of reviewer 2, we have modified our section on the structures in heterologous cells – the data are qualitative in nature and if the reviewers consider them inappropriate for inclusion we can remove them without affecting the conclusions of the manuscript.</p><p>Regarding the &quot;spring-like structures&quot;, we entirely agree that we do not have data to claim that the molecules form springs. We wanted to bring this up as an interesting discussion point. We have now further modified the text to express this explicitly: &quot;One interesting possibility would be that basilin oligomers form spring-like structures near the membrane at the base of stereocilia that affect the mechanical properties of the bundle. While there is currently no experimental evidence for this model, we are carrying out structural studies to address this possibility.&quot;</p><p><italic>Methods: Minimal details are provided for STORM analysis.</italic></p><p>We now provide a detailed description of the method:</p><p>“Whole mount staining and super-resolution imaging</p><p>Cochlear whole mount staining was carried out as described (Zhao et al., 2014).
