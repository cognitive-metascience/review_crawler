In <italic>Salmonella typhimurium</italic> and <italic>Escherichia coli</italic>, the virulence determining two-component system PhoQ/PhoP regulates the transcription of <italic>mgtA</italic> gene by sensing Mg<sup>2+</sup> concentrations in the periplasm. However, the factors that affect MgtA function are not known. This study demonstrates, for the first time, that MgtA is highly dependent on anionic phospholipids and in particular, cardiolipin. Colocalization studies confirm that MgtA is found in the cardiolipin lipid domains in the membrane. The head group of cardiolipin plays major role in activation of MgtA suggesting that cardiolipin may act as a Mg<sup>2+</sup> chaperone for MgtA. We further show that MgtA is highly sensitive to free Mg<sup>2+</sup> (Mg<sup>2+</sup><sub>free</sub>) levels in the solution. MgtA is activated when the Mg<sup>2+</sup><sub>free</sub> concentration is reduced below 10 μM and is strongly inhibited above 1 mM, indicating that Mg<sup>2+</sup><sub>free</sub> acts as product inhibitor. Combined, our findings conclude that MgtA may act as a sensor as well as a transporter of Mg<sup>2+</sup>.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.11407.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.11407.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.11407.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Magnesium is an essential element for living cells, meaning that organisms from bacteria to humans need magnesium to survive. All cells are surrounded by a membrane made of fatty molecules called lipids, which is also embedded with proteins. Magnesium, like other metal ions, is transported inside cells across the cell’s membrane by specific membrane proteins.</p><p>A species of gut bacteria called <italic>E. coli</italic> has two separate magnesium transport systems: one that works at high concentrations of magnesium and one at lower concentrations. The latter system involves a membrane protein called magnesium transporter A (or MgtA for short), which works like a molecular pump. However, it was not known exactly how this transporter was affected by magnesium nor how sensitive it was to this divalent metal ion. It was also unclear whether MgtA worked alone in the bacterial membrane or if it worked in conjunction with other molecules.</p><p>Now Subramani et al. have managed to show that MgtA can sense magnesium ions down to micromolar concentrations, which is the equivalent to a pinch (1 gram) of magnesium salt in 10,000 liters of water. The experiments also showed that this detection system depended on a specific lipid molecule in the membrane called cardiolipin. MgtA and cardiolipin were found together in the membrane of living <italic>E. coli</italic> suggesting that the two do indeed work together.</p><p>The discovery that a membrane transporter that pumps ions needs cardiolipin to work suggests that cells could indirectly control the movement of ions by changing the levels of specific lipids in their membranes. Subramani et al. now hope to use techniques, such as X-ray crystallography, to visualize how magnesium and cardiolipin bind to MtgA and explore how the three molecules work together as a complete system. Information about these interactions could in the future help researchers understand how these bacteria try to protect themself in the hostile environment in the human gut or cells of the immune systems. Further studies of this system could be used to develop biological sensors for magnesium or to design antibiotics that interfere with the magnesium transporter to treat bacterial infections.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.11407.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.11407.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>magnesium transport</kwd><kwd>cardiolipin</kwd><kwd>P-type ATPase</kwd><kwd>MgtA</kwd><kwd>magnesium inhibition</kwd><kwd>ATPase assay</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd><italic>E. coli</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100005416</institution-id><institution>Norges Forskningsråd</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>ES486454</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Subramani</surname><given-names>Saranya</given-names></name><name><surname>Perdreau-Dahl</surname><given-names>Harmonie</given-names></name><name><surname>Morth</surname><given-names>Jens Preben</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>A magnesium transporter from Escherichia coli depends strongly on the lipid cardiolipin and acts both as a sensor and a transporter of magnesium.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Magnesium is the most abundant divalent cation in biological systems and is an essential requirement for all living cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Reinhart, 1988</xref>). Mg<sup>2+</sup> has diverse biological roles, ranging from being an essential cofactor in ATP-mediated enzymatic reactions to being a signaling molecule that activates important virulence systems in bacteria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Groisman et al., 2013</xref>). Mg<sup>2+</sup> homeostasis is well studied in Gram-negative bacteria like <italic>S. typhimurium</italic> and <italic>E. coli</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Papp-Wallace and Maguire, 2008</xref>). Three classes of Mg<sup>2+</sup> transporters have been identified in bacteria: CorA, MgtE and MgtA (magnesium transporter A)/MgtB. Based on the Mg<sup>2+</sup> transport studies, Snavely et al., proposed that CorA transports Mg<sup>2+</sup> under normal Mg<sup>2+</sup> levels, whereas MgtA and MgtB transport Mg<sup>2+</sup> when bacteria faces low Mg<sup>2+</sup> condition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Snavely et al., 1991</xref>). Later Garcia Vescovi et al., identified that the low Mg<sup>2+</sup> levels in the periplasm activate the PhoQ/P system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Véscovi et al., 1996</xref>), which in turn induces the expression of genes essential for adapting the Mg<sup>2+</sup> limiting environments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Monsieurs et al., 2005</xref>). One of the genes was found to be <italic>mgtA</italic>. In addition to PhoQ/P mediated activation, a Mg<sup>2+</sup> sensing riboswitch at the 5’ leader region was found to activate the transcription of <italic>mgtA</italic> gene when the Mg<sup>2+</sup> level in cytoplasm falls below a certain threshold (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Cromie et al., 2006</xref>). Therefore, both the intracellular and extracellular Mg<sup>2+</sup> concentrations regulate transcription of the <italic>mgtA</italic> gene. Upon translation, MgtA is believed to transport Mg<sup>2+</sup> from the periplasm into the cytoplasm under Mg<sup>2+</sup> depriving conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Snavely et al., 1989</xref>). It has been shown that deletion of the <italic>mgtA</italic> gene affects the survival of <italic>S. typhimurium</italic> at higher temperatures and also promotes lysis in <italic>Streptococcus pneumonia</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">O'Connor et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Neef et al., 2011</xref>) .</p><p>MgtA belongs to the P3 subfamily of P-type ATPases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Palmgren and Axelsen, 1998</xref>). The P3 family is subdivided into P3A and P3B. The P3A family is dominated by H<sup>+</sup>-ATPases found in plants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Palmgren, 2001</xref>), while P3B contains Mg<sup>2+</sup> ATPases, found to be dominant amongst prokaryotes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Kühlbrandt, 2004</xref>). Recently, a close homolog of MgtA was reported in <italic>Petunia hybrida</italic> (PH1), which lacks the ability to induce a proton gradient. PH1 was proposed to support the proton pumping performed by the P3A proton pump PH5, but evidence for magnesium transport was not established (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Faraco et al., 2014</xref>). In general, MgtA is found in bacteria, archaea, fungi and plants (See also <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">2</xref>). MgtA has ten predicted transmembrane helices (TM), a nucleotide binding domain (N), a phosphorylation domain (P) and an actuator domain (A) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). The Post-Albers cycle describes the transport mechanism of a P-type ATPase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Albers, 1967</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Post et al., 1969</xref>). During the transport cycle, P-type ATPases alternate between the E1 and E2 states with different intermediate conformational states (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Palmgren and Nissen, 2011</xref>). The E1 state has high affinity and is open for ions binding from the cytoplasm. Ion binding induces autophosphorylation by transferring the γ-phosphate from an ATP molecule to a conserved aspartate residue in the DKTGT consensus motif of the P domain forming the E1P state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Lutsenko and Kaplan, 1995</xref>). In <italic>E. coli</italic> MgtA (ecMgtA), the phosphorylated aspartate corresponds to Asp 373. Phosphorylation induces domain rearrangements leading to the E2P state, which is now open to the periplasmic side. E2P has low affinity for the bound ions and high affinity for the counter ions (Mg<sup>2+</sup> in case of MgtA). The exchange of counter ions dephosphorylates the enzyme and forms the E2 state. Further conformational changes return the enzyme back to the E1 state and the counterions are released into the cytoplasm, thus completing the transport cycle. A possible Post-Albers scheme with the four steps transport cycle can be visualized for MgtA and is given in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>. Since MgtA imports Mg<sup>2+</sup> into the cytoplasm, Mg<sup>2+</sup> is predicted to have high affinity to the E2P state. However, the stoichiometry and electrogenic nature of magnesium transport by MgtA remains unknown.<fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.11407.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Magnesium uptake scheme for MgtA.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Cartoon representation of MgtA showing transmembrane domain (TM), actuator domain (A), phosphorylation domain (P) and nucleotide binding domain (N).

Moreover, the extra DOPG did not show any additive effect over CL induced ATPase activity. The minor decrease in the ATPase activity is likely due to the presence of detergent C<sub>12</sub>E<sub>8</sub> (Octaethylene glycol monododecyl ether) in which the lipids are dissolved (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>).

However, the maximal ATPase activity in the presence of bovine heart CL was approximately 30% lower than what was observed with <italic>E. coli</italic> CL.

The SEC elution profile shows a monodisperse peak corresponding to the size of a monomer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>). The SEC profile of MgtA in the presence and absence of CL did not show signs of dimerization of MgtA. However, a significant shift in the elution peak was observed corresponding to a difference of ~50 kDa. This shift likely indicates an increase in lipid-protein-detergent micelle radius caused by binding of CL to MgtA. The presence of Mg<sup>2+</sup> with CL does not show any further shift, confirming that MgtA function as a monomer in the described assay conditions. The general P-type ATPase inhibitor vanadate as well as specific inhibitors that affect different steps of Post-Albers cycle (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3</xref>) inhibited the MgtA ATPase activity. AlF<sub>4</sub><sup>-</sup> and ADP-AlF<sub>4</sub><sup>-</sup> showed maximal inhibition, followed by vanadate, whereas MgF<sub>4</sub><sup>-</sup> showed only a partial inhibition.

NAO is widely used to image anionic phospholipids in bacteria and displays a specific red-shifted fluorescence emission when bound to CL (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Mileykovskaya et al., 2001</xref>). The online web resource GenoBase: comprehensive resource database of <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> K-12 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Otsuka et al., 2015</xref>), reports protein localization images for most <italic>E. coli</italic> proteins.

The confocal images of MgtA (gene locus: JW4201) fused to GFP from GenoBase showed clear fluorescence localized at the poles. Since our biochemical data showed that MgtA is activated in the presence of CL, we hypothesized that MgtA could colocalize with the CL rich domains in <italic>E. coli</italic>. To further expand the analysis, we decided to include an N-terminal deletion mutant as well (NΔ31-MgtA). The N-terminal of ecMgtA is rich in positively charged residues and is predicted to harbor intrinsically disordered regions. Similar disordered regions are observed in MgtA and the ortholog MgtB from <italic>S. typhimurium.</italic> The deletion mutant served two purposes; 1) to test whether the positively charged residues were important for the interaction with CL, since activation by lipids binding at the N-terminus had been reported for another P-type ATPase, ATP13A2 of the P5 subfamily (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Faraco et al., 2014</xref>) and 2) to test whether this stretch was important for trafficking to the membrane. We generated constructs of MgtA and NΔ31-MgtA with blue fluorescent protein (BFP) fused at the C-terminus. The confocal images of <italic>E. coli</italic> C43(DE3) overexpressing MgtA-BFP confirmed that it was mainly concentrated at the poles and colocalized with the NAO-stained CL domains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). The NΔ31-MgtA-BFP was also found at the poles and colocalized with CL (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). As a control, the overexpressed BFP alone did not colocalize with the NAO stained CL (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). Furthermore, no significant difference in the ATPase activity between the purified wt and NΔ31 mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>) was observed.

To estimate the sensitivity of MgtA to Mg<sup>2+</sup>, we have to make the assumption that Mg<sup>2+</sup> must be free in solution to be transported through MgtA. The Mg<sup>2+</sup><sub>free</sub> indicates that the Mg<sup>2+</sup> ions are coordinated only by water and not by ATP, which is also present in the assay mix. It is not possible to perform an ATPase assay with the concentrations of Mg<sup>2+</sup><sub>free</sub>, ATP<sub>free</sub> and Mg<sup>2+</sup>-ATP acting independent of each other. Thus, it becomes inevitable to obtain the desired information from an assay where one ligand is fixed (e.g. ATP) while varying the concentration of other ligand (e.g. Mg<sup>2+</sup>).</p><p>The ATPase activity was measured at three fixed concentrations (1.0, 3.0 and 6.0 mM) of ATP, with increasing concentrations of Mg<sup>2+</sup> (Mg<sup>2+</sup><sub>total</sub>) from 0 to 10.0 mM. This experiment showed steep activation of MgtA ATPase activity at low Mg<sup>2+</sup><sub>total</sub> levels that peak when the molar ATP concentration is equivalent to the molar Mg<sup>2+</sup><sub>total</sub> concentration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). A rapid decline in ATPase activity was observed at higher Mg<sup>2+</sup><sub>total</sub> concentrations. For each of the ATP concentrations indicated, the ATPase activity reached equivalent maximum velocity (~14 μmol Pi min<sup>-1</sup> mg<sup>-1</sup>). However, the activation profile was slightly shifted towards higher Mg<sup>2+</sup><sub>total</sub> as the ATP concentration in assay buffer increased. This shift can be explained by the fact that higher ATP concentrations chelate more Mg<sup>2+</sup> than lower ATP concentrations, thereby reducing the level of Mg<sup>2+</sup><sub>free</sub> available for MgtA to transport, causing a delay in activation. This is verified by plotting the data from <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref> against the calculated Mg<sup>2+</sup><sub>free</sub> (Calculated with MAXC, see materials and methods) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). We found that the activating concentration of Mg<sup>2+</sup><sub>free</sub> was equivalent (~10.0 μM) for all three fixed ATP concentrations. Further, we observed that the ATPase activity peaked at 250 μM Mg<sup>2+</sup><sub>free</sub> and was inhibited rapidly above 1.0 mM Mg<sup>2+</sup><sub>free</sub>. Since the cytoplasmic Mg<sup>2+</sup><sub>free</sub> concentration is ~1 mM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Silver and Clark, 1971</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Froschauer et al., 2004</xref>), the inhibition that is observed could occur from the cytoplasmic side of MgtA. In that case, the inhibition can be explained as product inhibition, considering the Mg<sup>2+</sup><sub>free</sub> transported into the cytoplasm to be the product. Together, these results indicate that Mg<sup>2+</sup><sub>free</sub> regulates MgtA ATPase activity when the Mg<sup>2+</sup><sub>free</sub> levels deviate from the 1 mM physiological threshold concentration. We also calculated the apparent K<sub>m</sub> for Mg<sup>2+</sup><sub>free</sub> to be between 10–15 μM for the three ATP concentrations tested (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>) which is only slightly lower than the reported ~29 μM from <italic>in vivo</italic> studies with <italic>S. typhimurium</italic> at 37°C (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Snavely et al., 1989</xref>).<fig-group><fig id="fig4" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.11407.016</object-id><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><title>Mg<sup>2+</sup>and pH dependency of MgtA.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) ATP hydrolysis was measured with increasing concentration Mg<sup>2+</sup> at fixed ATP concentrations.

However, at all pH values, a decrease in ATPase activity at higher Mg<sup>2+</sup><sub>total</sub> concentration was observed corresponding to product inhibition as seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>. When the ATPase activity was plotted against Mg<sup>2+</sup><sub>free</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref>), it became clear that in the pH range from 6.3 to 7.2, the activation and inhibition profiles were equivalent with only decrease in the maximum ATPase activity when the pH is below 7.0. At pH 7.6 and pH 7.9, the affinity for Mg<sup>2+</sup><sub>free</sub> was reduced, but the inhibition by Mg<sup>2+</sup><sub>free</sub> was equivalent to the other pH ranges. Our data do not show any clear proton dependent Mg<sup>2+</sup> affinity for MgtA. Considering that the MgtA homolog PH1 from <italic>P. hybrida</italic> did not show proton transport activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Faraco et al., 2014</xref>), we have to question whether proton counter transport occurs in MgtA. Both MgtA and PH lack the membrane imbedded arginine, which is important for proton translocation as described for the P3A-type (H<sup>+</sup>) ATPases, Pma1 (Arg 695) in yeast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Dutra et al., 1998</xref>) and AHA2 (Arg 655) in Arabidopsis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Buch-Pedersen and Palmgren, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Pedersen et al., 2007</xref>). These observations suggest that MgtA may be importing magnesium without the need for proton as counter ion. Since enzymatic activity in general is affected by changes in pH, the pH dependent ATPase activity changes we observe may not be linked to proton translocation. The role of protons as counterions for MgtA therefore awaits further verification.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Over the past two decades, identification of different Mg<sup>2+</sup> transporters in bacteria and their link to the virulence system PhoP/PhoQ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Groisman et al., 2013</xref>) has prompted new studies into these transporters. A key Mg<sup>2+</sup> transporter is MgtA, which is expressed under low Mg<sup>2+</sup> conditions sensed by the PhoP/PhoQ system. A detailed picture of the transcriptional regulation of <italic>mgtA</italic> is available. However, the in vitro enzymatic characterization of MgtA has been missing and the factors that affect the enzymatic functions are not known. Towards the aim of enzymatic characterization of MgtA, we purified MgtA and demonstrated the tight association of MgtA with CL, and sensitivity of MgtA towards Mg<sup>2+</sup>, providing the first step in understanding the P3B-type ATPases.</p><p>In this study, MgtA was overexpressed and purified from <italic>E. coli</italic>. The purification process decreased the ATPase activity of MgtA, indicating the removal of an activating compound or an interacting partner. Addition of total <italic>E. coli</italic> lipids restored the ATPase activity, leading to successful reactivation of purified MgtA. Addition of DOPE, DOPG and CL independently to an ATPase assay revealed that MgtA was only activated by anionic phospholipids. Furthermore, CL showed the strongest activation as compared to DOPG, while DOPE had no effect on ATPase activity. This indicated the importance of specific lipid-protein interactions in the membrane. Our results are the first to link activation by CL to any P-type ATPase. CL has often been linked to membrane proteins connected with the oxidative phosphorylation in mitochondria and membrane proteins involved with lipid metabolism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Planas-Iglesias et al., 2015</xref>). Lipids exert their effect on membrane proteins either by binding to specific sites or by changing the environment immediate to the protein, thus facilitating oligomerization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Ernst et al., 2010</xref>). MgtA does not exhibit oligomerization in presence of CL or CL-Mg<sup>2+</sup> in vitro Thus, CL likely causes a small structural change directly on the protein surface either by binding to a specific site or by facilitating Mg<sup>2+</sup><sub>free</sub> recognition. Our data suggests that the CL binding does not occur at the N-terminus but at an yet unidentified site.</p><p>Addition of other lipid types (e.g. DOPE and DOPG) to MgtA pre-incubated with CL did not affect the ATPase activity. This suggests that other lipid types do not interfere with CL binding to MgtA and hints that the head group of the lipids plays an important role in the activation. The preferential selection of CL in the presence of other lipid types hint that MgtA function may be regulated in vivo by changing the local concentration of CL. Since CL have been shown to form domains or rafts at the poles and division septa in <italic>E. coli</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Renner and Weibel, 2011</xref>), we hypothesized that MgtA could be localized in these CL domains. Our confocal studies indeed showed that MgtA is confined to the poles and colocalized with NAO stained CL. Several publications have validated the use of NAO to stain CL-rich domains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Mileykovskaya et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Mileykovskaya and Dowhan, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Mileykovskaya and Dowhan, 2009</xref>). However, a recent study questions the specificity of NAO to CL, and shows that NAO stains both anionic phospholipids, PG and CL in the membrane and at the poles of <italic>E. coli</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Oliver et al., 2014</xref>). Considering the discrepancies in NAO staining, it is not possible to distinguish which anionic lipid among CL and PG would have the most pronounced effect on MgtA in vivoin the <italic>E. coli</italic> inner membrane. It has earlier been reported that expression of MgtA and consequent removal of Mg<sup>2+</sup> from the periplasm by MgtA further activated the sensor kinase PhoQ of the two-component system PhoQ/PhoP. This positive feedback regulation increased the level phosphorylated PhoP, which is necessary for the expression of subset of genes expressed under low Mg<sup>2+</sup> condition <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Park and Groisman, 2014</xref>It is interesting to note that PhoP of the two-component system PhoQ/P, which activates MgtA expression, also goes to one pole in <italic>S. typhimurium</italic> when activated by phosphorylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Sciara et al., 2008</xref>).Our observation that MgtA is localized in CL rich domains in the poles, thus connect the localization observed for activated PhoP and MgtA. However the exact molecular mechanism behind the similar localization pattern of MgtA-CL and PhoP remains to be determined.</p><p>Activation by both anionic lipids has been observed for other membrane proteins, including the anaerobic respiratory complex in <italic>E. coli</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Arias-Cartin et al., 2011</xref>), the mechanosensitive channel MscL (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Powl et al., 2003</xref>), the protein translocon complex SecYEG (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Gold et al., 2010</xref>) and the cell division proteins MinD and MinE (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Renner and Weibel, 2012</xref>). Thus, it is reasonable to conclude that MgtA is active in an anionic phospholipid environment. This diversity of lipid binding could arise from the structural similarity between PG and CL. In bacteria, CL is synthesized by the fusion of two PG molecules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Tropp, 1997</xref>). While CL carries two negative charges in the head group, PG carries only one. This difference in the charge could contribute either to efficient binding of lipid or efficient presentation of substrate (Mg<sup>2+</sup>) to MgtA. It has been shown that CL can bind divalent cations like Mg<sup>2+</sup> and undergo lipid phase changes as a function of Mg<sup>2+</sup> concentration(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Vail and Stollery, 1979</xref>). It is therefore tempting to speculate that CL could act as a Mg<sup>2+</sup> reservoir or as a chaperone for easy substrate presentation to MgtA. The Cu<sup>+</sup>-ATPases from the P1B-type ATPase family are well known to require protein chaperones that are either part of the Cu<sup>+</sup>-ATPases or expressed as separate proteins in cytoplasm to bind and deliver Cu<sup>+</sup> to the Cu<sup>+</sup>-ATPases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Arguello et al., 2007</xref>). Our observation with bovine heart CL indicates that the head group of cardiolipin plays the main role in activation of MgtA relative to the composition of fatty acid tails. This, it is intriguing to speculate that the head group of CL could function as the Mg<sup>2+</sup> chaperone for MgtA and its function could differ depending on the side it associates with MgtA. If the headgroup of CL faces the periplasmic side, then it may act as a chaperon for Mg<sup>2+</sup>, assisting the uptake of Mg<sup>2+</sup>. If the headgroup faces the cytoplasmic side, it may play a role in sensing the Mg<sup>2+</sup> levels in cytoplasm, thereby regulating MgtA activity. However to further address these questions, a crystal structure of CL bound to MgtA will be necessary as it is not possible to determine the sidedness of the CL headgroup binding site in MgtA in the present study.</p><p>Surprisingly, the effect of Mg<sup>2+</sup> on the ATPase activity of MgtA was more pronounced than expected. MgtA is activated already below 10 μM Mg<sup>2+</sup><sub>free</sub>. The activation is followed by a rapid decrease in activity as the Mg<sup>2+</sup><sub>free</sub> concentration rises above 1 mM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). All P-type ATPases require Mg<sup>2+</sup> for their activity. Even though our data does not conclusively establish the transport of Mg<sup>2+</sup> by MgtA, it shows that MgtA is highly sensitive to the Mg<sup>2+</sup><sub>free</sub> and the level of sensitivity is different from other P-type ATPases. The related H<sup>+</sup> ATPase from <italic>Neurospora crassa</italic> also shows decrease in ATPase activity at higher Mg<sup>2+</sup> concentration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Brooker and Slayman, 1983</xref>). However, it is not completely inhibited even above 20 mM of Mg<sup>2+</sup><sub>total</sub>, whereas MgtA is completely inhibited above 5 mM. MgtA presents a strikingly narrow activity range induced by Mg<sup>2+</sup> as compared to the H<sup>+</sup> ATPase. Overall, we conclude that MgtA is more sensitive to Mg<sup>2+</sup> concentrations in vitro than any other studied P-type ATPase. This sensitivity towards Mg<sup>2+</sup> points out that Mg<sup>2+</sup> is the ion transported through MgtA <italic>in vivo</italic>. The narrow activity range suggests that MgtA could have more Mg<sup>2+</sup> binding sites other than the transport sites to sense the varying Mg<sup>2+</sup><sub>free</sub> concentrations.</p><p>The Mg<sup>2+</sup><sub>free</sub> concentration <italic>of E.</italic> coli and <italic>S. enterica</italic> cytoplasms is found to be ~1 mM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Silver and Clark, 1971</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Froschauer et al., 2004</xref>). The observation that MgtA transports Mg<sup>2+</sup> into the cytoplasm and its ATPase activity decreases above the physiological 1 mM Mg<sup>2+</sup><sub>free</sub>, strengthens the notion that the cytoplasmic Mg<sup>2+</sup><sub>free</sub> concentration also regulates MgtA internally. Additionally, it has been reported that increasing cytoplasmic Mg<sup>2+</sup> concentrations negatively regulates <italic>mgtA</italic>-coding region (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Cromie et al., 2006</xref>). Based on these results we extend the model, initially proposed by Groisman and coworkers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Cromie et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Park et al., 2010</xref>) in which PhoP/PhoQ senses low Mg<sup>2+</sup> in the periplasm and activates <italic>mgtA</italic> transcription. When the cytoplasmic Mg<sup>2+</sup> falls below a threshold, the riboswitch allows transcription of <italic>mgtA</italic>. Our data adds further evidence to the post translated system, in which MgtA is targeted to the PG-CL domains at the poles and transport Mg<sup>2+</sup> into the cytoplasm, thereby satisfying the cellular needs. When the Mg<sup>2+</sup> concentration in the cytoplasm exceeds the threshold, Mg<sup>2+</sup><sub>free</sub> negatively regulates both MgtA in PG-CL domain and <italic>mgtA</italic> coding region (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). In conclusion, our data supports that MgtA acts both as a transporter and as asensor for Mg<sup>2+</sup>.<fig id="fig5" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.11407.019</object-id><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><title>Model illustrating the regulation of Mg<sup>2+</sup> uptake by MgtA.</title><p>When PhoQ senses low Mg<sup>2+</sup><sub>free</sub> (&lt;50 μM) in periplasm, it phosphorylates PhoP.

Association of MgtA with CL is essential for its activity. MgtA imports Mg<sup>2+</sup><sub>free</sub> available in periplasm to the cytoplasm of bacteria, thereby increasing cytoplasmic Mg<sup>2+</sup><sub>free</sub> concentration. When the cytoplasmic Mg<sup>2+</sup><sub>free</sub> concentration reaches a threshold (~1 mM), MgtA is inhibited both at the transcriptional and the post-translational level.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.11407.019">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.11407.019</ext-link></p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="x-tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-11407-fig5-v3"/></fig></p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><p>Lipids were purchased from Avanti Polar Lipids, Alabaster, Alabama.

Your article has been favorably evaluated by Michael Marletta (Senior Editor) and two reviewers, one of whom, Eduardo Groisman, is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>The manuscript by Morth and colleagues describes a set of experiments that show several important findings on the biology and regulation of the phylogenetically widespread Mg<sup>2+</sup> transporter MgtA. The authors demonstrate that: 1) anionic phospholipids are required for the in vitro activity (i.e., ATPase) of the MgtA protein; 2) MgtA co-localizes with anionic phospholipids in the poles of <italic>E. coli</italic>; and 3) the activity of MgtA is highly sensitive to the concentration of free Mg<sup>2+</sup>. This manuscript is well written. Moreover, the authors are cautious by not making more claims than their data and the literature allows. Furthermore, their findings nicely complement and are in agreement with the current knowledge of how expression of the MgtA protein is regulated.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>The mechanism by which cardiolipin alters MgtA function is unclear. The authors should at least include the autophosphorylation mutant D373N in their imaging analyses presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>. Does phosphorylation affect co-localization with CL?</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.11407.022</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p> <italic>The mechanism by which cardiolipin alters MgtA function is unclear. The authors should at least include the autophosphorylation mutant D373N in their imaging analyses presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>. Does phosphorylation affect co-localization with CL?</italic></p><p>An additional experiment has been added to shed more light on the molecular interaction between MgtA and CL. To establish whether the head group or the fatty acid chain of CL was most important for MgtA function, we performed an ATPase assay as a function of CL extracted from bovine heart vs. <italic>E. coli</italic> CL. Both CL extractions share the same head group, however vary to a greater extent in their fatty acid composition. This experiment indicates that the head group primarily induced initial activation while the fatty acid chains affected the turnover number. Our observations are described in the section “The head group of CL plays a major role in MgtA activation” as well as in the Discussion. A graph that explains the effect of bovine heart CL has been added as <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref> and the P-type ATPase inhibitor profile, which was earlier in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> has been included as <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3</xref>.</p><p>As the reviewers suggested, we tested the localization of the non-phosphorylatable mutant D373N and observed that the mutant D373N showed similar localization profiles as wtMgtA. Both wtMgtA and the D373N mutant were found concentrated at the poles in <italic>E. coli</italic>. We conclude from this that active transport through MgtA does not affect the localization of MgtA. This imaging experiment was performed with MgtA tagged with GFP. The BFP tagged D373N mutant show much lower expression for unknown reasons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Author response image 1</xref>).<fig id="fig6" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.11407.020</object-id><label>Author response image 1.</label><caption><title>Overexpression of MgtA D373-BFP, and MgtA D373N-GFP in <italic>E. coli</italic> analysed by Western blotting.</title><p>Equivalently overexpressed C43(DE3) cells were normalized to OD<sub>600nm</sub> = 1 and 5µl of the cell lysate was used for western blotting.

Our results on the GFP tagged constructs are described under ‘MgtA colocalizes with cardiolipin domains at the poles of <italic>E. coli”</italic>’ and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>. We conclude from this study that wtMgtA and D373N show equivalent localization at the poles. However, we are not able to confirm that NAO colocalize with the polar distribution of the D373N mutant, as we cannot detect the D373N BFP-tagged construct in the fluorescence microscope.</p></body></sub-article></article>
