H3K4 methylation in yeast is catalyzed by Set1, the methyltransferase subunit of COMPASS. We report here the cryo-EM structure of a six-protein core COMPASS subcomplex, which can methylate H3K4 and be stimulated by H2B-Ub, bound to a ubiquitinated nucleosome. Our structure shows that COMPASS spans the face of the nucleosome, recognizing ubiquitin on one face of the nucleosome and methylating H3 on the opposing face. As compared to the structure of the isolated core complex, Set1 undergoes multiple structural rearrangements to cement interactions with the nucleosome and with ubiquitin. The critical Set1 RxxxRR motif adopts a helix that mediates bridging contacts between the nucleosome, ubiquitin and COMPASS. The structure provides a framework for understanding mechanisms of trans-histone cross-talk and the dynamic role of H2B ubiquitination in stimulating histone methylation.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>ubiquitin</kwd><kwd>histone methylation</kwd><kwd>chromatin</kwd><kwd>transcription</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>S. cerevisiae</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000057</institution-id><institution>National Institute of General Medical Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>GM130393</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Wolberger</surname><given-names>Cynthia</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100001021</institution-id><institution>Damon Runyon Cancer Research Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>DRG 2308-17</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Worden</surname><given-names>Evan J</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The structure of the COMPASS methyltransferase bound to an H2B-ubiquitinated nucleosome provides insights into mechanisms of trans-histone cross-talk and the dynamic role of H2B ubiquitination in stimulating histone methylation.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The histone proteins that package eukaryotic DNA into chromatin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Andrews and Luger, 2011</xref>) are subject to a huge variety of post-translational modifications that regulate chromatin structure, nucleosome positioning and protein recruitment, thereby playing a central role in regulating transcription (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Kouzarides, 2007</xref>). Methylation of histone H3 at lysine 4 (H3K4) is a mark of actively transcribed genes and is enriched in promoter regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Barski et al., 2007</xref>). H3K4 is methylated in yeast by the Set1 methyltransferase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Roguev et al., 2001</xref>), which can attach up to three methyl groups to the lysine ε-amino group (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Santos-Rosa et al., 2002</xref>), and in humans by the six related SET1/MLL family of methyltransferases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Meeks and Shilatifard, 2017</xref>).

Set1, which contains a conserved SET methyltransferase domain, is inactive on its own (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Avdic et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Dou et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Patel et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Southall et al., 2009</xref>). Multiple studies have identified a core subcomplex comprising Sdc1, Swd3, Swd1, Bre2 and Set1 which constitutes the minimal set of subunits required to support full Set1 methyltransferase activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Dou et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Patel et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Schneider et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Southall et al., 2009</xref>). This core subcomplex of COMPASS is highly conserved across all eukaryotes, with human WDR5/RbBP5/ASH2L/DPY30 corresponding to yeast Swd3/Swd1/Bre2/Sdc1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Miller et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Shilatifard, 2012</xref>). The ability of COMPASS activity to be fully stimulated on nucleosomes by H2B ubiquitination depends upon the presence of an additional COMPASS subunit, Spp1, as well as the RxxxRR motif in the N-set region of Set1 which is also referred to as the Arginine Rich Motif (ARM) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Hsu et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Kim et al., 2013</xref>). We refer to this core subcomplex plus Spp1 as the H2B-ubiquitin-sensing subcomplex.</p><p>Structural studies of the yeast core subcomplex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Hsu et al., 2018</xref>) and the H2B-ubiquitin-sensing subcomplex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Qu et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Takahashi et al., 2011</xref>) have shown that COMPASS adopts a Y-shaped, highly intertwined structure with the Set1 catalytic domain at its core. Furthermore, a recent structure of the related human MLL1 core complex bound to a ubiquitinated nucleosome revealed the underlying mechanisms of nucleosome recognition by human COMPASS-like complexes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Xue et al., 2019</xref>). In addition, a recent structure of the related COMPASS complex from <italic>K. Lactis</italic> has shown how COMPASS binds to a ubiquitinated nucleosome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Hsu et al., 2019</xref>). However, there is currently no structural information on how the full H2B-ubiquitin-sensing COMPASS subcomplex from <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> binds and recognizes the H2B-Ub containing nucleosome. We report here the 3.37 Å resolution cryo-EM structure of the H2B-Ub sensing COMPASS subcomplex from the yeast, <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic>, bound to an H2B-Ub nucleosome. The structure shows that COMPASS contains multiple structural elements that position the complex on the nucleosome disk though interactions with nucleosomal DNA and three of the core histones. The position of the Set1 catalytic domain suggests that COMPASS methylates H3K4 in an asymmetric manner by targeting H2B-Ub and H3K4 on opposite sides of the nucleosome. Structuring of a critical RxxxRR motif to form a helix enables the complex to associate with the nucleosome acidic patch, with the RxxxRR helix forming the bottom edge of an extended ubiquitin interaction crevice that underlies the structural basis of H2B-ubiquitin recognition by COMPASS. Comparison with other ubiquitin-activated methyltransferases shows that interactions with the H2B-linked ubiquitin are highly plastic and suggests how a single ubiquitin mark can be utilized by several different enzymes. Our findings shed light on the long-standing mystery of how H2B-Ub is recognized by COMPASS and provide the first example of trans-nucleosome histone crosstalk.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Architecture of the COMPASS H2B-Ub nucleosome complex</title><p>We determined the cryo-EM structure of the minimal, H2B-ubiquitin-sensing subcomplex of <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> COMPASS bound to a <italic>Xenopus laevis</italic> nucleosome core particle ubiquitinated at histone H2B K120 via a non-hydrolyzable dichloroacetone (DCA) linkage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Morgan et al., 2016</xref>). The ubiquitinated residue corresponds to K123 of yeast H2B. To drive tight association between COMPASS and the nucleosome, we utilized a variant of histone H3 in which K4 was substituted with the non-native amino acid, norleucine (Nle) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Worden et al., 2019</xref>). Lysine-to-norleucine mutations have been shown to greatly increase the affinity of SET-domain methyltransferases for their substrates in a S-adenosylmethionine (SAM)-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Jayaram et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Lewis et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Worden et al., 2019</xref>). To assess the gain in affinity imparted by the H3K4Nle substitution, we used gel mobility shift assays to measure binding of COMPASS to different nucleosome variants in the presence of SAM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). Surprisingly, COMPASS binds to unmodified and H2B-Ub nucleosomes with the same apparent affinity, indicating that H2B-Ub does not contribute significantly to the energy of COMPASS binding to the nucleosome (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). However, H2B-Ub nucleosomes that also contain the H3K4Nle mutant bind COMPASS with 2–5 fold higher affinity than unmodified nucleosomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>, compare the 0.125 µM lane for all samples). Methyltransferase activity assays on an H3 peptide fragment (residues 1–21) confirmed that the COMPASS was active (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>).

Compared to isolated <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> COMPASS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Qu et al., 2018</xref>), nucleosome-bound COMPASS flexes around the central Set1 catalytic domain and moves Swd3, Spp1 and Swd1 toward the nucleosome by ~36 Å (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1c</xref>). This movement allows Spp1 to bind the nucleosomal DNA, and allows Swd1 to interact with the histone core. Notably, a subset of particles in the cryo-EM structure of COMPASS in the absence of nucleosome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Qu et al., 2018</xref>) exhibited flexing about the same axis, although not to the extent observed here when COMPASS is bound to a nucleosome (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1c</xref>).

The intervening sequence of the H3 tail, from its exit point in the nucleosome (P38) to the first resolved residue in the Set1 active site (R8), is not visible in the maps, suggesting that these residues are highly mobile (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1b,d</xref>). To determine which copy of histone H3 was connected to the portion of the H3 tail bound to Set1, we compared the distance between the last H3 residue in the Set1 active site (R8) and the first H3 residue (P38) on each face of the nucleosome. The Set1 active site is positioned much closer to the exit point of the H3 subunit on the opposite face of the nucleosome (trans-H3,~35 Å) than to the exit point of the H3 subunit on the same side of the nucleosome (cis-H3,~88 Å, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1d</xref>). The 88 Å end-to-end distance between the exit point of cis-H3 and H3 in the Set1 active site is too long to be spanned by the intervening unstructured H3 tail residues given that an even greater distance (~100 Å) would be needed for the H3 residues to wrap around the nucleosomal DNA near the dyad axis. This arrangement therefore indicates that COMPASS methylates the nucleosome in an asymmetric manner by recognizing ubiquitin on one face of the nucleosome and targeting H3K4 on the opposite, trans-H3, face of the nucleosome.</p><p>COMPASS also interacts directly with the core histone proteins.

At one end of COMPASS, the nucleosomal DNA docks into a concave surface at the interface of Bre2 and Set1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2a,b</xref>). This concave surface is lined with several basic residues that can potentially contact the DNA. In particular, Bre2 K318 is in a position to interact directly with the sugar-phosphate backbone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2b</xref>). We note that we did not observe clear sidechain density for Bre2 K318, so the position of this sidechain is inferred from the conformation of the protein backbone. Set1 residues R1034, K1029 and K1026 are also located at this interface (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2b</xref>) but are too far away to directly contact the DNA. Instead, these basic residues likely serve to increase the local positive charge of the concave DNA binding surface. On the opposing edge of the nucleosome, COMPASS contacts the DNA at two distinct interfaces mediated by Spp1 and Swd1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2c,d</xref>). Fragmented density connecting Spp1 and the nucleosomal DNA corresponds to a loop in Spp1 that is disordered in our structure (residues 241–261). This Spp1 loop (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2c</xref>) contains a patch of positively-charged amino acids (KRKKKK) that likely interact with the negatively charged DNA backbone and major groove. Swd1 interacts with the nucleosomal DNA using two highly conserved basic resides, R236 and K266, which emanate from loops in blade 5 of the Swd1 WD40 domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2d</xref>). Substitution of Swd1 K266 with an alanine decreased H3K4 di- and tri-methylation in yeast (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3c–d</xref>), indicating that the loss of even a single DNA contact can impair COMPASS function. As discussed further below, this region of Swd1 is highly conserved and also mediates contacts between Swd1 and the core histone octamer, making this part of Swd1 a highly utilized surface for COMPASS interaction with the nucleosome.</p><p>Importantly, similar interactions between these COMPASS subunits (Bre2, Spp1 and Swd1) and nucleosomal DNA have recently been observed in the human MLL1 complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Xue et al., 2019</xref>) and the <italic>K. lactis</italic> COMPASS complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Hsu et al., 2019</xref>), indicating that these DNA interactions are critical for COMPASS function and are highly conserved.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>A conserved loop in Swd1 contacts the core histone octamer</title><p>The structure reveals that Swd1 contains two loops that interact with three different histones in the nucleosome core (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3a</xref>). Swd1 Loop 1 connects β21 and β22, and, along with the edge of β-strand 25, embraces the H2B C-terminal helix, ɑ4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3a</xref>). At the tip of L, V263 and I264 insert into a small hydrophobic crevice at the three-helix interface consisting of H2B helices, ɑ3 and ɑ4, and H2A ɑ3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3a,b</xref>). This hydrophobic crevice includes H2A Y50, and H2B V118, which are in van der Waals contact with Swd1 V263 and I264. In addition to the hydrophobic interactions in L, Swd1 N265 is positioned close to H2B Q95, potentially forming a hydrogen bond and further stabilizing the Loop 1 interaction with the histone core (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3b</xref>). To assess the importance of the interaction between Swd1 Loop 1 and the H2A/H2B hydrophobic crevice, we examined the effects of alanine substitutions on histone H3K4 methylation in <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic>. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3c</xref>, the substitution with the greatest effect was Swd1 I264A, which completely abolished H3K4 di- and tri-methylation and greatly reduced H3K4 mono-methylation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3c,d</xref>). I264 is positioned in the center of the H2A/H2B hydrophobic crevice and the strong defect in H3K4 methylation seen for the I264A mutation indicates that this interaction is critical for COMPASS activity in vivo. The V263A mutant slightly decreased H3K4 di- and tri-methylation, but did not change H3K4 mono-methylation, whereas an N265A mutation had no effect (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3c,d</xref>). We note that it is not possible to determine from these data if the changes in the relative H3K4 mono-, di- and tri-methylation levels in the COMPASS mutants are caused by altered product specificity, or slower enzyme turnover. Loop 1 is highly conserved (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>) and the residues that correspond to V263 and I264 are always hydrophobic in character, indicating that that the interaction we observe between Loop 1 and the histone octamer is structurally conserved among Swd1 homologs. Indeed, the human MLL1 core complex subunit, Rbbp5, binds to the histone octamer using a similar interface (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Xue et al., 2019</xref>) and another recent study reports that the <italic>K. lactis</italic> COMPASS complex Swd1 subunit also utilizes the hydrophobic cleft interface in a similar manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Hsu et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>In addition to Swd1 L, Loop 2 connects β-strands β23 and β24 and is oriented toward the histone H3 ɑ2-ɑ3 loop and histone H4 ɑ3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3b</xref>). At the tip of Loop 2, S289 forms a hydrogen bond with H3 K79. As compared to L, Loop 2 is not well conserved (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>) and the contact it makes with H3K79 is not recapitulated in other COMPASS-like complexes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Xue et al., 2019</xref>). Taken together, these results show that the interaction between Swd1 and the nucleosome is conserved from yeast to humans and is critical for COMPASS function in vivo.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>The Set1 RxxxRR motif forms an adaptor helix that bridges the nucleosome acidic patch and ubiquitin</title><p>The arginine-rich RxxxRR motif in the N-set region of Set1 is critical for stimulation of methyltransferase activity by H2B ubiquitination and mutants in this motif impair COMPASS activity in yeast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Kim et al., 2013</xref>). Our structure reveals the critical role that the RxxxRR motif plays in COMPASS interactions with both the nucleosome and ubiquitin. In isolated yeast COMPASS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Qu et al., 2018</xref>), the RxxxRR motif is disordered. When bound to the H2B-Ub nucleosome, Set1 residues 897–921 become ordered, forming a long helix that passes underneath COMPASS and makes extensive contacts with the nucleosome acidic patch (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4a–e</xref>), as well as with the H2B-linked ubiquitin (see below). The RxxxRR helix docks on the nucleosome surface parallel to the C-terminal helix ɑ4 of histone H2B, positioning multiple arginine residues opposite the negatively charged residues of H2A that make up the acidic patch (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4d,e</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1—figure supplement 4</xref>). Residues in the Set1 RxxxRR helix form several specific electrostatic interactions with acidic patch residues: R908 is in a position to contact H2A residue E56 and H2B E113, R904 contacts H2A residue E61 and E64 and R901 contacts H2A residues D90 and E92 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4d,e</xref>). The extensive electrostatic network mediated by the RxxxRR helix is flanked by interactions between Set1 R936 and H2A D72 on one side and between R909 and H2B S112 on the other. We note, however, that there is no clear sidechain density for R909 in our structure, so the contact between R909 and S112 is inferred from the conformation of the backbone. Interestingly, the RxxxRR motif is conserved in human Set1 orthologs, but not in the human paralogs MLL1-4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>) which have recently been shown not to bind the nucleosome acidic patch (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Xue et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>In addition to formation of the RxxxRR helix, nucleosome binding is accompanied by a profound restructuring of Set1 ɑ-helix, 926–933, which unravels and forms an extended strand that lies parallel to the RxxxRR helix (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4f</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1—figure supplement 4</xref>). This extended strand lies along the histone core, orienting R936 toward the nucleosome surface (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4d,f</xref>). The conformational change in this region of Set1 alleviates what would otherwise be steric clash between the N-terminus of the helix formed by these residues in uncomplexed (Apo) COMPASS.</p><p>Previous mutagenesis studies of the N-set region of yeast Set1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Kim et al., 2013</xref>) showed that a combined R909, R908 and R904 triple mutant abolished COMPASS activity <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic>. Furthermore, a large-scale alanine screen of histone residues in yeast previously determined that residues in the H2A/H2B acidic patch are required for H3K4 methylation by COMPASS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Nakanishi et al., 2008</xref>). To assess the contribution of individual Set1 amino acids to H3K4 methylation by COMPASS <italic>in vivo</italic>, we generated yeast strains in which a <italic>set</italic>1 deletion was complemented with mutant <italic>set</italic>1 containing point mutations designed to disrupt interactions with the nucleosome acidic patch. As compared to wild-type, R936A and R936E Set1 mutations both reduced H3K4 methylation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4g,h</xref>). The charge reversal mutation, R936E, was more severe and almost entirely abolished di- and tri-methylation by COMPASS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4g,h</xref>). Individual alanine substitutions of R901A, R904A and R901A reduced mono-methylation by COMPASS and abolished di-, and tri-methylation. The R909A mutation, which does not form electrostatic contacts with the acidic patch, greatly reduced di-and tri-methylation. As expected, the quadruple mutant R901A, R904A, R908A and R909A (4R-&gt;4A) completely abolished all methylation of H3K4. Charge reversal mutants R901E, R904E, R908E, R909E and the quadruple 4R-&gt;4E mutants all abolished H3K4 methylation, expect for R909E, which retained some residual H3K4 mono-methylation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4g,h</xref>).

The I44 patch contact is flanked by electrostatic interactions between Swd1 E14 and Ub R42 on one side, and between Swd1 E397 and Ub K48 on the other (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6b</xref>).</p><p>In addition to the I44 patch contacts, Set1 contacts the hydrophobic ‘I36 patch’ of ubiquitin consisting of I36, L71 and L73 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6b,f</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Komander and Rape, 2012</xref>). While the I36 patch of ubiquitin is not as widely utilized by ubiquitin-binding proteins, it is also used by the Dot1L methyltransferase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5c</xref>). At the end of the RxxxRR helix Ub L73 contacts I914 and the aliphatic portion of N917 through van der Waals interactions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6b</xref>). The importance of the L73 contact is supported by previous in vitro studies showing that ubiquitin residues, L71 and L73, are critical for ubiquitin- dependent COMPASS activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Holt et al., 2015</xref>). Finally, Set1 L928 inserts into a small hydrophobic pocket within ubiquitin and likely interacts with ubiquitin I13, I36, T7 and the aliphatic portion of K11 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6f</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1—figure supplement 4</xref>). However, this region of the map does not show clear sidechain density for Set1 L928, so the position of the L928 sidechain is inferred from the conformation of the protein backbone.</p><p>To assess the contribution of interfacial Swd1 residues in ubiquitin-dependent H3K4 methylation in vivo, we generated <italic>swd</italic>1 deletion yeast strains expressing mutant Swd1 and measured the effects on H3K4 methylation. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6g–h</xref>, the Swd1 L12A mutation completely abolished H3K4 methylation by COMPASS in vivo, indicating that the interaction between this Swd1 residue and Ub I44 is critical to COMPASS function. Swd1 E14A and E14R mutations both greatly decreased H3K4 di- and tri-methylation and also reduced H3K4 mono-methylation to an intermediate level (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6g,h</xref>). Unsurprisingly, a Swd1 F9A, L12A and E14A triple mutant (FLE) completely abolished H3K4 methylation. Finally, the E397R mutation, which lies on the periphery of the ubiquitin interaction, modestly reduced all methylation states of H3K4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6g,h</xref>). Together, these data show that the contacts observed between COMPASS and the H2B-linked ubiquitin are critical to activate COMPASS for H3K4 methylation.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Our structure reveals the basis of crosstalk between H2B-ubiquitination and H3K4 methylation by <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> COMPASS and shows that it methylates its target lysine in an asymmetric manner by recognizing the H2B-Ub and H3K4 on opposite sides of the nucleosome (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1d</xref>). This asymmetric recognition is distinct from the H3K79 methyltransferase, Dot1L, which is also stimulated by H2B-Ub but which methylates H3 on the same, cis-H3, side of the nucleosome (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5c</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Anderson et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Valencia-Sánchez et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Worden et al., 2019</xref>). To our knowledge, the asymmetric recognition of H2B-Ub and H3K4 by COMPASS and COMPASS-related complexes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Hsu et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Xue et al., 2019</xref>) is the first example of trans-nucleosome histone crosstalk. This observation highlights the importance of asymmetry in histone modifications. Previous studies have shown that ‘repressive’ H3K27 tri-methyl and ‘active’ H3K4 tri-methyl marks can be deposited asymmetrically in the same nucleosome, but on opposite H3 tails (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Voigt et al., 2012</xref>). This asymmetric, bivalent modification of H3K27 and H3K4 is believed to be associated with maintaining promoters in a poised state during differentiation. Our structure provides a mechanistic framework to understand how asymmetric nucleosome modifications can be read out and deposited during histone crosstalk.</p><p>Compared with other histone modifications such as methylation and acetylation, ubiquitination is a large, highly complex mark that presents a chemically rich interaction surface to potential binding partners and also decompacts chromatin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Fierz et al., 2011</xref>). In addition, because it is conjugated to the nucleosome through its flexible C-terminus, ubiquitin can adopt a range of orientations on the nucleosome, enabling even greater complexity it its recognition. Several structures now exist of H2B-Ub-activated methyltransferases bound to ubiquitinated nucleosomes, which reveal highly divergent strategies for ubiquitin recognition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). The distinct ubiquitin binding modes employed by COMPASS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Hsu et al., 2019</xref>) (this study), Dot1L (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Anderson et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Valencia-Sánchez et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Worden et al., 2019</xref>) and the MLL1 core complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Xue et al., 2019</xref>) reveal a striking plasticity in how ubiquitin is able to interact with and activate these different histone methyltransferases. The high complexity of the ubiquitin mark likely enables H2B-Ub to communicate with these different enzymatic complexes and template the deposition of ‘activating’ marks during transcription. The size of ubiquitin might also impose a significant steric obstacle that could inhibit the activity of enzymes which do not directly recognize the ubiquitin. Indeed, H2B-Ub may even impose a steric barrier to the transcriptional machinery as evidenced by the observation that efficient transcription elongation requires removal of H2B-Ub (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Wyce et al., 2007</xref>).</p><p>Our structure suggests a mechanism by which H2B-Ub stimulates COMPASS to methylate H3K4. Compared to the nucleosome-free <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> COMPASS structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Qu et al., 2018</xref>) and the structure of <italic>Kluyveromyces lactis</italic> COMPASS bound to an H3 peptide and SAM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Hsu et al., 2018</xref>), there are no discernable conformational changes in the Set1 catalytic domain that could explain how H2B-Ub stimulates methylation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>). It is notable that, for both COMPASS and Dot1L, the presence of ubiquitin conjugated to H2B does not appear to increase affinity of the enzyme for the nucleosome (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Worden et al., 2019</xref>). The lack of a discernable effect on binding energy suggests that ubiquitin binding primarily affects catalytic activation and, in the case of Dot1L, has been shown to increase k<sub>cat</sub> but not K<sub>M</sub> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">McGinty et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Worden et al., 2019</xref>). Alternatively, It has been suggested that ubiquitin activates Dot1L by using its binding energy to pay the energetic cost of inducing a conformational change in the globular core of histone H3, thereby inserting K79 into the Dot1L active site (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Worden et al., 2019</xref>). We speculate that H2B-Ub may similarly activate COMPASS by providing the binding energy needed to induce the disordered Set1 RxxxRR motif to form a helix that mediates contacts with the nucleosome. Ubiquitin binding may also compensate for the energetic cost of inducing the Set1 helix, 326–331, to unravel and form an extended β-strand that buttresses the RxxxRR helix and the catalytic domain of Set1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). Our structure provides a basis for further elucidating the role that H2B ubiquitination plays in stimulating histone methyltransferase activity.</p></sec><sec id="s4"

A total of three technical replicates were analyzed from the same yeast growth.</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>COMPASS activity assay</title><p>A 2x concentrated 2-fold dilution series of COMPASS (2560 µM – 40 nM) was prepared in reaction buffer (20 mM HEPES pH 7.5, 100 mM NaCl, 1 mM DTT, 0.2 mg/ml BSA). To initiate the reaction, 6 ul of each 2x stock of COMPASS was added to 6 ul of 500 µM H3 peptide (residues 1–21) dissolved in reaction buffer that either contained 500 uM SAM or contained no SAM. The reaction was allowed progress at 25°C for 35 min and then the reaction was quenched by the addition of 3 ul 0.5% trifluoroacetic acid (TFA). 10 ul of the quenched reaction was transferred to a microplate and the amount of S-adenosyl homocysteine (SAH) was quantified using the MTase-Glo assay (Promega) according to the manufacture’s instructions. Raw luminescence values were measured on a POLARstar Omega fluorescence plate reader (BMG Labtech).</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>Cryo EM sample preparation</title><p>A 2.44 ml volume of 300 nM COMPASS, 100 nM of nucleosome containing H2B-Ub and H3K4Nle, and 200 µM SAM was prepared in crosslinking buffer (25 mM HEPES pH7.5, 100 mM NaCl, 1 mM DTT). The sample was incubated on ice for 30 min and then mixed with 2.44 ml of 0.14% glutaraldehyde to initiate crosslinking. The crosslinking reaction progressed on ice and was quenched after one hour by the addition of 1 M Tris pH 7.5 to a final concentration of 100 mM. The reaction was incubated for 1 hr on ice and then concentrated to ~50 µl using an Amicon Ultra 30K MWCO spin concentrator. The concentration of the complex was determined using the absorption at 260 nm of the 601 nucleosome DNA. Quantifoil R2/2 grids were glow discharged for 45 s at 15 mA using a Pelco Easyglow glow discharger. A volume of 3 µl of 0.5 mg/ml crosslinked sample was added to the glow-discharged grids and flash frozen in liquid ethane using a Vitrobot (Thermo Fisher) at 4°<sup>C</sup> and 100% humidity with a 3.5 s blot time.</p></sec><sec id="s4-10"><title>EM data collection and refinement</title><p>All data were collected at the National Cryo-Electron Microscopy Facility (NCEF) at the National Cancer Institute on a Titan Krios (Thermo-Fisher) at 300 kV utilizing a K3 (Gatan) direct electron detector in counting-mode with at a nominal magnification of 81,000 and a pixel size of 1.08 Å. Data were collected at a nominal dose of 50 e<sup>-</sup>/Å<sup>2</sup> with 40 frames per movie and 1.25 e<sup>-</sup>/frame. A total of 5784 movies were collected.</p><p>The dataset was processed in Relion 3.0 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Zivanov et al., 2018</xref>). All movies were motion-corrected and dose-weighted using the Relion 3.0 implementation of MotionCorr2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Zivanov et al., 2018</xref>). An initial batch of 500 micrographs were randomly selected and used to pick 315,372 particles using the Laplacian of gaussian auto-picking feature. After 3 rounds of 2D-classification to remove junk particles, 216,107 particles were used for 3D classification. A single good class of 79,832 particles was refined and used as a model for template-based picking on the entire dataset, resulting in 2,036,654 particles. The particles were extracted and binned by a factor of 4. 1,357,004 particles were retained after 2D classification and used for 3D classification with six classes. Three classes emerged from the 3D classification which seemed to have a well resolved COMPASS on at least one side of the nucleosome. These three classes (1103264 particles) were merged and subjected to another round of 3D classification with four classes using a mask that encompassed the nucleosome and one COMPASS molecule. Two of the resulting Classes appeared to have high resolution features, were merged (650847 particles) and subjected to 3D refinement using the same mask that encompassed the nucleosome and COMPASS. After refinement the particles were reextracted at full resolution and refined again using the same mask. The unbinned particle stack was subjected beam tilt correction and per-particle contrast transfer function (CTF) estimation in Relion 3.0. The final particle stack was then subjected to masked refinement using the same mask that was used in the previous masked refinement and classification steps. The final structure was sharpened using the Relion postprocessing tool with a soft mask that encompassed the more well resolved COMPASS molecule and the nucleosome. A sharpening B-factor of −122.6 Å<sup>2</sup> was applied. The final resolution of the COMPASS-nucleosome structure is 3.37 Å according to the Fourier shell correlation (FSC) 0.143 criterion.</p></sec><sec id="s4-11"><title>Model building and refinement</title><p>Coordinates for the <italic>Xenopus laevis</italic> nucleosome core particle (PBD: 6NJ9), <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> Spp1, and the N-set domain of Set1 (PDB: 6B × 3) were docked into the EM density using Chimera. Crystal structures of <italic>Kluyveromyces lactis</italic> Sdc1, Swd3, Swd1, Bre2 and the Set1 catalytic domain (PDB: 6CHG) fit the EM density better than the existing cryo-electron microscopy structures (PDB: 6B × 3) of <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> Sdc1 (25% identity, 67% in modeled area), Swd3 (50% identity), Swd1 (50% identity), Bre2 (42% Identity) and Set1 (41% identity, 86% in modeled area). Therefore, homology models of <italic>K. lactis</italic> Sdc1, Swd3, Swd1, Bre2 and the Set1 catalytic domain were prepared using the Swiss-model software and docked into the EM density using Chimera. The resulting model was iteratively refined in Phenix (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Afonine et al., 2018</xref>) using reference restraints for Ubiquitin, the Set1 N-set domain, Spp1, Bre2 and the Sdc1 dimer (from PDBs 1UBQ, 6B × 3 and 6CHG) and edited in COOT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Emsley et al., 2010</xref>). The model was refined against the full map and any overfitting of the model was assessed by calculating the model-map FSC between the refined model and the sharpened, masked half-maps (Half one and Half 2) that were filtered to the FSC = 0.143 resolution cutoff for each half map (3.96 Å). The model-map FSCs of the two half maps agree well indicating that there is little overfitting of the model. Furthermore, the FSC = 0.5 resolution estimate of the model/map (Full) does not exceed the calculated map resolution, indicating that the model is not overfit.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"> <title>Acknowledgements</title> <p>This research was supported, in part, by the National Cancer Institute’s National Cryo-EM Facility at the Frederick National Laboratory for Cancer Research under contract HSSN261200800001E.

by which the COMPASS complex recognizes the H2B-ubiquitinated nucleosome. During the revision, the authors improved the resolution of the cryo-EM structure of a complex of <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> COMPASS with H2B-Ub nucleosome. The structure reveals the overall organization of the complex, including the mechanism of recognizing ubiquitin and selection of the trans H3 histone K4 for modification. As we noted earlier, what makes this paper have high potential impact is not only the structural information, but the in vivo work that complements the structure. Overall, the experiments are of high technical quality.</p><p><bold>Decision letter after peer review:</bold></p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Structural basis for COMPASS recognition of an H2B-ubiquitinated nucleosome&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been very favorably reviewed by three peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by John Kuriyan as the Reviewing and Senior Editor. The following individuals involved in review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Christopher P Hill (Reviewer #1); Karolin Luger (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Review:</p><p>Worden et al. have written a beautiful paper describing the structure and the underlying mechanism by which the COMPASS complex recognizes the H2B-ubiquitinated nucleosome. The cryo-EM structure of a complex of <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> COMPASS with H2B-Ub nucleosome is reported at about 4Å resolution. The structure reveals the overall organization of the complex, including the mechanism of recognizing ubiquitin and selection of the trans H3 histone K4 for modification. What makes this paper such high potential impact is not only the structural information, but the in vivo work that complements the structure. Overall, the experiments are of high technical quality.</p><p>Previous genetic data and biochemical data here strongly validate the structural model presented. The model certainly helps understand, but does not completely explain, the requirement H2B-Ub for K4 methylation. Interestingly, it's shown that H2B-Ub does not increase COMPASS-nucleosome affinity or alter the catalytic site, but it does induce some rearrangements in regions of Set1 around the active site. A paper in press at Molecular Cell (here cited as a bioRxiv preprint from Hsu et al.) presents a very similar structure for the <italic>K. lactis</italic> COMPASS, so this paper is very timely and should be published rapidly.</p><p>The reviewers have raised several questions or concerns. We are not asking for additional experimental work to be done, but please address these points in a revised manuscript.</p><p>Nomenclature:</p><p>1) Please note that the &quot;CPS&quot; gene names used by Shilatifard are not the standard names agreed to and commonly used by the yeast community (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.yeastgenome.org">www.yeastgenome.org</ext-link>). I would encourage the authors to switch to the standard names, but at the very least they need to include the translations (i.e. Cps60/Bre2, Cps50/Swd1, etc) when first introducing the proteins.</p><p>2) People interested in this paper will also read the Hsu paper and other structural studies of the Set1/MLL complexes. Many of those papers refer to the RXR as the ARM (Arginine Rich Motif), so it would be good to mention that early on to help readers make comparisons.</p><p>3) Introduction paragraph three. Please define the difference between &quot;core&quot; and &quot;H2B-Ub-sensing&quot; subcomplexes, as this isn't obvious, even to somebody reasonably familiar with COMPASS.</p><p>4) Subsection “COMPASS interacts with DNA using three distinct interfaces”, last sentence in the first paragraph: &quot;Hotspot&quot; is probably not the appropriate term here.</p><p>Other points:</p><p>5) A recent paper from Chaudhury et al. (G+D 2019) presented evidence suggesting dimerization of COMPASS, with the two complexes enclosing the nucleosome. Their model looks incompatible with the data presented here. Could the authors comment on this here or in the Discussion where they discuss asymmetrical modifications?</p><p>6) Results section, Figures 2, 3, 6. At several points in the paper, the authors propose specific inter-subunit side chain interactions based on what appears (in the figures) to be weak density data, and some of the predicted mutants in these residues have very little effect. The overall resolution of the cryo-EM data is not that high, and much of the model is based on docking in other structures (including from another species), so one needs to be careful about overstating conclusions. Perhaps the authors could make clear which contacts are unambiguous and which are more speculation.</p><p>7) Given the other paper in press on the <italic>K. lactis</italic> COMPASS, there were a few lines that didn't seem quite right. In the Introduction, it's strange to say there is &quot;currently no structural information&quot; about COMPASS/H2B-Ub when you cite the Hsu 2019 pre-print in other parts of the paper. The Discussion section should also reference the new Hsu 2019 paper along with &quot;this study&quot;. The two papers are nicely complementary and contemporaneous, so the authors might as well be generous in giving credit where it's due.</p><p>8) Are data available to demonstrate that the COMPASS complex used in this study is catalytically active? It would be good to know the catalytic efficiency in methylation. While authors show that COMPASS can bind to both H2B-Ub and unmodified H2B nucleosomes, they do not reveal if both can activate. This is interesting because, as seen in Xue et al., 2019, the human MLL1 complex is stabilized by the H2B-Ub nucleosome in a favorable conformation that promotes H3K4 methylation. It might be worth doing biochemical assays to see how this ubiquitination is conserved amongst paralogs, and to what extent it promotes activity.</p><p>9) While the western blots are discussed well throughout the paper, there are concerns with quantification. The authors discuss how mutations lead to decrease of H3K4 methylation patterns, but nowhere are the western blots quantified (with error bars) to show how much difference there is between mutants (and replicates). Therefore, western blots should be quantified. Furthermore, these western blots should have a control (such as GAPDH) in all lanes to indicate differences in mutants is not simply a gel-loading difference. In addition to quantifying western blots, the EMSA done in Figure 1—figure supplement 1 comparing nucleosome binding should also be quantified and fit to a binding-curve to provide better comparisons.</p><p>10) It is interesting that COMPASS can do H3K4 mono-, di-, and tri-methylation, while the human paralog MLL3 primarily does mono-methylation and MLL1 primarily does di- and tri-methylation. In agreement with the importance of this, certain mutations from this study show differences in methylation states, indicating the mechanism of mono-, di-, and tri-methylation may have some underlying differences. The differences in methylation states should be discussed for the mutants.</p><p>11) Please provide more information on DNA used (both sequence and length).</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.53199.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The reviewers have raised several questions or concerns.

Could the authors comment on this here or in the Discussion where they discuss asymmetrical modifications?</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewers for pointing out this interesting paper and agree that their model is incompatible with our structure. We note that we do not find the data definitive regarding whether COMPASS dimerizes and whether the lower molecular weight complex observed in the sdc1 deletions and mutants indeed represents a COMPASS monomer. Neither this manuscript nor previous citations in the support of COMPASS dimerization include experiments such as sec-mals, mass spec or centrifugation that would be needed to determine the composition of the complexes that migrate on a size exclusion column with an apparent molecular weight of 1MDa or 400kDa, which are identified as dimeric or monomeric COMPASS, respectively. This then raises questions on how to interpret the observed differences in H3K4 methylation patterns observed in vivo. We feel that most of the effects shown for the Sdc1 deletion and mutation studies could be explained by the overall lower activity of COMPASS in these mutants (see Figure 2 in the Chaudhury paper). Rather than bringing up questions about the validity of this paper we prefer not to comment on the results as we have many issues regarding the authors interpretation of their data.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) Results section, Figures 2, 3, 6.

We are excited to report that our new approach increased the average resolution of the map from 3.9 Å to 3.37 Å. This increase in resolution also resulted in a more featured map, so many contacts that were not supported by strong sidechain density now have clear sidechain density or sidechain bumps that support our conclusions. We have updated all the figures with the new map and model and have prepared a new supplemental figure (Figure 1—figure supplement 4) that gives more detailed views and density for the reported contact surfaces. We have also updated the text to specifically state potential contacts that are not supported by clear density.</p><p>“We note that we did not observe clear sidechain density for Bre2 K318, so the position of this sidechain is inferred from the conformation of the protein backbone.”</p><p>“We note, however, that there is no clear sidechain density for R909 in our structure, so the contact between R909 and S112 is inferred from the conformation of the backbone”</p><p>“However, this region of the map does not show clear sidechain density for Set1 L928, so the position of the L928 sidechain is inferred from the conformation of the protein backbone.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7) Given the other paper in press on the K. lactis COMPASS, there were a few lines that didn't seem quite right.

We have also included a new sentence in the Results first paragraph that describes the activity of COMPASS on the H3 peptide. We also note that there is substantial supporting literature that clearly shows the native COMPASS complex, and also the specific subcomplex used in our study, is stimulated by H2B-ub both in vivo and in vitro (Dover et al., 2002; Hsu et al., 2019; Kim et al., 2013; Sun and Allis, 2002). Since it has been shown previously that this specific subcomplex of COMPASS is robustly stimulated by H2B, it is our opinion that showing this again would not add to the conclusions of the paper.</p><p>In relation to the comparison with MLL, we feel that an entire biochemical characterization of the differences between the Set1 and MLL complexes on H2B-Ub stimulation would be beyond the scope of this study.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>9) While the western blots are discussed well throughout the paper, there are concerns with quantification.

In addition, we quantified the intensity of the western blot signal for each replicate and have included bar graphs in Figures 3, 4 and 6 that show the average intensity of the western signal for each sample as a percent of WT. This analysis has not changed any of the conclusions from our manuscript.</p><p>We attempted to quantify the binding affinity of COMPASS to the unmodified, H2B-Ub and H2B-Ub + H3K4Nle nucleosomes, however only the Nle-containing nucleosomes produced a curve that could be fit to a binding isotherm. This is because binding of the unmodified and H2B-Ub nucleosome samples appears to change linearly over the concentration range tested and could therefore not be fit. We have included our binding analysis in Figure 1—figure supplement 1 and also added text that clarifies how to compare the different EMSAs in Figure 1—figure supplement 1.</p><p>“However, H2B-Ub nucleosomes that also contain the H3K4Nle mutant bind COMPASS with 2-5 fold higher affinity than unmodified nucleosomes (Figure 1—figure supplement 1, compare the 0.125 µM lane for all samples)”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>10) It is interesting that COMPASS can do H3K4 mono-, di-, and tri-methylation, while the human paralog MLL3 primarily does mono-methylation and MLL1 primarily does di- and tri-methylation. In agreement with the importance of this, certain mutations from this study show differences in methylation states, indicating the mechanism of mono-, di-, and tri-methylation may have some underlying differences. The differences in methylation states should be discussed for the mutants.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that the different product specificities between the Set1 COMPASS complexes and the MLL complexes are very important. However, because our western blot analyses are simply reading out the steady-state levels of H3K4 methylation in vivo, it is impossible to determine if the differences we observe are due to altered product specificities of COMPASS or simply slower enzyme turnover. Given that Set1/COMPASS is probably a distributive enzyme, like MLL1 and Dot1L (Frederiks et al., 2008; Patel et al., 2009), a slower enzyme turnover would result in an altered distribution of methylation states. To determine if the mutations are actually changing the product specificity of COMPASS, we would need to purify the mutant complexes and measure their product preferences in vitro, which we feel is beyond the scope of our study. To address the differences we see in the distribution of H3K4 methylation for our COMPASS mutants, we have added a sentence which points out that the actual cause of the change in methylation is uncertain.</p><p>“We note that it is not possible to determine from these data if the changes in the relative H3K4 mono-, di- and tri-methylation levels in the COMPASS mutants are caused by altered product specificity, or slower enzyme turnover.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>11) Please provide more information on DNA used (both sequence and length).</p></disp-quote><p>We have added a section to the Materials and methods describing the DNA used in the nucleosome reconstitution.</p><p>“Purification of 601 DNA</p><p>The pST55-16x601 plasmid was a generous gift from Dr. Song Tan (Makde et al., 2010).
