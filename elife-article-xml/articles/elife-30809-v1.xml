To test the role of microglia in these processes during adulthood, we examined the effects of microglia depletion, via treatment of mice with the CSF-1 receptor antagonist PLX5622, and abrogated neuronal-microglial communication in CX3C receptor-1 deficient (<italic>Cx3cr1<sup>−/−</sup></italic>) mice. Microglia depletion significantly lowered spine density in young (developing) but not mature adult-born-granule-cells (abGCs) in the olfactory bulb. Two-photon time-lapse imaging indicated that microglia depletion reduced spine formation and elimination. Functionally, odor-evoked responses of mitral cells, which are normally inhibited by abGCs, were increased in microglia-depleted mice. In <italic>Cx3cr1<sup>−/−</sup></italic> mice, abGCs exhibited reduced spine density, dynamics and size, concomitantly with reduced contacts between <italic>Cx3cr1</italic>-deficient microglia and abGCs' dendritic shafts, along with increased proportion of microglia-contacted spines. Thus, during adult neurogenesis, microglia regulate the elimination (pruning), formation, and maintenance of synapses on newborn neurons, contributing to the functional integrity of the olfactory bulb circuitry.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>adult neruogenesis</kwd><kwd>synapses</kwd><kwd>microglia</kwd><kwd>olfactory bulb</kwd><kwd>spines</kwd><kwd>development</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100003977</institution-id><institution>Israel Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>FIRST Program. 1357/13</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Yirmiya</surname><given-names>Raz</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100003977</institution-id><institution>Israel Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Grant No. 1379/16</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Yirmiya</surname><given-names>Raz</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100003977</institution-id><institution>Israel Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Grant No. 1284/10</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Mizrahi</surname><given-names>Adi</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>During adult neurogenesis in the olfactory bulb, microglia regulate the elimination (pruning), formation, and maintenance of synapses on newborn neurons, contributing to the functional integrity of the olfactory bulb circuitry.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Over the past decade it became evident that microglia play crucial roles in the regulation of synaptic processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Tremblay et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Wake et al., 2013</xref>), with important implications to normal behavior and to neuro- and psycho-pathology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Yirmiya and Goshen, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Prinz and Priller, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Chung et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Yirmiya et al., 2015</xref>). During the early postnatal brain development period, microglia were found to be important for synapse development. For example, in the developing retino-geniculate system, microglia in the dorsal Lateral Geniculate Nucleus (dLGN) prune pre-synaptic terminals of the incoming retinal ganglion cells axons, contributing to the segregation of inputs into eye-specific territories (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Schafer et al., 2012</xref>). One molecular system underlying neuronal-microglial interactions involves the microglial CX3C receptor-1 (CX3CR1) and its neuronally-derived CX3C Ligand-1 (CX3CL1) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Jung et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Paolicelli et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Pagani et al., 2015</xref>) During early postnatal development, CX3CR1 signaling plays a critical role in synaptic pruning. Specifically, mice with <italic>Cx3cr1</italic> deletion (<italic>Cx3cr1<sup>−/−</sup></italic> mice) exhibit reduced dendritic spine pruning, abnormal synapse maturation, decreased functional connectivity and behavioral abnormalities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Paolicelli et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Zhan et al., 2014</xref>). During adulthood, microglia are involved in pruning of synapses on mature neurons. For example, following sensory (olfactory) deprivation, dopaminergic neuron synapses are eliminated from the olfactory bulb (OB) via a mechanism that involves altered interactions between neurons and microglial processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Grier et al., 2016</xref>). Moreover, microglial depletion induces an increase in spine density in the hippocampal CA1 area (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Rice et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>In the adult brain, new neurons are constantly added to the hippocampus and the OB circuits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Lledo et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Gould, 2007</xref>). In the OB, this developmental process was found to be accompanied by highly dynamic synapse formation and pruning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Mizrahi, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Livneh et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Livneh and Mizrahi, 2012</xref>). This remodeling process allows newborn OB cells to influence neuronal circuits and behavior. For example, adult-born Granule Cells (abGCs) inhibit and sharpen the responsiveness of mitral cells (the principal OB output cells) to odors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Egger and Urban, 2006</xref>), and contribute to odor discrimination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abraham et al., 2010</xref>).</p><p>Microglia were found to play a global role in adult neurogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Ziv and Schwartz, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Ekdahl, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Gemma and Bachstetter, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Sierra et al., 2014</xref>), by phagocytosing apoptotic newborn cells under normal physiological conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Sierra et al., 2010</xref>), facilitating the increased neurogenesis induced by rearing in an enriched environment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Ziv et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Maggi et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Reshef et al., 2014</xref>), and decreasing neurogenesis following exposure to inflammatory challenges (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Ekdahl et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Monje et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Lazarini et al., 2012</xref>). A recent study also demonstrated that interactions between microglia and adult-born neurons in the OB mediate the elimination of adult-born neurons and pruning of their synapses following deafferentation-induced sensory deprivation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Denizet et al., 2017</xref>). However, the role of microglia in the formation, pruning, maturation, and output of adult-born neuronal synapses under normal, physiological conditions is unknown. To test the causal role of microglia in adult neurogenesis we used two approaches for modulating microglial functioning, firstly by inducing a near complete depletion of microglia, via chronic treatment of mice with the CSF-1 receptor antagonist PLX5622 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Elmore et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Dagher et al., 2015</xref>) and secondly by studying the effects of impaired microglial-neuronal interactions in <italic>Cx3cr1<sup>−/−</sup></italic> mice.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Microglia depletion reduces spine density in adult-born neurons</title><p>In the adult neurogenesis process, new neurons are constantly generated in the subventricular zone, migrate into the OB via the rostral migratory stream (RMS), and upon their arrival begin to integrate into the existing neural circuits. To label abGCs, we infected neuroblasts migrating to the OB by injecting adeno-associated virus-1 (AAV-1), encoding tdTomato (red fluorescent protein), into the RMS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref>). The virus was injected to mice just before the initiation of treatment with PLX5622 (Plexxikon Inc., U.S.A.) - a selective antagonist of colony stimulating factor receptor-1 (CSFR1). In the brain, this receptor is exclusively expressed by microglia and its blockade induces microglial depletion. The depletion is already present following 7 days of treatment and is near complete by 21 days (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Elmore et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Dagher et al., 2015</xref>). Indeed, continuous administration of PLX5622 for 25 days caused dramatic microglia depletion in the OB (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1c–d</xref>). Specifically, microglia numbers decreased from an average (±S.E.M.) density of 271 (±11) microglia cells per mm<sup>2</sup> in controls to 60 (±2) in PLX5622 -treated animals. A similar microglial depletion was also present in other areas of the CNS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). The microglial depletion was also evident in the transcriptional level, as revealed by a whole transcriptome RNA-seq analysis of OBs isolated from PLX5622-treated and their respective control mice. A total of 131 genes were differentially regulated in the PLX5622 mice, of which 127 genes were down-regulated (p&lt;0.01, with a cutoff of ±1.35 fold change, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>). Of the 127 down-regulated gene transcripts, 112 have been previously identified as microglia unique or enriched (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Hickman et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Butovsky et al., 2014</xref>), and likely reflect the direct consequences of microglial depletion. We examined the effects of microglial depletion on the density and size of spines on the distal apical dendrites of abGCs within the external plexiform layer (EPL), where GCs form reciprocal synapses with mitral cells (MCs) - the bulb’s main projection neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1b</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.30809.002</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Experimental preparation for investigating the role of microglia in the development, maturation and plasticity of adult-born granule cells in the olfactory bulb.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) A scheme of the experimental design: Mice were injected into the rostral migratory stream (RMS) with a virus that induces the expression of TdTomato fluorescent protein in adult-born neurons migrating from the subventricular zone (SVZ) to the OB.

The overall neurogenesis process in the PLX-5622-treated mice was similar to that in controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1a–b</xref>). The number of spiny dendrites per cell (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1c</xref>) and the average length of these dendrites/cell were comparable (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1d</xref>). The number of young new-born neurons (labeled by DCX) was also comparable between the PLX5622-treated animals and controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2a–d</xref>). The number of cells co-labeled by BrdU and NeuN was also similar between the PLX5622-treated and the control mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3a–d</xref>). Because BrdU was injected 3 days before the initiation of the diet treatment (i.e., at that time the proliferation of new-born cells was comparable between the groups), the lack of a difference in the number of BrdU-NeuN labeled neurons signifies similar survival rates of the abGCs in the two groups. However, spine density was 25% lower in PLX5622-treated mice as compared with control mice (p&lt;0.001) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2b–d</xref>). The morphology of abGCs spines was structurally heterogeneous, with some spines having long necks, some having shorter necks and others with a ‘stubby’ morphology (i.e., no visible neck). Furthermore, some spiny protrusions ended with only one spine head while others had multiple heads (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2e–f</xref>).

Microglial depletion in PLX5622-treated mice (left panel) reduced the formation and elimination of spines on abGCs. Because in control mice spine formation exceeds spine elimination during the initial developmental period of abGCs, the reduced synaptic turnover in microglia-depleted mice resulted in lower spine density.

Spine elimination was also reduced, suggesting that CX3CL1-CX3CR1-mediated communication between specific spines on abGCs and adjacent microglial processes plays an important role in spune pruning.

During this period, microglia play an important modulatory role in the development of global neuronal circuit connectivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Wu et al., 2015</xref>). This modulation involves the pruning of synapses by microglia, based on two distinct microglial molecular pathways, as evidenced by reduced pruning and altered networks connectivity in developing mice with either microglial <italic>Cx3cr1</italic> deficiency or complement receptor 3 (CR3) deficiency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Paolicelli et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Schafer et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Zhan et al., 2014</xref>). Moreover, in sensory-deprived adult animals, microglia were found to be involved in pruning of spines on OB abGCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Denizet et al., 2017</xref>). We report here, that microglia-depleted mice displayed reduced spine elimination under normal physiological conditions. Thus, similarly to their role in early brain development, microglia are also involved in pruning of dendritic spines in normally-developing adult-born neurons. Surprisingly, microglia depletion was associated with reduced spine density on mature abGCs. This result is probably related to the present finding that in addition to the reduction in spine elimination, microglia depleted mice also exhibited reduced formation of spines on abGCs. This finding is consistent with a previous report, showing that microglia depletion (using a genetic ablation method) reduced plasticity-related spine formation in mature neurons of the adult motor cortex following motor learning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Parkhurst et al., 2013</xref>). Thus, microglia play a role in both synapse formation and elimination. The decrease in spine density may stem from the spine dynamics of these cells. Specifically, in abGCs there is an initial period of greater spine formation than elimination up to 28 days after their generation, followed by a period of relative stability and a subsequent period of greater pruning from 3 to 6 months (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Livneh and Mizrahi, 2011</xref>). Thus, during the first few weeks of abGCs development, microglia are predominantly involved in spine formation, and therefore microglia depletion during that period resulted in reduced spine density.</p><p>Consistently with the above interpretation, when the PLX5622 treatment was initiated 7 weeks following the birth of the labeled abGCs, when these cells are considered to be mature, the microglia depletion had no effect on spine density. In this experiment, the microglia depletion occurred when spine density is known to be stable (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Livneh and Mizrahi, 2011</xref>), as verified here by showing that spine density in 70-day-old abGCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3d</xref>) was similar to the spine density in 28-day-old abGCs (in control diet-treated animals – <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2d</xref>). Thus, the role of microglia in the regulation of dendritic spines in abGCs (under normal quiescent conditions) is limited to the initial developmental period of these cells (up to 28 days after birth). Interestingly, in late adulthood (i.e., in 10-months-old mice) microglia depletion was found to increase spine density (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Rice et al., 2015</xref>). This finding suggests that along the aging process, when spine density is destabilized and spine loss commences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Dickstein et al., 2013</xref>), microglia again assume an important regulatory role and mediate age-associated spine pruning.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Effects of microglial <italic>Cx3cr1</italic> deficiency on synaptic development of abGCs</title><p>In <italic>Cx3cr1<sup>−/−</sup></italic> mice the neuronal-microglial communication through CX3CR1 is abrogated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Paolicelli et al., 2014</xref>). Thus, this model provides a more specific tool than global microglia depletion to probe the mechanisms by which microglia affect synaptic development. We report here that <italic>Cx3cr1<sup>−/−</sup></italic> mice displayed reduced spine elimination under normal physiological conditions, indicating that similarly to their role in early brain development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Paolicelli et al., 2014</xref>), microglia communication with neurons via CX3CR1 signaling are also involved in pruning of dendritic spines in normally-developing adult-born neurons. However, in contrast with early development, when <italic>Cx3cr1</italic> deficiency is associated with a transient increase in spine density (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Paolicelli et al., 2011</xref>), <italic>Cx3cr1</italic> deficiency in the adult brain is associated with reduced spine density in developing abGCs. This discrepancy can be explained by the current finding that <italic>Cx3cr1<sup>−/−</sup></italic> mice also exhibit a reduction in spine formation in abGCs. These findings suggest that the overall effect of microglia on spine density is different in neonatal- vs. adult-born neurons, based the differential developmental dynamics of spines during these periods. Specifically, in the early postnatal OB, the number of spines increases rapidly over the first 2 weeks, reflecting higher spine formation than elimination, immediately followed by a period of spine reduction, reflective of greater spine pruning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Brunjes et al., 1982</xref>). Thus, during the 3<sup>rd</sup> third week of life (the time point at which <italic>Cx3cr1</italic> deficiency was found to be associated with increased spine density [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Paolicelli et al., 2011</xref>]), microglia are predominantly involved in pruning. In contrast, as noted above, during the development of abGCs the higher rates of spine formation than elimination lasts longer (until 28 days following abGCs generation) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Livneh and Mizrahi, 2011</xref>). During this period, microglia are predominantly involved in spine formation, and therefore microglial aberrations (e.g., depletion or <italic>Cx3cr1</italic> deficiency) were found here to be associated with reduced spine density.</p><p>Our finding that <italic>Cx3cr1<sup>−/−</sup></italic> abGCs had smaller spine heads suggests that in addition to their role in spine formation and elimination, microglia modulate spine morphology. Because spine size is positively correlated with synaptic efficacy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Holtmaat et al., 2005</xref>), it may be suggested that microglia regulate synaptic strength. The finding that microglia depletion did not cause any change in spine morphology, suggests that microglia are not essential for the regulation of spine head size. Rather, the enhanced putative microglia-to-spine contacts in <italic>Cx3cr1<sup>−/−</sup></italic> mice may be the mechanism underlying the lower spine head size, given previous direct evidence that contacts between microglia and spines in the developing visual cortex can cause a transient reduction in spine size (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Tremblay et al., 2010</xref>). Our findings extend these results by showing that in abGCs such changes can be persistent and cumulative, resulting in almost doubling of the proportion of small spines out of the total spine population (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6g</xref>), possibly reflecting a delay in the normal maturation of synapses.</p><p>Our results demonstrate that CX3CL1-CX3CR1 signaling is an important mechanism underlying the regulation of synaptic development in abGCs. In the CNS, it has been shown that CX3CL1 induces chemotaxis of microglia cells to location of neuronal damage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Harrison et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Fuhrmann et al., 2010</xref>), however, no studies were conducted yet to directly examine the role of this system in the interactions between microglial and neuronal components under normal quiescent conditions. The present finding, showing that <italic>Cx3cr1</italic>-deficient microglia made less putative contacts with dendritic shafts of abGCs, suggests a role for the CX3CL1-CX3CR1 system in such contacts. Furthermore, the reduction in microglial-dendritic shaft contacts may account for the lowered spine formation and subsequent reduction in spine densities on abGCs, consistently with a recent study showing that during brain development contacts between microglia and dendritic shafts are essential for spine formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Miyamoto et al., 2016</xref>). The finding that the mere impairment in CX3CR1 signaling produces effects on spine formation and density that are similar to the effects of global microglial-depletion highlights the importance of the CX3CL1-CX3CR1 system in these processes. Contrary to the finding of reduced microglial-dendritic shafts contacts in <italic>Cx3cr1<sup>−/−</sup></italic> mice, the proportion of spines contacted by microglia was increased in these mice. It may be suggested that this increase did not result from more putative contacts per spine, but merely reflects the fact that abGCs in <italic>Cx3cr1<sup>−/−</sup></italic> mice have less spines than in WT mice. The finding that despite the greater proportion of spines contacted in <italic>Cx3cr1<sup>−/−</sup></italic> mice there was less spine elimination indicates that microglia-spine contacts do not necessarily result in spine elimination. In fact, in developing animals it has been shown that only a small proportion of the spines that are contacted by microglia are subsequently eliminated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Tremblay et al., 2010</xref>). The results of the present study suggest that spine elimination following microglial contacts crucially depends on activation of the CX3CR1 by its ligand, and therefore either specific impairment of this signaling or complete microglial depletion result in reduced spine elimination. Obviously, other microglial-independent mechanisms are also involved in spine elimination (which persists to some extent also in the microglia-depleted mice).</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Possible mechanisms underlying the role of microglia in spine formation and elimination</title><p>One mechanism that may support spine formation involves the secretion of BDNF from microglia during their contacts with dendrites and spines. A recent study reported that BDNF supports the stabilization of young spines by promoting the transformation from filopodia to spines, specifically in abGCs in the OB (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Breton-Provencher et al., 2016</xref>). The source of this BDNF may be microglial because it was previously reported that conditional microglia-specific knockout of BDNF reduced learning-associated spine formation in the motor cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Parkhurst et al., 2013</xref>). Thus, in our study the reduced numbers of microglia in the depleted mice, or the reduced contacts between microglial processes to dendrites in the <italic>Cx3cr1<sup>−/−</sup></italic> mice, may have resulted in lower secretion of BDNF near the dendrites and therefore less promotion of spine formation. The mechanism for microglia-associated synapse elimination during early development was found to involve the complement system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Schafer et al., 2012</xref>). Specifically, the cytokine TGFβ was found to induce expression of complement in neurons, which is sensed by complement receptors on microglia to promote phagocytosis of synapses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bialas and Stevens, 2013</xref>). However, the specific role of <italic>Cx3cr1</italic> deficiency in these mechanisms has not been studied yet. Future research should seek to define the precise molecular mechanisms that underlie the role of microglia and their CX3CR1 signaling in the formation and elimination of abGCs synapses.</p><p>In general, the effects of <italic>Cx3cr1</italic> deficiency largely recapitulated the effects of microglia depletion on synaptic development of OB abGCs. Nevertheless, it should be noted that the OB micro-environment may be different in <italic>Cx3cr1<sup>−/−</sup></italic> vs. microglia-depleted mice, and thus it is possible that the similar findings involve different microglia-related mechanisms in each of the models. For example, previous studies found that CX3CR1 signaling is involved in microglial suppression and that <italic>Cx3cr1<sup>−/−</sup></italic> mice have some markers of inflammatory activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Wolf et al., 2013</xref>), whereas microglia-depleted mice were found to have low levels of inflammatory activation markers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Spangenberg et al., 2016</xref>). In the current study, we found no differences between the two models in the OB inflammatory cytokines milieu, suggesting that in the OB the inflammatory micro-environment in these models is similar. Still, other genes are obviously differentially regulated in these models, and future research should focus on specific molecules that may mediate the proximal effects of microglial manipulations on synapse development.</p><p>It should be also noted that in each of the two models the effects of the microglia manipulation in the brain are global. Therefore, it is possible that microglia-related changes in brain regions outside the OB influence the development of abGCs in this region. Given that abGCs receive inputs only from local mitral cells in the OB, this explanation is not likely, but still the possibility that altered inputs from other brain areas to the mitral cells indirectly influence abGCs’ development cannot be ruled out. Future studies directing the microglial manipulations (depletion or <italic>Cx3cr1</italic> deficiency) specifically to the OB should be conducted to definitively assess this possibility.</p><p>Because both CSFR1 and CX3CR1 are expressed on peripheral macrophages and several other immune cell types (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Jung et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Dai et al., 2002</xref>), the microglia depletion and <italic>Cx3cr1</italic> deficiency models also involve peripheral alterations, which could indirectly influence the abGCs. Our current findings that the levels of most peripheral cytokines and chemokines were not different in the two models does not lend support for this hypothesis. Furthermore, the levels of the few peripheral molecules that did show a differential expression pattern in one of the models usually reflected a reduced inflammatory condition. For example, in the serum of <italic>Cx3cr1<sup>−/−</sup></italic> mice, the levels of ICAM1 were reduced and those of CXCL12 were elevated, oppositely to the changes observed in these molecules during an inflammatory condition, such as multiple sclerosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Sharief et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">McCandless et al., 2008</xref>). Moreover, none of the alterations in peripheral cytokines and chemokines was reflected by a parallel change in the OB. Thus, it is not likely that changes in the peripheral inflammatory environment in the two models indirectly influence brain neurons, in general, and abGCs, in particular, via peripherally-derived inflammatory molecules.</p></sec><sec id="s3-4"><title>Functional impact of microglia depletion</title><p>The dendritic spines of the OB GCs constitute the structural basis for dendro-dentritic synapses of these cells with mitral cells. These synapses are reciprocal, consisting of an excitatory (glutamatergic) mitral-to-GC synapses, adjacent to inhibitory GC-to-mitral inhibitory (GABAergic) synapses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Egger and Urban, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Whitman and Greer, 2007</xref>). The latter synapses restrain MC activation in specific contexts and conditions, with important implications to olfactory functioning. In particular, these synapses contribute to lateral inhibition, which sharpens and tunes the mitral cells responses to specific odorants, intrinsic OB oscillations, which shape olfactory coding, and olfactory memory processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Egger and Urban, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abraham et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Alonso et al., 2012</xref>). Consistently with this known connectivity, the microglia depletion-induced reduction in spine density in the present study was associated with increased responsiveness of mitral cells to odors. This finding is consistent with a previous demonstration that genetically-induced impairment of the excitatory synapses between mitral cell and GCs resulted in decreased activity of the GCs, along with reduced inhibitory post-synaptic potentials in the GCs-to-mitral cells recurrent synapses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abraham et al., 2010</xref>). A more dramatic manipulation of the GCs, induced by ablating OB neurogenesis altogether, resulted in reduced number of GABAergic synapses onto mitral cells, which in turn reduces the inhibitory input that these cells receive (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Breton-Provencher et al., 2009</xref>). Obviously, in the current experiment only a relatively small subset of the MCs synapses were influenced by the microglial depletion, considering that it is estimated that about 2–10% of abGCs will be replaced during a one month period (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Ninkovic et al., 2007</xref>). Interestingly, we found a 28.6% increase in the mitral cells responsiveness to smells, but no global effects on the response profiles of these cells (i.e., no effects on their tuning curves). Whether the decreased number of synapses of abGCs in microglia-depleted mice contributes to this increase remains an open question for future exploration.</p></sec><sec id="s3-5"><title>Conclusion</title><p>The results of the present study demonstrate for the first time that in the process of adult neurogenesis microglia do not only regulate the numbers of new-born neurons, as demonstrated previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Ekdahl et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Monje et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Butovsky et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Ziv et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Maggi et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Sierra et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bachstetter et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Reshef et al., 2014</xref>), but that they also influence the synaptic development, maintenance, dynamics and functioning of adult-born neurons. These findings are consistent with previous reports regarding the role of microglia in synapse pruning, plasticity and circuits formation during brain development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Paolicelli et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Paolicelli and Gross, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Schafer et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Zhan et al., 2014</xref>), in neuroplasticity induced by environmental enrichment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Maggi et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Reshef et al., 2014</xref>) and in learning-dependent spine formation in the adult brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Parkhurst et al., 2013</xref>). Together, these findings indicate that microglia have a general role in modulation of neuronal plasticity and its involvement in neuronal circuit connectivity throughout the entire life span of animals. Accordingly, during various pathological conditions, including neuroinflammation, neurodegeneration, neurodevelopmental and neuropsychiatric diseases, at least some of the symptoms may result from direct detrimental effects of the microglial disturbances that are associated with these conditions on neural plasticity and circuit remodeling processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Prinz and Priller, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Salter and Beggs, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Zhan et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Chung et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Yirmiya et al., 2015</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th>Reagent type (species) <break/>or resource</th><th colspan="2">Designation</th><th>Source or reference</th><th>Identifiers</th><th>Additional information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>strain, strain <break/>background (Mice)</td><td colspan="2"><italic>Cx3cr1<sup>−/−</sup></italic></td><td>The Jackson Laboratories</td><td>B6.129P-Cx3cr1tm1Litt/J. <break/>(RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/IMSR_JAX:005582">IMSR_JAX:005582</ext-link>)</td><td>On C57BL/6 background <break/>(serving as wild-type control)</td></tr><tr><td>strain, strain <break/>background (Mice)</td><td colspan="2">Thy1-GCaMP3</td><td>Kindly provided to Adi Mizrahi <break/>from Guoping Feng. <break/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Chen et al.

Nstable, Nlost, and Ngained are the number of stable, lost, and gained spines, respectively. Dendrites and spines were analyzed only if they had strong fluorescent signal that was clearly contrasted from the background. To estimate the size of a spine, we used the integrated fluorescence of a spine head, which has been shown to be a good proxy of its size (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Holtmaat et al., 2005</xref>).

Finally, spine head size was calculated in two dimensions at the image frame in which the integrated fluorescence of a single spine head was highest. Intensity values of all pixels comprising the spine head were summed after subtracting the mean value of the background adjacent to the spine. To normalize this value and to avoid biases that can be caused by inhomogeneities in excitation level and TdTomato expression, the integrated value of the fluorescence of a single spine head was divided by averaging the intensity levels of the pixels on the adjacent dendritic shaft, whose intensity level was on the upper 10% of that dendrite. The result of this analysis was the spine head size having arbitrary units (AU). Higher values of this measure reflected bigger spine head sizes. In the current dataset, spines ranged from 0.15 to 70 AU.</p><p>tdTomato-based spine density was calculated from arbitrarily chosen dendritic trees within the EPL, belonging to the same neuron. Dendritic length and spine numbers were calculated using Fiji image processing package (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://fiji.sc/Fiji">http://fiji.sc/Fiji</ext-link>), with the use of the ‘simple neurite tracer’ and the ‘cell counter’ plugins. In several cases we observed multiple spines emerging from the same spine neck or parent dendrite. In those cases, all spine heads were counted as spines, regardless of the neck origin.</p><p>Microglial putative contacts with abGCs were calculated from arbitrarily chosen dendritic trees within the EPL, belonging to the same neuron. Dendritic length and putative contacts were calculated from image Z stacks using Fiji image processing package, with the use of the ‘simple neurite tracer’ and the ‘cell counter’ plugins. A putative dendritic contact was defined as double staining (marked by a yellow color) of a microglia process (Cy5) and an abGC dendritic shaft (TdTomato) (<xref ref-type="video" rid="video1">Videos 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="video" rid="video2">2</xref>). The number of contacts per dendritc shaft was normalized, by dividing this number by the dendritic shaft's length. A putative spine contact was defined as double staining (yellow staining) of a microglial process and an abGC dendritic spine. For each abGC we calculated the number of spines that were contacted by microglial processes out of the total spine number.</p><p>The microglial morphological analysis was conducted on image stacks, using Fiji (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://fiji.sc/Fiji">http://fiji.sc/Fiji</ext-link>), with the use of the ‘simple neurite tracer’ plugin.</p><p>The total numbers of Iba-1-labeled microglia and DCX- labeled newborn neurons were estimated using images taken by X10 lens, from the first 8 µm out of each 40 µm slice. In each slice, the number of Iba-1- or DCX-labeled cells (that were also counter-stained with DAPI to ascertain nuclear staining) were manually counted in a defined area exclusively containing the entire olfactory bulb (including the glomerular, plexiform, mitral and granule layers), using the ImageJ cell counter tool. For each brain, microglia and newborn neurons number as well as microglial morphology were assessed in eight sections along the entire rostro-caudal axis of the olfactory bulb.</p><p>The total numbers of Brdu-NeuN-labeled newborn neurons were estimated using images taken by X20 lens, from the first 8 µm out of each 40 µm slice. In each slice, the number of Brdu-NeuN- labeled cells were manually counted in a defined area of the exclusively containing the granule cell layer, using the imagej cell counter tool. Only cells co-labeled with NeuN and Brdu along the Z-axis were counted. For each brain, newborn neurons numbers were assessed in eight sections along the entire rostro-caudal axis of the olfactory bulb.</p></sec><sec id="s4-12"><title>Calcium imaging data analysis</title><p>Data was analyzed using ImageJ, followed by a custom code written in MATLAB (The Mathworks). ImageJ was used in order to manually mark regions of interest (ROIs) corresponding to individual cell bodies and to extract the mean fluorescence for each cell body at any given point in time. Thus, the extracted data was constructed from a vector of 164 values (representing the mean fluorescence in the ROI over time) for each single trial. Each trial was composed of 5 s pre-stimulation, 2 s odor presentation, and 5 s post stimulation for a total of 14 s (i.e.,164 time points at 7 Hz). Each trial was separately smoothed with the MATLAB ‘smooth’ function using a moving average filter with a span of 5. Relative fluorescence change (ΔF/F) was calculated using the mean fluorescence over 4 s before odor onset as the baseline fluorescence (F0). We defined a response window equal to the stimulus duration +3 s. In order to determine whether a response was statistically significant, we created a distribution of Z scores based on the statistics of each trial separately as follows: ZResponse = Response magnitude/Trial noise, where Response magnitude = peak ΔF/F during response window - peak ΔF/F during the parallel time window in the ‘Blank’ channel. Trial noise is the standard deviation during the response window at ‘Blank’. We used a threshold of ZResponse = 2 to define a response as significant. Notably, ZResponse thresholds ranging from 1.5 to 3, all yielded qualitatively similar results. Lastly, we categorized calcium transients as odor evoked responses if at least two trials in addition to the mean trace had Z scores that surpassed the threshold. The dataset underwent two different analyses – whole population and time-lapse.</p><p>For the whole population analysis, we used all recorded cells imaged at either time points and performed unpaired statistics. Neurons showing responses at the blank channel above 0.3 ΔF/F as well as neurons with seemingly artifactual changes in &gt;0.5 ΔF/F before odor presentation were discarded. Inclusion of these cells in the analysis did not qualitatively change the results. To assess changes in response profile we quantified two values: (1) the mean number of odors eliciting a response per cell, and (2) the magnitude of all responses.</p><p>For the time lapse analysis, we used only cells that were clearly identified at both imaging sessions. Thus, these neurons were also analyzed in the whole population analysis. The statistics for this part of the analysis was based on paired samples comparisons. For the scatter plot we used only cell-odor pairs that showed a significant response at least at one of the imaging sessions.</p></sec><sec id="s4-13"><title>RNA sequencing</title><p>Mice were sacrificed by decapitation. Brains were quickly removed on an ice-cold glass plate, and the olfactory bulbs were dissected out. Tissues were weighed, flash frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at −80°C. RNA was extracted using PerfectPure RNA extraction kit (5 PRIME, Darmstadt, Germany) and RNA samples (2 µg) were reverse transcribed using the QuantiTect Reverse Transcription Kit from Qiagen (Hilden, Germany), including DNase treatment of contaminating genomic DNA.</p><p>For RNA Sequencing, PolyA based mRNA was selected using oligodT beads, followed by fragmentation, first strand and second strand synthesis reactions. Illumina libraries were constructed while performing the end repair, A base addition, adapter ligation and PCR amplification steps with SPRI beads cleanup in between steps. Indexed samples were pooled and sequenced in an Illumina HiSeq 2500 machine in a single read mode.</p></sec><sec id="s4-14"><title>Bioinformatics analysis</title><p>Adapters were trimmed using the cutadapt tool. Following adapter removal, reads that were shorter than 40 nucleotides were discarded (cutadapt option –m 40). Reads that had either a percentage of Adenine bases above 50% or a percentage of Thymine bases above 50% were discarded using a custom script. TopHat (v2.0.10) was used to align the reads to the mouse genome (mm10) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Kim et al., 2013</xref>). Counting reads on mm10 refseq genes (downloaded from igenomes) was done with HTSeq-count (version 0.6.1p1) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Anders et al., 2015</xref>). Differential expression analysis was performed using DESeq2 (1.6.3) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Anders et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Love et al., 2014</xref>).

The amount of extracted proteins was measured both by NanoDrop and by a Pierce BCA protein assay kit (Thermo Scientific). Trunk blood was collected following brief isoflurane anesthesia and decapitation. The blood was allowed to clot for 30 mins at room temperature and then centrifuged for 10 mins at 1500 g for serum collection. Cytokine and chemokine measurements were carried out using Proteome Profiler Mouse Chemokine and Cytokine Array (R&amp;D Systems) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Cytokine and chemokine expression levels were measured by densitometry, and expressed as arbitrary units relative to the assay’s internal control.</p></sec><sec id="s4-16"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>All data are presented as mean ±S.E.M. Sample sizes were determined in advance. Based on previous research in our and other laboratories, examining synaptic density and dynamics in adult-born neurons, we analyzed about 18 neurons (range: 13–20) from four mice in each experimental and control group. This sample size was previously found to have sufficient statistical power to demonstrate the effects of various developmental, genetic and environmental factors. Animals were allocated into the experimental/control groups in a randomized manner. Following the randomization, we ascertained that the different experimental/control groups were matched for age and body weight, and adjusted the allocation if needed. Data was tested for normality using the Lilliefors test, and then compared using two-tailed Student’s t-test (unless noted). For relatively large samples (n &gt; 30), t-tests were applied also to distributions that did not pass the normality test. Spine turnover data was analyzed by mixed ANOVA, followed by specific comparisons with Bonferonni’s corrections. Histograms of spine sizes, proportions of responsive Mitral cells and response magnitudes were tested using the two-sampled Kolmogorov-Smirnov test. RNA-seq analysis was done using binomial linear models (DSEq2 algorithm).</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We thank Mr. Nitai Harari and Ms. Hagar Lev-Ari for help with running the experiments, and Ms. Zehava Cohen for help in preparation of the figures.

Differences in the inflammatory environment could certainly contribute to the changes that were observed, and therefore, as suggested by the reviewer, we compared the cytokine and chemokine milieus in the two models. We used two methods for this comparison. Firstly, we conducted an RNA-seq analysis, measuring the expression levels of 40 inflammatory cytokines and chemokines in the OB of PLX5622-treated, <italic>Cx3cr1<sup>-/-</sup></italic> and their respective control mice. Secondly, we conducted a microarray assay, comparing the protein levels of the same 40 inflammatory molecules in these groups. Both analyses indicated that there were no differences between the groups in the levels of olfactory bulb pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines (e.g., IL-1β, TNFα, IL-6 and IFNγ), either at the RNA transcription or the protein expression levels. These findings are now mentioned in the Results section (subsection “Comparison of the cytokine/chemokine expression profile between the two microglia manipulation models”, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref>, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9A</xref>). In the Discussion section, the distinctiveness of the micro environments created in the two models is acknowledged and discussed (subsection “Possible mechanisms underlying the role of microglia in spine formation and elimination”, as well as the response to point 4 below).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>, the effect of microglial depletion in adulthood should be verified and documented. Is it as effective as the same manipulation at earlier stages? Staining for microglia is needed.</p></disp-quote><p>As suggested by the Reviewer, we conducted an additional experiment assessing the effects of microglia depletion on mature GCs. In this experiment, we injected tdTomato-encoding AAV1 into the RMS, treating the animals with the PLX5622 diet for 25 days, from 45 to 70 days post-injection, i.e., when the GCs were already mature (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). This treatment reduced the numbers of microglia dramatically (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>), similarly to the effect shown above for animals treated with PLX5622 at 3 to 28 days post-injection. However, following the delayed microglia depletion induction there was no difference between the spine density in the PLX5622-treated and the control groups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3 B-D</xref>). These findings are described in the Results section (third paragraph subsection “Microglia depletion reduces spine density in adult-born neurons”).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) The RNAseq results as presented, and conclusion do not add to the story; these results only confirm that microglia were depleted.

Therefore, we mention the results of the RNA-Seq analysis in PLX5622-treated mice only as a confirmation of the microglia depletion (first paragraph subsection “Microglia depletion reduces spine density in adult-born neurons”), whereas the IPA pathway analysis was removed from the manuscript. As suggested, we added a thorough comparison of the cytokine milieu in the two models (see comment 1 above, in Essential Revision).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) Overall the discussion is somewhat confusing, in light of the fact that the two model systems that create completely distinct conditions. This is not sufficiently clarified in the text.</p></disp-quote><p>In accordance with the Reviewer’s comment we thoroughly revised the Discussion section, separating the discussion of the two microglia manipulation models. We also addressed the distinctiveness of the two models in the discussion, asserting that: “In general, the effects of <italic>Cx3cr1<sup>-/-</sup></italic> deficiency largely recapitulated the effects of microglia depletion on synaptic development of OB abGCs. Nevertheless, it should be noted that the OB micro-environment may be different in <italic>Cx3cr1<sup>-/-</sup></italic> vs. microglia-depleted mice, and thus it is possible that the similar findings involve different microglia-related mechanisms in each of the models. For example, previous studies found that CX3CR1 signaling is involved in microglial suppression and that <italic>Cx3cr1<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice have some markers of inflammatory activation (Wolf et al., 2013), whereas microglia-depleted mice were found to have low levels of inflammatory activation markers (Spangenberg et al., 2016). In the current study, we found no differences between the two models in the OB inflammatory cytokines milieu, suggesting that in the OB the inflammatory micro-environment in these models is similar. Still, other genes are obviously differentially regulated in these models, and future research should focus on specific molecules that may mediate the proximal effects of microglial manipulations on synapse development” (subsection “Possible mechanisms underlying the role of microglia in spine formation and elimination”).</p></body></sub-article></article>
