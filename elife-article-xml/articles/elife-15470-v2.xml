Recent studies in human cells revealed that a patch of amino acids in the shelterin component TPP1, called the TEL-patch, is essential for recruiting telomerase to telomeres. However, how TEL-patch—telomerase interaction integrates into the overall orchestration of telomerase regulation at telomeres is unclear. In fission yeast, Tel1<sup>ATM</sup>/Rad3<sup>ATR</sup>-mediated phosphorylation of shelterin component Ccq1 during late S phase is involved in telomerase recruitment through promoting the binding of Ccq1 to a telomerase accessory protein Est1. Here, we identify the TEL-patch in Tpz1<sup>TPP1</sup>, mutations of which lead to decreased telomeric association of telomerase, similar to the phosphorylation-defective Ccq1. Furthermore, we find that telomerase action at telomeres requires formation and resolution of an intermediate state, in which the cell cycle-dependent Ccq1-Est1 interaction is coupled to the TEL-patch—Trt1 interaction, to achieve temporally regulated telomerase elongation of telomeres.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.15470.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.15470.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.15470.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>The genetic blueprints for animals, plants and fungi are mostly contained within long strands of DNA and packaged into more compact thread-like structures called chromosomes. As such, most cells need to duplicate their chromosomes before they divide so that the two new cells each get a complete set of genetic instructions.</p><p>The machinery that copies DNA is unable to make it to the very ends of the chromosomes. Instead, an enzyme called telomerase adds new DNA to the chromosome ends to prevent them becoming too short. Problems with this process can cause serious issues, such as cell death or cancer, and so the activity of telomerase is carefully controlled. Other proteins guide telomerase to the ends of the chromosome only after the rest of the DNA has been copied.

Now, Hu, Liu et al. have identified a similar TEL-patch in a shelterin protein from a type of yeast called fission yeast; this patch is also needed to attach telomerase to the chromosome ends. Further experiments with this yeast then showed that telomerase only arrives at the ends of the chromosomes after two parallel interaction interfaces have formed. Importantly, one of these interactions only takes place after most of the chromosomes are have been copied. As such, this “two-pronged interaction” mechanism ensures that the telomerase enzyme arrives at the end of the chromosomes at the right time.</p><p>Other similarities between human and fission yeast chromosome ends make it plausible that a comparable process controls the timing of telomerase attachment in human cells. However, more studies will be needed to confirm if this is the case.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.15470.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.15470.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>telomerase</kwd><kwd>telomeres</kwd><kwd>recruitment</kwd><kwd>cell cycle</kwd><kwd>DNA replication</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd><italic>S. pombe</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01GM098943</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Hu</surname><given-names>Xichan</given-names></name><name><surname>Liu</surname><given-names>Jinqiang</given-names></name><name><surname>Jun</surname><given-names>Hyun-IK</given-names></name><name><surname>Qiao</surname><given-names>Feng</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000968</institution-id><institution>American Heart Association</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>15PRE22420012</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Jun</surname><given-names>Hyun-IK</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000912</institution-id><institution>March of Dimes Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Basil O'Connor Starter Scholar Research Award</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Qiao</surname><given-names>Feng</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>A telomerase recruitment mechanism delivers cell cycle information to the telomere-telomerase interface to ensure timely telomerase engagement at the telomere.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Telomeres, the physical ends of linear chromosomes, are essential for stable maintenance of chromosomes by facilitating chromosome end replication and preventing them from being degraded or fusing with each other (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Artandi and Cooper, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Palm and de Lange, 2008</xref>). In most eukaryotes, telomeres are comprised of short tandem DNA repeats. Rather than a blunt end, the telomere consists of a 3’ single-stranded overhang called the G-tail that provides the substrate for telomerase to counteract iterative telomere shortening after each round of DNA replication. Telomerase is a ribonucleoprotein enzyme that extends telomeres utilizing an RNA component as template for its reverse transcriptase protein subunit (named TERT in vertebrates and Trt1 in fission yeast) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Autexier and Lue, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Collins, 2006</xref>). This telomerase-dependent nucleotide addition is rigorously limited to late S/G2 phase. Dysregulation of telomerase and the subsequent perturbation of telomere length homeostasis lead to severe defects in cell proliferation. As a result, a constellation of genetic diseases caused by mutations in the telomere maintenance machinery (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Sarek et al., 2015</xref>), referred to as 'telomeropathies' (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Holohan et al., 2014</xref>) or 'telomere syndromes' (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Armanios and Blackburn, 2012</xref>), have been continuously identified, and include dyskeratosis congenita (DC), aplastic anemia, and multiple types of cancers.</p><p>Studies in telomerase regulation and telomere maintenance unveiled a precisely orchestrated process of telomerase recruitment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hockemeyer and Collins, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Nandakumar and Cech, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Schmidt and Cech, 2015</xref>). In budding yeast, the interaction between the telomere-binding protein Cdc13 and the telomerase holoenzyme component Est1 regulates telomerase activation and its recruitment to the telomere (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chandra et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Evans and Lundblad, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Pennock et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Qi and Zakian, 2000</xref>). Likewise, telomere-associated proteins in humans and fission yeast, which form a highly conserved protein complex called shelterin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">de Lange, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Miyoshi et al., 2008</xref>), are essential to regulate telomere states, recruit telomerase, and govern its activity on telomeres. In fission yeast, the shelterin complex contains the double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) binding protein Taz1 (the homolog of TRF1/TRF2 in humans) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Cooper et al., 1997</xref>) and the single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) binding protein Pot1 (human POT1 ortholog) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Baumann and Cech, 2001</xref>), which are bridged via direct protein-protein interactions between Rap1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Chikashige and Hiraoka, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Kanoh and Ishikawa, 2001</xref>), Poz1, and Tpz1 (human RAP1, TIN2 and TPP1 orthologs, respectively) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Miyoshi et al., 2008</xref>). The human system shares a conserved shelterin arrangement by forming a similar 'shelterin bridge' architecture (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bianchi and Shore, 2008</xref>). Recent studies discovered a cluster of residues on human TPP1, collectively termed TEL-patch, which mediates TPP1-TERT interaction to recruit telomerase to telomeres (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Nandakumar et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Sexton et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Zhong et al., 2012</xref>). TEL-patch mediated TPP1-TERT interaction also confers increased telomerase processivity in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Nandakumar et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Schmidt et al., 2014</xref>). Moreover, a detailed genetic study of TEL-patch mutants revealed multiple functions of TPP1 in telomerase recruitment, activation, and telomere length feedback regulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Sexton et al., 2014</xref>). Altered TEL-patch function is clinically manifested as Hoyeraal-Hreidarsson (HH) syndrome. HH patients bear extremely short telomeres, even in comparison to other DC patients. A germline mutation causing a single-amino-acid deletion (K170Δ) in the human TPP1 TEL-patch that affects its telomerase recruitment function has been identified as the causal mutation of HH (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kocak et al., 2014</xref>). This signifies the critical telomerase recruitment function of the TEL-patch in normal stem cell development.</p><p>Interestingly, fission yeast <italic>Schizosaccharomyces pombe</italic>, which has a similar shelterin architecture to mammals, contains an additional shelterin component called Ccq1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Flory et al., 2004</xref>), the functional homolog of which has not yet been identified in mammals. Ccq1 was demonstrated to be a cell cycle-dependent telomerase recruitment factor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Miyoshi et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Tomita and Cooper, 2008</xref>). Further investigation showed that Ccq1 is required to bring telomerase to telomeres through its Tel1<sup>ATM</sup>/Rad3<sup>ATR</sup>-mediated Thr93 phosphorylation during late S phase, which creates a binding site for the 14-3-3 domain of Est1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Moser et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Webb and Zakian, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Yamazaki et al., 2012</xref>). Est1 is an accessory protein of telomerase holoenzyme and is linked to the telomerase protein subunit (Trt1) via their co-association with telomerase RNA (TER1) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Leonardi et al., 2008</xref>). Ccq1 also interacts with Tpz1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Miyoshi et al., 2008</xref>), and the Ccq1-Tpz1 interaction is therefore thought to bring the telomerase complex (Est1-TER1-Trt1) to the telomere (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Moser et al., 2009</xref>) via the Ccq1 Thr93-phosphorylation dependent Ccq1-Est1 interaction. However, in-depth analyses further revealed that Ccq1-Est1 and Ccq1-Tpz1 interactions seem to be mutually exclusive (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Armstrong et al., 2014</xref>). Moreover, Est1-Ccq1 interaction could be disrupted by TER1 in a yeast three-hybrid analysis and Est1 mutations that affect Est1-TER1 interaction also impair Est1-Ccq1 interaction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Armstrong et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Webb and Zakian, 2012</xref>). In addition, based on a Ccq1-centric model, it is hard to explain why the telomeric association of Est1 requires not only Ccq1, but also Trt1 and TER1, which are downstream from Ccq1-Est1 interaction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Webb and Zakian, 2012</xref>). Therefore, the hypothetical Tpz1-Ccq1-Est1-TER1-Trt1 interaction chain seems unlikely to form to mediate telomerase recruitment. These results imply that an alternative mechanism exists to directly associate telomerase to other shelterin components, such as Tpz1, to initiate telomere elongation in fission yeast in response to the cell cycle-dependent Ccq1-Thr93 phosphorylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chang et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>In this study, we identified a Tpz1 mutation in the TEL-patch region that results in an ever shorter telomere (<italic>EST</italic>) phenotype, similar to the telomere phenotype of human TPP1 TEL-patch mutants. We observed decreased telomeric association of Trt1 and weakened Tpz1-Trt1 interaction in this Tpz1 TEL-patch mutant, indicating the conserved role of the TEL-patch in telomerase recruitment. Our epistasis analyses demonstrated that the Tpz1 TEL-patch functions by positively regulating Trt1. Furthermore, we found that telomerase action at telomeres requires formation and resolution of an intermediate state, formed via two cooperative telomere-telomerase interfaces involving cell cycle-regulated Ccq1-Est1 interaction and Tpz1 (TEL-patch)-Trt1 interaction. As a result, the temporal information for telomerase recruitment is endowed to the TEL-patch through the phosphorylation status of Ccq1 Thr93, thus achieving cell cycle-specific telomere elongation.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Tpz1 TEL-patch mutations lead to <italic>E</italic>ver <italic>S</italic>horter <italic>T</italic>elomere—<italic>EST</italic> phenotype</title><p>Telomerase exists in low abundance in the cell. Therefore, the interaction between shelterin and telomerase has been proposed to enrich telomerase at chromosome ends. Indeed, a group of surface-exposed amino acids in the human TPP1 OB-domain, termed TEL-patch, are found to be necessary for the telomerase recruitment to telomeres (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Nandakumar et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Sexton et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Zhong et al., 2012</xref>). Although the fission yeast shelterin component Ccq1 has been connected to telomerase recruitment in this model organism, it is unlikely to be the sole factor to link Trt1 to telomeres (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Armstrong et al., 2014</xref>). Additional interactions between shelterin components and Trt1 must exist to bring Trt1 directly to the telomere. Given the high conservation of the OB-fold domain arrangement in the N-terminal regions of <italic>S. pombe</italic> Tpz1 and human TPP1, we decided to test whether a Tpz1 TEL-patch functions in <italic>S. pombe</italic> as an interface between telomerase and shelterin. To identify candidate residues for such a TEL-patch in <italic>S. pombe</italic> Tpz1, we performed a sequence alignment between fission yeast Tpz1 and human TPP1 in combination with a secondary structure prediction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). We then identified 12 conserved Tpz1 residues in the region corresponding to the human TPP1 TEL-patch as candidate residues for fission yeast Tpz1 TEL-patch. <italic>S. pombe</italic> cells bearing individual mutations in these 12 residues of Tpz1 were tested for their telomere maintenance. <italic>tpz1-I105R</italic> and <italic>tpz1-V107R</italic> mutant strains appear to have destabilized Tpz1 protein and display a similar telomere deprotection phenotype (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>) to <italic>tpz1Δ</italic> strain. The remaining 10 <italic>tpz1</italic> mutant strains have comparable levels of Tpz1 expression as the wild-type strain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>). Strains bearing <italic>tpz1-T73A, tpz1-K75E, tpz1-R76E, tpz1-I77R, and tpz1-R81E</italic> displayed shortening telomeres (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>), implicating positive regulatory roles of these residues in telomere length regulation. Although <italic>tpz1-T73A, tpz1-K75E,</italic> and <italic>tpz1-R76E</italic> cells all have shortened telomeres, in contrast to the <italic>tpz1-I77R and tpz1-R81E</italic> cells, their telomeres remain stably short (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). This telomere phenotype is similar to that of previously identified fission yeast <italic>tpz1-K75A</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Armstrong et al., 2014</xref>) or human TPP1-L104A (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Sexton et al., 2014</xref>), proposed to affect telomerase activation and telomere length homeostasis set point, respectively. Strikingly, <italic>tpz1-R81E</italic> cells showed the classic <italic><underline>E</underline>ver <underline>S</underline>horter <underline>T</underline>elomere</italic> (<bold><italic>EST</italic></bold>) phenotype (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Lundblad and Szostak, 1989</xref>), similar to <italic>trt1Δ</italic> cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Nakamura et al., 1997</xref>). The deterioration in telomere maintenance of <italic>tpz1-R81E</italic> strain started as early as ~50 generations. Its telomeres shorten to the critical length at 75 generations, and are almost completely lost afterwards. Gradual telomere loss was also observed in <italic>tpz1-I77R</italic> cells, albeit to a much milder degree than in <italic>tpz1-R81E</italic> cells. Furthermore, Tpz1-Arg81 and Trt1 appear to have an epistatic relationship because telomere shortening in the <italic>tpz1-R81E/trt1Δ</italic> double mutant is not additive (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). The similar phenotypes observed for <italic>tpz1-R81E, trt1Δ,</italic> and <italic>tpz1-R81E/trt1Δ</italic> support a role of Tpz1-Arg81 in directly regulating telomerase activity on telomeres. Similar to the previously identified <italic>tpz1-K75A</italic> mutant that is defective in telomerase activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Armstrong et al., 2014</xref>), <italic>tpz1-K75E</italic> and <italic>tpz1-R76E</italic> mutants have a milder telomere loss phenotype and their shortened telomeres are maintained for many generations. These observations clearly distinguish Tpz1-Arg 81 from telomerase activation residues in Tpz1, i.e. Lys75 or Arg76.<fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.15470.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Fission yeast Tpz1 TEL-patch mutant leads to an EST phenotype.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) A sequence alignment of OB fold-domains between fission yeast Tpz1, human TPP1 and <italic>Oxytricha nova</italic> TEBP-β, in combination with a secondary structure prediction.

This result clearly indicates that Tpz1-Arg81 functions downstream of telomere switching from the non-extendible to the extendible state and upstream of telomerase action, most likely to mediate telomere-telomerase interaction. Therefore, we genetically demonstrated the existence of the TEL-patch in fission yeast Tpz1 that is functionally analogous to the TEL-patch of human TPP1.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>The Tpz1 TEL-patch contributes to Tpz1-Trt1 interaction</title><p>Mutations of the TEL-patch residues in human TPP1 disrupt the direct interaction between TPP1 and TERT. Moreover, the TEN domain of human TERT was demonstrated to mediate its interaction with TPP1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Schmidt et al., 2014</xref>), providing an interface required for the recruitment of telomerase to telomeres. In fission yeast, both Tpz1 and Ccq1 have been found to interact with Trt1 independent of telomerase RNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Armstrong et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Tomita and Cooper, 2008</xref>). To directly assess the function of the putative TEL-patch residue Tpz1-Arg81, we first examined the binding efficiency between Tpz1-R81E and Trt1 utilizing co-immunoprecipitation assay. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A,B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>, whereas Tpz1-E74R, Tpz1-K75A, Tpz1-K75E, and Tpz1-R76E pulled down similar amounts of Trt1 as the wild-type Tpz1, Tpz1-R81E only immunoprecipitated 30% of Trt1 compared to the wild-type Tpz1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B and C</xref>). Considerably reduced Tpz1-Trt1 interaction in the <italic>tpz1-R81E</italic> mutant correlates well with its progressive telomere shortening phenotype (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>), further supporting an essential role that Tpz1-Arg81 plays in mediating the interaction between telomerase and shelterin at the telomere. Interestingly, <italic>tpz1-I77R</italic> cells lost about 50% of the Tpz1-Trt1 interaction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B and C</xref>).

However, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B,D and E</xref>, all tested Tpz1 mutants, including Tpz1-R81E, interact with Ccq1 similarly to wild-type Tpz1. Moreover, the Ccq1-Trt1 interaction remains unchanged for all Tpz1 mutants as well (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>). Next, we tested whether two Ccq1 mutants, Ccq1-F157A/K174E and Ccq1-T93A, previously shown to be defective in Tpz1-Ccq1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Liu et al., 2015</xref>) and Ccq1-Est1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Moser et al., 2011</xref>) interactions, respectively, can completely abolish Tpz1-Trt1 interaction. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>, Tpz1-Trt1 interaction is clearly retained in both Ccq1-F157A/K174E and Ccq1-T93A mutants. This was particularly striking for the Ccq1-F157A/K174E mutant, in which Tpz1-Ccq1 interaction is completely disrupted. These data, together with previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Armstrong et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Webb and Zakian, 2012</xref>), argue against Ccq1 as the sole platform that recruits telomerase to telomeres. These results further point to the existence of the TEL-patch in fission yeast Tpz1 and indicate a conserved function in the recruitment of telomerase.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>The TEL-patch mutant of Tpz1 fails to localize telomerase to telomeres</title><p>To further test whether the failure of the <italic>tpz1-R81E</italic> mutant to replenish telomeres emanates from its inability to recruit telomerase to telomeres, we directly tested the group of Tpz1 OB-fold domain mutants for in vivo localization of telomerase to telomeres using ChIP assays.

The latter result is consistent with the phenotype of another previously described telomerase activation mutant strain <italic>tpz1-K75A</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Armstrong et al., 2014</xref>).

In contrast, in all the tested Tpz1 OB-fold domain mutants, little effect was observed on the telomeric association of both Tpz1 and Ccq1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B and C</xref>). These results directly reveal a specific role for Tpz1 N-terminal OB-domain residues Ile77 and Arg81 in mediating telomere-Trt1 interaction and Trt1 recruitment. Moreover, since <italic>tpz1-I77R</italic> cells have a much more subtle telomere shortening phenotype than <italic>tpz1-R81E</italic> cells, we speculate that a threshold amount of residual telomerase interaction may be required for telomere maintenance upon disruption of the Tpz1 TEL-patch.

We next tested whether the inability of the Tpz1 TEL-patch mutant to maintain telomere length could be rescued by forcing telomerase to physically associate with telomeres. To this end, we measured telomere lengths of strains with Trt1 fused to Tpz1 mutants as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Armstrong et al., 2014</xref>).

Different from the proposed Tpz1-Ccq1-Est1 chain-interaction that connects telomerase to telomere shelterin, Ccq1-Est1 and Ccq1-Tpz1 interaction were demonstrated to be mutually exclusive (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Armstrong et al., 2014</xref>) and the binding surfaces for Est1 and Tpz1 in Ccq1 are most likely to overlap. Our recent work utilizing a new strategy, called <italic>MICro-MS</italic> (Mapping Interfaces via Crosslinking-Mass Spectrometry), mapped the Tpz1-interacting interface on Ccq1 and isolated a group of separation-of-function mutants that specifically disrupt Ccq1-Tpz1 interaction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Liu et al., 2015</xref>). If Ccq1 interacts with Est1 via an overlapping surface that also mediates Ccq1-Tpz1 interaction, Ccq1 mutants that are defective in Ccq1-Tpz1 interaction is most likely to compromise Ccq1-Est1 interaction too.

Unexpectedly, we found that Ccq1-T93A, the Ccq1 mutant in the Rad3<sup>ATR</sup>/Tel1<sup>ATM</sup> phosphorylation site Thr93, did not completely abolish Ccq1-Est1 interaction; rather, it diminished Ccq1-Est1 interaction to a similar degree that was observed for Ccq1-F157A/K174E or Ccq1-I175R mutant.<fig id="fig5" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.15470.011</object-id><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><title>Est1 binds to Ccq1 through two different binding sites.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Ccq1-Est1 interaction is diminished but not completely disrupted in the <italic>ccq1-T93A, ccq1-F157A/K174E</italic>, and <italic>ccq1-I175R</italic> strains as evaluated by Co-IP assays.

As a result, mutating either site only partially disrupts Ccq1-Est1 interaction. Indeed, as expected from the two-binding-site model, a Ccq1 mutant with both binding sites mutated—Ccq1-T93A/F157A/K174E completely lost its ability to bind to Est1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>). Previous mutational analysis of Est1 using the yeast two-hybrid assay identified residues in the predicted Est1 phospho-binding site (R79 and R180) that mediate the interaction between Est1 and Thr93-phosphorylated Ccq1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Moser et al., 2011</xref>). Another study found that an additional residue—K252 in the 14-3-3–like domain of Est1 is also important for Est1-Ccq1 interaction, besides for Est1-TER1 interaction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Webb and Zakian, 2012</xref>). In the Est1 structure model, K252 is on a different surface compared to phospho-Thr93 binding residue R79 and R180. Est1-K252 is therefore very likely to be part of the binding site for the HDAC2/3-like domain at the N-terminus of Ccq1. In fact, in <italic>ccq1-T93A/est1-K252E</italic> cells, which bear mutations on Ccq1 and Est1 that in combination disrupt both binding sites, Ccq1-Est1 interaction could not be detected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>). However, for strains <italic>ccq1-T93A/est1-R79A/R180A</italic> and <italic>ccq1-F157A/K174E/est1-K252E,</italic> in which mutations were introduced to only one of the Ccq1-Est1 binding sites with the other site intact, Ccq1 and Est1 interaction could still be observed at similar levels to single mutants <italic>ccq1-T93A</italic> or <italic>est1-K252E</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>). Altogether, our results indicate that phospho-Thr93 in Ccq1 contributes to one of the two binding sites that mediate Ccq1-Est1 interaction. The second Est1-interacting surface resides in the HDAC2/3-like domain at the N-terminus of Ccq1, and overlaps with the Tpz1-interacting surface.</p><p>To further understand the relationship of Tpz1 and Est1 binding to the HDAC2/3-like domain in Ccq1, we performed a competitive binding assay. This evaluated the interaction between Est1 and Thr93-phosphorylated Ccq1 in the presence of Tpz1. In this assay, Flag-tagged Ccq1 was immunoprecipitated from the whole cell extract by α-Flag agarose beads. We then titrated increasing amounts of MBP-Tpz1-CTD to the Ccq1-Est1 complex. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref> the addition of MBP-Tpz1-CTD partially displaced the Ccq1-bound Est1 at a high concentration of Tpz1. This did not occur when the Ccq1-binding defective mutant MBP-Tpz1-CTD L449A was added. Because of the entropic advantage provided by the phospho-Thr93-centered Est1-Ccq1 binding site, a high concentration of Tpz1 is needed to compete Est1 off the HDAC2/3-like domain of Ccq1. Taken together, the mutational analyses and the competitive binding assays indicate that Est1-Ccq1 interaction and Tpz1-Ccq1 interaction are mutually exclusive on the HDAC2/3-like domain of Ccq1 since both association events utilize the same binding surface on Ccq1 containing Phe157 and Lys174, et al. In addition, because phosphorylated Ccq1-Thr93 provides a secondary binding site for Ccq1-Est1 association, Tpz1-Ccq1-Est1 ternary complex can also form, likely in a transient manner, not as stable as Tpz1-Ccq1 or Ccq1-Est1 binary complexes. Thus, combined with our discovery of the TEL-patch in the N-terminal OB-domain of Tpz1, we suspect that the cell cycle-regulated Ccq1 (phospho-Thr93)-Est1 interaction can be coupled to the Tpz1 (TEL-patch)-Trt1 interaction via the Tpz1-Ccq1-Est1 intermediate complex to coordinate the recruitment of telomerase to telomeres.</p></sec><sec id="s2-6"><title>TEL-patch function is regulated in a cell cycle-dependent manner</title><p>As shown before, Rad3<sup>ATR</sup>/Tel1<sup>ATM</sup>-dependent phosphorylation of Ccq1 at Thr93 is cell cycle-regulated and peaks during late S phase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chang et al., 2013</xref>), correlating well with the temporal pattern of telomerase recruitment to the telomere (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Moser et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Webb and Zakian, 2012</xref>). Therefore, we asked whether the cell cycle-dependent phosphorylation of Ccq1 actually dictates the TEL-patch-mediated shelterin-telomerase interaction and thus restricts telomerase recruitment to late S phase. To test this, we incubated <italic>cdc25-22</italic> cells at non-permissive temperature (36°C) for 3 hr to arrest them in late G2 phase. Cells were then shifted to permissive temperature (25°C) and cell samples were collected every 20 min for co-IP analysis to monitor Tpz1-Trt1 interaction in a 4-hr cell cycle window. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A and C</xref>, the interaction between Tpz1 and Ccq1 remained almost unchanged throughout the cell cycle. Strikingly, Tpz1 and Trt1 association gradually increased after release from the G2 arrest, peaked during late S phase (100–140 min), and then decreased to the level at G2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A and D</xref>). This temporal pattern of the Tpz1-Trt1 interaction along cell cycle progression correlates very well with that of Ccq1 phosphorylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chang et al., 2013</xref>), and consequently, with that of the Ccq1-Est1 interaction promoted by Ccq1 phosphorylation, which also peaked in late S phase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E and G</xref>). Consistent with our hypothesis, when the critical Rad3<sup>ATR</sup>/Tel1<sup>ATM</sup> phosphorylation site in Ccq1—Thr93 was mutated, neither Tpz1-Trt1 interaction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B and D</xref>) nor Ccq1-Est1 interaction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6F and G</xref>) peaked in late S phase. Therefore, we propose that through an intermediate telomerase recruitment complex formed by both Ccq1-Est1 and Tpz1-Trt1 interactions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>), the cell cycle information is delivered through Ccq1 Thr93-phosphorylation to the TEL-patch on Tpz1. This in turn enables Tpz1 to directly position telomerase onto the telomere and elongate it during late S phase, after most of the genome has been replicated.<fig id="fig6" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.15470.012</object-id><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><title>Tpz1-Trt1 interaction is cell cycle-regulated.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) and (<bold>B</bold>) Co-IP assays evaluating the binding efficiency of Tpz1-Trt1 and Tpz1-Ccq1 interactions during cell cycle progression in <italic>ccq1<sup>+</sup> </italic>(<bold>A</bold>) and <italic>ccq1-T93A</italic> (<bold>B</bold>) cells.

A TEL-patch mutation causes drastically reduced association of telomerase with telomeres, and consequently an <italic>EST</italic> phenotype. Similar phenotypic consequences were previously reported for the Ccq1 Thr93 phosphorylation-deficient allele (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Moser et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Yamazaki et al., 2012</xref>). Moreover, our biochemical analyses reveal an unexpected complexity in the Ccq1-Est1 interaction involving two binding sites. As schematically illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>, we envision that in late S phase, when the DNA replication machinery completes most of the genome, Rad3<sup>ATR</sup>/Tel1<sup>ATM</sup> are activated and phosphorylate the critical Thr93 residue in Ccq1 at telomeres, priming the telomere for telomerase recruitment. Then, telomerase holoenzyme, minimally composed of Trt1-TER1-Est1, is attracted to the telomere by the cell cycle-regulated, phospho-Thr93-mediated Ccq1-Est1 interaction. At the same time, in a collaborative manner, Trt1 interacts with Tpz1 via the respective TEN domain and the TEL-patch residues, thus forming an intermediate telomerase recruitment complex that further engages the telomerase core enzyme (Trt1-TER1) at the very 3’ end of the telomere for nucleotide additions. Aided by phospho-Ccq1 Thr93, Est1-Ccq1 interaction at their second binding site takes place, resulting in dissociation of Ccq1 from Tpz1. Because Est1 may use the same surface to interact with Ccq1 as it interacts with TER1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Webb and Zakian, 2012</xref>), Est1 is likely to depart from TER1 upon its binding to Ccq1. With phosphorylation of the critical Thr93 in Ccq1 disappearing after late S phase, Ccq1-Est1 interaction diminishes accordingly. Alignment of the very 3’ end of telomeric ssDNA to the template region in TER1 might also participate in the telomerase recruitment process, and therefore, only Tpz1 on the extreme 3’ end of the telomere, but not the majority of Tpz1 on the internal telomeric regions, is involved in forming the intermediate telomerase recruitment complex.</p><p>Ever since the very beginning of the telomere research at the molecular genetics level, the noncatalytic, accessory components of the telomerase holoenzyme, such as Est1p and Est3p in budding yeast, have been demonstrated to play equally important roles in telomere elongation as the catalytic core (telomerase reverse transcriptase and telomerase RNA) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Lundblad and Szostak, 1989</xref>). Indistinguishable progressive telomere shortening phenotypes are displayed by strains either with deletion of the telomerase RNA, the reverse transcriptase subunit, or accessory proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Leonardi et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Lingner et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Lundblad and Szostak, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Webb and Zakian, 2008</xref>), suggesting that all these components work collaboratively to form a functional telomerase. Est1, whose homologs have been identified from yeasts to humans, has been proposed to recruit and activate telomerase RNP to telomeres in a cell-cycle dependent manner. Unexpectedly, a previous study discovered that the telomerase core, RNP, Trt1 and TER1 RNA, is also required for the association of Est1 with the telomere (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Webb and Zakian, 2012</xref>). Our finding that telomerase holoenzyme is recruited to telomeres via an intermediate state involving two-pronged cooperative Est1-Ccq1 and Trt1-Tpz1 interactions, uncovers the active role of Trt1 itself in the recruitment process. In addition, our model explains the intricate interdependence between Trt1, TER1, and Est1 for telomeric association of the holoenzyme.</p><p>What are the advantages of employing two cooperative telomere-telomerase interactions to recruit telomerase to telomeres? We think that this mode enables temporal and spatial regulation of telomerase recruitment. It has been shown in budding yeast that Tel1<sup>ATM</sup> prefers shorter telomeres than longer ones. We demonstrate here that the cell cycle-dependent interaction between Ccq1 and Est1 is coupled to the Tpz1 TEL patch-Trt1 interaction. Moreover, in fission yeast, strains with shorter telomeres show a higher level of Ccq1 phosphorylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Moser et al., 2011</xref>). Therefore, shorter telomeres could have more access to telomerase due to the higher level of Thr93 phosphorylation in Ccq1. After locating which telomere to elongate, interaction between the TEL-patch of Tpz1 and the catalytic subunit Trt1 further orients the very 3’ end of telomeric ssDNA via the sequence-specific Pot1/Tpz1-ssDNA interaction to the active site of Trt1. Two-interface recruitment mode has been observed in other pathways for similar purposes. For example, 53BP1, an important effector of DNA double-strand-break (DSB) response, simultaneously recognizes mononucleosomes containing dimethylated H4K20 (H4K20me2) and H2A ubiquitinated on Lys15 (H2AK15ub) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Fradet-Turcotte et al., 2013</xref>). There, it was proposed that the engagement of H4K20me2 by the Tudor domain of 53BP1 positions its ubiquitination-dependent recruitment (UDR) motif in the correct orientation to contact the epitope formed by H2AK15ub, and thus to ensure that 53BP1 responds only to bona fide DSB signaling.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Multi-functionality of Tpz1 in regulating telomerase action at telomeres</title><p>Within the fission yeast telomere shelterin complex, Tpz1 physically lies in the middle of the telomeric ssDNA and dsDNA binding proteins. Functionally, Tpz1 is positioned between the positive and negative regulators of the telomerase elongation. Tpz1 directly interacts with three other shelterin components: Poz1, Ccq1, and Pot1. This unique position of Tpz1 in the shelterin complex enables its architectural role in shelterin complex assembly and underscores its potential coordination roles in communicating the dsDNA length and/or structural information to the 3’ end of ssDNA—telomerase’s ultimate destination. In our previous studies, utilizing biochemically identified Tpz1 separation-of-function mutants that can individually but specifically disrupt Tpz1’s interactions with Poz1, Ccq1, or Pot1, we found that Tpz1-mediated complete linkage between telomere dsDNA and ssDNA binding proteins in the shelterin complex is required for defining the telomerase-nonextendible state of telomeres (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Jun et al., 2013</xref>). Disruption of the linkage on either the dsDNA binder or the ssDNA binder side of Tpz1 causes unregulated elongation of telomeres. In addition to maintaining the telomerase-nonextendible state, through its interaction with Ccq1, Tpz1 may also activate the telomerase-nonextendible state of telomeres by participating in breaking down the 'shelterin bridge'. Moreover, Lys75, which is close to the TEL-patch in the OB-fold domain of Tpz1, was demonstrated to have telomerase activation function, the step that follows successful telomerase-telomere association and alters telomerase conformation to become competent for telomere synthesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Armstrong et al., 2014</xref>). Recently, SUMOylation of Tpz1-Lys242 in late S phase was shown to enhance the Tpz1-Stn1 interaction, promote Stn1-Ten1 association with telomeres, and thus to coordinate synthesis of the telomeric lagging strand by Polα stimulated via Stn1-Ten1-Polα interaction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Hannan et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Miyagawa et al., 2014</xref>). The TEL-patch in Tpz1 and its conserved role in telomerase recruitment characterized in this work further extend the versatility of Tpz1 in telomere length homeostasis. Evidently, the ability to regulate the telomeric state together with the role of recruiting/activating telomerase and coordinating Polα are integrated into one single telomeric protein—Tpz1. This integration ensures timely, accurate, and efficient coupling of conformational transitions of the telomere to the engagement and activation of the telomerase RNP.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Conservation of telomerase recruitment mechanisms</title><p>Although the TEL-patch of the shelterin component TPP1 acting as the telomere-telomerase interface was initially discovered and extensively studied in human cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hockemeyer and Collins, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Schmidt and Cech, 2015</xref>), upstream regulatory events of TEL-patch-mediated telomerase recruitment remain to be elucidated. In contrast, regulatory pathways and factors that control telomerase recruitment have been fairly well studied in both budding and fission yeasts due to their convenient and precise genetic manipulability. For instance, in budding yeast, cell cycle-specific assembly and disassembly of active telomerase RNP at telomeres have been shown to restrict telomerase action to late S phase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Tucey and Lundblad, 2014</xref>). Moreover, telomerase tends to preferentially elongate short telomeres and Tel1<sup>ATM</sup> is enriched in short telomeres to achieve telomere length homeostasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bianchi and Shore, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Sabourin et al., 2007</xref>). Cdk1 was also shown to control the temporal recruitment of telomerase by directing the timing of Cdc13 and Stn1 phosphorylation along cell cycle progression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Li et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Liu et al., 2014</xref>).

This similarity between human and fission yeast makes us speculate that the conservation could probably be extended to other aspects of the telomerase recruitment pathway. Is it possible that human telomerase recruitment also involves two coupled telomere-telomerase interactions? What is the Ccq1-Est1 interaction equivalent in human cells? In fact, human TIN2 (Poz1 homolog) has been demonstrated to be essential for telomerase recruitment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abreu et al., 2010</xref>). DC mutations in the C-terminal region of TIN2 (not contained in Poz1) lead to defective association of TIN2 with telomerase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Frank et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Yang et al., 2011</xref>). As illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1</xref>, we speculate that the C-terminal domain of TIN2 is likely to be the Ccq1-functional equivalent in humans and interacts either with hEST1 or the telomerase RNP directly, forming the second interface between telomeres and telomerase in addition to the TPP1 (TEL-patch)-TERT (TEN domain) interaction. Moreover, TIN2 may also be subject to cell cycle-controlled post-translational modifications, and thus mediate its telomerase recruitment function in a highly regulated way.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Yeast strains, gene tagging, and mutagenesis</title><p>Fission yeast strains used in this study are listed in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Supplementary file 1</xref>.

Your article has been favorably evaluated by James Manley (Senior editor) and three reviewers, one of whom, Kathleen Collins, is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors. The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>(Note that the Title should be changed as part of the clarifications of essential revision point number 6.)</p><p>Summary:</p><p>In this thorough and thoughtful study, the authors illuminate interaction trade-offs that unify previously puzzling requirements for telomerase action at telomeres in fission yeast. Using elegant genetic and biochemical approaches, they demonstrate a series of interactions and interaction rearrangements between telomere and telomerase proteins that load and then activate telomerase for end-elongation. Biochemical specificity of interactions accounts for how short telomeres are preferentially elongated in a cell cycle dependent manner. Results from fission yeast studied here provide ideas about telomerase-telomere interaction across species.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The Tpz1-Ccq1-Est1 ternary complex should be described as speculative in existence or it should be demonstrated directly. Is it possible to directly detect the formation of the ternary complex Est1-Tpz1-Ccq1 using a pull-down of Ccq1 to show that Est1 and Tpz1-C can be pulled down in a Ccq1-dependent manner? Alternatively, since the authors are already using radio-labeled Est1p, perhaps this reagent could be used as the basis for some form of super-shift EMSA experiment to demonstrate formation of the ternary complex?</p><p>2) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref> should better document the senescent phenotype that is reported. The authors should analyze the telomere length in the tpz1-R81E/poz1D strain at later generations to make certain that the strain senesces or show that the telomeres are dependent on homologous recombination. In addition, &quot;phenocopying&quot; may not be the correct word to describe similar phenotypes resulting from different mutations.</p><p>3) The quantification shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C and D</xref> should normalize Trt1 and Ccq1 in the IP to Tpz1 bound to beads to compensate for mutant effects on protein stability and IP efficiency before making comparisons between strains.</p><p>4) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref> experiment should be re-run in a way that normalization with Input levels can be performed, or the statement that Ccq1-T93A and Est1-K252E do not interact should be qualified to reflect the technical limitation. Est1-K252E seems significantly reduced compared to wild type and other Est1 mutants in the ccq1-T93A background.</p><p>5) In their concluding model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>) the authors speculate that Ccq1 and Est1 leave the telomere while Tpz1 stays telomere bound. This data contradicts the study's cell cycle Co-IP data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>) that shows Tpz1 and Ccq1 are bound together throughout the cell cycle and the Est1-Ccq1 interaction data showing decreasing interaction during late S-phase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E</xref>). In addition, data from the Nakamura lab shows Tpz1- and Ccq1-telomere interaction as co-incident with both protein telomere interaction peaking in late S-phase (Chang et al., 2013), which contradicts this model in which Ccq1 leaves the telomere while Tpz1 remains bound. These discrepancies with the model should be accounted for.

The term transition state has a very specific meaning, and is precisely not to be considered a detectable intermediate during a given reaction pathway. In contrast the complex being proposed in the present study, while possibly transient, would be considered a bone fide intermediate complex during telomerase recruitment. In addition, since the paper describes two distinct bivalent interactions, one within the Est1-Ccq1 complex and the second within the putative ternary complex of Tpz1-Ccq1-Est1(telomerase), it is potentially confusing to the reader what exactly is meant by 'bivalent transition state'. The authors might consider revising their wording to something more typical of a transiently formed multi-protein complex (i.e. telomerase pre-priming complex, telomerase recruitment complex, etc.).</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were requested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for resubmitting your work entitled &quot;Telomerase Recruitment is Promoted by an Intermediate-State Involving both Ccq1 and the TEL-Patch of Tpz1&quot; for further consideration at <italic>eLife</italic>.

Is it possible to directly detect the formation of the ternary complex Est1-Tpz1-Ccq1 using a pull-down of Ccq1 to show that Est1 and Tpz1-C can be pulled down in a Ccq1-dependent manner? Alternatively, since the authors are already using radio-labeled Est1p, perhaps this reagent could be used as the basis for some form of super-shift EMSA experiment to demonstrate formation of the ternary complex?</italic></p><p>We thank the reviewer for this suggestion and have performed the experiments with results now shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>. Neither the active concentration of the previously utilized Est1 (35S-labeled, translated from RRL) nor the in vitro phosphorylation efficiency of Ccq1-T93 by Rad3 appeared to be high enough for the proposed experiment. To overcome these technical limitations, we overexpressed Est1 in <italic>S. pombe</italic> and pulled down Flag-Ccq1—Est1 complex using anti-Flag beads. The complex was then titrated with increasing concentrations of MBP-Tpz1-C (wild-type or Tpz1-L449A mutant that is defective in Tpz1- Ccq1 interaction). At the high concentration of Tpz1, we observed the binding of wild-type Tpz1, but not the Tpz1-L449A mutant, to the Ccq1-Est1 complex. At the same time, decreased association of Est1 with Ccq1 was also observed upon Tpz1 binding. These results indicate that Tpz1-Ccq1-Est1 ternary complex indeed exists but may be less stable than either Ccq1-Est1 or Ccq1-Tpz1 complex, suggesting Tpz1-Ccq1- Est1 be an intermediate state.</p><p><italic>2) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref> should better document the senescent phenotype that is reported. The authors should analyze the telomere length in the tpz1-R81E/poz1D strain at later generations to make certain that the strain senesces or show that the telomeres are dependent on homologous recombination. In addition, &quot;phenocopying&quot; may not be the correct word to describe similar phenotypes resulting from different mutations.</italic> </p><p>Following reviewers’ suggestion, we re-streaked the tpz1-R81E/poz1Δ strain for more generations and analyzed its telomere lengths and senescence phenotype at later generations. We found that tpz1-R81E/poz1Δ cells completely lost their telomeres and senesced after generation 150, and survivals containing circularized chromosomes to bypass the need for telomerase-dependent telomere maintenance appeared afterwards. Accordingly, in the revised manuscript, telomere Southern blot in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref> now includes the DNA sample from generation 200, which has circularized chromosome with no telomeric sequence. Evidence of circularized chromosome is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref>.</p><p><italic>3) The quantification shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C and D</xref> should normalize Trt1 and Ccq1 in the IP to Tpz1 bound to beads to compensate for mutant effects on protein stability and IP efficiency before making comparisons between strains.</italic></p><p>We did the normalization as suggested and updated <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C and D</xref> accordingly.

Est1-K252E seems significantly reduced compared to wild type and other Est1 mutants in the ccq1-T93A background.</italic></p><p>We agree that the protein level of Est1-K252E in the “Input” is reduced, compared to wild typeand other Est1 mutants in the <italic>ccq1-T93A</italic> background. Therefore, we re-carried out the co-IP experiment with the amount of <italic>est1-K252E/ccq1-T93A</italic> cells three times more than other cells in the assay. As shown in the revised <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>, for the <italic>est1-K252E/ccq1-T93A</italic> strain, even with a bit more Est1-K252E protein in the “Input” than other strains assayed in parallel, no Ccq1-Est1 interaction can be detected.</p><p><italic>5) In their concluding model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>) the authors speculate that Ccq1 and Est1 leave the telomere while Tpz1 stays telomere bound. This data contradicts the study's cell cycle Co-IP data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>) that shows Tpz1 and Ccq1 are bound together throughout the cell cycle and the Est1-Ccq1 interaction data showing decreasing interaction during late S-phase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E</xref>). In addition, data from the Nakamura lab shows Tpz1- and Ccq1-telomere interaction as co-incident with both protein telomere interaction peaking in late S-phase (Chang et al., 2013), which contradicts this model in which Ccq1 leaves the telomere while Tpz1 remains bound. These discrepancies with the model should be accounted for. Is only a minor fraction of the Tpz1-Ccq1 complex interacting with Est1 at any given time?</italic></p><p>We thank the reviewers for pointing this out. The speculation that Ccq1 and Est1 leave the telomere is based on the previous yeast 2-hybrid or 3-hybrid results showing that Est1-Ccq1 and Est1-TER1 RNA interactions are mutually exclusive (Armstrong et al., Current Biology 2014) and that Est1 mutants that impair Est1-TER1 RNA interaction also reduce Est1-Ccq1 interaction (Webb and Zakian, Genes &amp; Dev 2012). As the reviewers suggested, since only a very minor fraction of Tpz1-Ccq1 complex, located at the very 3’end of the telomeric ssDNA, interacts productively with Trt1-TER1-Est1 telomerase RNP, the leaving of this small fraction of Ccq1 from telomeres may not be detected by either Ccq1-ChIP or Ccq1- Tpz1 co-IP.</p><p>We have now further amended our description and discussion of the model to better emphasize this point, thus avoiding the confusion that readers might have. We also incorporated the cell cycle-dependent Ccq1 phosphorylation and Ccq1-Est1 interaction to the model to illustrate the dissociation of Est1 from Ccq1 when Ccq1 no longer bears phospho-T93.</p><p><italic>6) With respect to the nomenclature used to describe the proposed binding intermediate complex formed between Tpz1-Ccq1-Est1 (telomerase), the reviewers should strongly consider changing the name of the model.
