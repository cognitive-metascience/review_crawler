with high efficiency and fidelity. Although the enzymatic activities of the replicative DNA Pol III are well understood, its dynamics within the replisome are not. Here, we test the accepted view that the Pol III holoenzyme remains stably associated within the replisome. We use in vitro single-molecule assays with fluorescently labeled polymerases to demonstrate that the Pol III* complex (holoenzyme lacking the β<sub>2</sub> sliding clamp), is rapidly exchanged during processive DNA replication. Nevertheless, the replisome is highly resistant to dilution in the absence of Pol III* in solution. We further show similar exchange in live cells containing labeled clamp loader and polymerase. These observations suggest a concentration-dependent exchange mechanism providing a balance between stability and plasticity, facilitating replacement of replisomal components dependent on their availability in the environment.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.23932.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.23932.001</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>DNA replication</kwd><kwd>DNA polymerase</kwd><kwd>single-molecule</kwd><kwd>multiprotein complexes</kwd><kwd>fluorescence microscopy</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd><italic>E. coli</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Australian Government Research Training Program Scholarship</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Lewis</surname><given-names>Jacob S</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001712</institution-id><institution>Stichting voor Fundamenteel Onderzoek der Materie</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>12CMCE03</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Spenkelink</surname><given-names>Lisanne M</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>GM32335</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Cox</surname><given-names>Michael M</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000923</institution-id><institution>Australian Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>DP150100956</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Dixon</surname><given-names>Nicholas E</given-names></name><name><surname>van Oijen</surname><given-names>Antoine M</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000923</institution-id><institution>Australian Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>FL140100027</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>van Oijen</surname><given-names>Antoine M</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The canonical model that the bacterial replisome tightly holds on to its polymerases is challenged by the visualization of rapid holoenzyme exchange, both in vitro and in vivo.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> replisome requires participation of 13 different proteins. Ten of them form the DNA polymerase III (Pol III) holoenzyme (HE), which is arranged into three functionally distinct and stably bound subassemblies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>): αεθ forms the Pol III core that has DNA polymerase activity; β<sub>2</sub> is the sliding clamp needed for stable association with the primer–template DNA; and τ<sub>n</sub>γ<sub>(3–n)</sub>δδ’ψχ (where n = 2 or 3 in the HE) is the clamp loader complex (CLC) that loads β<sub>2</sub> onto DNA and is the central organizer of the replisome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Robinson and van Oijen, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Duderstadt et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Lewis et al., 2016</xref>). The CLC interacts with two or three Pol III cores via the α–τ interaction, forming stable complexes termed Pol III* (i.e. HE lacking only the sliding clamp). Pol III* ensures the organization of the cores needed for coordinated DNA synthesis on the two template strands (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Wu et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Onrust et al., 1995</xref>) and is essential for cell survival (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Blinkova et al., 1993</xref>). Although physical coupling of leading and lagging strand cores in one HE particle requires the lagging strand polymerase to undergo cycles of release and rebinding from one Okazaki fragment to the next, the molecular mechanisms underlying its cycling are still debated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Dohrmann et al., 2011</xref>). There is, however, consensus that Pol III is reused rather than replaced for successive Okazaki fragment synthesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Tanner et al., 2008</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">2009</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Yao et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Georgescu et al., 2011</xref>). Thus, the replisome is believed to be a highly stable entity.<fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.23932.002</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Single-molecule rolling-circle replication assay.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Canonical view of the organization of the <italic>E. coli</italic> replication fork. The DnaB helicase encircles the lagging strand, facilitates unwinding of dsDNA through ATP hydrolysis, and recruits DnaG primase for synthesis of RNA primers that initiate synthesis of 1–2 kb Okazaki fragments on the lagging strand. The extruded single-stranded (ss) DNA is protected by ssDNA-binding protein, SSB. The Pol III holoenzyme (HE) uses the ssDNA of both strands as a template for coupled, simultaneous synthesis of a pair of new DNA duplex molecules. The β<sub>2</sub> sliding clamp confers high processivity on the Pol III HE by tethering the αεθ Pol III core onto the DNA. The clamp loader complex (CLC) assembles the β<sub>2</sub> clamp onto RNA primer junctions. Up to three Pol III cores interact with the CLC through its τ subunits to form the Pol III* complex, and the τ subunits also interact with DnaB, thus coupling the Pol III HE to the helicase.

Reconciling these different observations, we here demonstrate the presence of a novel exchange mechanism that allows Pol III* to remain stably associated with the replisome under conditions of high dilution, yet facilitates rapid exchange at nanomolar concentrations.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>In vitro single-molecule observation of Pol III dynamics</title><p>We use a single-molecule approach to directly visualize the dynamics of Pol III complexes at the replication fork (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Mok and Marians, 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Tanner et al., 2009</xref>). A rolling-circle DNA amplification scheme is used to observe highly processive DNA synthesis in real time, while imaging Pol III complexes entering and leaving the replisome. Using the minimal set of 12 proteins required to support coupled leading and lagging strand synthesis, we allow active replisomes to self assemble onto pre-formed replication forks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Tanner et al., 2008</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">2009</xref>). A 5'-flap within a 7.2 kb double-stranded (ds) circular DNA substrate is anchored to the surface of a microfluidic flow cell and replication is initiated by introducing a laminar flow of buffer with the components required for coupled leading and lagging strand synthesis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). As replication proceeds, the newly synthesized leading strand becomes part of the circle and later acts as a template for lagging strand synthesis. With the lagging strand attached to the surface and the continuously growing DNA product stretched in the buffer flow, the dsDNA circle moves away from the anchor point. Replication is visualized by real-time near-TIRF fluorescence imaging of stained dsDNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>).

We also observe Pol III that remains bound to the DNA on the lagging strand behind the replication fork, evident as horizontal lines in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>. We reasoned that these correspond to polymerases bound to the 3'-termini of Okazaki fragments. We repeated the experiment in the presence of Pol I and/or DNA ligase; Pol I replaces RNA primers with DNA and ligase seals the remaining nick.

To demonstrate that green Pol III cores in a Pol III* complex do not exchange with the red ones from another Pol III*, we combined them in a 1:1 ratio for 1 hr at 37°C (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>), then imaged the mixture on the surface of a coverslip at the single-molecule level (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>). Consistent with the stable interaction between α in the core and τ in the CLC, exchange of Pol III cores was not observed. It remained possible, however, that the nature and strength of the α–τ interaction is different at a step in lagging strand replication that involves exchange of Pol III cores within the Pol III* complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Leu et al., 2003</xref>). To test this possibility, we mixed pre-assembled red and green Pol III* complexes in a 1:1 ratio and used them in a bulk rolling-circle replication experiment in an eightfold molar excess over 5'-biotinylated flap-primed dsDNA template. Under these conditions, most Pol III*s will have participated in replication at the fork, as long leading strand and shorter lagging strand products are generated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>). Next, the newly synthesized DNA was removed from proteins by its immobilization on streptavidin beads, and subsequent single-molecule imaging of the released protein fraction on the surface of a coverslip showed no co-localization of red and green Pol III cores (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). This result confirms that the functional unit exchanging at the replication fork is the entire Pol III* complex; the interaction between the τ subunit of the CLC and α of Pol III must remain intact during DNA replication, thus challenging the previously suggested model of a τ processivity switch on the lagging strand (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Leu et al., 2003</xref>).<fig-group><fig id="fig3" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.23932.009</object-id><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>Pre-assembled Pol III* complexes do not exchange Pol III core.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Red and green Pol III* are separately pre-assembled by treatment at 37°C for 15 min (30 nM Pol III core and 10 nM τ<sub>3</sub>-CLC).

Those studies used assays in which replisomes were assembled, replication initiated, and the reactions rapidly diluted to measure the stability of synthesizing replisomes on DNA. To place our observations of dynamic exchange of Pol III* in context of the previous work, we carried out single-molecule pre-assembly replication assays (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Yao et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Tanner et al., 2011</xref>) using the red Pol III*. In this experiment, the replisome is pre-assembled onto the rolling-circle template in solution. Subsequently, the template is attached to the surface of a flow cell, which is then washed to remove all unbound proteins. Replication is initiated by introduction of a replication solution that omits Pol III* and helicase. Since the absence of free Pol III* in solution makes polymerase exchange impossible, we hypothesized that Pol III would be recycled within the replisome, enabling its sustained participation in processive DNA replication. These conditions indeed support highly processive DNA replication (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>), with synthesis rates and processivities identical to a situation with Pol III* in solution and consistent with values reported previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Mok and Marians, 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">McInerney et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Tanner et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Yao et al., 2009</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D,E</xref>). Further, we observed photobleaching without recovery, consistent with the original, pre-assembled Pol III* remaining stably associated within the replisome. As further confirmation of the robustness of the pre-assembled replisome in the absence of competing polymerases and the easy displacement of Pol III* upon challenge, we initiate replication by pre-assembly of replisomes, normally supporting highly processive synthesis, and challenge them with Pol III core. The observation of a sharp reduction in processivity is consistent with the displacement of the Pol III* from the replication fork by the Pol III cores, which are unable to support coordinated leading and lagging strand synthesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Wu et al., 1992</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Quantification of exchange time of Pol III* in vitro</title><p>To quantify the concentration-dependent exchange times of Pol III* during coupled DNA replication, we performed in vitro single-molecule FRAP (fluorescence recovery after photobleaching) experiments. We visualized red Pol III* entering and leaving the replication fork at different concentrations using the same rolling-circle amplification scheme as described in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>. Instead of continuous imaging at constant laser power, we periodically bleached all Pol III* at the replication fork using a high-laser power (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>). By bleaching the fluorescence signal of Pol III* complexes, we can monitor the recovery of the florescence signal as unbleached Pol III*s from solution exchange into the replisome (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>). We monitored the recovery of the fluorescence signal and calculated the average intensity after each FRAP pulse over time (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>). By measuring the single-molecule FRAP of Pol III* over a concentration series spanning four orders of magnitude and fitting the rate of signal recovery, we obtained the characteristic exchange time of Pol III* into active replisomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>). At a total Pol III* concentration of 13 nM, the fluorescence signal recovers rapidly (characteristic exchange time, τ = 1.85 s), while at 30 pM the fluorescence signal is 20-fold slower to recover (τ = 42 s). These observations are in agreement with our previous two-color experiments, indicating that the rate of exchange is dependent on Pol III* concentration.<fig-group><fig id="fig5" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.23932.020</object-id><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><title>Quantification of Pol III* exchange time using single-molecule FRAP.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) (Top panel) Imaging sequence used during the FRAP experiments.

We imaged cells in which the clamp loader and core complexes were labeled at their C-termini with yellow and red fluorescent proteins, respectively (τ-YPet, ε-mKate2). As observed previously, these fusions remain fully functional (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Reyes-Lamothe et al., 2010</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>). These cells were immobilized on a (3-aminopropyl)triethoxysilane-treated coverslip and τ-YPet and ε-mKate2 foci were imaged simultaneously. Fluorescent proteins bound to large structures such as the nucleoid diffuse slowly and thus present in our images as diffraction-limited foci, whereas the signal from proteins freely diffusing through the cytosol blurs over the entire cell (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Robinson et al., 2015</xref>). To monitor exchange of polymerase molecules at replisomes, the fluorescence intensity of individual replication foci was tracked over time. We noticed that once the population of fluorescent molecules had become partially nonfluorescent by irreversible photobleaching, instances of synchronized intensity fluctuations of τ-YPetand ε-mKate2 within the replisome foci could be observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>). To determine whether these intensity fluctuations were truly correlated, that is, whether they could be explained by the exchange of Pol III*, we used cross-correlation analysis, a powerful unbiased method that enables the calculation of (i) the extent of similarity between two fluctuating signals and (ii) on which timescales that similarity occurs. The average cross-correlation function calculated for 1210 foci in 480 cells showed a clear positive cross-correlation peak, consistent with synchronous exchange of τ-YPet and ε-mKate2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>, black line). To show that this peak arises due to protein dynamics, we fixed cells with formaldehyde to arrest all cellular processes and demonstrate the absence of a cross-correlation peak (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>, gray line). To eliminate the possibility of correlated intensity changes due to laser fluctuations, we calculated the cross-correlation function for random pairs of τ-YPet and ε-mKate2 foci within the same field of view, but from different cells. Also here, no cross-correlation peak was detected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>, red line). Our experimental data cannot be explained by exchange of core only, the uncoupled exchange of both ε and τ, or even the complete absence of exchange (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2</xref>). In support of Pol III* exchange, a positive cross-correlation peak can, however, be explained by simultaneous exchange of ε and τ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2</xref>).<fig-group><fig id="fig6" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.23932.022</object-id><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><title>Visualization of Pol III* exchange in vivo.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Left: image of τ (orange) and ε (blue) foci within a single <italic>E. coli</italic> cell, averaged over 40 s.

Assuming all ε and τ form functional Pol III* complexes within the cell, these concentrations of ε and τ would correspond to ~23 nM Pol III* per cell. These in vivo measurements are consistent with exchange times measured for the highest concentration of Pol III* in vitro (a few seconds at 13 nM). Given these observations, we conclude that Pol III* exchange occurs during coupled DNA replication in vivo.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>We conclude that the <italic>E. coli</italic> replisome strikes a balance between stability and plasticity. In the absence of Pol III* in solution, it retains its original polymerase and forms a highly stable complex resistant to dilution. In its presence, Pol III* readily exchanges into the replisome at a rate that is dependent on its concentration. Such a concentration-dependent exchange mechanism seems counterintuitive but can be rationalized through a complex protein–protein and protein–DNA interaction network controlled and maintained by multiple dynamic interactions. Under dilute conditions, transient disruption of any one of these interactions would be followed by its rapid re-formation, preventing dissociation. If, however, there are competing Pol III*s in close proximity to the fork, one of these can bind at a transiently vacated binding site (e.g. on the β<sub>2</sub> sliding clamp or DnaB helicase) and consequently be at a sufficiently high local concentration to compete out the original Pol III* for binding to the other sites. Such concentration-dependent exchange has recently been reported for other systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Loparo et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Graham et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Geertsema et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Gibb et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Chen et al., 2015</xref>) and mathematically described by multisite competitive exchange mechanisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Sing et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Åberg et al., 2016</xref>). Further evidence for a multisite mechanism comes from comparison of the number of Pol III*s in or near the replisome at different concentrations. We quantified the number of Pol III*s at the replication fork in the in vitro experiments by normalizing the fluorescence intensity of the replisomal spot to the intensity of a single Pol III* (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4—figure supplement 3</xref>). The peaks of the distributions are at one Pol III* per replisome (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref>), consistent with in vivo observations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Reyes-Lamothe et al., 2010</xref>). Nevertheless, we find that often more than one Pol III* is present in the replisome. As its concentration increases, the binding equilibria are pushed toward occupancy of all binding sites and more than one Pol III* is associated with the replisome. At lower concentrations, Pol III* still exchanges, but the average number of Pol III*s is reduced. Our observation of Pol III* exchange in living cells shows that such a multisite exchange mechanism is a physiologically relevant pathway accessible to the replisome during coupled DNA replication. Such a mechanism may have direct implications for the mechanisms used by the replisome to deal with obstacles such as DNA damage and transcription. The ability for the replisome to rapidly exchange components in the presence of competing factors in a concentration-dependent manner could allow for components to be easily replaced from solution and provide frequent but limited access to other binding partners, such as translesion synthesis polymerases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Sutton, 2010</xref>), without violating fundamental chemical and thermodynamic principles.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Replication proteins</title><p><italic>E. coli</italic> DNA replication proteins were produced as described previously: the β<sub>2</sub> sliding clamp (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Oakley et al., 2003</xref>), SSB (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Mason et al., 2013</xref>), the DnaB<sub>6</sub>(DnaC)<sub>6</sub> helicase–loader complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Jergic et al., 2013</xref>), DnaG primase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Stamford et al., 1992</xref>), the Pol III τ<sub>3</sub>δδ’χψ clamp loader (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Tanner et al., 2008</xref>) and Pol III αεθ core (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Tanner et al., 2008</xref>).

The chamber was placed on an inverted microscope (Nikon Eclipse Ti-E) with a CFI Apo TIRF 100x oil-immersion TIRF objective (NA 1.49, Nikon, Japan) and connected to a syringe pump (Adelab Scientific, Australia) for flow of buffer.</p><p>Conditions for coupled DNA replication under continuous presence of all proteins were adapted from previously described methods (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Tanner et al., 2008</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">2009</xref>). All in vitro single-molecule experiments were performed at least four times. Briefly, 30 nM DnaB<sub>6</sub>(DnaC)<sub>6</sub> was incubated with 1.5 nM biotinylated ds M13 template in replication buffer (25 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.9, 50 mM potassium glutamate, 10 mM Mg(OAc)<sub>2</sub>, 40 μg/ml BSA, 0.1 mM EDTA and 5 mM dithiothreitol) with 1 mM ATP at 37°C for 30 s. This mixture was loaded into the flow cell at 100 μl/min for 40 s and then at 10 μl/min. An imaging buffer was made with 1 mM UV-aged Trolox, 0.8% (<italic>w</italic>/<italic>v</italic>) glucose, 0.12 mg/ml glucose oxidase, and 0.012 mg/ml catalase (to increase the lifetime of the fluorophores and reduce blinking), 1 mM ATP, 250 μM CTP, GTP and UTP, and 50 μM dCTP, dGTP, dATP and dTTP in replication buffer. Pol III* was assembled in situ by incubating τ<sub>3</sub>δδ’χψ (410 nM) and SNAP-labeled Pol III cores (1.2 μM) in imaging buffer at 37°C for 90 s. Replication was initiated by flowing in the imaging buffer containing 6.7 nM Pol III* (unless specified otherwise), 30 nM β<sub>2</sub>, 300 nM DnaG, 250 nM SSB<sub>4</sub>, and 30 nM DnaB<sub>6</sub>(DnaC)<sub>6</sub> at 10 μl/min. Reactions were carried out 31°C, maintained by an electrically heated chamber (Okolab, Burlingame, CA).</p><p>Double-stranded DNA was visualized in real time by staining it with 150 nM SYTOX orange (Invitrogen) excited by a 568 nm laser (Coherent, Santa Clara, CA; Sapphire 568–200 CW) at 150 μW/cm. The red and green Pol III* were excited at 700 mW/cm<sup>2</sup> with 647 nm (Coherent, Obis 647–100 CW) and 488 nm (Coherent, Sapphire 488–200 CW) lasers, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). The signals were separated via dichroic mirrors and appropriate filter sets (Chroma, Bellows Falls, VT). Imaging was done with either an EMCCD (Photometics, Tucson, AZ; Evolve 512 Delta) or a sCMOS camera (Andor, UK; Zyla 4.2). The analysis was done with ImageJ using in-house built plugins. The rate of replication of a single molecule was obtained from its trajectory and calculated for each segment that has constant slope.</p><p>Conditions for the pre-assembly replication reactions were adapted from published methods (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Tanner et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Georgescu et al., 2011</xref>). Solution 1 was prepared as 30 nM DnaB<sub>6</sub>(DnaC)<sub>6</sub>, 1.5 nM biotinylated ds M13 substrate and 1 mM ATP in replication buffer. This was incubated at 37°C for 3 min. Solution 2 contained 60 μM dCTP and dGTP, 6.7 nM red Pol III*, and 74 nM β<sub>2</sub> in replication buffer (without dATP and dTTP). Solution 2 was added to an equal volume of solution 1 and incubated for 6 min at 37°C. This was then loaded onto the flow cell at 100 μl/min for 1 min and then 10 μl/min for 10 min. The flow cell was washed with replication buffer containing 60 μM dCTP and dGTP. Replication was finally initiated by flowing in the imaging buffer containing 50 nM β<sub>2</sub>, 300 nM DnaG and 250 nM SSB<sub>4</sub> at 10 μl/min.</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>Measurement of the stoichiometry of Pol III*s at the replisome</title><p>The average intensity of a single labeled Pol III core (6 pM) was calculated by immobilization on the surface of a cleaned microscope coverslip in imaging buffer. The imaging was under the same conditions as used during the single-molecule rolling-circle experiments. Using ImageJ with in-house built plugins, we calculated the integrated intensity for every Pol III core in a field of view after applying a local background subtraction. The histograms obtained were fit with a Gaussian distribution function using MATLAB 2014b, to give a mean intensity of 5100 ± 2000 for the red and 1600 ± 700 for the green Pol III core (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s4">Figure 4—figure supplement 4</xref>). To measure the intensity of the fluorescent spot at the replication fork, we tracked its position and integrated the intensity for both colors simultaneously over time. Given there is no decay in fluorescence intensity of labeled Pol III cores as a function of DNA length under near-TIRF imaging conditions during DNA replication (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s5">Figure 4—figure supplement 5</xref>), we calculated the total number of Pol III*s at every time point during coupled DNA replication by dividing these intensities by the intensity of a single Pol III*. Subsequent histograms were fit to four (6.7 nM) or three (0.3 nM) Gaussians centered at integral numbers of Pol III* (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4—figure supplement 3</xref>) using MATLAB 2014b.</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>Fluorescent chromosomal fusions</title><p>The strain EAW192 (<italic>dnaQ-mKate2</italic>) was constructed using a modified version of the λ RED recombination system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Huang et al., 1997</xref>), introducing a mutant FRT–Kan<sup>R</sup>–wtFRT cassette. To select for recombinants, cells were plated on LB-agar supplemented with 40 µg/ml of kanamycin and grown overnight. Kanamycin-resistant strains were further screened for ampicillin sensitivity, to ensure that cells had been cured of the λ RED plasmid pKD46. The two-color strain EAW203 (<italic>dnaX-YPet</italic>, <italic>dnaQ-mKate2</italic>) was constructed by P1 transduction. JJC5945 cells (<italic>dnaX-YPet</italic>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Robinson et al., 2015</xref>) were first treated with pLH29 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Huang et al., 1997</xref>) to remove existing Kan<sup>R</sup> markers, then infected with P1 grown on EAW192 (<italic>dnaQ-mKate2</italic>) cells. Transductants were selected for kanamycin resistance.</p></sec><sec id="s4-10"><title>Growth rates of fluorescent chromosomal fusions</title><p>Single colonies of wild-type <italic>E. coli</italic> MG1655 and derivatives containing the C-terminal chromosomal <italic>dnaQ</italic> and <italic>dnaX</italic> fusions were used to inoculate 5 ml of LB broth (with 34 μg/ml kanamycin, if required) and grown at 37°C with shaking overnight. LB broth (100 ml) was inoculated with 1.0 × 10<sup>5</sup> cells/ml from overnight cultures. Subsequent growth of each strain was monitored at 37°C with shaking by determining OD<sub>600</sub> every 30 min for 9.5 hr. The doubly labeled <italic>dnaX-YPet dnaQ-mKate2</italic> cells grew only slightly more slowly than wild-type cells (division time = 33 ± 4 min cf. 33 ± 8 min) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>), indicating that labeling the ε and τ components of the replisome does not significantly disrupt DNA replication.</p></sec><sec id="s4-11"><title>In vivo single-molecule visualization assays</title><p>The cells were grown at 37°C in EZ rich defined medium (Teknova) that included 0.2% (<italic>w/v</italic>) glucose. For imaging, a PDMS well was placed on top of a coverslip that was functionalized with (3-aminopropyl)triethoxysilane (BioScientific, Australia) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Robinson et al., 2015</xref>). The cells were immobilized on the surface of the well, which was then placed on the heated stage (Okolab) of the microscope. Imaging was done at 37°C. The τ-YPet and ε-mKate2 were excited at 0.03 mW/cm<sup>2</sup> with 514 nm (Coherent, Sapphire 514–150 CW) and 3 W/cm<sup>2</sup> with 568 nm (Coherent, Sapphire 568–200 CW) lasers, respectively. The signals were separated via a beam splitter (Photometrics, DVΛ Multichannel Imaging System) and appropriate filter sets (Chroma). Imaging was done with an EMCCD camera (Photometrics, Evolve Delta). The visualization of foci in living cells was performed in triplicate. The image processing was done with ImageJ using in-house built plugins.</p><p>The concentrations or ε and τ were determined as described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Robinson et al., 2015</xref>) by measuring the total fluorescence within each cell and dividing by the mean intensity of a single molecule. To measure the total fluorescence, we first imaged 141 wild-type MG1655 cells to determine the cellular autofluorescence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s3">Figure 6—figure supplement 3A</xref>). We found the autofluorescence to be constant for the duration of our measurements. We then imaged 273 τ-YPet, ε-mKate2 cells in 20 fields of view. The background fluorescence from the microscope coverslip was determined by fitting the photobleaching per field of view with a single-exponential decay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s3">Figure 6—figure supplement 3B</xref>). The mean cellular intensities were corrected for the background and cellular autofluorescence. We then fitted individual cell photobleaching curves to obtain the amplitudes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s3">Figure 6—figure supplement 3C</xref>).</p><p>To find the intensity of a single-molecule, photobleaching trajectories of single foci were determined. The τ and ε foci were identified by making average projections of movies. The intensity over time trajectories for each focus as it photobleached was measured. Next, the local background fluorescence around each focus was subtracted. Trajectories showed step-wise intensity transitions corresponding to photobleaching of single fluorescent molecules (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s3">Figure 6—figure supplement 3D</xref> inset). These transitions were fit by change-point analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Watkins and Yang, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Duderstadt et al., 2016</xref>). A histogram of the step sizes showed a relatively narrow distribution (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s3">Figure 6—figure supplement 3D</xref>). We found the mean intensity of a single molecule by fitting with a Gaussian distribution. These were 158 ± 2 for ε and 130 ± 5 for τ (mean ± s.e.).</p><p>To find the total fluorescence intensity per cell, the mean cell intensity was multiplied by the area of the cell. This was then divided by the single-molecule intensity. It was determined that there are 104 ± 3 copies of ε and 96 ± 6 copies of τ per cell. This corresponds to a concentration of 72 ± 3 nM for ε and 67 ± 5 nM for τ. If we assume that all ε and τ are part of a Pol III* complex this tells us that there is 23 nM Pol III* in the cell. The intensities of the foci were measured by integrating the intensity of the peak and subtracting the mean local background intensity. The average cross-correlation functions were calculated using MATLAB 2014b (Mathworks). The cross-correlation was fit with an exponential decay and gave a characteristic time scale of 4 ± 2 s (mean ± error of the fit) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>).</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We thank Harshad Ghodke for helpful discussions and Yao Wang and Zhi-Qiang Xu for contributing reagents.

An emerging picture in the field is that components of tightly associated complexes can exchange rapidly, provided an excess of components is present. This paper applies this concept to the exchange of the Pol III* at a replication fork. The exchange is studied by a single molecule approach, giving very detailed data regarding this question. Furthermore, the authors take the work into the whole cell, and find that the exchange still occurs even in the context of the cell. The data are presented clearly, and the manuscript is well written. The findings presented in this paper are fundamentally important to the field's understanding of how the replisome functions. Classically, the replisome is thought to be a stable (non-dynamic) structure, but recent work has begun to indicate that this picture is not correct. In this paper, the authors present strong evidence with regards to the dynamic nature of the replisome, potentially changing the view of how this fundamental process functions in vivo. In particular, Pol III* holoenzyme seems to rapidly exchange in and out of the replisome.</p><p>Although concentration-dependent exchange of polymerase has been reported before in the case of T7 replication machinery (this needs to be explicitly mentioned), this appears to be the first example of showing the same for <italic>E. coli</italic> in vitro, and we are not aware of an in vivo report, except by a recent <italic>eLife</italic> paper from University of Washington where they reported that the replicative helicase is disassembling and reassembling due to replication-transcription conflict. Therefore, the work is generally suitable for <italic>eLife</italic>. However, there are some missed opportunities, especially in solidifying the claim of concentration-dependent exchange in vivo, and more detailed summary of prior work is needed.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) It is not clear whether the concentration dependence of the turnover rate (a key point) observed in vitro is also true in vivo. Since this concentration dependence is the main new finding, could the authors show this in live cells to strengthen this point? This is a difficult task but potential growth rate difference may modulate the concentrations of Pol III* in solution and perhaps facilitate such an analysis. Alternatively, the authors could try to conditionally deplete one of the core components and observe the dynamics as the concentrations of the proteins decrease over time. We prefer if the in vivo concentration be established experimentally. If the authors don't feel that this is necessary, then they should explain why this is the case.</p><p>2) Since the authors do not show concentration dependence in vivo, how can the authors distinguish turnover of the Pol III* complex in vivo from disassembly of the entire replisome due to potential obstacles? If the authors calculate the average rate of turnover from the intensity traces in vivo, they could potentially correlate this with the in vitro numbers to support their point.</p><p>3) They show evidence of exchange in vitro but there is no attempt to quantify the kinetics as a function of protein concentration in solution and put it in a firm mathematical footing. This is a glaring omission especially because the same group has put forward the mathematical framework.</p><p>4) It remains possible that only the cores exchange between Pol III*s at a replication fork. The control was performed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>, but in that experiment the Pol III*'s are not at a working fork with DnaB where things might be different. For example, two Pol III*'s might bind one fork (required intermediate for wholesale exchange), and this would increase their local concentration of cores to a very high level, at which time the cores might begin exchanging between the two Pol III*'s. It is not clear that the clamp loader is also getting recycled in the in vitro experiment because it is not labeled fluorescently. The lack of exchange in the context of Pol III* alone is not sufficient because one cannot rule out the possibility of the interaction becoming more dynamic in the context of replisome. It seems the better side of caution for the authors to add a statement that explains that things could possibly be different at a moving fork, such that the cores exchange among two Pol III*s. One could note, that even if this occurs, it still runs along the same message line of the paper, that seemingly tight complexes in fact are quite fluid when an excess of a component is present.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.23932.027</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>Essential revisions:</italic> </p><p><italic>1) It is not clear whether the concentration dependence of the turnover rate (a key point) observed in vitro is also true in vivo.

We agreed that changing the growth rate by using different growth media might be a way to modulate replisomal protein concentrations. Therefore, we propagated cells containing <italic>dnaX-YPet</italic> and <italic>dnaQ-mKate2</italic> chromosomal fusions in M9 minimal medium with either glucose or acetate as the sole carbon source. It is well documented that such media decrease the growth rate of <italic>E. coli</italic>. For example, M9-acetate medium decreases the growth rate by ~4-fold (Pierucci (1972) J Bacteriol 109:848–854, Volkmer &amp; Heinemann (2011) PLosONE 6: e23126). We compared the fluorescence intensities of ε and τ in these cells under the same experimental conditions used for previous in vivo measurements in EZ rich glucose medium. However, we found no difference in the intensities of either ε or τ subunits, with intensities (arb. units) of 2,053 versus 2,069 for ε and 674 versus 744 for τ in M9-glucose and acetate media, respectively. We believe that to reliably modulate the concentration of Pol III* components in vivo would require changing the entire equilibrium of protein expression in the cell. It might be possible to deplete each component of the Pol III* complex by multiple-gene silencing using antisense RNAs. However, such an approach would require a considerable investment in resources and time and we feel is outside the scope of our current study.</p><p>As requested by the reviewers, we have determined the concentrations of ε and τ in vivo under the same experimental conditions we used to establish Pol III* exchange in vivo by cross-correlation analysis. These new experiments and conclusions are described in subsection “Exchange of Pol III* complexes in live cells” and shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s3">Figure 6—figure supplement 3</xref>. We found that the in vivo concentrations of ε and τ are 72 ± 3 nM and 67 ± 5 nM, respectively. Assuming that all ε and τ are complexed to form Pol III*, the concentration of Pol III* would be 23 nM. This concentration is ~3-fold higher than concentrations of Pol III* in two-color in vitro experiments where rapid exchange is observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>).</p><p><italic>2) Since the authors do not show concentration dependence in vivo, how can the authors distinguish turnover of the Pol III* complex in vivo from disassembly of the entire replisome due to potential obstacles? If the authors calculate the average rate of turnover from the intensity traces in vivo, they could potentially correlate this with the in vitro numbers to support their point.</italic> </p><p>Indeed, given the complex, crowded intracellular environment, the exchange behavior within the cell could be quite different. It is difficult to predict what effect potential obstacles arising from DNA repair and recombination will have on the exchange of Pol III*. We therefore calculated the exchange time from the cross-correlation function, as the reviewers suggested. From this we found a time of 4 ± 2 s. This is of the same order of magnitude as the in vitro exchange times we found at similar Pol III* concentrations (~few seconds). We conclude that the Pol III* dynamics we observe are mostly due to Pol III* exchange. This result is now described in subsection “Exchange of Pol III* complexes in live cells” and shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref> (previously <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>).</p><p><italic>3) They show evidence of exchange in vitro but there is no attempt to quantify the kinetics as a function of protein concentration in solution and put it in a firm mathematical footing. This is a glaring omission especially because the same group has put forward the mathematical framework.</italic> </p><p>To address this important issue, we have extended our experiments to include in vitro single-molecule FRAP to quantify the timescales of Pol III* exchange as a function of concentration. These experiments and conclusions are described in subsection “Quantification of exchange time of Pol III* in vitro” and shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>. The main observation is that we can modulate the timescales of exchange of Pol III* in a concentration-dependent manner. At high concentrations, recovery of the fluorescence signal associated with Pol III* is rapid and at lower concentrations the recovery is much slower.</p><p>We can use the exchange times derived from in vitro FRAP experiments to quantify the kinetics as a function of protein concentration using the mathematical model described in Åberg et al., 2016. Using the mathematical framework, a <italic>K</italic><sub>D</sub> of 7 nM is derived, representing the average of all interactions that hold the Pol III* complex at the fork. While this number is interesting and likely tells us something about the requirements for the strengths of the interactions balancing stability and exchange, we do not have a sufficiently complete picture of all the interactions within the replisome to use this value in any meaningful interpretive manner.</p><p><italic>4) It remains possible that only the cores exchange between Pol III*s at a replication fork. The control was performed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>, but in that experiment the Pol III*'s are not at a working fork with DnaB where things might be different. For example, two Pol III*'s might bind one fork (required intermediate for wholesale exchange), and this would increase their local concentration of cores to a very high level, at which time the cores might begin exchanging between the two Pol III*'s. It is not clear that the clamp loader is also getting recycled in the in vitro experiment because it is not labeled fluorescently. The lack of exchange in the context of Pol III* alone is not sufficient because one cannot rule out the possibility of the interaction becoming more dynamic in the context of replisome. It seems the better side of caution for the authors to add a statement that explains that things could possibly be different at a moving fork, such that the cores exchange among two Pol III*s. One could note, that even if this occurs, it still runs along the same message line of the paper, that seemingly tight complexes in fact are quite fluid when an excess of a component is present.</italic> </p><p>To address this important issue, we designed an experiment that allows us to image individual Pol III*s that have participated in coupled DNA replication. We performed a bulk rolling-circle replication experiment using a 8-fold excess of Pol III* over DNA, with a total Pol III* concentration of 6.6 nM. At this concentration of Pol III*, the time scale of its exchange is approximately a few seconds (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). We allowed the reaction to proceed for 20 minutes. By using this strategy, we can be confident that all Pol III*s in solution have participated in DNA replication at the fork at least several times. We then imaged these Pol III*s at the single-molecule level and did not observe any co-localization between red and green Pol IIIs. These results and conclusions are described in subsection “Exchange of Pol III* complexes in vitro” and have been added to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>.</p></body></sub-article></article>
