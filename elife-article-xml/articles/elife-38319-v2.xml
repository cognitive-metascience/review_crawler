sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) by the SR-Ca<sup>2+</sup>-ATPase (SERCA). We recently discovered a micropeptide named DWORF (<underline>DW</underline>arf <underline>O</underline>pen <underline>R</underline>eading <underline>F</underline>rame) that enhances SERCA activity by displacing phospholamban (PLN), a potent SERCA inhibitor. Here we show that DWORF has a higher apparent binding affinity for SERCA than PLN and that DWORF overexpression mitigates the contractile dysfunction associated with PLN overexpression, substantiating its role as a potent activator of SERCA. Additionally, using a well-characterized mouse model of dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) due to genetic deletion of the muscle-specific LIM domain protein (MLP), we show that DWORF overexpression restores cardiac function and prevents the pathological remodeling and Ca<sup>2+</sup> dysregulation classically exhibited by MLP knockout mice. Our results establish DWORF as a potent activator of SERCA within the heart and as an attractive candidate for a heart failure therapeutic.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.38319.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>The heart is a muscular organ that contracts regularly to pump blood around the body, ensuring that nutrients and oxygen are carried to the cells and organs. Heart failure is a disease where the heart muscle becomes weakened, does not beat as strongly, and cannot pump blood as well as it should. Eventually, the heart can no longer deliver enough blood to meet the body’s needs.</p><p>Although heart failure is a widespread disease, we still do not fully understand its underlying causes and the molecular machinery driving its progression. However, one common feature in many cases of heart failure is a problem with the supply of calcium to the heart muscle. Calcium is the molecule responsible for the process of muscle contraction; the strength of contraction depends on the amount of calcium available. Movement of calcium within heart cells is in turn controlled by an enzyme pump called SERCA.</p><p>In 2016, researchers identified a small protein, DWORF, which increased the activity of SERCA. Makarewich et al. – including many of the researchers involved in the 2016 study – therefore wanted to find out more about how DWORF and SERCA worked together. They also wanted to test if DWORF could be used to boost the heart’s ability to pump blood efficiently, and if so, whether it could treat heart failure.</p><p>Genetically modified mice that produced larger than normal amounts of DWORF had more available calcium in the heart muscle, which made it contract more strongly. This was true even when the same mice were treated with an excessive amount of a specific protein (phospholamban) that can lower the activity of SERCA, suggesting that DWORF might have a protective effect on the heart. Experiments using mice engineered to show symptoms of heart disease confirmed that DWORF treatment did indeed help their hearts beat normally, and, crucially, prevented them from developing heart failure.</p><p>This work has shown for the first time that DWORF can restore the heart’s ability to pump normally in an experimental model of heart disease. In the future, Makarewich et al. hope that DWORF could be a useful target for new, more effective drugs to treat heart failure.</p></abstract><kwd-group

death and disability in industrialized nations and its prevalence is rising rapidly. The molecular mechanisms that drive the progression of heart failure are poorly understood due to the complex and multifactorial nature of the disease. Among the many pathological features of heart failure, the most prominent and widespread is aberrant Ca<sup>2+</sup> cycling, which reduces myocardial contractility and initiates pathological remodeling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Piacentino et al., 2003</xref>). Dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM), which is characterized by ventricular chamber enlargement and systolic dysfunction, is the third most common cause of heart failure and the most frequent reason for heart transplantation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Maron et al., 2006</xref>). While many cases of DCM are idiopathic in nature, direct links have been established between the development of DCM as a consequence of inflammatory, metabolic, or toxic insults or by genetic mutations in Ca<sup>2+</sup> regulatory proteins, contractile proteins or cytoskeletal proteins that reside at the sarcomeric Z-disc (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Arber et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Cahill et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">McNally et al., 2013</xref>). Regardless of the cause of DCM, progressive chamber dilation and heart failure are driven by Ca<sup>2+</sup> dysregulation including alterations in Ca<sup>2+</sup> cycling and homeostasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Luo and Anderson, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Minamisawa et al., 1999</xref>).</p><p>Ca<sup>2+</sup> is a ubiquitous intracellular second messenger involved in the regulation of a broad range of cellular processes including muscle contraction, energy metabolism, proliferation and apoptosis. The involvement of Ca<sup>2+</sup> in so many fundamental events demands its precise control, which predominantly occurs at the level of the sarco(endo)plasmic reticulum (SR), the major intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> storage site. In the heart, Ca<sup>2+</sup> plays a crucial role in connecting membrane excitability with contraction, a process known as excitation contraction-coupling. During each cycle of contraction and relaxation, Ca<sup>2+</sup> is released from the SR via ryanodine receptors (RyRs) into the cytoplasm where it binds to myofilament proteins to induce sarcomere shortening (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bers, 2002</xref>). Relaxation is initiated by Ca<sup>2+</sup> re-sequestration into the SR, a process that is mediated by a SR Ca<sup>2+</sup>-ATPase (SERCA), which uses the energy generated from ATP hydrolysis to pump Ca<sup>2+</sup> against its concentration gradient back into the lumen of the SR.</p><p>A universal cause of the decreased contractile performance of the failing heart is impaired Ca<sup>2+</sup> sequestration into the SR and a reduction in SERCA activity and protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Luo and Anderson, 2013</xref>). Hence, augmenting SERCA activity has been suggested as an attractive clinical approach for treating heart failure by preserving cardiac contractile function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Gwathmey et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Kranias and Hajjar, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Pleger et al., 2013</xref>). Consistent with this hypothesis, overexpression of SERCA2a, the predominant cardiac isoform of SERCA, has been shown to improve cardiac function and ameliorate the progression of cardiovascular disease in several rodent and large animal models of heart failure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Kawase et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Miyamoto et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Prunier et al., 2008</xref>). In the heart, it has been shown that the activity of SERCA is inhibited by the binding of two small transmembrane peptides, phospholamban (PLN) and sarcolipin (SLN), which lower the affinity of SERCA for Ca<sup>2+</sup> and decrease the rate of Ca<sup>2+</sup> re-uptake into the SR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">MacLennan and Kranias, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Nelson et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Vangheluwe et al., 2006</xref>). Our lab recently discovered and characterized a novel micropeptide named <underline>DW</underline>arf <underline>O</underline>pen <underline>R</underline>eading <underline>F</underline>rame (DWORF), which binds directly to SERCA and enhances its activity by displacing the SERCA inhibitory peptides PLN and SLN (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Nelson et al., 2016</xref>). The discovery of DWORF as a potent stimulator of SERCA activity and cardiac contractility provides a novel therapeutic target through which to preserve cardiac contractile function and restore Ca<sup>2+</sup> homeostasis in the context of heart failure.</p><p>In this study, we investigate the molecular determinants of the DWORF-SERCA regulatory complex and explore the therapeutic potential of DWORF overexpression as a means to increase SERCA activity and cardiac contractility in the context of heart failure. We use a combination of techniques to examine the interaction of SERCA with DWORF and PLN to precisely demonstrate that SERCA has a higher apparent affinity for DWORF than for PLN. We also examine the stoichiometric parameters of the DWORF-SERCA complex and analyze the ability of DWORF and PLN to homo- or hetero-oligomerize into higher order structures. Additionally, we show that in vivo overexpression of DWORF relieves the inhibitory effects of PLN on SERCA, even in the context of super-inhibition of SERCA via cardiac-specific PLN overexpression. Lastly, we use a well-characterized mouse model of DCM, muscle-specific LIM protein (MLP) knockout mice, to show that DWORF overexpression enhances cardiac function and prevents adverse cardiac remodeling to abrogate the heart failure phenotype observed in these mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Arber et al., 1997</xref>). The MLP KO mouse model of heart failure strongly reproduces the morphological and clinical characteristics of DCM and heart failure in human patients, which highlights the potential of DWORF overexpression as a clinically relevant therapy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Hoshijima et al., 2006</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>SERCA has a higher apparent affinity for DWORF than for PLN and interacts with both proteins in a 1:1 stoichiometry</title><p>The interaction of PLN with SERCA has been extensively studied (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Kranias and Hajjar, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">MacLennan and Kranias, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Hou et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Hou and Robia, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Kelly et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Kimura et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Robia et al., 2007</xref>). In contrast, due to the very recent discovery of DWORF, very little is known about the SERCA/DWORF regulatory complex. To examine the apparent binding affinity and stoichiometry of SERCA in complex with DWORF in live cell membranes, we performed fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) experiments using transfected AAV-293 cells. We sampled large populations of cells (~1000 cells per experiment) coexpressing mCerulean (Cer)-SERCA2a and either yellow fluorescent protein (YFP)-DWORF or –PLN and compared each cell’s FRET efficiency (Cer excitation, YFP emission) with its YFP-DWORF or –PLN fluorescence intensity, which is an index of protein expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Hou et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Kelly et al., 2008</xref>). For both DWORF and PLN, FRET efficiency increased with increasing protein expression, a relationship that can be approximated by a hyperbolic fit of the form y=(FRET<sub>max</sub>)<italic>x</italic>/(<italic>K</italic><sub>d</sub> +<italic>x</italic>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Hou et al., 2008</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>). FRET<sub>max</sub> is defined as the maximal FRET and represents the intrinsic FRET of the bound complex, while <italic>K</italic><sub>d</sub> represents the protein concentration at which half-maximal FRET is achieved [apparent dissociation constant; in arbitrary units (AU)]. Multiple independent experiments were performed and representative data are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>. The mean PLN-SERCA2a FRET<sub>max</sub> value was 29.9 ± 2.1%, which is similar to previous results (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Hou et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Hou and Robia, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Kelly et al., 2008</xref>), while the FRET<sub>max</sub> value for DWORF-SERCA2a was 16.3 ± 1.7% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref>). This difference in FRET<sub>max</sub> values is consistent with an increased FRET distance for the DWORF-SERCA2a complex compared to PLN-SERCA2a due to the shorter cytoplasmic domain of DWORF (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bidwell, 2012</xref>). Importantly, SERCA2a exhibited a higher apparent affinity for DWORF than for PLN as evidenced by a reduction in <italic>K</italic><sub>d</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.38319.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>FRET analysis indicates that SERCA has a higher apparent affinity for DWORF than PLN and binds both peptides in a 1:1 stoichiometry.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) The apparent affinity of SERCA for PLN and DWORF was assessed by FRET from Cer-SERCA2a to YFP-PLN or YFP-DWORF (Cer excitation, YFP emission).

To further substantiate these findings, we analyzed the interaction of SERCA2a with PLN and DWORF in a heterologous expression system. HEK293 cells were co-transfected with equal amounts of Myc-tagged SERCA2a and HA-tagged PLN in the presence of increasing levels of HA-DWORF, and Myc-SERCA2a/HA-peptide interactions were assessed by Myc (SERCA2a) immunoprecipitation and western blot analysis.

Consistent with previous findings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Nelson et al., 2016</xref>), using the same heterologous expression system we found that co-expression of DWORF with SERCA2a did not change the apparent affinity of SERCA for Ca<sup>2+</sup>, but it relieved the inhibition of PLN on SERCA in a dose-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3B,C</xref>).

Alterations in Ca<sup>2+</sup> cycling and depressed SR Ca<sup>2+</sup> re-uptake are universal features of heart failure that have been shown to contribute directly to the pathogenesis of cardiovascular disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Piacentino et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Luo and Anderson, 2013</xref>). For this reason, significant attention has been focused on restoring Ca<sup>2+</sup> homeostasis through enhancing SERCA activity, which has been shown to maintain cardiac contractility and prevent the progression of the disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Gwathmey et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Kranias and Hajjar, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Pleger et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Ly et al., 2007</xref>). Here we describe a novel approach to stimulate SERCA activity through DWORF overexpression and present strong evidence demonstrating its potent ability both to enhance Ca<sup>2+</sup> cycling and contractility and to prevent the development of cardiomyopathy in a well-characterized mouse model of DCM.</p><p>In the heart, it is well established that SERCA activity is reversibly regulated by PLN, a small transmembrane protein that directly interacts with SERCA and reduces its activity by lowering its affinity for Ca<sup>2+</sup>. Since its discovery over 40 years ago, the regulation of PLN and its interaction with SERCA have been the subject of intense research (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Kranias and Hajjar, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">MacLennan and Kranias, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Nelson et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Vangheluwe et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Hou et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Hou and Robia, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Kelly et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Kimura et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Robia et al., 2007</xref>). Our lab recently identified DWORF as a novel transmembrane protein that resides in the cardiac SR membrane and competes for the same binding site on SERCA as PLN and enhances SERCA activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Nelson et al., 2016</xref>). This work has opened up new avenues of research aimed at understanding SERCA regulation in the heart and also provides a novel mechanism to increase SERCA activity in the context of heart failure. In this study, we used FRET to investigate the stoichiometry and relative affinity of micropeptide regulatory complexes in live cell membranes and found that SERCA has a higher apparent affinity for DWORF than PLN, which makes it an attractive candidate for gene therapy. While enhancing SERCA activity by increasing its expression level has been a primary focus of gene therapy studies thus far, there is also strong experimental evidence that increasing SERCA activity through the ablation of the SERCA inhibitor PLN is beneficial (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Minamisawa et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Sato et al., 2001</xref>), and achieving a similar outcome through DWORF overexpression is a much more clinically relevant approach to achieve this goal.</p><p>In this study, we used the MLP KO mouse model of DCM to test our hypothesis that increasing SERCA function by DWORF overexpression would prevent the development of ventricular dysfunction, fibrosis, and long-term heart failure that is characteristic of dilated cardiomyopathy. We selected this specific genetic model of DCM for several reasons. First, genetic ablation of MLP in mice has been shown to lead to adult onset DCM, which closely resembles the human disease, and MLP KO mice represent a very common and extensively used mouse model for studying the pathophysiology of dilated cardiomyopathy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Arber et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Minamisawa et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Lorenzen-Schmidt et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Heineke et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Recchia and Lionetti, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Rockman et al., 1998</xref>). Second, it has been shown that MLP KO mice exhibit the characteristic cardiomyocyte Ca<sup>2+</sup> cycling defects that are acquired in human heart failure, including reductions in peak cardiomyocyte Ca<sup>2+</sup> transient amplitude and prolongation of Ca<sup>2+</sup> reuptake kinetics, which relates to decreased SERCA activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Arber et al., 1997</xref>), and these are the specific parameters that should be enhanced with DWORF overexpression. Lastly, it has been shown that increasing SERCA function by PLN gene deletion in MLP KO mice preserved Ca<sup>2+</sup> homeostasis and prevented the development of DCM in this model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Minamisawa et al., 1999</xref>). Because we believe that DWORF exerts its effect through the displacement of PLN to induce maximal cardiomyocyte contractility, we expected to see a similar degree of benefit in MLP KO mice via DWORF overexpression. Interestingly, it has been reported that in ischemic cardiomyopathy and idiopathic DCM, MLP protein levels are significantly decreased, implying that MLP deficiency may be a common pathophysiological mechanism in advanced heart failure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Zolk et al., 2000</xref>). Our studies largely focused on Ca<sup>2+</sup> dynamics due to the described function of DWORF as a potent stimulator of SERCA activity, but it should be noted that SERCA is not the only target that could rescue this animal model of DCM. In fact, it has previously been shown that G-protein-coupled receptor kinase 2 (GRK2) inhibition via overexpression of a β-adrenergic receptor kinase peptide inhibitor (βARKct) prevented the development of myocardial failure in MLP KO mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Rockman et al., 1998</xref>). We did not directly assess β-adrenergic receptor density or responsiveness in our animals, so this could also be a contributing factor. Additionally, we showed that DWORF overexpression in MLP KO mice resulted in a dramatic attenuation of fibrosis compared to MLP KO mice, which also may contribute to its ability to prevent the disease phenotype. It remains to be seen whether DWORF overexpression can preserve cardiac function in other forms of DCM and in chronic heart failure. In the future, we will test the therapeutic potential of DWORF overexpression in additional clinically relevant models of heart failure by adeno-associated viral (AAV) delivery. It has previously been shown that enhancing contractility by overexpressing SERCA is protective against diabetic cardiomyopathy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Trost et al., 2002</xref>) as well as cardiac dysfunction induced by chronic pressure overload (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Miyamoto et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">del Monte et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Nakayama et al., 2003</xref>) and we believe that we can achieve the same results with DWORF overexpression.</p><p>Despite promising results in rodent and large animal models of heart failure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Gwathmey et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Kawase et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Miyamoto et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Prunier et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Ly et al., 2007</xref>), overexpression of SERCA by AAV gene delivery in a human clinical trial (<underline>C</underline>alcium <underline>U</underline>p-regulation by <underline>P</underline>ercutaneous administration of gene therapy <underline>I</underline>n cardiac <underline>D</underline>isease, CUPID) failed to meet its primary endpoints and was discontinued (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Greenberg et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Greenberg et al., 2014</xref>). A major reason this clinical trial is believed to have failed was due to lack of successful SERCA overexpression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Greenberg et al., 2016</xref>). In spite of the failure of this clinical trial, we believe that gene therapy is still a promising approach for heart failure treatment and that DWORF overexpression may be superior to that of SERCA. First, as mentioned above, the CUPID trial likely failed primarily because SERCA, which is a large multi-pass transmembrane protein, was not efficiently delivered to the targeted cells and expressed in the cells it did infect. In this regard, DWORF may provide a more optimal protein for delivery due to its small size, which allows it to be easily packaged in AAV vectors and rapidly translated from a relatively small number of transcripts. Second, in heart failure, it is well established that SERCA levels are reduced, but there is often either no change or a slight increase in PLN expression which would dramatically increase the PLN to SERCA ratio (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Kranias and Hajjar, 2012</xref>). Therefore, overexpressing SERCA alone may not be sufficient to overcome this imbalance. Since DWORF can enhance the activity of SERCA in the presence of excess PLN (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>), it may prove to be more beneficial to increase the activity of the endogenous SERCA pump by expressing DWORF rather than the pump itself. Lastly, it has been shown that SERCA2a requires post-translational modification with SUMO for full activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Kho et al., 2011</xref>), a process that may be limited by the capacity for SUMOylation rather than SERCA abundance. Ectopic expression of DWORF could increase the activity of the available SERCA protein without the need to address SUMOylation capacity. We strongly believe that enhancing Ca<sup>2+</sup> cycling remains a compelling pathway to target in the development of heart failure therapeutics as its disruption is a major common insult in the disease and our evidence suggests that the overexpression of DWORF represents a potent means to achieve this goal.</p><p>In summary, through multiple independent assays, our results show that DWORF displays a higher apparent affinity for SERCA than PLN, partly because PLN has a high self-affinity for oligomerization. Thus, the more monomeric DWORF outcompetes PLN for binding to the pump. Overexpression of DWORF leads to the displacement of PLN from SERCA and results in enhanced SERCA activity, even in instances where PLN is overexpressed causing SERCA super-inhibition. Lastly, the prevention of the DCM phenotype of MLP KO mice by DWORF overexpression highlights the clinical potential of DWORF overexpression as a promising therapeutic for heart failure and an attractive candidate for future gene therapy studies.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th>Reagent type</th><th>Designation</th><th>Source</th><th>Identifiers</th><th>Additional information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Antibody</td><td>Mouse Anti-HA Tag <break/>Monoclonal Antibody <break/>(5B1D10)</td><td>Invitrogen</td><td>Cat. #32–6700</td><td>WB (1:2,000)</td></tr><tr><td>Antibody</td><td>Mouse Anti-Myc Tag <break/>Monoclonal Antibody</td><td>Invitrogen</td><td>Cat. #R950-25</td><td>WB (1:2,000), IP (1 ug)</td></tr><tr><td>Antibody</td><td>Mouse Anti-Phospholamban <break/>Monoclonal Antibody (2D12)</td><td>Invitrogen</td><td>Cat. #MA3-922</td><td>WB (1:2,000)</td></tr><tr><td>Antibody</td><td>Rabbit Anti-Phospholamban <break/>(PLN, PLB) (pSer16) pAb</td><td>Badrilla</td><td>Cat. #A010-12AP</td><td>WB (1:1,000)</td></tr><tr><td>Antibody</td><td>Rabbit Anti-Phospholamban <break/>(PLN, PLB) (pThr17) pAb</td><td>Badrilla</td><td>Cat. #A010-13AP</td><td>WB (1:1,000)</td></tr><tr><td>Antibody</td><td>Mouse Anti-Ryanodine <break/>Receptor Monoclonal <break/>Antibody (C3-33)</td><td>Invitrogen</td><td>Cat. #MA3-916</td><td>WB (1:1,000)</td></tr><tr><td>Antibody</td><td>Mouse Anti-SERCA2 <break/>ATPase Monoclonal <break/>Antibody (2A7-A1)</td><td>Invitrogen</td><td>Cat. #MA3-919</td><td>WB (1:1,000)</td></tr><tr><td>Antibody</td><td>Rabbit Anti-Calsequestrin <break/>Polyclonal Antibody</td><td>Invitrogen</td><td>Cat. #PA1-913</td><td>WB (1:1,000)</td></tr><tr><td>Antibody</td><td>Rabbit Anti-DWORF</td><td>New England Peptide</td><td>Custom made</td><td>WB (1:1,000)</td></tr><tr><td>Antibody</td><td>Mouse Anti-GAPDH Loading <break/>Control Monoclonal Antibody <break/>(GA1R)</td><td>Invitrogen</td><td>Cat. #MA5-15738</td><td>WB (1:10,000)</td></tr><tr><td>Antibody</td><td>Rabbit Anti-Calcium Channel <break/>Antibody, Voltage Gated α1C, <break/>pAb</td><td>Millipore</td><td>Cat. #AB5156</td><td>WB (1:250)</td></tr><tr><td>Antibody</td><td>Goat Anti-Mouse IgG (H + L) <break/>-HRP Conjugate</td><td>Bio-Rad</td><td>Cat. #1706516</td><td>WB (1:20,000)</td></tr><tr><td>Antibody</td><td>Goat Anti-Rabbit IgG (H + L) <break/>-HRP Conjugate</td><td>Bio-Rad</td><td>Cat. #1706515</td><td>WB (1:20,000)</td></tr><tr><td>Antibody</td><td>DyLight 800 Sheep <break/>Anti-Rabbit IgG</td><td>Bio-Rad</td><td>Cat. #STAR36D800GA</td><td>WB (1:10,000)</td></tr><tr><td>Antibody</td><td>StarBright Blue <break/>700 Goat Anti-Mouse <break/>IgG</td><td>Bio-Rad</td><td>Cat. #12004159</td><td>WB (1:10,000)</td></tr><tr><td>Antibody</td><td>hFAB Rhodamine <break/>Anti-GAPDH Primary <break/>Antibody</td><td>Bio-Rad</td><td>Cat. #12004168</td><td>WB (1:10,000)</td></tr><tr><td>Antibody</td><td>Mouse Anti-Cardiac <break/>Troponin T Monoclonal <break/>Antibody [1C11]</td><td>Abcam</td><td>Cat. #ab8295</td><td>IHC (1:500)</td></tr><tr><td>Antibody</td><td>Goat anti-Mouse IgG (H + L) <break/>Cross-Adsorbed Secondary <break/>Antibody, Alexa Fluor 555</td><td>Invitrogen</td><td>Cat. #A-21422</td><td>IHC (1:500)</td></tr><tr><td>Other</td><td>Wheat Germ Agglutinin, <break/>Alexa Fluor 488 <break/>Conjugate</td><td>Invitrogen</td><td>Cat. #W11261</td><td>IHC (1:500)</td></tr><tr><td>Other</td><td>VECTASHIELD Antifade <break/>Mounting Medium with <break/>DAPI</td><td>Vector Laboratories</td><td>Cat. #H-1200</td><td>IHC</td></tr><tr><td>Other</td><td>Dynabeads Protein G <break/>for Immunoprecipitation</td><td>Invitrogen</td><td>Cat. #10004D</td><td>IP</td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap><sec id="s4-1"><title>Experimental design</title><p>The objectives of the present study were to molecularly characterize the interaction of DWORF with SERCA and to directly test if DWORF overexpression could prevent the development of cardiomyopathy in a mouse model of DCM. Male mice were used for all experiments and all mice with the appropriate genotypes were used without any exclusions. With the exception of echocardiography measurements, we did not use blinding approaches. All echocardiography experiments were performed and analyzed by a single blinded operator. The sample sizes were based on previous experience and published reports. For each experiment, sample size is indicated in the figure legend and reflects the number of independent biological replicates. In general, sample size was chosen to use the least number of animals to achieve statistical significance, and no statistical methods were used to predetermine sample size.</p></sec><sec id="s4-2"><title>FRET measurements</title><p>AAV-293 cells were cultured in DMEM cell culture medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) (ThermoScientific, Waltham, MA) and transiently transfected using MBS mammalian transfection kit (Agilent Technologies, Stratagene, La Jolla, CA), according to manufacturer instructions. The transfected cells were trypsinized (ThermoScientific) and replated onto poly D lysine-coated glass-bottom chambers and allowed to adhere for 1–2 hr prior to imaging. Acceptor sensitization FRET microscopy was performed as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Hou et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Hou and Robia, 2010</xref>).

The images were analyzed in FIJI (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Schindelin et al., 2012</xref>), and FRET was calculated from the pre- and post-bleach donor fluorescence intensity using the equation FRET = 1-(F<sub>DA</sub>/F<sub>D</sub>) where F<sub>DA</sub> = the intensity of the donor before bleaching and F<sub>D</sub> = the intensity of the donor after bleaching. To distinguish between 1:1 and higher order stoichiometry, the fluorescence of the donor was plotted against the fluorescence of the acceptor at the same time point during progressive bleaching. A linear relationship was taken to indicate a 1:1 complex of Cer- and YFP-labeled proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Kelly et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Zak et al., 2017</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-3"><title>Mice</title><p>Animal work described in this manuscript has been approved and conducted under the oversight of the UT Southwestern Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee.

M-mode tracings were used to measure anterior and posterior wall thicknesses at end diastole and end systole. Left ventricular (LV) internal diameter (LVID) was measured as the largest anteroposterior diameter in either diastole (LVID;d) or systole (LVID;s). A single observer blinded to mouse genotypes performed echocardiography and data analysis. Fractional shortening (FS) was calculated according to the following formula: FS(%) = [(LVID;d − LVID;s)/LVID;d]×100. Ejection fraction (EF%) was calculated by: EF(%)=([EDV − ESV]/EDV)×100. EDV, end diastolic volume; ESV, end systolic volume. Diastolic function was assessed in lightly anesthetized mice (1.5%–2% isoflurane) using pulsed wave Doppler recordings of the maximal early (E) and late (A) diastolic transmitral flow velocities and Doppler tissue imaging recordings of peak E’ velocity and peak A’ velocity in apical four-chamber view. Body temperature was maintained at 37°C throughout using a heating pad. Changes in transmitral flow pattern (E/A ratio) and mitral annulus velocities (E’, A’) were used to assess diastolic dysfunction.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Adult mouse cardiomyocyte isolation</title><p>Adult mouse hearts were rapidly excised and the aorta was cannulated on a constant-flow Langendorff perfusion apparatus.

Your article has been reviewed by Didier Stainier as the Senior Editor, a Reviewing Editor, and three reviewers. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.

DWORF is shown to be a competitive displacer of PLN at SERCA2a with higher affinity than PLN for SERCA. Cardiac directed transgenic DWORF peptide expression antagonized the hallmark cardiac myocyte phenotypes of transgenic PLN overexpression and prevented characteristic calcium cycling abnormalities and dilated cardiomyopathy in MLP deficient mice. These highly detailed and rigorous experiments markedly extend the findings from the seminal report in Science and make a case for further evaluation of DWORF therapy in heart failure. The biophysical studies are especially nice. The PLN-DWORF transgenic cross studies had the predicted outcome based on the underlying mechanistic model, but that in no way compromises the need to report such studies.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) One limitation of the work is the exclusive reliance on genetic models for cardiac disease. The MLP knockout mouse is a model of dilated cardiomyopathy, but it is not typical of clinical heart failure, and there are more clinically relevant models. Also, micropeptide delivery to the heart in the DWORF transgenic mouse before the disease manifested is not directly clinically translatable. The authors should explain their rationale for experimental design and discuss the limitations of the MLP KO model.</p><p>2) The MLP knockout is a unique genetic model. Please discuss if DORF would elicit inotropic response in other chronic heart failure models.</p><p>3) The authors should address the additional data needed to demonstrate that the altered regulation is merely due to a competition between PLN and DWORF. Some of the possibilities include:</p><p>a) Adding a group with unregulated SERCA {plus minus} DWORF to show that there is no direct/additive effect of DWORF on SERCA to pump function.</p><p>b) A competition assay between DWORF and PLN performed on the PLN KO background (using virus), to show that the mechanism is loss of PLN regulation.</p><p>c) Immunoprecipitate SERCA to show at which concentrations only DWORF and not PLN gets precipitated</p><p>4) The blot in Figure 2—figure supplement 2 shows large variability in expression. Please explain whether enough samples were examined, and whether the sample variability was caused by technical reasons.</p><p>5) As there is a sizeable increase in Ca<sup>2+</sup> amplitude and change in Ca<sup>2+</sup> decay kinetics in the DWORF Tg and DWORF-MLP KO, are sarcomere relaxation kinetics also faster in these animals?</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.38319.019</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) One limitation of the work is the exclusive reliance on genetic models for cardiac disease.

In brief, the MLP KO mouse model has been extensively used for studying the pathophysiology of dilated cardiomyopathy because it leads to adult onset DCM, which closely resembles the human disease. It has been shown that MLP KO mice develop the characteristic Ca<sup>2+</sup> cycling defects that are classically acquired in human heart failure including reductions in peak Ca<sup>2+</sup> transient amplitude and prolongation of Ca<sup>2+</sup> reuptake kinetics. Therefore, this model provides an excellent platform to test if enhancing SERCA activity via DWORF overexpression can rescue cardiac function and ameliorate their heart failure phenotype. We do recognize that there are limitations to our experimental design and we have edited the Discussion section of our manuscript to acknowledge these.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) The MLP knockout is a unique genetic model. Please discuss if DORF would elicit inotropic response in other chronic heart failure models.</p></disp-quote><p>We understand the reviewers’ point and have edited the Discussion section of our manuscript to address this. We do believe that DWORF overexpression will enhance contractility and be beneficial in other chronic heart failure models. SERCA overexpression has previously been shown to be protective against several different animal models of heart failure including diabetic cardiomyopathy and pressure-overload induced heart failure. In our future studies, we will assess whether enhancing SERCA activity via DWORF overexpression (by transgene or AAV mediated gene-delivery) can provide similar protection in these chronic heart failure models.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) The authors should address the additional data needed to demonstrate that the altered regulation is merely due to a competition between PLN and DWORF.

We have performed suggested experiments ‘a’ and ‘c’ and have included these results as Figure 2—figure supplement 3. Consistent with our previous publication on DWORF (Nelson et al., 2016), we found that co-expression of DWORF with unregulated SERCA did not lead to a direct or additive stimulation of SERCA activity (Figure 2—figure supplement 3B and C). Instead, we found that the ability of DWORF to simulate SERCA activity lies in its capacity to compete PLN off of SERCA and reduce the inhibitory effects of PLN on SERCA. This competitive displacement of PLN from SERCA can be very clearly seen in immunoprecipitation experiments shown in Figure 2—figure supplement 3A.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) The blot in Figure 2—figure supplement 2 shows large variability in expression. Please explain whether enough samples were examined, and whether the sample variability was caused by technical reasons.</p></disp-quote><p>We have increased the number of samples analyzed by Western and have included a new panel of representative Western blots alongside the previous panel (Figure 2—figure supplement 2B). While we do still see a small level of variation in protein expression between samples, it does not trend in the direction of significance between groups in any of the proteins analyzed. Several of the calcium-handling proteins we are analyzing, namely RyR2 and the LTCC, are rather large and can be difficult to cleanly detect by Western blotting. We ran each sample multiple times to confirm our results and performed all quantification analyses using internal GAPDH controls for each blot (although only a single GAPDH blot is shown in Figure 2—figure supplement 2B for clarity).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) As there is a sizeable increase in Ca<sup>2+</sup> amplitude and change in Ca<sup>2+</sup> decay kinetics in the DWORF Tg and DWORF-MLP KO, are sarcomere relaxation kinetics also faster in these animals?</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this suggestion. We re-analyzed the fractional shortening traces we previously obtained using sarcomere length measurements and found that sarcomere relaxation kinetics are indeed faster in DWORF Tg mice (Figure 6D). Additionally, we found that sarcomere relaxation kinetics are significantly slowed in MLP KO and MLP/DWORF dKO mice and this parameter is normalized with DWORF overexpression (Figure 6D).</p></body></sub-article></article>
