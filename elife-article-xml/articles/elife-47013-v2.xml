HSCs give rise to lineage-restricted progenitors that gradually differentiate into mature cells. Following cellular differentiation, single-lineage elements including erythrocytes, megakaryocytes, lymphocytes as well as myeloid cells such as monocytes and granulocytes circulate throughout the body performing diverse functions. While HSC development towards cellular lineages during homeostasis has been extensively studied (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Hoggatt et al., 2016</xref>), the mechanisms by which how progenitors give rise to mature cells during stress responses are less comprehended. For instance, certain pathogens regulate production of blood cells by the bone marrow and it has been shown that fine-tuned regulation of cytokine-induced signals is required for differentiation of HSC into mature cell types (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Kleppe et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Mirantes et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Zhang and Lodish, 2008</xref>). For example, the protozoan parasite that causes kalazar, <italic>Leishmania donovani,</italic> inhabits the bone marrow of humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Kumar and Nylén, 2012</xref>), targets bone marrow stromal macrophages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Cotterell et al., 2000</xref>) and induces differentiation of myeloid cells at the expense of lymphoid progenitors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abidin et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Cotterell et al., 2000</xref>). In the same line of evidence, after experimental exposure to Gram-negative bacteria, mice display increased amounts of bone marrow-derived neutrophils, through a G-CSF–C/EBPα dependent mechanism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Boettcher et al., 2014</xref>). Moreover, infection by intracellular bacteria has been shown to modulate production of circulating leukocytes involving IFN-γ-mediated pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Baldridge et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">MacNamara et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Murray et al., 1998</xref>). Altogether, these studies indicate vertebrate hosts respond to infection by ‘remodeling’ cell lineage production, which are highly dependent upon the interplay of cytokine-induced hematopoiesis triggered during infection. Interestingly, recent reports have demonstrated hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells (HSPCs) may be infected by different classes of infectious agents such as viruses and bacteria, albeit at low efficiency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Carter et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Kolb-Mäurer et al., 2002</xref>). Therefore, since many pathogens may reach the bone marrow and provide microbial-HSC interactions, it is possible that, in addition to cytokines, pathogen recognition by progenitor cells directly regulate cell lineage commitment providing an anti-microbial defense system. In contrast, the Red Queen hypothesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Van Valen, 1973</xref>) predicts such pathogens would benefit from cell lineage commitment to establish themselves into the host.</p><p>The human pathogen <italic>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</italic> (<italic>Mtb</italic>) has been recently detected in circulating HSCs (Lin<sup>-</sup>CD34<sup>+</sup>) from latent TB individuals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Tornack et al., 2017</xref>). Since <italic>Mtb</italic> can also gain access to the bone marrow during extra-pulmonary (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Mert et al., 2001</xref>) as well as active pulmonary TB (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Das et al., 2013</xref>), it has been suggested that the human bone marrow is a niche/reservoir for this bacterium during natural pathogen infection. However, whether interactions between <italic>Mtb</italic> and human CD34<sup>+</sup> cells drive cellular differentiation has not been formally demonstrated. Interestingly, earlier (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Rogers, 1928</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Schmitt et al., 1977</xref>) and recent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Berry et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Zak et al., 2016</xref>) studies have reported major changes in the peripheral myeloid cells such as increased blood counts and dysregulated ‘interferon transcriptional signature’ during active TB. More specifically, several ‘interferon-stimulated genes’ (ISGs) are modulated in circulating mature neutrophils and monocytes in active TB patients, which calls forth a possible role of such genes in TB pathogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Berry et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Dos Santos et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Zak et al., 2016</xref>). In contrast, lymphocyte compartments were recently demonstrated to be contracted during progression from latent to active TB in humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Scriba et al., 2017</xref>). Therefore, the observed changes in blood leukocytes could be a consequence of the interactions between Mtb and the bone marrow cellular environment. Thus, we hypothesized that <italic>Mtb</italic> regulates cellular differentiation of human HSPCs. By employing in vitro functional assays and integrated systems biology analysis of published available cohorts of healthy controls and TB patients, our study suggests that <italic>Mtb</italic> co-opts an evolutionarily recent IFN/IL-6/CEBP axis linking monocyte differentiation and disease severity.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title><italic>Mtb</italic> H37Rv replicates in primary human CD34<sup>+</sup> cell cultures</title><p>To investigate the dynamics of <italic>Mtb</italic> infection by HSPCs, we have exposed peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from healthy donors to H37Rv <italic>Mtb</italic> (multiplicity of infection, MOI3) and measured bacterial infectivity by CD34<sup>+</sup> cells. First, by using a fluorescent dye (syto-24) which does not influence bacteria infectivity (data not shown), flow cytometry experiments demonstrated that <italic>Mtb</italic> were associated with CD34<sup>+</sup> cells following 4 hr exposure to mycobacteria (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a,b</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1a</xref>). At that time point, we observed ~69% of CD34<sup>+</sup> and ~79% of CD14<sup>+</sup> associated with <italic>Mtb</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1c</xref>). When compared to CD14<sup>+</sup> cells, which are highly phagocytic cells, the MFI measurements within the CD34<sup>+</sup> cell population were found to be ~4 x lower (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1d</xref>). These data suggest that PBMC CD34<sup>+</sup> cells may be permissive to <italic>Mtb</italic> infection in vitro. Similarly, purified cord blood derived CD34<sup>+</sup> cells display comparable % and MFI as those seen in PBMC CD34<sup>+</sup> cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1b</xref>). Confocal microscopy analysis confirmed the presence of sparse intracellular mycobacteria in purified cord blood derived CD34<sup>+</sup> cells at 4 hr post-infection (pi) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1c</xref>). These findings raise the possibility that although human primary Lin<sup>-</sup>CD34<sup>+</sup> cells can be infected by <italic>Mtb</italic> in vitro and in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Tornack et al., 2017</xref>), this cell population may display intrinsic resistance to <italic>Mtb</italic> infection as it has been reported for other bacterial species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Kolb-Mäurer et al., 2002</xref>). Next, we employed a purified cell culture system to investigate whether H37RV <italic>Mtb</italic> replicates in CD34<sup>+</sup> cells in different time points. When sorted purified cord-blood CD34<sup>+</sup> cells were exposed to <italic>Mtb</italic> H37Rv (MOI3) and cultivated in StemSpan SFEM II (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Bodine et al., 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Keller et al., 1995</xref>), bacilli numbers exhibited a ~ 1.5 log growth at 5 days post infection (dpi) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1e</xref>). As a control, purified CD14<sup>+</sup> cells displayed higher bacterial proliferation than purified CD34<sup>+</sup> cells over time (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>-<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1d</xref>). Together, these findings demonstrate that <italic>Mtb</italic> infects and replicates in primary human CD34<sup>+</sup> cell cultures in vitro. While at one dpi bacilli were more associated with the surface of round cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1f</xref>), at five dpi intracellular bacteria were associated with cells with abundant cytoplasm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1f</xref>), suggesting that <italic>Mtb</italic>-exposed cultures displayed increased frequencies of cells exhibiting morphological alterations over time (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1f</xref>, right panel). Indeed, Giemsa staining (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1g</xref>, arrows) presented higher frequency of cytoplasm- richer cells in bacteria-exposed vs uninfected cell cultures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1g</xref>, right panel), thus suggesting that <italic>Mtb</italic> infection enhances cellular differentiation by CD34<sup>+</sup> cells in vitro.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.47013.002</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title><italic>Mtb</italic> H37Rv infects human CD34<sup>+</sup> cells and proliferates in cell cultures in vitro.</title><p>PBMC from healthy donors were exposed to syto24-labeled <italic>Mtb</italic> H37Rv (MOI3, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1a</xref>) for 4 hr.

First, we used Ingenuity Pathway analysis (IPA) to determine IL-6/IL-6R upstream regulators in transcriptomes from publicly available CD14<sup>+</sup> monocytes of active TB patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Berry et al., 2010</xref>).. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5a</xref> (top panel), <italic>IL6, IL6ST, IL6R</italic> and <italic>STAT3</italic> were significantly enriched in transcriptomes of active TB monocytes, when compared to cells from healthy controls. As reported previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Berry et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Mayer-Barber et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Novikov et al., 2011</xref>), <italic>STAT1</italic> and <italic>IL1B</italic> were also confirmed as upstream regulators in active TB monocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5a</xref>, top panel). We next examined potential genes share between IL6/IL6R and type I IFN signaling pathways in active TB monocytes. Strikingly, the two top upstream regulators in TB monocytes, <italic>IRF1</italic> and <italic>STAT1</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5a</xref>, top panel), were the only genes in common between the TB monocyte gene signature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Berry et al., 2010</xref>), the ‘IL6/STAT3 pathway’ and the ‘in vivo IFN-β” signature (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5a</xref>, Venn diagram, bottom panel), suggesting these genes might be regulated by both IL-6 and type I IFN during active TB in vivo. Since type I IFN and IL-6 share the ability to induce phosphorylation of both STAT1 and STAT3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Ho and Ivashkiv, 2006</xref>), we ran gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Subramanian et al., 2005</xref>) to identify potential overlapping downstream target genes in the whole blood ‘Berry TB’ disease signature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Berry et al., 2010</xref>). In addition to the previously demonstrated type I IFN/STAT1 signature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Berry et al., 2010</xref>), the ‘IL6/STAT3’ pathway was significantly enriched in this data set (FDR-corrected p&lt;10<sup>−4</sup>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref>). Next, we defined protein signatures by overlapping the ‘Berry TB’, the ‘IL6/STAT3’ pathway with a published plasma proteome defining disease progression from latent to active TB (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Scriba et al., 2017</xref>) (‘Scriba Plasma TB’, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5b</xref>, Venn Diagram top panel). STRING network analysis of protein-protein interactions confirmed two clusters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5b</xref>, bottom panel), which comprised three signatures: ‘CD34/myeloid’, ‘IL6/STAT3’ and ‘IFN/IL6-shared’ pathways. Reanalysis of the published ‘Scriba Plasma TB’ proteome set (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Scriba et al., 2017</xref>) confirmed increased IL-6/STAT3 protein levels and changes in CD34/CD38 homeostasis, which were found to be early events in TB pathogenesis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5c</xref>, top panel). ‘IL6/STAT3’ pathway-associated proteins such as PLA2G2A, CRP, STAT3, IL-6 and CFB increased around 12 months before TB diagnosis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5c,d</xref>, top panels - orange circles and bars), which was concomitant with significant changes in the ‘IFN/IL6-shared’ plasma markers CXCL10, IFNAR1 and MMP9 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5c,d</xref> top panels - blue circles and bars). The ‘IL6/STAT3’ and ‘IFN/IL6-shared”pathways were also significantly enriched in a gene set recently linked to monocyte expansion in vivo, measured as monocyte:lymphocyte (ML) ratio (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Naranbhai et al., 2015</xref>) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref>), and positively correlated with mycobacterial growth in vitro, thus connecting monocyte expansion and increased <italic>Mtb</italic> survival. Interestingly, the changes found in both the ‘IL6/STAT3’ and ‘IFN/IL6-shared’ pathways during development of TB disease preceded enrichment of the ‘ML ratio’ gene set (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Naranbhai et al., 2015</xref>) (6 months before diagnosis, p&lt;0.05, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5c</xref>, bottom panel and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5d</xref>, top panel, gray bar) and reduction of the CD34/CD38 gene markers, in agreement with our in vitro model of <italic>Mtb</italic>-enhanced CD34<sup>+</sup> differentiation (CD34<sup>+</sup> → CD34<sup>+</sup>CD38<sup>+</sup> → CD14<sup>+</sup>). Moreover, fold changes were higher for ‘IL6/STAT3’ pathway genes than for ‘IFN/IL6-shared’ genes, and significantly higher than ‘ML ratio’ genes (p&lt;0.05) or ‘CD34/myeloid’ differentiation genes (p&lt;0.01) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5d</xref> bottom panel). Together, these data suggest sequential activation of IL-6/IL-6R and IFN signaling pathways before monocyte expansion during TB disease progression in vivo, raising a possible link between these two events in disease pathogenesis. In support of this idea, CD34<sup>+</sup> cells exposed to <italic>Mtb</italic> in vitro displayed increased levels of pSTAT1 as well as C/EBPβ (and a slight enhancement of C/EBPα), which are key TF regulators of ISGs and myeloid differentiation genes, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1a</xref>). Interestingly, qPCR experiments from HK <italic>Mtb</italic>-exposed CD34<sup>+</sup> cells did not show induction of myeloid differentiation TFs <italic>CEBPA</italic> and <italic>CEBPB</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1g</xref>).

To further investigate a potential link between this gene module (<italic>IL6/IL6R/CEBP</italic>) with disease severity and monocyte expansion in vivo, we first examined large transcriptomic data sets of ‘disseminated TB’, which includes extrapulmonary and lymph node TB (GSE63548). The ‘IL6/STAT3’ pathway was found to be significantly enriched among differentially expressed genes in both extrapulmonary (FDR p=10<sup>−3</sup>) and lymph node TB (FDR p=10<sup>−4</sup>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref>).

In contrast, ISRE (STAT1/STAT2) and IRF1 motifs, the major upstream regulators observed in TB monocyte transcriptome (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5a</xref> top panel) and shared between IL-6 and IFN signaling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5b</xref>), were not enriched in the ‘ML ratio’ gene set (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref>).

We have also examined the recent human evolution including Neanderthal introgression (&lt;100,000 years ago) and human pathogen adaptation (15,000–1,500 years ago), up to extant human genetic variation through analysis of large genome wide association studies (GWAS).</p><p>First, STRING network measurements of amino acid conservation and gene co-occurrence across mammalian and primate evolution revealed that IL-6, IL-6R and C/EBP family members C/EBPα, C/EBPβ and C/EBPδ differ substantially throughout primate evolution and even among closely related hominins (<italic>Pan troglodytes</italic> and <italic>Gorilla gorilla</italic>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6a</xref>, heat map). In contrast, matched control molecules in the same STRING network (KLF5/NFKB1/MAPK1//STAT1<italic>/</italic>STAT3) remained largely conserved in most mammals, and even in birds and reptiles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6a</xref>, heat map and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1d</xref>). Next, to investigate the biological consequence of the evolutionary differences in overlapping IL-6/IFN signaling, we reanalyzed cross-species type I IFN regulation from the ‘mammalian interferome’ database (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Shaw et al., 2017</xref>). As expected, the conserved ‘IFN/IL6-shared’ genes <italic>CXCL10/CXCL9/STAT1/STAT2</italic> displayed higher fold-changes upon type I IFN treatment across all 10 species (from chicken to human, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6b</xref>, top panel). Interestingly, the ‘IL-6/STAT3’ pathway genes <italic>IL6, STAT3</italic> and <italic>SOCS3</italic> were also significantly upregulated while <italic>IL6R</italic> was significantly down-regulated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6b</xref>, top panel) in the same experimental setting. Among CD34/myeloid differentiation genes, <italic>ICSBP/IRF8</italic> and <italic>CD38</italic> were strongly upregulated, but only in 4/10 and 2/10 species, respectively, while <italic>ELF1</italic> was homogeneously and significantly upregulated in 9/10 species (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6b</xref>, top panel). These results suggest that type I IFN consistently regulates expression of IL-6 signaling and myeloid-associated genes in different species. However, among the entire <italic>IL6/IL6R/CEBP</italic> myeloid gene set, <italic>CEBPB</italic> was the topmost variable ISG across mammalian evolution (CV &gt;1000%, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6b</xref>, bottom panel). Remarkably, type I IFN-induced upregulation of both <italic>CEBPB</italic> and <italic>CEBPD</italic>, previously identified as NF-IL6 and NF-IL6β, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Ramji and Foka, 2002</xref>) was present only in humans and lacking in all other mammals investigated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6b</xref>, bottom panel, inset). Mechanistically, ChipSeq analysis of IFN-treated human CD14<sup>+</sup> monocytes corresponding to regions with active chromatin (DNase Hypersensitivity Sites, DHS and H3K27 acetylation, not shown) confirmed the existence of functional STAT1 peaks in <italic>CEBPB</italic> and <italic>CEBPD</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6c</xref>, top and middle panels, denoted by vertical blue lines). These peaks correlated with increased downstream transcription in CD14<sup>+</sup> cells, as compared to purified CD34<sup>+</sup> cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6c</xref>, RNA-seq). In agreement with our findings (represented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6b</xref>, bottom panel, <italic>inset</italic>), only 3 out of 11 (27%) STAT1 binding peaks in <italic>CEBPB</italic> and <italic>CEBPD</italic> were found in conserved regions (Conservation Birds-Mammals line, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6c</xref>), while 6 out of 7 (86%) STAT1 peaks were conserved in <italic>CXCL9</italic> and <italic>CXCL10</italic> genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6c</xref>, bottom panel). Interestingly, transcriptional regulation of <italic>CEBPB</italic> and <italic>CEBPD</italic> in humans and macaques, but not mouse cells stimulated with double-stranded RNA, which mimics a viral infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1a</xref>), were also observed in an independent data set (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Hagai et al., 2018</xref>).

Thus, transcriptional induction of <italic>CEBPB</italic> and <italic>CEBPD</italic> controlled by IL-6- and type I IFN-signaling appears as a relatively recent event in mammalian and primate evolution.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig6" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.47013.022</object-id><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><title>Evolutionary recent and human-specific genetic adaptation link <italic>IL6/IL6R/CEBP</italic> gene module with monocyte expansion and TB pathogenesis.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) Heat map showing <italic>CEBPB</italic> network generated by STRING co-occurrence protein conservation scores across primates, mammals, birds and reptiles.

Employing a purified cord-blood-derived CD34<sup>+</sup> culture cell system, we observed that <italic>Mtb</italic> enhances IL-6R-mediated myeloid differentiation by human primary CD34<sup>+</sup> cells in vitro. Importantly, IL-6/IL-6R downstream molecules such as C/EBPβ, C/EBPδ, STAT3 and their targets were significantly enriched in cell transcriptomes from active TB patients as well as were positively correlated with disease severity. Therefore, our data expands previous studies and raise a scenario in which <italic>Mtb</italic> skews myeloid development, mediated by IL-6/IL-6R signaling, as a key step in human TB pathogenesis.</p><p>While <italic>Mtb</italic> enhanced <italic>IL6</italic> expression in purified CD34<sup>+</sup> cell cultures from all donors, <italic>IFNA</italic> and <italic>IFNB</italic> mRNA were detected in some but not all donors. However, ISGs were highly enriched in the bacteria-exposed samples suggesting that although low/undetectable amounts of type I IFN were produced in infected cell cultures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Rodero et al., 2017</xref>), these cytokines were present in the cell culture (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1h</xref>). Furthermore, our results show that live <italic>Mtb</italic> is a potent stimulus to induce ISGs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1c</xref> - <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig2sdata1">Figure 2—source data 1</xref>) and myeloid differentiation in primary human CD34<sup>+</sup> cells. However, while heat killed mycobacteria induced IL-6 production by CD34<sup>+</sup> cells, it poorly stimulated <italic>STAT1</italic>, <italic>CEBPB</italic> and differentiation cell surface molecules by progenitor cells as well as CD14<sup>+</sup> monocyte levels. Interestingly, although IL-6R signaling was involved in both myeloid differentiation and <italic>Mtb</italic> growth by CD34<sup>+</sup> cell cultures, type I or type II IFN signaling were not. These results suggest that monocyte maturation is connected to <italic>Mtb</italic> proliferation in vitro and could explain why the effects of anti-IL6R antibodies on cellular differentiation inhibited bacteria growth (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4f–i</xref>). Although the ISG gene set was enriched in <italic>Mtb</italic>-exposed CD34<sup>+</sup> cells, our data suggest type I or type II IFN signaling appear not to mediate <italic>Mtb</italic>-enhanced monocyte development in vitro. Collectively, this evidence suggests that unknown activities of live pathogen infection regulate myeloid differentiation involving an IL-6R-mediated process and implies cross-talking of regulatory pathways between live <italic>Mtb</italic>, IL-6 and IFN signaling to boost myeloid differentiation of CD34<sup>+</sup> cells. At the molecular level, it has been reported that IFN-induced C/EBPβ triggers gamma-activated transcriptional elements (GATE) sequences independent of STAT1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Li et al., 2007</xref>), suggesting the existence of cooperative and/or redundant roles of IL-6 and IFN signaling in different molecular settings. The mechanisms by which endogenous IL-6, IFN-α/β and live <italic>Mtb</italic> interplay to enhance C/EBP-mediated myeloid differentiation of HSPCs require further investigation. Of note, in our previously characterized cohort of multiple sclerosis patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Menezes et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Van Weyenbergh et al., 2001</xref>), IFN-β therapy in vivo did not significantly change monocyte or lymphocyte counts, nor did it increase the ML ratio after three months of treatment in patients with documented clinical response (data not shown), supporting the idea that type I IFN by itself is not sufficient to cause monocyte expansion in vivo.</p><p>It has not been determined how mature myeloid cell populations from active TB patients acquire the ‘ISG’ signature. While monocytes and other cells may encounter <italic>Mtb</italic>-associated inflammatory stimuli in infected tissues (e.g. lungs and liver), our data suggest the possibility that <italic>Mtb</italic> may activate these cells during their development in the bone marrow. We have not directly addressed whether circulating monocytes/granulocytes acquire their phenotype in the bone marrow, during development of myeloid progenitors in vivo. Nevertheless, a recent study by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Norris and Ernst (2018)</xref> demonstrated increased monocyte egress from the bone marrow in a murine model of <italic>Mtb</italic> infection.

Our results expand these previous studies, revealing a novel <italic>IL6/IL6R/CEBP</italic> gene module and its link to monocyte development, mycobacterial dissemination and TB disease severity.

Nevertheless, a pivotal role for IL6/IL6R signaling has not been evident from previous ‘omics’ approaches. While IL-6 signaling partially overlaps with type I IFN responses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5a,b</xref>), possibly due to their shared ability to activate STAT1 and STAT3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Ho and Ivashkiv, 2006</xref>), whole blood transcriptomic analyses in TB are predominated by an ‘IFN-inducible neutrophil signature’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Berry et al., 2010</xref>). Therefore, the high numbers of neutrophils in the blood possibly mask differential expression of other gene sets in less frequent populations, such as monocytes, monocyte subsets and, in particular, Lin<sup>-</sup>CD34<sup>+</sup> cells.</p><p>Most ISGs present in the whole blood Berry TB signature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Berry et al., 2010</xref>), the Scriba TB plasma proteome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Scriba et al., 2017</xref>) and the Naranbhai et al.

In addition, a recently identified <italic>trans</italic> e-QTL (rs5743618) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Quach et al., 2016</xref>) in <italic>TLR1</italic>, a gene with peak Neanderthal introgression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Dannemann et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Enard and Petrov, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Hagai et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Quach et al., 2016</xref>) has been associated to TB susceptibility in several populations worldwide (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Barletta-Naveca et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Naderi et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Qi et al., 2015</xref>). Biological pathway analysis of genes significantly regulated in trans of rs5743618 revealed a significant enrichment of IL-6/STAT3 signaling and <italic>IL6</italic> as the most connected gene (data not shown). In agreement, <italic>Mtb-</italic>induced macrophage IL-6 production, among other cytokines, can be predicted on the basis of strong genetic components as recently reported by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bakker et al. (2018)</xref> in a large GWAS/immunophenotyping cohort study. By employing a data-driven multi-level analysis from large cohorts, we expand these previous observations and revealed significant genetic links shared between IL-6/IL-6R/CEBP signaling, CD34<sup>+</sup> myeloid differentiation, monocyte homeostasis and TB susceptibility (compiled in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7a</xref>). Together, these findings favor the hypothesis that such genetic changes have undergone stepwise mammalian, primate and recent human selection, including Neanderthal introgression and worldwide population-specific pathogen adaptation.</p><p>In summary, our observations suggest that <italic>Mtb</italic> boosts myeloid differentiation by exploiting a feed-forward loop between IL-6 and type I IFN molecular networks, bridged by C/EBPβ (and C/EBPδ) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7b</xref>). Yet, further experiments will define the precise mechanisms of crosstalk between IFN, IL-6 and CEBP family members, specifically CEBPβ and CEBPδ, during natural <italic>Mtb</italic> infection. While this question merits direct investigation, nonetheless, the use of IL-6R blockade as an adjunct therapy to treat multi-drug resistant severe TB has been proposed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Okada et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Zumla et al., 2016</xref>). Thus, the present study provides evidence of a novel host-directed target for therapeutic intervention in a major human disease.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and

We used CellRouter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Lummertz da Rocha et al., 2018</xref>) to calculate signature scores for each sample based on cell-type specific transcriptional factors collected from literature. Specifically, for this analysis, we normalized raw counts by library size as implemented in the R package DESeq2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Love et al., 2014</xref>). We then plotted the distributions of signature scores across experimental conditions.

Differentially expressed genes were sorted into gene networks and canonical pathways, and significantly overrepresented pathways and upstream regulators were identified. Additional pathway, GO (Gene Ontology) and transcription factor target enrichment analysis was performed using GSEA (Gene Set Enrichment Analysis, Broad Institute Molecular Signatures Database (MSigDB)) and WebGestalt (WEB-based GEne SeT AnaLysis Toolkit). Gene sets from GO, Hallmark, KEGG pathways, WikiPathways and Pathway Commons databases, as well as transcription factor motifs, were considered overrepresented if their FDR-corrected p-value was &lt;0.05.

However, there is no comparison with CD14<sup>+</sup>, no quantification no statistics. This figure does not have use as it stands. Similarly, with Figure 1—figure supplement 1D – one assumes the control here would be uninfected cells? In this case, the statistical comparison shown is meaningless – comparing the bacterial load in CD14<sup>+</sup> cells versus CD34<sup>+</sup> cells on one graph would be more useful. The authors indicate they are comparable – but need to provide the data in a way that allows for this comparison.</p><p>2) Figures 1 F and G need quantification, followed by statistical comparison.</p><p>3) Figure 2—figure supplement 1B and C needs statistics, – are the differences significant, – if not the text needs to be revised to indicate this. This applies to all supplementary graphs, – these should have statistics. If differences are not significant &quot;NS&quot; should be stated. Same with Figures in the main text.</p><p>4) The comparative genomics/transcriptomics and evolutionary analysis is very dense, – it needs to be simplified and presented in a clearer manner.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>In this manuscript Delgobo et al. demonstrate a novel role for <italic>Mtb</italic> in driving monocyte differentiation from human hematopoietic stem cells via an IL-6/CEBP axis. In vitro studies show that <italic>Mtb</italic> replicates in human CD34<sup>+</sup> cells, and causes upregulation of the monocyte marker CD14 as well as enrichment of genes associated with myeloid differentiation. This in vitro monocyte expansion is demonstrated to be IL-6 dependent and associated with STAT1 and CEBP signaling. IL-6 receptor blockade impairs CD14 upregulation in infected CD34<sup>+</sup> cell and reduces CFU burden, suggesting that this differentiation pathway is advantageous for <italic>Mtb</italic>. Interestingly, analysis of the IL6/IL6R/CEBP signaling axis among different mammalian species suggested that coordinate regulation of CEBP by IL6 and type 1 IFN is a relatively recent event in mammalian evolution and seems restricted to primates. This is corroborated by in vitro experiments using infection of cells from 10 species. Overall, the authors demonstrate, with compelling mechanistic evidence, a role for <italic>Mtb</italic> in co-opting an evolutionarily recent signaling axis to support infection by driving monocyte differentiation. The evolutionary aspect of the study is particularly intriguing.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic></p><p>In this manuscript the authors' study the mechanisms by which HSPC differentiation occurs following <italic>Mtb</italic> infection. The authors uncover a less studied role for IL-6/IL-6R signaling in driving HSPC commitment to myeloid differentiation and exacerbating TB disease. In particular, re-analysis of previously published transcriptomic, proteomic, and genetic datasets support their hypotheses. Addressing the below points will further improve the impact of the findings.</p><p>Major comments:</p><p>Figure 1B-D:</p><p>The authors show that approximately 60% of CD34<sup>+</sup> cells stain positively for <italic>Mtb</italic> with syto24, but that each of these cells has a much lower <italic>Mtb</italic> syto24 MFI than similarly infected CD14<sup>+</sup> cells. However, after 4h, both CD34<sup>+</sup> and CD14<sup>+</sup> cells have a very similar number of CFU/ml.</p><p>Is the rate of uptake/infectivity potentially different when the cells are isolated and infected in a homogeneous culture rather than infected as total PBMCs?</p><p>It would also be useful to see the uninfected control quantified and included in the flow analysis as well.</p><p>Figure 3:</p><p>The authors show that heat-killed <italic>Mtb</italic> is unable to stimulate the same increase in myeloid differentiation of CD34<sup>+</sup> cells as live <italic>Mtb</italic>. However, they later show that it is a cytokine (IL-6) dependent phenomenon. Are the IL-6 levels induced by heat-killed <italic>Mtb</italic> significantly lower than live infection?</p><p>Figure 4:</p><p>Cytokine signaling is a known trigger for myeloid cell differentiation, and therefore the authors identify differential expression of IL-6 as a potential driver of the increased number of CD14<sup>+</sup> cells induced by <italic>Mtb</italic> infection. However, despite seeing what appears to be a significant transcriptional increase of IL-6 at 5dpi, there is no correlating increase in protein at that time point. CD34<sup>+</sup> cells infected with <italic>Mtb</italic> and treated with aIL6R for 10d develop a lower percentage of CD14<sup>+</sup> cells than untreated infected cells, at a much later time point than when differences in IL-6 induction (either by protein or transcriptional data) are seen.</p><p>A time course showing IL-6 levels in culture (1,3,5,7,10dpi) as well as a time course showing when the CD14<sup>+</sup> population begins to expand in the untreated <italic>Mtb</italic> infected cells would more support the idea that it is an IL-6-dependent expansion. Alternatively, the authors could consider only blocking IL-6R early, when there is a significant difference in protein levels, to determine if there is the same effect on myeloid expansion.</p><p>Additionally, despite making note that &quot;interferon signaling&quot; and &quot;interferon alpha/beta&quot; pathways were significantly enriched in the infecting cells, neither IFNa/b nor IFN-g are well represented in the RNAseq data that is shown, and these cytokines are also not measured at the protein level. Including this data would provide better support for the data represented in Figure 4D-E, where no changes are seen after IFNAR or IFN-g blockade. This is a particularly critical point for the authors' later argument that transcription factors induced by both IFN and IL-6 are primarily being driven by IL-6 to induce myeloid differentiation.</p><p>The authors show in Figure 1F-G that <italic>Mtb</italic> is associated with cells undergoing morphological change. If exogenous IL-6 alone is sufficient to drive this myeloid differentiation, why would the cells actively infected with <italic>Mtb</italic> be the only cells showing signs of differentiation? The authors may want to consider additional discussion of this point.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #4:</italic></p><p>This manuscript investigates relationships (in human cells) between tuberculosis infection, hematopoiesis and monocyte expansion, and IL-6 signaling. In many respects the authors are investigating an aspect of 'trained' immunity or myeloid lineage 'remodeling' in the bone marrow. There are many substantial problems with this manuscript; the main one being an emphasis on correlation rather than causation. The authors attempt to draw conclusions that are predominantly indirect in nature.</p><p>1) That CD34<sup>+</sup> cells can be infected in vitro does not mean it happens in vivo. The authors draw from other studies that argue that <italic>M.tb</italic> can get to the bone marrow. However, overall, there is no evidence that CD34<sup>+</sup> cells are infected in vivo and if this would make any difference to myeloid output. The authors ignore older studies in this area (Goodell's <italic>M. avium</italic> Nature paper, Murray et al. Blood on the IFN-gamma KO mice infected with BCG).</p><p>2) Results section. The authors draw a conclusion &quot;These results suggest M.tb hijacks IL-6R-mediated myeloid differentiation by human CD34<sup>+</sup> cells in vivo&quot;. There is no evidence of &quot;hijacking&quot; provided. Only that something happens to the IL-6 pathway, which is entirely expected if a cell is infected with an intracellular bacteria.</p><p>3) Subsection “Recent genetic changes link IL6/IL6R/CEBP axis, monocyte expansion and TB pathogenesis in humans”. Myeloid expansion. In this very long section, the authors propose a correlation between myeloid expansion and M.tb infection, including a lengthy analysis of Neanderthal genomics, which cannot be tested.</p><p>In summary, the authors' model may or may not happen. The reliance on correlative studies means no firm conclusions can be drawn about the system at hand. While some leeway is warranted because it is a human-based study, the overall conclusions are not sufficiently substantiated.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.47013.045</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p>[Editors’ note: the author responses to the first round of peer review follow.]</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Our decision has been reached after consultation between the reviewers.

The set of experiments to study <italic>Mtb</italic> infectivity by CD34<sup>+</sup> cells employed two approaches. First (Figure 1A-D), we used PBMC cultures, which contain both CD14<sup>+</sup> and CD34<sup>+</sup> cells in the same well. Second (Figure 1E-G and Figure 1—figure supplement 1C,D), we used sorted cord blood derived purified CD34<sup>+</sup> cells and PBMC derived purified CD14<sup>+</sup> cells from different subjects. Hence, employing confocal microscopy, now Figure 1—figure supplement 1C was meant to formally demonstrate that purified CD34<sup>+</sup> cells can be infected by <italic>Mtb</italic>. In contrast, novel Figure 1—figure supplement 1D was meant to be a positive control confirming that H37RV <italic>Mtb</italic> replicates in purified CD14<sup>+</sup> cells and, in that case, the statistical comparison was performed to show that the bacilli replicate over time. We apologize for the unclear information provided and have now clarified this information in the Results section and included a representative dot plot of the CD14<sup>+</sup> cell population in Figure 1A.</p><p>Additionally, while we observed a statistical difference between <italic>Mtb</italic> replication in CD34<sup>+</sup> vs CD14<sup>+</sup> cells, we have not included this information in the same graph because these cells were not obtained “side-by-side” from the same donors and these cell populations were cultivated in different media – purified CD34<sup>+</sup> cells require complete StemSpan SFEM II (growth factors enriched media, please see Materials and methods). Nevertheless, for comparisons and as per reviewer’s request, we have now presented this new information below (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig1">Author response image 1</xref>, left panel).

In vitro studies show that Mtb replicates in human CD34<sup>+</sup> cells, and causes upregulation of the monocyte marker CD14 as well as enrichment of genes associated with myeloid differentiation. This in vitro monocyte expansion is demonstrated to be IL-6 dependent and associated with STAT1 and CEBP signaling. IL-6 receptor blockade impairs CD14 upregulation in infected CD34<sup>+</sup> cell and reduces CFU burden, suggesting that this differentiation pathway is advantageous for Mtb. Interestingly, analysis of the IL6/IL6R/CEBP signaling axis among different mammalian species suggested that coordinate regulation of CEBP by IL6 and type 1 IFN is a relatively recent event in mammalian evolution and seems restricted to primates. This is corroborated by in vitro experiments using infection of cells from 10 species. Overall, the authors demonstrate, with compelling mechanistic evidence, a role for Mtb in co-opting an evolutionarily recent signaling axis to support infection by driving monocyte differentiation. The evolutionary aspect of the study is particularly intriguing.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate the reviewer’s analysis of our manuscript and thank him for his positive comments on the manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3:</p><p>In this manuscript the authors' study the mechanisms by which HSPC differentiation occurs following Mtb infection.

While Syto24 is a fluorescent probe employed to detect the frequency of Syto24-positive CD34<sup>+</sup> vs CD14<sup>+</sup> PBMC populations in the same well, this technique yields only an estimate of the numbers of <italic>Mtb</italic> associating with the host cell. Therefore, CFU/ml was used as a reliable golden standard bacterial count. To assess the reviewer’s question, we would need to isolate CD34<sup>+</sup> cells and CD14<sup>+</sup> cells from PBMC, infect with <italic>Mtb</italic>Syto24 and compare to CD34<sup>+</sup> and CD14<sup>+</sup> cells sorted from <italic>Mtb</italic>Syto24-infected PBMCs.

These data support that the rate of uptake/infectivity of CD34<sup>+</sup> cells is not different when isolated or infected as (a small fraction of) total PBMCs. We have now incorporated this information in the Results section (new Figure 1—figure supplement 1B) and, as per reviewer’s request, we have now included the uninfected control in the flow cytometry analysis (new Figure 1D).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Figure 3:</p><p>The authors show that heat-killed Mtb is unable to stimulate the same increase in myeloid differentiation of CD34<sup>+</sup> cells as live Mtb.

Since many myeloid differentiation markers were blocked by neutralization of IL-6R signaling in both untreated and <italic>Mtb</italic>-exposed cell culture systems, we deduced that this was an IL-6R-‘mediated’ and not IL-6R-‘dependent’ phenomenon. Nevertheless, as per reviewer’s request, we have now measured intracellular IL-6 levels in CD34<sup>+</sup> from PBMC exposed to HK <italic>Mtb</italic> and live <italic>Mtb</italic>.

Our data suggest a collaborative and, for some functions, a redundant role for IL-6 and IFNs, C/EBP-β being an important hub for myeloid differentiation. While it has been reported that IFN-induced C/EBP-β activates GATE sequences independent of STAT1 in certain cell lineages (Li, Gade, Xiao, and Kalvakolanu, 2007), the mechanisms through which endogenous IL-6, IFN-α/β and live <italic>Mtb</italic> interplay to induce myeloid differentiation of HSPCs will require further exploration. We have now incorporated this data as new figures (Figure 4C and Figure 4—figure supplement 1F,G) and have included these points in the Results and Discussion section.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Figure 4:</p><p>Cytokine signaling is a known trigger for myeloid cell differentiation, and therefore the authors identify differential expression of IL-6 as a potential driver of the increased number of CD14<sup>+</sup> cells induced by Mtb infection.

CD34<sup>+</sup> cells infected with Mtb and treated with aIL6R for 10d develop a lower percentage of CD14<sup>+</sup> cells than untreated infected cells, at a much later time point than when differences in IL-6 induction (either by protein or transcriptional data) are seen.</p><p>A time course showing IL-6 levels in culture (1,3,5,7,10dpi) as well as a time course showing when the CD14<sup>+</sup> population begins to expand in the untreated Mtb infected cells would more support the idea that it is an IL-6-dependent expansion. Alternatively, the authors could consider only blocking IL-6R early, when there is a significant difference in protein levels, to determine if there is the same effect on myeloid expansion.</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewer raises an interesting point. The RNAseq data demonstrated in the heat maps were displayed as z-score values. However, when we plotted RNAseq normalized counts data from 2 independent experiments (technical replicates from 3 donors), we can observe that <italic>IL6</italic> (and <italic>IL6R</italic>) transcript levels are higher in <italic>Mtb</italic>-exposed cultures than those found in uninfected cells starting at day 1.</p><p>This was confirmed by qPCR experiments (novel Figure 4—figure supplement 1B,C), which showed enhancement of <italic>IL6</italic> amplification at day 1 post-infection, thus correlating with the protein being produced at this time point. However, we only started to detect a measurable difference in monocyte frequencies at 5-7 dpi. This is consistent with the idea that early signals, such as those provided by IL-6/IL-6R, are important for driving CD14<sup>+</sup> monocyte differentiation at later time points. In agreement with this hypothesis, it has been reported that IL-6 increases myeloid output in multipotent progenitors but not in lineage committed myeloid progenitors (Schurch, Riether, and Ochsenbein, 2014), which implies several sequential cellular or molecular processes are needed for monocyte development to be completed. As per reviewer’s request, we have performed a detailed time course to measure CD14<sup>+</sup> frequencies during <italic>Mtb</italic> infection by CD34<sup>+</sup> cells. As a control, we confirmed that <italic>Mtb</italic> H37Rv replicated in the cultures over time (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig3">Author response image 3</xref>). Furthermore, CD14<sup>+</sup> monocytes started to appear on day 3 of culture, but only at day 7, <italic>Mtb</italic> shows a slight difference in terms of CD14<sup>+</sup> levels. This difference becomes more evident by day 10 of culture.</p><fig id="respfig3"><label>Author response image 3.</label><caption><title>Mtb growth and CD14+ frequencies in CD34+ cultures exposed to H37Rv in vitro.</title><p>Left panel, CFU loads of human cord blood purified CD34<sup>+</sup> cells infected with Mtb H37Rv.

In the published model, specific transcription factors (TFs) need to be sequentially activated to stimulate cell differentiation processes. Indeed, when we employed Cell Router on 180 hematopoiesis-associated TFs found in our transcriptomics (Figure 2B), we observed that mRNA signature scores for the myeloid development (GRAN/MONO) started at day 1 post-infection, but a difference between untreated vs <italic>Mtb</italic>-exposed cells was detected only after day 3 of infection. Thus, our data suggest a model in which exogenous IL-6 (in the conditioned StepSpan medium) primes secretion of endogenously produced IL-6 by live <italic>Mtb</italic> at day 1, which sequentially activates myeloid TFs and their targets on the following days of culture, culminating with measurable CD14<sup>+</sup> cells at later time points.</p><p>However, at later time points, cell cultures change by displaying increased cell heterogeneity in addition to <italic>Mtb</italic> replication, which makes it difficult to approach how IL-6 responses are regulated. For example, in experiments using exogenous IL-6 (20 ng/mL) and <italic>Mtb</italic>, we observed that simultaneous addition of both downregulated C/EBP-β protein levels (Figure 4—figure supplement 1, compare 3<sup>rd</sup> and 4<sup>th</sup> lanes). It appears that, while a certain level of IL-6 production is enhanced by <italic>Mtb</italic>, too much cytokine could have some inhibitory actions, indicating a very complex interplay between IL-6 and <italic>Mtb</italic> infection. We believe that, in addition to IL-6-mediated myeloid differentiation by <italic>Mtb</italic> initiated early on during infection, pathogen replication regulates yet-to-be-defined intracellular associated events. We appreciate the reviewer’s suggestion about the early blockade of IL-6, but unfortunately, we did not have enough cells to perform this experiment. Nevertheless, our data show that IL-6R participates in the <italic>Mtb</italic>-enhanced myeloid differentiation and we have now incorporated the monocyte differentiation curve data (Figure 3—figure supplement 1E) in the Results section.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Additionally, despite making note that &quot;interferon signaling&quot; and &quot;interferon alpha/beta&quot; pathways were significantly enriched in the infecting cells, neither IFNa/b nor IFN-g are well represented in the RNAseq data that is shown, and these cytokines are also not measured at the protein level. Including this data would provide better support for the data represented in Figure 4D-E, where no changes are seen after IFNAR or IFN-g blockade. This is a particularly critical point for the authors' later argument that transcription factors induced by both IFN and IL-6 are primarily being driven by IL-6 to induce myeloid differentiation.</p></disp-quote><p>We were also intrigued with the increased ISG expression in the RNAseq without IFN-α/β and IFN-γ being represented in the RNAseq data. However, some but not all donors displayed increased <italic>IFN</italic> mRNA as detected in qPCR experiments (Figure novel S4c), which could partially explain the observed &quot;interferon signaling&quot; and &quot;interferon α/β&quot; pathways enriched in our samples. However, several groups previously demonstrated that while ISG expression can be easily detected, <italic>IFNA/B</italic> mRNA or protein are notoriously difficult to detect (Berry et al., 2010; Rodero et al., 2017). For example, a recent study (Llibre et al., 2019) employed digital ELISA to show neither type I IFN was detected in samples from tuberculosis patients, whereas type I IFN signaling is detectable in myeloid cells after infection (Berry et al., 2010). Nevertheless, as per reviewer request, we measured IFN-γ in the supernatants by ELISA, which showed no production of this cytokine in CD34<sup>+</sup> cell cultures exposed to <italic>Mtb</italic>. Unfortunately, we did not have access to the ultrasensitive assay used by Rodero et al. and Llibre et al. to measure type I IFNs. However, anticipating the difficult to measure type I IFN in our system, we have performed experiments blocking IFNAR2, demonstrating inhibition of <italic>Mtb</italic>-enhanced ISGs STAT1 and MX1, suggesting bioactive type I IFN protein is present in our system and involved in the ISGs transcription upregulated in CD34<sup>+</sup> cells. We have now included this new set of data in a new Figure 4—figure supplement 1(E and H) and have mentioned this in the Results section of the manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The authors show in Figure 1 F-G that Mtb is associated with cells undergoing morphological change.

To do so, we would need to investigate cohorts of re-infected patients and interrogate whether the IFN-IL6-CEBP axis is modulated during re-infection and linked to different TB disease outcomes. Unfortunately, to our knowledge, no such cohorts exist at the present moment and the correlates of innate immune memory during the natural infection of <italic>Mtb</italic> are still an open question in the field. Yet, our results argue in favor of the IFN-IL6-CEBP axis amplifying, rather than protecting against TB disease in humans. In support of this hypothesis, HSPC-derived monocytes induced by <italic>Mtb</italic> display increased frequency of CD14<sup>+</sup>CD16<sup>+</sup> cells (Figure 3J), a subpopulation associated with severe TB disease (Balboa et al., 2011).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1) That CD34<sup>+</sup> cells can be infected in vitro does not mean it happens in vivo.

We have cited these studies in the original version of the manuscript (Tornack et al., 2017). In addition, as summarized in Mert et al. (Mert et al., 2001), 39 out of 149 bone marrow biopsies in 6 case series of miliary TB patients were positive for <italic>Mtb</italic>, by Ziehl-Neelsen staining and/or PCR. It should be stated that the samples used in their study were either obtained at autopsy or for diagnostic purpose. Due to obvious ethical limitations, we did not have access to bone marrow samples from patients with active TB, but have compared our results obtained in CD34<sup>+</sup> cells obtained from purified cord blood and PBMCs with CD34<sup>+</sup> cells from healthy bone marrow, with similar results (novel Figure 2—figure supplement 1B,C). Regarding myeloid output in TB, we have also cited early studies showing that monocytes are increased in active pulmonary TB patients (Rogers, 1928; Schmitt, Meuret, and Stix, 1977). Furthermore, we have also cited more recent experiments by Scriba et al. (Scriba et al., 2017) demonstrating that monocytes are increased during activation of latent TB in vivo. Together, these studies provide a theoretical framework raising the possibility that <italic>Mtb</italic> infection enhances monocyte output during active TB disease in vivo. We have now stressed this point in the Introduction section of the manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The authors ignore older studies in this area (Goodell's M. avium Nature paper, Murray et al. Blood on the IFN-gamma KO mice infected with BCG).</p></disp-quote><p>We did cite the work by Goodell and colleagues in our previous version of the manuscript (Baldridge, King, Boles, Weksberg, and Goodell, 2010). In this mouse model study, proliferation of HSPCs was induced by IFN-γ, whereas anti-IFN-gamma neutralizing antibody had no effect on monocyte expansion in our human HSPC model. While Murray, Young and Daley (1998) found a role for IFN-g in the extramedullary expansion of myeloid cells in BCG-infected mice, we did not detect production of IFN-γ in our supernatants of <italic>Mtb</italic> H37Rv-exposed human primary CD34<sup>+</sup> cells. It should also be noted that mice infected with <italic>M. avium, M. tuberculosis</italic> or <italic>M. bovis</italic> BCG show different outcomes of disease such as cellular dynamics of myeloid cells circulating in the blood and/or recruited into the tissues. For instance, Noris and Ernst have recently reported <italic>Mtb</italic>-infected mice displayed increased egress of monocytes from the bone marrow to the blood (Norris and Ernst, 2018). In contrast, Baldridge et al. observed that, upon infection with <italic>M. avium</italic>, the absolute numbers of lymphocytes, neutrophils, monocytes, eosinophils and basophils in peripheral blood remained stable; with a relative increase of CD4<sup>+</sup> T-cells and granulocytes. Moreover, Baldridge et al. showed a loss of granulocyte-monocyte progenitors, common myeloid progenitors, and macrophage-erythroid progenitors with a concomitant increase in common lymphoid progenitors in murine bone marrow. These changes are in strong contrast with human tuberculosis data, where several groups have demonstrated lymphopenia, in parallel to myeloid expansion (both granulocytes and monocytes), as discussed above in point #1.1. We apologize for not citing previous work on murine models of BCG infection such as <italic>Murray</italic> et al. 1998, as our manuscript is focusing on human pathogenesis caused by <italic>Mtb</italic> infection.

The authors draw a conclusion &quot;These results suggest M.tb hijacks IL-6R-mediated myeloid differentiation by human CD34<sup>+</sup> cells in vivo&quot;. There is no evidence of &quot;hijacking&quot; provided. Only that something happens to the IL-6 pathway, which is entirely expected if a cell is infected with an intracellular bacteria.</p></disp-quote><p>We would like to correct that our manuscript actually stated: “These results suggest <italic>Mtb</italic> hijacks IL-6R-mediated myeloid differentiation by human CD34<sup>+</sup> cells in vitro.” We suggested the term “hijacking” because, in our opinion, this correctly and intuitively describes the in vitro process in which <italic>Mtb</italic> infection of purified CD34<sup>+</sup> cells significantly increase monocyte expansion, resulting in significantly increased mycobacterial burden, both of which are blocked by anti-IL-6R antibody, the latter arguing in favor of causality, at least in vitro. However, as instructed by the Editor, we have now removed the word “hijacking” from the manuscript. We hypothesize this phenomenon might occur in vivo, since progression from latent to active TB is accompanied with increased monocyte levels (novel Figure 5F), significantly correlated with the IL-6 signaling pathway (novel Figure 5H-G-I, p&lt;0.0001), as well as in vivo <italic>Mtb</italic> loads in TB patients (novel Figure 5J<italic>CEBPB</italic> transcript levels versus <italic>Mtb</italic> sputum positivity, p&lt;0.01), all of this in paired samples (also expanded with disease severity measured as symptom count and modal X-ray grade in Suppl. Figure S5b). This in vivo evidence is indeed based upon association/correlation and we did not indicate causation in any of this data interpretation.</p><p>Weagree with the reviewer that IL-6 (among other pro-inflammatory cytokines) is frequently induced by upon infection by several bacteria. However, this does not translate into increased monocyte expansion in several murine models of infection. As outlined above, Baldridge et al. (2010) demonstrated strictly IFN-γ-dependent, IFNAR-independent HSPC proliferation upon <italic>M. avium</italic> infection, without any effect on circulating monocytes. On the other hand, MacNamara et al. described IFN-γ-dependent, IFNAR-independent monocytosis upon <italic>Ehrlichia muris</italic> infection (MacNamara et al., 2011). Boettcher and colleagues found G-CSF-dependent granulopoiesis upon LPS exposure and <italic>E. coli</italic> infection (Boettcher et al., 2014), while Granick et al. show PGE2-dependent granulopoiesis upon <italic>S. aureus</italic> infection (Granick et al., 2013). Since these models do not reflect physiological infection of the bone marrow, we have also compared <italic>Mtb</italic> with <italic>Leishmania infantum</italic>, which is a classical human bone marrow pathogen and the causative agent of human visceral leishmaniasis. As outlined above in reply to Reviewer#2, we found that <italic>L. infantum</italic> infection of human CD34<sup>+</sup> cells does not increase monocyte output in vitro, in contrast to <italic>Mtb</italic> infection.

Starting with several datasets spanning mammalian evolution, we generated independent experimental confirmations providing strong evidence in favor of our observations: 1. amino acid conservation levels in IL6/IL6R/CEBPA/CEBPB/CEBPD<italic>, 2.</italic> human- and primate-specific IFN regulation of <italic>CEBPB</italic> and <italic>CEBPD</italic> transcripts as compared to other mammals or rodents (novel Figure 6A, Figure 6B-C and Figure 5—figure supplement 1D).</p><p>Regarding human genetics/evolution, of which Neandertal introgression analysis is a small (but significant) part (see below, novel Figure 6D), GWAS data validated in several independent cohorts from &gt;230,000 individuals (&gt;170,000 Europeans, &gt;62,000 Japanese) demonstrate an irrefutable genetic link between systemic monocyte levels and polymorphisms in several genes from our proposed IL6/IL6R/CEBP gene module (summarized in Figure 7A and detailed in Supplementary file 2), of which a significant number are also validated TB susceptibility genes (Suppl. Figure 5f). In the absence human “knock-out” models, GWAS of large case-control studies are the closest equivalent, several of which have been able to use Mendelian randomization to investigate causation (Porcu et al., 2019; Taylor et al., 2019; Warrington et al., 2019).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In summary, the authors' model may or may not happen. The reliance on correlative studies means no firm conclusions can be drawn about the system at hand. While some leeway is warranted because it is a human-based study, the overall conclusions are not sufficiently substantiated.</p></disp-quote><p>We respectfully disagree with the reviewer that we did not present substantiated evidence to propose this model (which has not been challenged by the other 3 reviewers). Nevertheless, we acknowledge his/her comment and have now included two new Figure panels, which provide mechanistic insights and additional experimental support for our model.</p><p>First, to substantiate our hypothesis that transcriptional up-regulation of <italic>CEBPB</italic> and <italic>CEBPD</italic> by IFN are recent in mammalian evolution, we compiled IFN signaling through STAT1 ChipSeq analysis with chromatin architecture, RNAseq gene transcription in purified CD34<sup>+</sup> vs. CD14<sup>+</sup> cells and sequence conservation across 100 vertebrates (ranging from birds to mammals). We compared the most diverse genes in our module, <italic>CEBPB</italic> and <italic>CEBPD,</italic> to the most conserved, <italic>CXCL10</italic> and <italic>CXCL9</italic>, with respect to their type I IFN regulation (represented in Figure 6B). As shown in Figure 6C, we found that STAT1-binding peaks in <italic>CEBPB</italic> and <italic>CEBPD</italic> observed by ChipSeq analysis of IFN-stimulated human monocytes corresponded to regions with active chromatin (DNase Hypersensitivity Sites, DHS) and correlated with increased downstream transcription in CD14<sup>+</sup> monocytes and purified CD34<sup>+</sup> cells. In agreement with our findings (represented in Figure 6B), only 3 out of 11 (27%) STAT1 binding peaks in <italic>CEBPB</italic> and <italic>CEBPD</italic> were found in regions conserved during mammalian evolution (from chicken to humans), while 6 out of 7 (86%) STAT1 peaks were conserved in <italic>CXCL9</italic> and <italic>CXCL10</italic> genes.</p></body></sub-article></article>
