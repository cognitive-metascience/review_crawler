Even minor structural differences in the ascarosides have dramatic consequences for their biological activities. Here, we identify a mechanism that enables <italic>C. elegans</italic> to dynamically tailor the fatty-acid side chains of the indole-3-carbonyl (IC)-modified ascarosides it has produced. In response to starvation, <italic>C. elegans</italic> uses the peroxisomal acyl-CoA synthetase ACS-7 to activate the side chains of medium-chain IC-ascarosides for β-oxidation involving the acyl-CoA oxidases ACOX-1.1 and ACOX-3. This pathway rapidly converts a favorable ascaroside pheromone that induces aggregation to an unfavorable one that induces the stress-resistant dauer larval stage. Thus, the pathway allows the worm to respond to changing environmental conditions and alter its chemical message without having to synthesize new ascarosides de novo. We establish a new model for biosynthesis of the IC-ascarosides in which side-chain β-oxidation is critical for controlling the type of IC-ascarosides produced.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.33286.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Small roundworms such as <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic> release chemical signals called ascarosides in order to communicate with other worms of the same species.

The ascarosides thus help the worms in the population decide whether the neighborhood is good – meaning they should hang around, eat, and make babies – or whether the neighborhood is bad.

The ascarosides are derivatives of the 3,6-dideoxysugar ascarylose that can be named according to their structural features, including the number of carbons (C#) in their fatty acid-derived side chains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Butcher, 2017</xref>). These side chains are attached to the ascarylose sugar at their penultimate (ω−1) or terminal (ω) carbon and are often unsaturated (Δ) at the α-β position. The ascarosides can be modified with various head groups at the 4’-position of the ascarylose sugar, such as the IC, the octopamine succinyl (OS), the 4-hydroxybenzoyl (HB), and the (<italic>E</italic>)-2-methyl-2-butenoyl (MB) groups. They can also be modified with various terminus groups at the end of their fatty-acid side chain. These head and terminus modifications can have important consequences for the biological activity of the ascarosides. For example, while unmodified, simple ascarosides are often negative signals that induce avoidance in <italic>C. elegans</italic>, ascarosides that are modified with an IC head group, such as IC-asc-ΔC9 (icas#3), are favorable signals that induce aggregation at picomolar concentrations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Srinivasan et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">von Reuss et al., 2012</xref>). However, the consequences of the IC group and other modifications can be quite nuanced. For example, unlike IC-ascarosides with medium-length (C9) side chains, which do not induce dauer, an IC-ascaroside with a short (C5) side chain, IC-asc-C5 (icas#9), is one of the five primary components of the dauer pheromone and induces the dauer larval stage when it accumulates at low nanomolar concentrations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Butcher et al., 2009a</xref>). Thus, IC-ascarosides have a dual nature to their activity as they are generally favorable signals that induce aggregation on food, but can also indicate unfavorable conditions and induce dauer when they have short side chains and accumulate to higher concentrations.</p><p>Peroxisomal β-oxidation is central to biosynthesis of the ascarosides. β-oxidation cycles shorten the side chains of long-chain ascaroside precursors by two carbons per cycle to produce short- and medium-chain ascaroside pheromones (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Golden and Riddle, 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Wanders and Waterham, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Butcher et al., 2009b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Joo et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Joo et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">von Reuss et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Zhang et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Zhang et al., 2018</xref>). The first step in these β-oxidation cycles is catalyzed by an acyl-CoA oxidase, which installs a double bond at the α-β position of its substrate in a reaction that uses an FAD cofactor and produces H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>. Specific acyl-CoA oxidases process ascaroside precursors with specific side-chain lengths and thus help to control which pheromones are produced (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Joo et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">von Reuss et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Zhang et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Zhang et al., 2018</xref>). The <italic>C. elegans</italic> genome encodes seven acyl-CoA oxidases, five of which have been implicated in ascaroside production (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Zhang et al., 2018</xref>). To reflect their similarity to mammalian ACOX-1, the acyl-CoA oxidases that were previously referred to as ACOX-1, –2, −3, –4, and −5 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">von Reuss et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Zhang et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">2016</xref>) have been renamed ACOX-1.1, –1.2, −1.3, –1.4, and −1.5, respectively, and an additional acyl-CoA oxidase (F59F4.1) has been named ACOX-1.6. To reflect its similarity to mammalian ACOX-3, the acyl-CoA oxidase that was previously referred to as ACOX-6 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Zhang et al., 2016</xref>) has been renamed ACOX-3. The remaining three steps in each β-oxidation cycle are catalyzed by an enoyl-CoA hydratase (MAOC-1), an (<italic>R</italic>)-3-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase (DHS-28), and a 3-ketoacyl-CoA thiolase (DAF-22) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Butcher et al., 2009b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Joo et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Joo et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">von Reuss et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Zhang et al., 2015</xref>). Our group has shown that (ω−1)-ascarosides and ω-ascarosides are biosynthesized by two parallel β-oxidation pathways, the former pathway involving ACOX-1.1, ACOX-1.3, ACOX-1.4, and ACOX-3 and the latter pathway involving ACOX-1.1 and ACOX-1.2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Zhang et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Zhang et al., 2018</xref>). In general, extensive β-oxidation of ascaroside precursors by these pathways to make ascarosides with very short side chains generates some of the most potent dauer pheromones, such as asc-ωC3 (ascr#5).</p><p>Very little is known about how various head groups, such as the IC, OS, HB, and MB groups, become attached to the ascarosides and how this attachment process is coordinated with the β-oxidation process that shortens the ascaroside side chains. Attachment of the IC head group to the 4’-position of the ascarylose is thought to occur late in the biosynthetic pathway after β-oxidation of the side chain has occurred (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">von Reuss et al., 2012</xref>). The exogenous addition of a synthetic ascaroside with a nine-carbon side chain, asc-C9 (ascr#10), to <italic>daf-22</italic> worms (which are defective in β-oxidation and thus cannot make short- and medium-chain ascarosides, but which presumably can still biosynthesize the IC group and attach it) leads to production of the corresponding IC-ascaroside, IC-asc-C9 (icas#10) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">von Reuss et al., 2012</xref>). This result suggests that attachment of the IC group occurs after side-chain β-oxidation, at least in the biosynthetic pathway to IC-asc-C9. The acyl-CoA synthetase gene, <italic>acs-7</italic>, has been shown to be required for biosynthesis of the short-chain IC- and OS-modified ascarosides, IC-asc-C5 and OS-asc-C5 (osas#9), but not for medium-chain IC- and OS-ascarosides, such as IC-asc-C9 and OS-asc-C9 (osas#10) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Panda et al., 2017</xref>). Panda et al. proposed that ACS-7 activates indole-3-carboxylic acid (ICA) as the corresponding CoA-thioester (IC-CoA) and is involved in the attachment of the IC group specifically to the short-chain ascaroside asc-C5 (ascr#9) to make IC-asc-C5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). However, while Panda et al. were able to show that ACS-7 activates ICA as an AMP-ester (IC-AMP), they could not show that ACS-7 catalyzes the formation of IC-CoA or attachment of the IC group to an ascaroside (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Their interpretation of these data was that some other protein or factor was required for the full activity of ACS-7. Panda et al. showed that mutant worms lacking lysosome-related organelles (LROs) did not make 4’-modified ascarosides, and they reported that ACS-7 was expressed in the lysosome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Panda et al., 2017</xref>). Thus, they concluded that ACS-7 was functioning inside the lysosomes in IC-ascaroside biosynthesis.</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.33286.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Comparison of the previous model and the model supported by our current data.</title><p>In both the previous model (<bold>A</bold>) and the current model (<bold>B</bold>), long-chain ascarosides are shortened to medium- and short-chain ascarosides through β-oxidation cycles in the peroxisome. (<bold>A</bold>) According to the previous model, the final step in the biosynthesis of all of the IC-modified ascarosides is the attachment of the IC head group to the 4’-position of the ascarylose sugar. Short/medium-chain ascarosides, such as asc-C5 and asc-C9, are transported from the peroxisome to the lysosome, where the IC group is attached. According to this model, the acyl-CoA synthetase ACS-7 plays a key role in activating ICA as its corresponding CoA thioester, IC-CoA, for attachment specifically to asc-C5 to make IC-asc-C5. (<bold>B</bold>) According to our model, the IC head group is only attached to ascarosides with medium-length side chains, such as asc-C9. The biosynthesis of IC-modified ascarosides with shorter side chains, such as IC-asc-C5, requires additional β-oxidation in the peroxisome. In our model, under favorable conditions, the IC head group is attached by unknown enzymes to the medium-chain ascarosides, such as asc-C9, to make aggregation pheromones. This process may occur in the lysosome as it has been shown that the lysosome is required for the biosynthesis of 4’-modified ascarosides (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Panda et al., 2017</xref>). If conditions decline, such as during starvation, ACS-7 then plays a key role for activating IC-asc-C9 as the corresponding CoA-thioester for further β-oxidation of its side chain in the peroxisome to make shorter-chain IC-ascarosides, such as the dauer pheromone IC-asc-C5.</p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="postscript" mimetype="application" xlink:href="elife-33286-fig1-v2"/></fig><p>Here, we show that the role of the acyl-CoA synthetase ACS-7 is not to attach the IC group to ascarosides as proposed by Panda et al., but to activate the side chains of medium-chain IC-ascarosides for shortening through β-oxidation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). Thus, in contrast to the previously proposed model, we show that β-oxidation of the side chain occurs <italic>after</italic> attachment of the IC head group in the biosynthesis of the short-chain IC-ascarosides. Our data show that under favorable, growth-promoting conditions, the IC group is preferentially attached to ascarosides with 8–11-carbon side chains to form aggregation pheromones. However, if conditions decline, such as during starvation, the side chains of these IC-ascarosides can be activated by ACS-7 and then shortened through peroxisomal β-oxidation cycles involving ACOX-1.1 and ACOX-3 to make the potent dauer pheromone IC-asc-C5. Consistent with its function in activating ascarosides for peroxisomal β-oxidation, ACS-7 is localized to the peroxisome, rather than the lysosome, as previously reported by Panda et al. Our results uncover the mechanism by which <italic>C. elegans</italic> responds to declining environmental conditions and converts aggregation-inducing, medium-chain IC-ascarosides to dauer-inducing, short-chain IC-ascarosides. This mechanism is likely also used by <italic>C. elegans</italic> in the biosynthesis of short-chain OS-ascarosides, which induce nematode dispersal under unfavorable conditions. Using this mechanism, <italic>C. elegans</italic> can efficiently alter the function of existing ascarosides simply by tailoring the length of the side chain, providing a novel strategy to rapidly modulate chemical signaling in response to environmental conditions.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Attachment of the IC group during ascaroside biosynthesis</title><p>Previously, it has been shown that <italic>daf-22</italic> worms, which cannot make any short- or medium-chain ascarosides, can attach the IC group to exogenously provided synthetic asc-C9 to produce IC-asc-C9 (structures shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A,B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">von Reuss et al., 2012</xref>).

To determine whether <italic>C. elegans</italic> could attach the IC group to other ascarosides, we cultured <italic>daf-22</italic> worms with ascarosides of various side-chain lengths (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). These data suggest that the unknown enzyme that attaches the IC group specifically prefers ascarosides with side chains of 8–11 carbons in length (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>).

Our data show that IC-asc-C9 is a much better substrate for ACS-7, which rapidly converts IC-asc-C9 to the corresponding CoA-thioester, IC-asc-C9-CoA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). We have shown that once the side chain of the medium-chain IC-ascarosides is activated, it can be shortened through β-oxidation cycles involving ACOX-1.1, ACOX-3, and likely ACOX-1.4 as well, to make the short-chain IC-ascaroside, IC-asc-C5. Specifically, we have shown that the <italic>acox-1.1;acox-3</italic> double deletion mutant fails to make any IC-asc-C5 and accumulates IC-asc-C7. Furthermore, ACOX-1.1 and ACOX-3 are able to process IC-asc-C9-CoA to IC-asc-C5-CoA in vitro with the help of the β-oxidation enzymes MAOC-1, DHS-28, and DAF-22. Consistent with ACS-7 working in the same biosynthetic pathway as ACOX-1.1 and ACOX-3, the three genes appear to be transcriptionally co-regulated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">von Mering et al., 2005</xref>). ACOX-3 has been shown to be induced by dietary restriction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Palgunow et al., 2012</xref>). ACS-7 and ACOX-3 have also been shown to be co-regulated by the transcription factor SKN-1, which functions in a variety of stress responses, including detoxification, pathogen defense, the unfolded protein response, and lipid metabolism under starvation conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Blackwell et al., 2015</xref>). However, the significance of this regulation for IC-ascaroside biosynthesis remains to be seen.</p><p>In addition to the IC-ascarosides, ACS-7 is also necessary for biosynthesis of short-chain OS-ascarosides, as <italic>acs-7</italic> mutant worms cannot make the short-chain OS-ascarosides (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Panda et al., 2017</xref>). Thus, it is likely that, in addition to medium-chain IC-ascarosides, ACS-7 also activates medium-chain OS-ascarosides for β-oxidation of their side chains. The β-oxidation of IC- and OS-modified ascarosides may be regulated in a similar fashion. Starvation has been shown to increase the ratio of short-chain (C5) to medium-chain (C9) OS-ascarosides (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Artyukhin et al., 2013</xref>). Production of the short-chain OS-ascaroside OS-asc-C5 (osas#9) under starvation conditions is consistent with its biological role, as it acts as a dispersal signal that encourages the worm population to seek more favorable conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Artyukhin et al., 2013</xref>). In addition to the IC and OS head groups, the 4’-position of the ascarosides can also be modified by the MB and HB head groups (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">von Reuss et al., 2012</xref>). However, MB- and HB-ascarosides with fewer than nine-carbons in their side chains have not been detected in <italic>C. elegans</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">von Reuss et al., 2012</xref>). Thus, unlike medium-chain IC-and OS-ascarosides, medium-chain MB- and HB-ascarosides probably do not undergo activation by an acyl-CoA synthetase for further β-oxidation in the peroxisome.</p><p>In contrast to previous reports that suggested ACS-7 is localized to the lysosomes in the intestine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Panda et al., 2017</xref>), we have shown that ACS-7 is localized to the peroxisomes. It is likely that the peroxisome is where ACS-7 contributes to IC-ascaroside biosynthesis, as ACS-7 activates the medium-chain IC-ascarosides as their CoA-thioesters for β-oxidation by the peroxisomal enzymes ACOX-1.1/ACOX-3, MAOC-1, DHS-28, and DAF-22. The lysosome has been shown to be important for biosynthesis of ascarosides modified with a head group on the 4’-position of the ascarylose sugar (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Panda et al., 2017</xref>). Mutant worms that lack LROs, such as <italic>glo-1</italic> mutants, do not make any ascarosides modified on the 4’-position with IC, OS, HB, or MB head groups (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Panda et al., 2017</xref>). In a model that accounts for the role of the LROs in ascaroside biosynthesis, long-chain ascarosides could be shortened to medium- and short-chain ascarosides in the peroxisome, and then medium-chain ascarosides, such as asc-C9, may be transported from the peroxisome to the LROs for attachment of 4’-modifications, such as attachment of the IC head group to make IC-asc-C9, by unknown enzymes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). In response to changing internal or external conditions, these modified ascarosides could then be transported back to the peroxisome for activation by ACS-7 and further β-oxidation of their side chains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). Trafficking of the ascarosides through multiple cellular organelles, such as the peroxisome and LROs, during biosynthesis may enable <italic>C. elegans</italic> to induce the production of modified ascarosides with specific side-chain lengths only under certain conditions or only in certain tissues.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th>Reagent type (species) <break/>or resource</th><th>Designation</th><th>Source or reference</th><th>Identifiers</th><th>Additional information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td rowspan="11">Gene (<italic>C. elegans</italic>)</td><td><italic>acox-1.1</italic></td><td/><td>WBGene00008564</td><td>Other names: CELE_F08A8.1, <italic>acox-1</italic></td></tr><tr><td><italic>acox-1.2</italic></td><td/><td>WBGene00008565</td><td>Other names: CELE_F08A8.2, <italic>acox-2</italic>, <italic>drd-100</italic></td></tr><tr><td><italic>acox-1.3</italic></td><td/><td>WBGene00008566</td><td>Other names: CELE_F08A8.3, <italic>acox-3</italic></td></tr><tr><td><italic>acox-1.4</italic></td><td/><td>WBGene00008567</td><td>Other names: CELE_F08A8.4, <italic>acox-4</italic></td></tr><tr><td><italic>acox-1.5</italic></td><td/><td>WBGene00008167</td><td>Other names: CELE_C48B4.1, <italic>acox-5</italic>, <italic>drd-51</italic></td></tr><tr><td><italic>acox-1.6</italic></td><td/><td>WBGene00010336</td><td>Other names: CELE_F59F4.1, <italic>acox-6</italic></td></tr><tr><td><italic>acox-3</italic></td><td/><td>WBGene00019060</td><td>Other names: CELE_F58F9.7, <italic>acox-6</italic></td></tr><tr><td><italic>acs-7</italic></td><td/><td>WBGene00007228</td><td>Other name: CELE_C01G6.7</td></tr><tr><td><italic>maoc-1</italic></td><td/><td>WBGene00017123</td><td>Other name: CELE_E04F6.3</td></tr><tr><td><italic>dhs-28</italic></td><td/><td>WBGene00000991</td><td>Other name: CELE_M03A8.1</td></tr><tr><td><italic>daf-22</italic></td><td/><td>WBGene00013284</td><td>Other name: CELE_Y57A10C.6</td></tr><tr><td>Gene (<italic>M. tuberculosis</italic>)</td><td><italic>fadD6</italic></td><td/><td>Gene ID: 887549</td><td/></tr><tr><td rowspan="17">Strains (<italic>C. elegans</italic>)</td><td>N2</td><td>CGC</td><td valign="bottom">RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/WB-STRAIN:N2_(ancestral)">WB-STRAIN:N2_(ancestral)</ext-link></td><td>wild type (Bristol)</td></tr><tr><td>RAB1</td><td valign="bottom">doi: 10.1021/acschembio.7b01021</td><td valign="bottom"/><td>backcrossed VC1785 <italic>acox-1.1(ok2257)</italic>I</td></tr><tr><td>RAB21</td><td valign="bottom">doi: 10.1021/acschembio.7b01021</td><td/><td>backcrossed <italic>acox-1.4(tm6415)</italic>I</td></tr><tr><td>VC40449</td><td>CGC</td><td>RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/WB-STRAIN:VC40449">WB-STRAIN:VC40449</ext-link></td><td><italic>acox-1.4(gk892586)</italic>I</td></tr><tr><td>RAB22</td><td valign="bottom">doi: 10.1021/acschembio.7b01021</td><td/><td>backcrossed <italic>acox-3(tm4033)</italic>IV</td></tr><tr><td>DR476</td><td>CGC</td><td>RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/WB-STRAIN:DR476">WB-STRAIN:DR476</ext-link></td><td><italic>daf-22(m130)</italic>II</td></tr><tr><td>RAB24</td><td valign="bottom">doi: 10.1021/acschembio.7b01021</td><td/><td><italic>acox-1.1(reb2[E434A])</italic>I</td></tr><tr><td>RAB28</td><td valign="bottom">doi: 10.1021/acschembio.7b01021</td><td/><td><italic>acox-1.4(reb6[E433A])</italic>I</td></tr><tr><td>RAB30</td><td valign="bottom">doi: 10.1021/acschembio.7b01021</td><td/><td><italic>acox-1.1(ok2257)</italic>I<italic>;

FadD6 reaction conditions were similar to previously described conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Arora et al., 2005</xref>) with some modifications. For a 200 μL total reaction volume, ~300 μM asc-C13, IC-asc-C7, or IC-asc-C9, 5 mM CoA, 15 mM ATP and 20 μg FadD6 protein were added to reaction buffer (100 mM Tris, 8 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, pH 7.5), and the reaction was incubated at 30°C for 1 hr. The asc-C13-CoA, IC-asc-C7-CoA, and IC-asc-C9-CoA were purified by Agilent 1200 Series HPLC on a Phenomenex Luna 5 μm C<sub>18</sub> 2 100 Å (100 × 4.6 mm) column. A water (with 10 mM ammonium acetate) and acetonitrile solvent gradient was used, starting from 0% acetonitrile, ramping to 100% acetonitrile over 20 min, and then holding at 100% acetonitrile for 2 min, with a flow rate of 0.7 mL / min. Purified asc-C13-CoA, IC-asc-C7-CoA, and IC-asc-C9-CoA were then dried with a speedvac. Although FadD6 was initially used in the chemoenzymatic synthesis of these molecules, once we identified the substrate preferences of ACS-7, we subsequently used it to make IC-asc-C7-CoA and IC-asc-C9-CoA, as it was much faster and far more consistent than FadD6 at making these compounds.</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>Characterization of CoA-thioesters</title><p>The structures of synthetic IC-asc-C7-CoA, IC-asc-C9-CoA, and asc-C13-CoA were confirmed by LC-MS/MS, using a Nano LCMS Solutions 3 μM 200 Å (0.3 × 150 mm) ProtoSIL C18AQ + column attached to an UltiMate 3000 RSLCnano System and a Bruker Impact II QTOF mass spectrometer, operating in positive ion, heated (H)-ESI mode.

The plasmid was transformed into BL21(DE3) cells, and a culture was grown at 37°C until the OD<sub>600</sub> reached 0.7, at which point expression was induced overnight at 25°C using 0.6 mM IPTG. The cells were resuspended in buffer (25 mM Tris, pH 7.5, 500 mM NaCl, 20 μM FAD) and lysed using a microfluidizer, and the protein was purified with Ni-NTA resin (Thermo Fisher). After the protein was concentrated with a 10 KDa cut-off centricon (MilliporeSigma, Burlington, MA), it was further purified through FPLC on a HiLoad 16/600 Superdex 200 column (GE Healthcare) and concentrated again to 1 mg/mL for assay. <italic>maoc-1</italic>, <italic>dhs-28</italic>, and <italic>daf-22</italic> genes were cloned by PCR from a <italic>C. elegans</italic> (N2) cDNA library.

The retention time of IC-asc-C5-CoA was predicted using the linear relationship between the retention times of IC-asc-C5-CoA and IC-asc-C7-CoA and IC-asc-C9-CoA. The coupled enzyme assay for acyl-CoA oxidase activity was performed as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Zhang et al., 2015</xref>), with several modifications.

After the agar plates solidified, 50 μL of OP50 (freshly inoculated culture in LB medium, 37°C, 225 rpm, 6 hr) were added to the center of each plate. Plates with bacteria were dried in a sterile hood in the dark for about 20 min. Twenty RAB37 <italic>rebEx11 (Pacs-7::gfp::acs-7)</italic> worms or wild-type worms were transferred to each plate while minimizing exposure to light under the microscope. The plates were kept in the dark for 24 hr before imaging.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We thank Patrick McGrath and Wen Xu for kindly providing plasmids and advice for making mutations via CRISPR-Cas9.

A lightly edited version of the letter sent to the authors after peer review is shown, indicating the most substantive concerns; minor comments are not usually included.</p></boxed-text><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Biosynthesis of Indole-Modified Ascaroside Pheromones in <italic>C. elegans</italic>&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been favorably evaluated by Michael Marletta (Senior Editor) and three reviewers, one of whom, Jon Clardy (Reviewer #1), is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>Small molecules called ascarosides govern many of the developmental and behavioral aspects of the important model organism <italic>C. elegans</italic>. Apparently small changes in the structure of an ascaroside can have profound effects on worm behavior. Shortening the chain length of a fatty acid tail by a few carbons can change behavior from the arrested metabolism of the persistent dauer state to aggregative behavior. The authors look at how the biosynthesis of one class of ascaroside, the IC-ascarosides, connects with the altered biological function. They correct a previous model in which the switch would require de novo synthesis of new IC ascarosides into a model where β-oxidation, a common metabolic reaction, changes the structure and function of an existing ascaroside.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>Both reviewers found the new model of IC-ascaroside biosynthesis in which the short chain variants come from β-oxidation of the side chain to be convincingly documented. It also clarifies some puzzling features of the earlier mechanistic proposal and alters our understanding of how ascaroside signaling can be modified to respond to changing circumstances. There are only a few relatively minor comments on the technical aspects of the mechanistic analysis.</p><p>Both reviewers felt that, as written, the manuscript did not put forward a clear case for the updated mechanism's broader significance – a case they both agreed could have been easily made. The new mechanism allows an IC-ascaroside's function to be altered without the de novo synthesis of new ascarosides, and the altered length of the side chain dramatically alters the IC-ascarosides function. Is this shortening by β-oxidation and altered function connected to nutritional status, for example? Is the β-oxidation shortening model applicable to other ascarosides? These issues are hinted at in an unclear fashion in the Discussion at the very end of the manuscript, but they don't appear in the Introduction, which is not clearly written, or the Abstract. The typical <italic>eLife</italic> reader is unlikely to keep reading about mechanistic details without some promise that issues of greater significance will be addressed.</p><p>Title:</p><p>The current title doesn't reflect the full significance of the study that comes from linking biosynthesis to development/behavior. Something like &quot;Biosynthetic tailoring of existing ascarosides alters their biological function.&quot;</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.33286.016</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>Both reviewers found the new model of IC-ascaroside biosynthesis in which the short chain variants come from β-oxidation of the side chain to be convincingly documented.

The Abstract, Introduction, and Discussion have been completely rewritten. In the revised text, we have emphasized that we have identified a mechanism that enables <italic>C. elegans</italic> to dynamically tailor the IC-ascarosides that it has produced. This tailoring enables the worm to respond rapidly to changing environmental conditions and alter its chemical message without having to synthesize new ascarosides de novo. The mechanism explains how <italic>C. elegans</italic> can shorten the side chains of medium-chain IC-ascarosides in response to conditions such as starvation in order to convert a favorable signal that induces aggregation to an unfavorable one that induces the stress-resistant dauer larval stage. This mechanism is also likely used by the worm to tailor the side chains of OS-modified ascarosides under starvation conditions in order to produce a dispersal signal.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Title:</p><p>The current title doesn't reflect the full significance of the study that comes from linking biosynthesis to development/behavior.
