Living organisms have evolved sensory systems to detect and avoid excessive heat or cold: a behavior that is termed ‘thermotaxis’. In rare cases, animals use this ability to locate food sources in their environment. One example of such an adaptation is the female mosquito of the species <italic>Aedes aegypti</italic>.

This type of sensory navigation allows animals to avoid environments of noxious cold and heat, with the goal of remaining in physiologically suitable ambient temperatures. For ectotherms, such as most insects, thermotaxis behavior is the primary method of thermoregulation. Terrestrial invertebrates are vulnerable to temperature extremes, facing the risk of desiccation at elevated temperatures, and rapid hypothermia at low temperatures. Therefore, mechanisms to detect environmental temperatures and trigger appropriate approach or avoidance behaviors are extremely important for their survival. For instance, adult <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic> worms migrate preferentially toward a specific thermal environment determined by the temperature of their cultivation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Hedgecock and Russell, 1975</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Mori and Ohshima, 1995</xref>). Adult <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> flies prefer a narrow range of air temperatures around 24–25°C (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Sayeed and Benzer, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Hamada et al., 2008</xref>) and rapidly avoid air temperatures of ~31°C (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Ni et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>Interestingly, some hematophagous (blood-feeding) arthropods have evolved a specialized mode of thermotaxis to locate endothermic (warm-blooded) hosts. Such thermophilic behavior is seen in kissing bugs [<italic>Triatoma infestans</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Flores and Lazzari, 1996</xref>) and <italic>Rhodnius prolixus</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Schmitz et al., 2000</xref>)], the bedbug [<italic>Cimex lectularius</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Rivnai, 1931</xref>)], the tick [<italic>Ixodes ricinus</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Lees, 1948</xref>)], and many species of mosquito (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Clements, 1999</xref>) including <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic>, a major tropical disease-vector (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bhatt et al., 2013</xref>). Female <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> require a vertebrate blood meal for the production of eggs, and finding a suitable warm-blooded host is therefore an essential component of reproduction. Mosquitoes use a variety of physical and chemical senses to locate hosts in their environment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Cardé, 2015</xref>). When host-seeking, these animals become strongly attracted to inanimate warm objects, eagerly probing at them as if they were hosts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Howlett, 1910</xref>).</p><p>In nature, mosquitoes thermotax in a complex thermal landscape in which ambient air temperature, host body temperature, and surrounding surface temperatures can vary widely. For mosquitoes such as <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic>, host-seeking behavior can be activated by an increase in ambient carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Majeed et al., 2014</xref>). This activation elicits flight activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Eiras and Jepson, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">McMeniman et al., 2014</xref>) and results in an array of behaviors including attraction to visual stimuli (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">van Breugel et al., 2015</xref>) and host olfactory cues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Dekker et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">McMeniman et al., 2014</xref>), and landing on warm objects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Burgess, 1959</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Eiras and Jepson, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Kröber et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Maekawa et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">McMeniman et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">van Breugel et al., 2015</xref>). <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> flying in a wind tunnel can detect a warmed stimulus from a distance, eliciting attraction and thermotaxis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">van Breugel et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>What are the mechanisms by which animals detect thermal stimuli, and how might these be adapted for the specialized needs of heat-seeking female mosquitoes? Thermotaxis is typically initiated by thermosensitive neurons that sample environmental temperature to inform navigational decision-making. Such neurons must be equipped with molecular thermosensors capable of detecting and transducing thermal stimuli. Diverse molecular thermoreceptors have been identified in the animal kingdom, many of which are members of the transient receptor potential (TRP) superfamily of ion channels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Barbagallo and Garrity, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Palkar et al., 2015</xref>). Different thermosensitive TRPs show distinct tuning spanning the thermal spectrum from noxious cold to noxious heat. Among these is TRPA1, which is a heat sensor in multiple insects, including the vinegar fly <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> and the malaria mosquito <italic>Anopheles gambiae</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Hamada et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Wang et al., 2009</xref>). Neurons in thermosensitive sensilla (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Gingl et al., 2005</xref>) of <italic>An. gambiae</italic> female antennae express <italic>TRPA1</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Wang et al., 2009</xref>). In <italic>D. melanogaster, TRPA1</italic> is expressed in internal thermosensors located in the brain, and <italic>DmelTRPA1<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mutants fail to avoid high air temperature in a thermal gradient (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Hamada et al., 2008</xref>). Interestingly, some snakes and vampire bats express thermosensitive TRP channels in organs used to sense infrared radiation from warm-blooded prey (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Gracheva et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">2011</xref>). This raises the possibility that <italic>AaegTRPA1</italic> may be used by mosquitoes to find hosts. Recently, a structurally distinct insect thermosensor, <italic>Gr28b,</italic> was identified in <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Ni et al., 2013</xref>). <italic>Gr28b</italic>, a gustatory receptor paralog, is expressed in heat-sensitive neurons of <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> aristae and is an important component of thermotaxis during rapid avoidance of heat (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Ni et al., 2013</xref>). It is also highly conserved among <italic>Drosophila</italic> species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">McBride et al., 2007</xref>), and has a clear ortholog in <italic>Ae. aegypti, AaegGr19</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Ni et al., 2013</xref>). A functional role for these thermosensors has never been investigated in the mosquito.</p><p>Here, we use high-resolution quantitative assays to examine the behavioral strategies underlying mosquito heat-seeking behavior. Our results show that by seeking relative warmth and avoiding both relative cool and high temperatures, female mosquitoes selectively localized to thermal stimuli that approximate warm-blooded hosts. Using genome editing, we generated mutations in the candidate thermoreceptors, <italic>AaegTRPA1</italic> and <italic>AaegGr19</italic>. We found that <italic>TRPA1</italic> is required for tuning mosquito thermotaxis during host-seeking. <italic>AaegTRPA1<sup>-/- </sup></italic>mutants lacked normal avoidance of thermal stimuli exceeding host body temperatures, resulting in a loss of preference for biologically relevant thermal stimuli that resemble hosts. This work is important because it identifies a key mechanism by which mosquitoes tune their thermosensory systems toward human body temperatures.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>We previously described an assay to model heat-seeking behavior in the laboratory by monitoring mosquitoes landing on a warmed Peltier element in the context of a cage supplemented with CO<sub>2</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A,B</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">McMeniman et al., 2014</xref>). This assay has the advantages that it is simple in design, produces robust behaviors, and enables the collection of data from large numbers of animals in a short experimental timeframe. Using this system, we can examine mosquito responses to diverse thermal stimuli and measure thermotaxis in different ambient temperature environments. We first needed to determine whether heat-seeking behavior habituates over multiple thermal stimulations. In our heat-seeking assay, <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> mosquitoes reliably responded to 12 serial presentations of a 3-minute long 40°C stimulus over the course of more than 2.5 hr, with no evidence of habituation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>).<fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.11750.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Mosquitoes thermotax to stimuli approximating host body temperature.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Schematic of heat-seeking assay enclosure (30 × 30 × 30 cm).

It is unknown whether there are minimal or maximal temperature thresholds constraining mosquito heat-seeking, and whether responses to thermal stimuli depend on the background ambient temperature.</p><p>To investigate these questions, we measured attraction to thermal stimuli produced by heating the Peltier to temperatures ranging from ambient (set to 26°C in these experiments) to 60°C (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D, E</xref>). We found that mosquitoes were highly sensitive to thermal contrast and were attracted to stimuli 2.5°C above ambient (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D–F</xref>). Furthermore, mosquito occupancy on the Peltier increased monotonically with stimulus temperatures up to 40°C. However, for higher temperature stimuli, we observed a dramatic reduction in Peltier occupancy. A 50°C stimulus resulted in approximately half as many animals on the Peltier compared to a 40°C stimulus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D–F</xref>). Stimuli of 55°C or greater resulted in occupancy rates indistinguishable from an ambient thermal stimulus (26°C) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D–F</xref>). Spatial analysis of mosquito occupancy on or near the Peltier revealed that while mosquitoes were still attracted to high-temperature stimuli, they populated the area peripheral to the Peltier, and strongly avoided the Peltier itself for stimuli ≥ 55°C (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>).</p><p>Female mosquitoes searching for a warm-blooded host may be responding to the absolute temperature of a stimulus or may instead be evaluating relative warmth, defined as the differential between a stimulus and background ambient temperature. To investigate the thermotaxis strategies constituting mosquito heat-seeking behavior, we conducted experiments at three ambient temperatures: 21, 26, and 31°C (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A–F</xref>). We found that Peltier occupancy for stimuli 21–40°C depended on the differential between the Peltier and ambient temperature (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2B,C</xref>), rather than the absolute temperature of the Peltier (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). For example, at all ambient temperatures tested, a stimulus 5°C above ambient was sufficient to elicit significant heat-seeking, and elicited approximately half as much Peltier occupancy as a stimulus 10°C above ambient. On the other hand, heat-seeking to targets 50–55°C was inhibited at all ambient temperatures tested (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2D,F</xref>), despite the fact that the temperature differential varied widely in these situations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>).<fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.11750.005</object-id><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Mosquitoes thermotax to relative warmth and avoid both relative cooling and stimuli exceeding host body temperature.</title><p>(<bold>A–F</bold>) Heat-seeking at different ambient temperatures (n = 5–6 trials per condition): 21°C (blue), 26°C (gray), 31°C (orange).

Using a quantitative thermotaxis assay, we modelled <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> heat-seeking behavior in the laboratory. We found that mosquitoes can search for hosts in a wide range of ambient temperatures by seeking relative warmth and avoiding relative cool. Remarkably, these animals can detect a stimulus with thermal contrast as small as 2.5°C. In an outdoor environment, however, hosts are often warmer than the surrounding air but cooler than sun-warmed soil, rocks, trees, and human-made objects (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref>). For this reason, diurnal mosquitoes such as <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> are poorly served by merely thermotaxing to the hottest object available. A more optimal strategy is to search specifically for biologically relevant stimuli, and to avoid thermal stimuli exceeding host temperature, as we have observed in our laboratory models of heat-seeking. Acquiring a blood meal is an essential component of reproduction for a female <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> mosquito. To maximize her chances of success, a female mosquito should reject ‘distracting’ stimuli that exceed host temperatures. Our results demonstrate that <italic>AaegTRPA1</italic> is critical for this selective thermotaxis.</p><p>Mosquito heat-seeking behavior represents an excellent model system for further study of the genetics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Kang et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Zhong et al., 2012</xref>), neuroscience (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Frank et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Liu et al., 2015</xref>), and decision-making (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Luo et al., 2010</xref>) underlying thermosensation and thermotaxis. Until now, mechanistic studies of thermosensation have been largely restricted to traditional laboratory model organisms, such as domestic mice and <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> flies, whose thermotaxis consists mainly of moving away from suboptimal thermal environments. Mosquitoes too, must undergo such behavioral thermoregulation, as we have found in our thermal gradient assay. However, their repertoire of thermotactic behaviors is expanded by the evolution of a specialized and highly tuned mode of thermotaxis to locate warm-blooded hosts. It may also be that these two thermotactic drives—host-seeking and thermoregulation—interact in mosquitoes. For instance, the avoidance of high-temperature stimuli during heat-seeking may be influenced by a nociceptive or thermoregulatory response independent of host-seeking behavior. It will be interesting to investigate the neural mechanisms that regulate divergent behavioral choices of thermoregulation and heat-seeking, and whether these systems are in behavioral conflict during mosquito host-seeking.</p><p>Our work identifies <italic>TRPA1</italic> as a gene regulating mosquito avoidance of high-temperature stimuli, which we have shown to be a major behavioral component of heat-seeking. However, because both <italic>AaegTRPA1<sup>-/-</sup></italic> and <italic>AaegGr19<sup>-/- </sup></italic>mutants retain normal attraction to warmth, this aspect of heat-seeking must rely on other thermoreceptors, still to be identified. Our study shows that this attraction must be mediated either by a single thermosensor that adapts to background temperature, or multiple thermosensors each tuned to a distinct absolute threshold. During interactions with a warm-blooded host or a 50°C Peltier, mosquitoes are likely experiencing a wide range of thermal fluctuations. For instance, there can be a 10°C thermal gradient in the air within 5 mm of a 37°C stimulus or human arm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">van Breugel et al., 2015</xref>). This suggests that for a mosquito standing on a warmed Peltier, the antennae, brain, thorax, forelegs, and proboscis may all be experiencing different temperatures. The temperature of mosquito tissues will also be greatly influenced by their material and geometric properties, as well as thermal conduction due to contact with the Peltier. Furthermore, convective plumes forming in the air near a vertical heated plate can be highly dynamic and turbulent in their structure, with thermal air gradients differing considerably at the bottom and top of the plate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bejan, 2013</xref>). These features of thermal stimuli may explain why mosquitoes in our assay often appear to be differentially attracted to the bottom and top of the Peltier. Future studies characterizing this complex thermal microenvironment, and identifying the relevant thermosensory neurons and receptors will be required to define the thermal fluctuations experienced by mosquitoes during heat-seeking. Understanding the behavioral and molecular basis of thermotaxis in mosquitoes and other disease vectors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Flores and Lazzari, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Schmitz et al., 2000</xref>) is of great biomedical importance. <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> mosquitoes are potent vectors of yellow fever, chikungunya, and dengue arboviruses, resulting annually in hundreds of millions of infections (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bhatt et al., 2013</xref>).

For each trial, 45–50 mosquitoes were introduced into a custom-made Plexiglas box (38.5 × 28 × 12.5 cm) with two Peltier elements (4.6 × 6.5 cm surface area, ATP-O40-12, Custom Thermoelectric, Bishopville, MD) each covered with a taut piece of standard white letter size printer paper (extra bright, Navigator) cut to 9 × 11 cm. The Peltier elements were mounted on a single wall, 3.5 cm above the floor, 8.5 cm from either edge of the enclosure, and adjacent to one another separated by 6.5 cm. Mosquitoes were allowed to acclimate for 10 min, at which point the Peltier elements were both warmed to 40°C. After fully warming the Peltier elements for 60 s, a CO<sub>2</sub> pulse (20 s) was added to the airstream and the Peltier elements were kept at 40°C for a 4-min stimulus period at which point they were returned to ambient temperature (26°C). After a 12-min interstimulus period, the stimulus was repeated, this time with the left Peltier element warmed to 50°C while the right Peltier element was warmed to 40°C. A camera (Point Grey Research, Richmond, BC, Canada) was used to measure mosquito landings, and only mosquitoes directly on either Peltier area during seconds 60–240 of stimulus periods were scored. Preference was calculated by subtracting the proportion of total mosquitoes on the left Peltier (40 or 50°C) from the proportion of total mosquitoes on the right Peltier (40°C). Heat maps are smoothed 2D histograms of mean mosquito occupancy during seconds 60–240 of stimulus periods, sampled at 1 Hz and binned into 15 × 52 image sectors.</p></sec><sec id="s4-3-3"><title>Capillary feeder (CAFE)</title><p>This assay was adapted for the mosquito from the original assay developed for <italic>Drosophila</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Ja et al., 2007</xref>) For each trial, five mosquitoes were fasted with access to water for 24 hr, and placed in a polypropylene vial (#89092–742, VWR, Radnor, PA) with access to two 5-µl calibrated glass capillaries (#53432–706, VWR) containing 10% (w: v) sucrose with 5% (v: v) green McCormick brand food dye. Capillaries spaced ~0.5 cm apart traversed the cotton plug (#49–101, Genesee Scientific, San Diego, CA) of the vial and protruded into the vial &lt; 1 mm to provide a flush surface for mosquitoes to access the liquid while resting on the plug surface. The control capillary contained only green sucrose solution, and the experimental capillary contained green sucrose solution supplemented with 0, 1, or 10 mM of denatonium benzoate (Sigma-Aldrich) or 0, 10, 50, or 100 mM of N-methylmaleimide (Sigma-Aldrich). The experimental capillary with 0 mM chemical was identical to the control capillary, and served as a zero-choice to test for side-bias in the assay. Because a small amount of liquid evaporated during preparation of the capillaries, all choice conditions and genotypes were prepared in a time-staggered format so that any measurement error due to evaporation was spread across the conditions. The levels of remaining liquid in both capillaries were measured after 18–20 hr and were compared to the known initial liquid level. Experiments started at ZT 8–10 and ended at ZT 4–6 the following day. Consumption values were compared to control capillaries in vials without mosquitoes to account for evaporation. We note that in cases where mosquitoes did not feed from a capillary and all liquid loss was due to evaporation, consumption values could be calculated to be negative due to very small variation in evaporation rates between experimental and control capillaries. Any negative consumption values were rounded to zero. Sucrose preference was calculated by dividing the amount consumed from the control capillary (not containing denatonium benzoate or N-methylmaleimide) by the total amount consumed from both capillaries. In experiments with 0 mM denatonium benzoate or 0 mM N-methylmaleimide, one capillary was arbitrarily designated ‘sucrose only’.</p></sec><sec id="s4-3-4"><title>Thermal gradient</title><p>This assay was adapted from one developed for <italic>Drosophila </italic>(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Sayeed and Benzer, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Hamada et al., 2008</xref>). A custom-built enclosure (6 mm tall) was affixed to an aluminum thermal gradient bar (50 × 30.5 cm, TGB-5030, ThermoElectric Cooling America Corp., Chicago, IL) driven by two Peltier elements (AHP-1200CPV, ThermoElectric Cooling America Corp., Chicago, IL). The enclosure was separated lengthwise into 4 lanes (each 50 × 6 cm) that were visually isolated from one another. Three lanes were for testing mosquito thermal preference, while the fourth lane was dedicated to measuring air temperature via an array of eight digital temperature sensors (DS18B20, Maxim, San Jose, CA; connected to an Arduino Uno, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.arduino.cc/">https://www.arduino.cc/</ext-link>) mounted to the top of the enclosure and distributed evenly across the length of the lane and centered in each analysis sector. An overhead camera (C910, Logitech, Lausanne, Switzerland) monitored mosquito position through the transparent lid of the enclosure. Images were acquired once per minute and analyzed using custom MATLAB scripts to count mosquitoes across eight analysis sectors of the lane. The MATLAB script is available for download as <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3-data">Source code 3</xref>. The assay was conducted in a room maintained at 80–90% relative humidity and 14°C to achieve low air temperatures within the gradient enclosure. At the beginning of each 3-hr trial, the air temperature throughout the enclosure was stabilized at ~26°C, and 25–30 mosquitoes were introduced into each lane of the assay. After 90 min, a thermal gradient was established (air temperatures: ~19°C to ~36°C) by heating the right Peltier element and cooling the left Peltier element. Mosquitoes were monitored for an additional 90 min while exposed to this thermal gradient. Mosquito distributions during minutes 60–90 were monitored in both the ‘no thermal gradient’ and ‘thermal gradient’ conditions. Dead mosquitoes were visually identified at the conclusion of each trial. All genotypes were tested in parallel, and their lane positions were randomized across trials.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>Thermal images</title><p>All thermal images were acquired with an infrared camera (E60, FLIR Systems, Wilsonville, OR).</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>All statistical analyses were performed using Prism 5 software (GraphPad Software, Inc., La Jolla, CA).</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We thank Kevin Lee, Conor McMeniman, and members of the Vosshall Lab for discussions and comments on the manuscript; Nilay Yapici for advice, and Sarah-Yeoh Wang for assistance with the CAFE experiments in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B–D</xref>; Gloria Gordon for expert mosquito rearing; Conor J McMeniman for early work on the characterization of the <italic>AaegTRPA1</italic> locus and Benjamin J Matthews for <italic>AaegGr19</italic> RNA-seq analysis, both of which guided ZFN design; Lina Ni and Paul Garrity for valuable advice on the gradient assay in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>; and Marco Gallio, Charles Zuker, and Paul Garrity for sharing unpublished information about <italic>Drosophila</italic> thermosensors prior to publication.

Your article has been favorably assessed by a Senior Editor and three peer reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors. One of the three reviewers, Paul Garrity, has agreed to share his identity.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>This is an elegant manuscript that examines genes involved in thermosensation in <italic>Ae. Aegypti</italic> mosquitoes. The authors established a behavioral assay to test thermal preference and determined the range of temperatures that female mosquitoes find attractive. They then generated targeted mutations in TRPA1 and Gr19, previously shown to participate in <italic>Drosophila</italic> thermosensation, and examined their role in thermal preference. This is an important study because thermotaxis behaviors in mosquitoes have not yet been studied in depth (and quantitatively), and because the authors link a particular thermoreceptor to heat avoidance using genetic knockouts.

We absolutely agree that it would be valuable to know more about the temperature that mosquitoes experience in this assay. This is a very difficult measurement to obtain and interpret, because thermal stimuli by their nature produce extremely complex and non-uniform thermal microenvironments. Moreover, to our knowledge there is no way to determine the instantaneous temperature that thermosensitive neurons in the mosquito sensory structures are experiencing. We could restrict our analysis to only report occupancy in the center of the Peltier, as was suggested, but we would still be unable to claim that these animals are experiencing uniform temperatures. We erred on the side of showing all the data because the behavior of the mosquitoes is likely driven by heat produced from the full surface area of the Peltier. To bring these ideas into the manuscript, we have added the following text to the Discussion:</p><p>“During interactions with a warm-blooded host or a 50°C Peltier, mosquitoes are likely experiencing a wide range of thermal fluctuations. […] Future studies characterizing this complex thermal microenvironment, and identifying the relevant thermosensory neurons and receptors will be required to define the thermal fluctuations experienced by mosquitoes during heat-seeking.”</p><p><italic>3) Why is the occupancy in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> ~2-3x what is seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>?</italic> </p><p>As in many behavioral assays in the laboratory, the absolute level of mosquito heat-seeking varies between experimental sessions. While all possible measures were taken to ensure consistency in mosquito rearing, we note that seasonal, meteorological, and other environmental effects can impact behavior. For this reason, we always include the essential controls within every series of experiments so that we can make appropriate comparisons.</p><p><italic>4) The authors suggest that the broad peak in temp preference (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>) matches the range of host body temps (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>), but shouldn't it also represent a trade-off between thermoregulatory (regulating internal body temp) and heat-seeking behavior? Can the authors comment on this trade-off? Do the authors have a suggestion for how these two processes could be uncoupled to study them separately in this system?</italic> </p><p>This is a very important point, and we have expanded our discussion of these ideas in the context of our data. The following text has been added to the Discussion section:</p><p>“It may also be that these two thermotactic drives – host-seeking and thermoregulation – interact in mosquitoes. For instance, the avoidance of high-temperature stimuli during heat-seeking may be influenced by a nociceptive or thermoregulatory response independent of host-seeking behavior. It will be interesting to investigate the neural mechanisms that regulate divergent behavioral choices of thermoregulation and heat-seeking, and whether these systems are in behavioral conflict during mosquito host-seeking.”</p><p><italic>5) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2(A–E)</xref> should be displayed as &quot;% on Peltier&quot; rather than &quot;normalized% on Peltier&quot;. This is necessary to corroborate the claim that mosquitoes respond to the temperature differential not the absolute temperature, which would be very interesting.</italic> </p><p>Due to the technical constraints of changing the ambient temperature in the environmental room where the behavior is carried out, the experiments in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> were conducted on different days, with different ambient temperature set points on each day. For this reason, we normalized these data to eliminate any effects due to variability in the absolute level of heat-seeking. We believe the important comparison is the relative amount of heat-seeking to different thermal stimuli in each thermal background. The raw, un-normalized data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C and F</xref>) also show that temperature differential is important for attracting mosquitoes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>), and that mosquitoes avoid the Peltier area for stimuli above ~55°C, regardless of the differential (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>).</p><p><italic>6) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3G</xref> explores the temporal dynamics of the temperature seeking behavior.

We have also modified the text (shown below) to more clearly point out the interesting dynamics seen in this figure. We certainly agree with the interpretation that TRPA1 is required for a specific component of thermotaxis in which high-temperature stimuli are avoided. We added the following sentence:</p><p>“Therefore, <italic>AaegTRPA1</italic> is not required for initial attraction to warmth, but is required for normal avoidance of high-temperature stimuli that exceed host body temperature.”</p><p><italic>7) The Introduction does a good job of providing background on the mosquito thermotaxis literature, but could provide better background in comparing/contrasting the thermosensory system of the mosquito with the better studied</italic> Drosophila <italic>system.

The manuscript has been revised to include the following text:</p><p>In the Introduction:</p><p>“In <italic>D. melanogaster</italic>, TRPA1 is expressed in internal thermosensors located in the brain, and <italic>DmelTRPA1<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mutants fail to avoid high air temperature in a thermal gradient (Hamada et al., 2008).”</p><p>In the Results:</p><p>“The different phenotypes of these mutations in <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> and <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> may reflect differences in expression patterns of these genes.
