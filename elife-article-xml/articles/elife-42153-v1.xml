These plants become established in the fall, overwinter, and flower in the spring. Essential to this adaptive strategy is that flowering does not occur prior to winter, and that the perception of winter leads to competence to flower in the spring (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Woods et al., 2014b</xref>). The winter cue perceived in many plants is exposure to a prolonged period of cold, and the process by which such exposure leads to competence to flower is known as vernalization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Chouard, 1960</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Woods et al., 2014a</xref>). In some plants, however, short days (SD) provide an alternative winter cue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Purvis and Gregory, 1937</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Heide, 1994</xref>), and the process by which SD exposure leads to competence to flower has been referred to as SD vernalization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Purvis and Gregory, 1937</xref>). This phenomenon was called SD vernalization because a hallmark of cold-mediated vernalization is acquisition of <italic>competence</italic> to flower rather than flowering per se, and the SD-vernalization phenomenon is similar in that exposure to SD leads to competence, but plants must still be exposed to inductive LD to flower.</p><p>The physiology of SD vernalization has been studied extensively in rye, wheat, barley, and oat (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Purvis and Gregory, 1937</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Dubcovsky et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Sampson and Burrows, 1972</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Heide, 1994</xref>) although it exists in other families of plants as well (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Chouard, 1960</xref>). The study of SD vernalization in wheat and barley is complicated by the fact that there are genotypes of wheat (e.g. Templar) and barley (e.g. Morex) in which flowering per se occurs in SD; that is certain wheat and barley genotypes are facultative LD plants in that they flower most rapidly in LD but also will flower in SD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Kikuchi et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Casao et al., 2011a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Evans, 1987</xref>). This SD flowering in wheat and barley is distinct from SD vernalization. <italic>Brachypodium distachyon</italic> (<italic>B. distachyon</italic>), however, is an obligate LD plant that only has a SD-vernalization pathway and not a SD-flowering pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Ream et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Gordon et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Woods and Amasino, 2015</xref>); thus, the SD-vernalization pathway can be studied in <italic>B. distachyon</italic> without the complication of SD flowering.</p><p>Little is known at a molecular level about how the SD-vernalization pathway operates in any plant species, and thus we have explored the genetic basis of SD vernalization in <italic>B. distachyon.</italic> Our work reveals a novel role for a <italic>FT</italic>-like gene in the SD-vernalization pathway and provides a molecular explanation of the distinction between SD vernalization and SD flowering in the pooid grasses.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results|discussion"><title>Results and discussion</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Natural variation in the SD vernalization response in <italic>B. distachyon</italic></title><p>The model pooid grass B. distachyon has a robust cold-mediated vernalization response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Ream et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Gordon et al., 2017</xref>).

Flowering time was measured as days to heading and leaf number on the parent culm. Furthermore, dissections on the parent culm were made at the end of the experiment in accessions that did not visibly flower to determine the developmental state of the meristem. Forty of the accessions exhibited a robust SD-vernalization response: these accessions flowered rapidly after the shift from SD to LD, but in LD alone flowering occurred only after quite long periods of growth. The accessions never flowered when grown solely in SD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A and B</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1 and S2</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>; Materials and methods contains the rationale for the controls); furthermore, dissections on the parent culm revealed that the meristems were still vegetative after 150 days of growth in SD in all 51 accessions tested, consistent with our previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Ream et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Gordon et al., 2017</xref>) indicating that B. distachyon is an obligate LD plant.

Plants were grown in 8 hr SD for 9 weeks before shifting into 10, 12, 14, 15, or 16 hr day-lengths (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). All three SD-responsive accessions flowered more rapidly after exposure to SD when the day-length was 12 hr or longer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). In <italic>B. distachyon</italic> 12 hr is the minimal day-length that is still partially inductive for flowering (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Ream et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Woods et al., 2017a</xref>). Thus, the flowering effect of SD vernalization is manifest at the same inductive photoperiods as cold-mediated vernalization.</p><p>To determine if SD vernalization, like cold-mediated vernalization, is a quantitative response, we conducted a SD-exposure time course. Four SD-responsive and five non-responsive accessions were grown for 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, or 12 weeks in 8 hr SD before shifting into LD. Like cold-mediated vernalization, the SD response is quantitative—longer periods of SD exposure result in more rapid flowering in the SD-responsive accessions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C</xref>). Furthermore, 8 weeks of SD exposure saturates the SD-vernalization response. Lastly, even 12 weeks of SD exposure did not enable flowering in any of the accessions we had characterized as SD non-responsive in the 8 week SD exposure evaluation noted above.</p><p>We also explored whether the SD vernalization response is possible at a range of developmental stages. In the experiments described above, the SD treatment started when imbibed seeds were sown in soil and continued until plants were shifted into LD and, thus, depending upon the length of time in SD, the SD treatment spanned a range of early developmental stages. To determine if SD vernalization is effective at later developmental stages, we grew SD-responsive accessions in LD for 2, 4, and 6 weeks and subsequently exposed them to 8 weeks of SD. Plants were then returned to inductive LD to determine their SD vernalization responsiveness. All of the SD vernalized plants flowered within 35 days after shifting back into LD, with four additional leaves appearing on the parent culm before flowers were visible (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1D,E</xref>), indicating the SD vernalization is equally effective at early and later developmental stages.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Genetic mapping of the SD vernalization response identifies an FT paralog</title><p>To explore the genetic basis of natural variation in the SD-vernalization response, we generated mapping populations from crosses between responsive and non-responsive accessions (Koz3 X Bd1-1; 12 c X Bd1-1; RON2 X Bd1-1; and Koz3 × 29–1; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). In all populations, SD responsiveness segregated as a single, dominant locus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A</xref>) that mapped as a large-effect QTL near the bottom of chromosome 2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1B</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig2sdata1">Figure 2—source data 1</xref>). Fine mapping using the Koz3 X Bd1-1 F2 population narrowed the interval to a region on chromosome two containing eight annotated genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1C</xref>). None of these genes exhibited a difference in expression pattern in the shoot apical meristem or leaf tissue of responsive versus non-responsive lines grown in SD followed by LD, SD only, or LD only (data not shown), indicating that the variant underlying this trait is not likely to be in a cis-regulatory region of a gene. However, there is one gene in the interval that is preferentially expressed in SD, and this gene exhibits a one nucleotide change in all 11 SD non-responsive accessions that is not found in any of the 40 SD-responsive accessions; this change results in a threonine to lysine substitution at position 94 (T94K) in an <italic>FT</italic> paralog (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>–<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">2</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig2sdata2">Figure 2—source data 2</xref>) referred to as <italic>FT-like 9</italic> (Bradi2g49795; <italic>FTL9</italic>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Higgins et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s4">Figure 2—figure supplement 4</xref>).

Second, constitutive expression of an <italic>FTL9</italic> cDNA from the SD-responsive accessions Koz3 and Bd21 under the control of the maize ubiquitin promoter in both SD-responsive (Bd21-3 and Koz3) and non-responsive accessions (Bd29-1), which results in <italic>FTL9</italic> expression in LD, causes LD-grown transgenic plants to behave as if they were vernalized without prior cold or SD treatment both in terms of accelerated flowering as well as expression of <italic>VERNALIZATION1</italic> (<italic>VRN1</italic>), a MADS box transcription factor related to the <italic>APETALA/FRUITFUL</italic> family of genes in <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic>, that is a marker of the vernalized state in grasses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Woods et al., 2014a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Yan et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Preston and Kellogg, 2008</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3</xref>). In contrast, constitutive expression of the <italic>FTL9</italic> cDNA from the SD-non-responsive accession Bd1-1 did not affect the flowering behavior of transgenic lines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3</xref>) indicating that the T94K change is likely to disrupt <italic>FTL9</italic> function consistent with the recessive nature of this allele (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A</xref>) and that the T94K change occurs in a highly conserved amino acid in this family of proteins in plants and animals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2B</xref>). In the experiments described above we evaluated transgenic expression of <italic>FTL9</italic> alleles from both Koz3 and Bd21-3 because <italic>FTL9</italic> alleles from SD-responsive accessions exhibit variation in the predicted C terminus of the FTL9 protein (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig2sdata2">Figure 2—source data 2</xref>): the ancestral state of FTL9 is 178 amino acids, but in Koz3 there is a deletion of a single nucleotide (G) in amino acid 175 that alters the reading frame such that FTL9 is 184aa long.

Furthermore, dissections on the parent culm revealed that the meristems were vegetative in both Koz3 and Bd1-1 when grown only in SD or in LD for the duration of the experiment. However, prolonged exposure of Koz3 (SD vernalization responsive) to SD followed by a shift to LD (SD-LD) results in the up-regulation of both <italic>FT1</italic> and <italic>VRN1</italic>, whereas this treatment does not result in <italic>FT1</italic> and <italic>VRN1</italic> expression in the SD non-responsive accession Bd1-1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). In Koz3 all of the meristems had converted to floral meristems by day 15 after shifting into LD whereas the meristems remained vegetative in the Bd1-1 accession. Thus, SD vernalization provides competence to flower by enabling the expression of <italic>VRN1</italic> and <italic>FT1</italic> once plants are in LD. As previously shown for cold-mediated vernalization (Woods et al., 2016), SD-mediated vernalization is attenuated in <italic>amiVRN1</italic> transgenic lines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C,D</xref>), further corroborating that the cold- and SD-mediated vernalization pathways converge on enabling expression of genes like <italic>VRN1</italic> when plants are exposed to inductive LD. It is important to note that the loss of <italic>FTL9</italic> activity has no effect on cold-mediated vernalization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>) demonstrating that there are features that define the two pathways as separate.

The two controls for this experiment were accessions grown in SD and LD only. The SD only control demonstrates that growth in SD is indeed non-inductive for flowering because growth for 150 days does not permit flowering in any of the accessions tested (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>–<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">2</xref>). Dissections on the parent culm revealed that the meristems were still vegetative after 150 days of growth in SD in all 51 accessions tested, consistent with previous reports (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Woods et al., 2014a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Gordon et al., 2017</xref>). The LD only control was chosen to ensure that if robust flowering occurs following a shift from SD to LD, this was indeed due to the prior SD treatment and not simply due to the age of the plant when shifted into inductive LD. Thus, an accession is SD vernalization responsive if the SD-LD shifted plants flower much more rapidly than the LD only controls.</p></sec><sec id="s3-8"><title>Control for day and night temperature during SD vernalization</title><p>To ensure the acceleration of flowering by prolonged exposure to SD was indeed due to the shorter photoperiod and not due to extended periods of cooler dark temperatures of 18°C, we grew four accessions (KOZ3, 12 c, RON2 and Bd18-1) in SD under constant day and night temperatures of 21°C. Accessions grown under constant 21 °C day/night temperatures showed the same robust SD vernalization response as those grown under 21°C/18 °C day/night temperatures (data not shown), indicating that the SD vernalization phenomenon is due strictly to the photoperiod and not a composite of photoperiod and temperature.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We thank John Vogel and Sean Gordon for leading the effort to sequence and analyze 51 <italic>B distachyon</italic> genomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Gordon et al., 2017</xref>) which provided data critical for this work.

Your article has been reviewed by two peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by Hao Yu who is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors and Christian S. Hardtke as the Senior Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>This paper investigates the mechanism underlying the poorly understood phenomenon of short-day induced vernalization in the pooid grass <italic>Brachypodium distachyon</italic>. The authors study why many accessions of <italic>Brachypodium</italic> have the ability to perceive seasonal cues important for the release of flowering repression during winter, not only by perceiving cold signal, but also by responding to short photoperiods. The authors identify that an FT-like gene called FTL9 is expressed in short days and required for conferring <italic>Brachypodium</italic> accessions a rapid flowering response when they are transferred to long days. They further demonstrate that accessions without this flowering response carry a characteristic amino acid change in a conserved region of FTL9, suggesting that allelic variation of FTL9 contributes to natural variation for <italic>Brachypodium</italic>'s flowering response to short days. In addition, the authors show that FTL9 expression is repressed in long days by VRN2, and its effect on flowering under short days is mediated by two floral activating genes VRN1 and FT1.</p><p>Taken together, this paper presents some mechanistic understandings of short-day vernalization, which has previously been described only at the physiological level. The results also provide a new example of how different FT paralogs can evolve new functions to expand the plant ability to fine-tune their flowering time in response to different environmental conditions. The physiological and molecular genetic data are clearly presented and well designed, and the overall findings are of considerable general interest. We suggest the following revisions before this manuscript could be further considered in <italic>eLife</italic>.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) We suggest that the authors perform microscopic analysis of meristems during short day treatment of responsive lines versus the lines with the inactive FTL9 allele. Currently scoring of flowering is carried out purely at the whole plant level by counting the number of days until &quot;the emergence of the spike was visible&quot;. However, FTL9 might promote the floral transition under short days, but the spikes might not visibly emerge until the plants are transferred to long days. Such a result would alter the conclusion in this manuscript as it would indicate that flowering actually occurs in short days, which, however, is invisible because the spike does not grow out until the plant is exposed to long days. Thus, it is useful and important to dissect meristems during the short-day treatment and after the shift to long days in a short-day responsive and a short-day non-responsive variety. Such a dataset would add another level of phenotypic analysis to the paper and would strengthen the conclusion that an active FTL9 allele is required for the acquisition of floral competence without a direct effect on inducing flowering.</p><p>2) All short-day non-responsive types seem to harbor the same FTL9 allele. The text and the results shown in Figure 1—figure supplement 2 suggest that this is an inactive allele caused by a single amino acid change in a highly conserved residue. However, if there is strong selection for a straightforward loss of function allele in certain environments, as suggested, then we would expect many different alleles to arise independently in different populations, as for example, shown for FLC and FRI in populations of Brassicaceae species. This presence of the same FTL9 allele in all populations that have lost the response suggests that it might not simply be a complete null but might retain some function that causes this specific allele to be selected for whenever short-day vernalization is lost. Some discussions on the properties of the &quot;loss of function&quot; FTL9 allele along these lines would be worthwhile.</p><p>3) The results on FTL10 shown in Figure 3 are not convincing to indicate its florigen activity. The native FTL10 expression in <italic>Brachypodium</italic> is not modulated by day-length and is also very low in all conditions tested. Although constitutive expression of FTL10 induces flowering under tissue culture conditions and short days, this might not reflect its endogenous function relevant to control of flowering time. Thus, the conclusion on FTL10 function in the context of Figure 3 should be revised by either showing more pieces of evidence or toning down the claim on its role.</p><p>4) To make the paper as accessible as possible to a broad readership, it would be useful to ensure that all gene products are properly introduced on first mention. For example, in subsection “FTL9 is repressed in LD by VRN2”, <italic>VERNALIZATION2</italic> is first mentioned without a description of the nature of its protein product. We suggest citing the original paper(s) describing the isolation of the VRN2 gene. Introduction for some other genes is similarly lacking in this manuscript.</p><p>5) Some figure panels are not cited in order in the text. For example, Figure 4E is mentioned in the text before Figure 4A-D, while Figure 3D and E are mentioned after Figure 4. The authors must re-arrange the figure panels to describe them in an appropriate order in the text.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.42153.026</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) We suggest that the authors perform microscopic analysis of meristems during short day treatment of responsive lines versus the lines with the inactive FTL9 allele.

In fact, we had already done this; however, we now realize that this was not properly emphasized in the manuscript but rather was “hidden” in the Materials and methods section. We now state in the main text of the manuscript (Results and Discussion section) that “Flowering time was measured as days to heading and leaf number on the parent culm. Furthermore, dissections on the parent culm were made at the end of the experiment in accessions that did not visibly flower to determine the developmental state of the meristem.” We also now state in the main text (Results and Discussion section) “Dissections on the parent culm revealed that the meristems were all still vegetative after 150 days of growth in SD in all 51 accessions tested, consistent with our previous studies […]” We felt that it was most important to determine the state of the meristem in all accessions at the end of the SD treatment to determine if they were in fact vegetative. We also direct readers in the Figure 1 legend to see Supplementary file 1 and Supplementary file 2 which includes both days to heading as well as leaf-count data. We also now add information in Figure 3A on the state of the meristem in Koz3 (SD vernalization responsive) and Bd1-1 (SD vernalization non-responsive) during growth in SD, LD and after the shift to long days. We state in the legend “Dissection of meristems on the parent culm revealed that all meristems remained vegetative in both Koz3 (12 dissected meristems) and Bd1-1 (12 meristems) in SD and LD grown plants. After a shift from SD to LD at day 7 all of the meristems were vegetative in Koz3 and Bd1-1 (12 meristems for each accession); however, by day 15 in LD all of the meristems had converted to floral meristems in Koz3 (12 meristems) whereas they remained vegetative in Bd1-1 (12 meristems).” We refer the reader to this figure legend for details on the state of the meristem for Figure 4A and Figure 5A,B. In the main text we added (subsection “Convergence between the SD vernalization and cold-mediated vernalization pathways”) “Furthermore, dissections on the parent culm revealed that the meristems were vegetative in both Koz3 and Bd1-1 when grown only in SD or in LD for the duration of the experiment.” Also “In Koz3 all of the meristems had converted to floral meristems by day 15 after shifting into LD whereas the meristems remained vegetative in the Bd1-1 accession.”</p><p>In addition to dissecting meristems for nearly all the experiments we not only counted days to heading but also the number of leaves formed on the parent culm as a metric for flowering which we indicate in the Materials and methods section as “The developmental stage of the plants was recorded as the number of primary leaves derived from the parent culm at the time of heading.” Counting leaves also reflects the state of the meristem as once a vegetative meristem converts to a floral meristem no new leaves on the tiller will be made. In cases where we report a non-flowering phenotype there are higher leaf numbers compared to accessions that flowered at an early date indicating that the meristem in the parent culm is still vegetative.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) All short-day non-responsive types seem to harbor the same FTL9 allele. The text and the results shown in Figure 1—figure supplement 2 suggest that this is an inactive allele caused by a single amino acid change in a highly conserved residue. However, if there is strong selection for a straightforward loss of function allele in certain environments, as suggested, then we would expect many different alleles to arise independently in different populations, as for example, shown for FLC and FRI in populations of Brassicaceae species. This presence of the same FTL9 allele in all populations that have lost the response suggests that it might not simply be a complete null but might retain some function that causes this specific allele to be selected for whenever short-day vernalization is lost. Some discussions on the properties of the &quot;loss of function&quot; FTL9 allele along these lines would be worthwhile.</p></disp-quote><p>This is a good point we now state in the subsection “Loss of the SD-vernalization response arose once in <italic>B. distachyon</italic>”:</p><p>“This suggests that the <italic>FTL9</italic> variant associated with loss of SD responsiveness arose once and was then maintained by positive selection throughout outcrossing to diverse accessions. Although, <italic>B. distachyon</italic> is typically inbreeding, outcrossing occurs as well (Sancho et al., 2018). That a lesion in <italic>FTL9</italic> that appears to have undergone positive selection arose once is in contrast to the loss of a vernalization requirement in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> which arose independently many times due to loss-of-function mutations in <italic>FRIGIDA</italic> (Le Corre et al., 2002). Perhaps the T94K change does not result in a complete loss of function, but rather retains a function distinct from its role in SD vernalization.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) The results on FTL10 shown in Figure 3 are not convincing to indicate its florigen activity. The native FTL10 expression in Brachypodium is not modulated by day-length and is also very low in all conditions tested. Although constitutive expression of FTL10 induces flowering under tissue culture conditions and short days, this might not reflect its endogenous function relevant to control of flowering time. Thus, the conclusion on FTL10 function in the context of Figure 3 should be revised by either showing more pieces of evidence or toning down the claim on its role.</p></disp-quote><p>We are grateful to receive this comment because we do not want this key point to be misunderstood. We are NOT making any claims about the &quot;endogenous function [of FTL10] relevant to control of flowering time.&quot; Indeed, expression data to date is consistent with no function - the RNA is barely detectable by PCR under a range of conditions - and FTL10 may in effect be a pseudogene. Nevertheless, the coding region is intact and the FTL10 protein can trigger flowering unlike FTL9 which causes competence. This is a key point of divergence of some cereal crops and <italic>Brachypodium</italic>: in some cereal crops the FTL10 ortholog is robustly expressed in short days and this can account for flowering in short days which does not occur in <italic>Brachypodium</italic>. It is important to keep in mind that not all genes with intact coding regions have roles. Evolution is a continuum and any given “snapshot” of this continuum is likely to reveal “pseudogenes” which have lesions in coding regions or regulatory elements.</p><p>We have revised the manuscript to make this point more clear. We now state in the subsection “Roles of SD expressed FT-like genes in grass flowering”:</p><p><italic>“FT3</italic> is up-regulated in SD in barley and wheat, whereas <italic>FTL10</italic> expression in <italic>B. distachyon</italic> is not modulated by day-length and its expression level is quite low in all photoperiod and temperature conditions tested (Figure 3D). Due to its minimal expression, <italic>FTL10</italic> may not play a role in <italic>B. distachyon</italic> flowering. However, constitutive expression of <italic>FTL10</italic> from the maize ubiquitin promoter results in flowering during transgenic line generation in tissue culture (Figure 3E) and rapid flowering in SD (Figure 2—figure supplement 3I, J) similar to the effects of expression of other <italic>FT1</italic> orthologs in <italic>B. distachyon</italic> (Figure 2—figure supplement 3I, J; Ream et al., 2014) and wheat (Lv et al., 2014) indicating that <italic>FTL10</italic> has the ability to induce flowering. Thus, the <italic>FT3/FTL10</italic> orthologs in this grass-specific duplication event have diverged in barley and wheatversus <italic>B. distachyon</italic>. In barley and wheat, <italic>FT3</italic> has retained its presumably ancestral role of being expressed in SD which leads to flowering in SD. <italic>B. distachyon</italic> cannot flower in SD because its ortholog, <italic>FTL10</italic>, is no longer expressed. As discussed above, constitutive expression in <italic>B. distachyon</italic> of the other duplicated gene, <italic>FTL9</italic>, does not induce flowering in SD or in tissue culture because its role is to establish competence to flower as opposed to the florigen-like role of <italic>FTL10/FT3</italic> in inducing flowering (Figure 2—figure supplement 3G, I, J).”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) To make the paper as accessible as possible to a broad readership, it would be useful to ensure that all gene products are properly introduced on first mention. For example, in subsection “FTL9 is repressed in LD by VRN2”, VERNALIZATION2 is first mentioned without a description of the nature of its protein product. We suggest citing the original paper(s) describing the isolation of the VRN2 gene. Introduction for some other genes is similarly lacking in this manuscript.</p></disp-quote><p>We now add some introductory information about the genes discussed upon first mention.</p><p>Subsection “Genetic mapping of the SD vernalization response identifies an FT paralog” “The founding member of this family is <italic>FLOWERING LOCUS T (FT</italic>) which encodes a small protein with similarity to phosphatidylethanolamine-binding proteins […]”.</p><p>Subsection “Genetic mapping of the SD vernalization response identifies an FT paralog” “[<italic>…] VERNALIZATION1 (VRN1</italic>), a MADS box transcription factor related to the <italic>APETALA/FRUITFUL</italic> family of genes in <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic> which is a marker of the vernalized state in grasses (Woods et al., 2014).”</p><p>Subsection “FTL9 is repressed in LD by VRN2” “PHYTOCHROME C (PHYC) is a light receptor and in <italic>phyC</italic> mutants […]”.</p><p>Subsection “FTL9 is repressed in LD by VRN2” “<italic>VERNALIZATION2 (VRN2</italic>) which contains a putative zinc finger and a <italic>CONSTANS, CONSTANS</italic>-like and <italic>TIMING OF CAB1</italic> domain (Yan et al., 2004) […]”.</p><p> <italic>5) Some figure panels are not cited in order in the text.

We also move the sections “Loss of the SD-vernalization response arose once in <italic>B. distachyon</italic>” and “Roles of SD expressed FT-like genes in grass flowering” before the “FTL9 is repressed in LD by VRN2” section so now all of the figure panels are cited in order in the text.</p></body></sub-article></article>
