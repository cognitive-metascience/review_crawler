In bacteria, actinonin targets peptide deformylase (PDF) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Chen et al., 2000</xref>), an enzyme involved in prokaryotic post-translational modification and also present in the relict plastid (apicoplast) of apicomplexan parasites. Actinonin causes defects in malaria parasite apicoplast development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Goodman and McFadden, 2014</xref>) and inhibits recombinantly expressed <italic>Plasmodium falciparum</italic> PDF (<italic>Pf</italic>PDF – PF3D7_0907900) in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bracchi-Ricard et al., 2001</xref>) at concentrations consistent with its anti-parasitic activity, all of which led to the general conclusion that actinonin targets the apicoplast-localized <italic>Pf</italic>PDF in malaria parasites. However, the characteristics of actinonin —particularly the rapid mode of action and the unusual kinetics of apicoplast genome loss —are at odds with how all other drugs targeting apicoplast translation impact the parasite (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Amberg-Johnson et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Uddin et al., 2018</xref>). In a search for the target of actinonin, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Amberg-Johnson et al., 2017</xref> used the related apicomplexan <italic>Toxoplasma gondii</italic> and identified a point mutation in the putative metalloprotease <italic>TgftsH1</italic> that confers a 3.5-fold resistance to actinonin. They also showed that actinonin inhibits recombinantly expressed human malaria parasite FtsH1 (<italic>Pf</italic>FtsH1) in vitro at levels comparable to its antimalarial activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Amberg-Johnson et al., 2017</xref>). Moreover, parasites with reduced <italic>Pf</italic>FtsH1 expression were more sensitive to actinonin, all of which prompted the interim conclusion that <italic>Pf</italic>FtsH1, rather than <italic>Pf</italic>PDF, might be the target of actinonin and that <italic>Pf</italic>FtsH1 is a potential new antimalarial target (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Amberg-Johnson et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>Despite repeated attempts, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Amberg-Johnson et al., 2017</xref> were not able to generate actinonin resistant <italic>P. falciparum</italic> parasites. Interestingly, the residue mutated from asparagine to serine (N805S) in <italic>Tg</italic>FtsH1 identified as conferring actinonin resistance by Amberg-Johnson et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Amberg-Johnson et al., 2017</xref>) is already a serine in <italic>Pf</italic>FtsH1 (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>), which begs the question of whether <italic>Pf</italic>FtsH1 is already ‘resistant’ to actinonin. This might mean that actinonin kills malaria parasites through a mechanism not involving <italic>Pf</italic>FtsH1, perhaps even inhibition of <italic>Pf</italic>PDF. Compounding this uncertainty is a report that <italic>Pf</italic>FtsH1 is localized in the mitochondrion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Tanveer et al., 2013</xref>), which is inconsistent with the demonstrated impact of actinonin on the malaria parasite apicoplast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Goodman and McFadden, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Uddin et al., 2018</xref>). However, phenotypic evidence from <italic>Pf</italic>FtsH1 knockdowns and changes in post-translational processing of <italic>PfFtsH1</italic> in the absence of a functioning apicoplast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Amberg-Johnson et al., 2017</xref>) strongly suggest a relationship between <italic>Pf</italic>FtsH1 and the apicoplast. These contradictory findings may result from the of differential targeting of the various processed forms of <italic>Pf</italic>FtsH1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Tanveer et al., 2013</xref>) or stem from the close physical and functional association between the mitochondria and apicoplast in malaria parasites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">van Dooren et al., 2005</xref>). Given the complexity of FtsH1 processing and localization in <italic>P. falciparum</italic>, it is unlikley that cell biological studies alone will be able to definitively resolve the issue of whether <italic>Pf</italic>FtsH1 is the primary target of actinonin.</p><table-wrap id="table1" position="float"><label>Table 1.</label><caption><title>The impact of mutations in <italic>ftsh1</italic> on parasite resistance to actinonin.</title></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th>Parasite</th><th>FTSH1 Peptidase Motif <break/>(partial amino acid sequence)</th><th>Actinonin IC<sub>50</sub> <break/>(µM)</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><italic>Tg</italic> FTSH1 WT (TGGT_259260)</td><td>804 FGRDALS<bold>N</bold>GASSDI 811</td><td>14<sup>a</sup></td></tr><tr><td><italic>Tg</italic> FTSH1 Act<sup>R</sup></td><td>804 FGRDALS<bold>S</bold>GASSDI 811</td><td>44<sup>a</sup></td></tr><tr><td><italic>Pf</italic> 3D7 FTSH1 (PF3D7_1239700)</td><td>481 FGKSETS<italic>S</italic><bold>G</bold>ASSDI 494</td><td>1.99 (n = 1)<sup>b</sup></td></tr><tr><td><italic>Pf</italic> D10 FTSH1 WT</td><td>481 FGKSETS<italic>S</italic><bold>G</bold>ASSDI 494</td><td>2.0 ± 0.2 (n = 4)</td></tr><tr><td><italic>Pf</italic> D10 FTSH1 Act<sup>R</sup></td><td>481 FGKSETS<italic>S</italic><bold>C</bold>ASSDI 494</td><td>73.3 ± 2.7 (n = 4)</td></tr><tr><td><italic>Pf</italic> D10 (apicoplast minus)</td><td>481 FGKSETS<italic>S</italic><bold>G</bold>ASSDI 494</td><td>43.1 ± 4.1 (n = 2)<sup>c</sup></td></tr><tr><td colspan="3"/></tr></tbody></table><table-wrap-foot><fn><p><sup>a</sup>calculated from data provided in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Amberg-Johnson et al., 2017</xref>, <sup>b</sup> and <sup>c</sup> are both consistent with previously published data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Goodman and McFadden, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Amberg-Johnson et al., 2017</xref>).</p></fn></table-wrap-foot></table-wrap><p>To determine if <italic>Pf</italic>FtsH1 is the target of actinonin, we generated <italic>P. falciparum</italic> parasites with robust resistance to actinonin, identified a point mutation conferring resistance, and recapitulated the resistance phenotype by introducing a single amino acid change using CRISPrCas9 genome editing.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results|discussion"><title>Results and discussion</title><p><italic>P. falciparum</italic> strain D10 parasites were selected for resistance using stepwise increases in actinonin concentration.

Alignment and analysis of sequenced genes was done using Sequencher (Gene Codes Corporation, Ann Arbor, MI USA) and Geneious Prime (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.geneious.com">www.geneious.com</ext-link>).</p><p>CRISPr-Cas9 mediated gene-editing utilized pAIO (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Spillman et al., 2017</xref>) expressing Cas9 and the <italic>Pfftsh1</italic>-specific sgRNA 5’-<named-content content-type="sequence">GTAAATCAGAAACTAGTAG</named-content>-3’ inserted according to standard protocols (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Ghorbal et al., 2014</xref>) . Two allelic replacement vectors—pFtsH1<sup>G489G</sup> carrying two synonymous ‘shield’ mutations and pFtsH1<sup>G489C</sup> carrying a further G to T mutation at base 1465 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>)—were created by cloning a PCR amplified segment of <italic>Pfftsh1</italic> into pGEM-T Easy (Promega). Quickchange XL (Clontech) was used to make sequential modifications for allelic replacement constructs. The shield mutations were introduced first and then the plasmid carrying the confirmed shield mutations was modified to also include the putative resistance mutation (G1465T). All constructs were confirmed by sequencing.</p><p>Each allelic replacement vector was linearized by digestion with <italic>Eco</italic>RI and co-transfected with pAIO-<italic>Pfftsh1</italic> using standard transfection methods (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Waller et al., 2000</xref>). Transfected parasites were selected by including 10 µM DSM-1 (Sigma-Aldrich) in the culture media for 14 days (rFtsH1<sup>G489G</sup> and rFtsH1<sup>G489Ca</sup>) or 7 days (rFtsH1<sup>G489Cb</sup>) followed by 10–14 days of culture without drug until parasites grew normally in culture. Parasites were cloned by limiting dilution and three to five clones of each line were screened for actinonin sensitivity and successful modification of the <italic>Pfftsh1</italic> allele. All clones from rFTSH1<sup>G489G</sup> and rFtsH1<sup>G489Ca</sup> had the expected gene modifications while only one of five clones from rFtsH1<sup>G489Cb</sup> did. Actinonin sensitivity was correlated to the presence of the G489C mutation in all clones tested. One clone from each recombinant line was selected for complete characterization of actinonin sensitivity.</p></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We thank the Australian Red Cross Blood Services, Melbourne, Australia, for supplying human erythrocytes.</p></ack><sec id="s4" sec-type="additional-information"><title>Additional information</title><fn-group content-type="competing-interest"><title>Competing interests</title><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf1"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="author-contribution"><title>Author contributions</title><fn fn-type="con" id="con1"><p>Conceptualization, Data curation, Supervision, Investigation, Methodology, Writing - original draft</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con2"><p>Formal analysis, Investigation, Methodology, Writing - review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con3"><p>Investigation, Methodology, Writing - review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con4"><p>Conceptualization, Supervision, Funding acquisition, Writing - review and editing</p></fn></fn-group></sec><sec id="s5" sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Additional files</title><supplementary-material id="supp1"><label>Supplementary file 1.</label><caption><title>Supplementary Tables.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) Screen of D10 clones for <italic>Pfftsh1</italic> sequence and actinonin resistance.

Your article has been reviewed by four peer reviewers, including Jon Clardy as the Reviewing Editor and Reviewer #1, and the evaluation has been overseen by Gisela Storz as the Senior Editor. The following individuals involved in review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Sean Prigge (Reviewer #2); Ellen Yeh (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>We would like to draw your attention to changes in our revision policy that we have made in response to COVID-19 (https://elifesciences.org/articles/57162). Specifically, we are asking editors to accept without delay manuscripts, like yours, that they judge can stand as <italic>eLife</italic> papers without additional data, even if they feel that they would make the manuscript stronger. Thus the revisions requested below only address clarity and presentation.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>The original report revised the generally accepted model for actinonin's antimalarial activity from inhibition of a peptide deformylase to inhibition of PfFtsH1, but a drug-resistant <italic>PfFtsh1</italic> mutant was not reported. This report describes a drug resistant mutant in <italic>PfFtsh1</italic> and supporting experiments that tighten the argument. Taken together, the results establish that FtsH1 is the primary target of actinonin in malaria parasites and show that parasites can generated significant resistance to this drug (18-35x). The reviewers generally found that this report added materially to the original report and tightened up the evidence supporting the original conclusion.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Introduction. Please provide more background on uncertainty of FtsH1 localization. The authors cite Tanveer et al., 2013 for mitochondrial localization of FtsH1. In Amberg-Johnson et al., 2017, cleavage of FtsH1 dependent on presence of apicoplast also indicates possible apicoplast localization. [related but different reviewer] What are the authors' thoughts about FtsH1 localization? The isoprenoid supplementation in this report and experiments in Amberg-Johnson et al., 2017, link the function of FtsH1 to the apicoplast, but the reported localization is to the mitochondrion (Tanveer et al., 2013).</p><p>2) Figure 1, Please show dose-response curves for D10 ActS, D10 ActR, FtsH1<sup>G489G</sup> and rFtsH1<sup>G489Ca/b</sup>. The data points used to derive the IC<sub>50</sub> and slope of the sigmoidal curve can be informative in interpreting the drug response.</p><p>3) The authors seem to reference the pAIO-<italic>Pfftsh1</italic> using Waller et al., 2000, when Spillman et al., 2017, may have been meant. Does the DHOD enzyme function in pAIO to the extent that this plasmid confers DSM1 resistance? It did not look like DSM1 was used to select for pAIO in Spillman et al., 2017.</p><p>4) The authors describe the dose escalation process of generating drug resistance, but it would be nice if they provided a sense of how long it took to achieve high level resistance.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic></p><p>This seems like a pretty straightforward case. Earlier studies on actinonin's activity on the malaria parasite <italic>Plasmodium falciparum</italic> (Pf) left the impression that actinonin's target was peptide deformylase, its target in both bacteria and mammalian mitochondria. An <italic>eLife</italic> paper using a different apicomplexan, <italic>T. gondii</italic>, argued pretty convincingly, at least for me, that the target was likely to be a different protease, a metalloprotease called PfFtsH1 found in the Pf apicoplast. However there were alternative explanations for the results, and the target of actinonin was in the strictest sense not unambiguously identified. This short report, which shares no authors in common with the earlier Amberg-Johnson <italic>eLife</italic> publication, shows that a single mutation in PfFtsH1 confers resistance to actinonin in Pf. I think that the arguments presented here even more firmly establish PfFtsH1 as the target. Ironically the significance of this report, which I think is sufficient for publication in <italic>eLife</italic>, is to unequivocally relegate actinonin to a lesser category in the long list of potential antimalarial drugs – a relegation that I believe had largely been accomplished by the identification of FtsH1 as the target in the <italic>Toxoplasma gondii</italic> study reported in <italic>eLife</italic> by Amberg-Johnson et al.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>Actinonin is a peptidomimetic natural product known to inhibit certain metalloproteases. In bacteria and plastid-containing organisms, it has been shown to inhibit the metalloprotein peptide deformylase and this was thought to be the mechanism of action in the malaria parasite <italic>Plasmodium falciparum</italic>. Experiments in <italic>Toxoplasma gondii</italic> identified a different target metalloprotease, called FtsH1, and showed that a mutation in this enzyme conferred modest resistance to actinonin. Actinonin was also shown to inhibit recombinant <italic>P. falciparum</italic> FtsH1, suggesting that this is the target in malaria parasites. However, it was reported that actinonin resistance mutations could not be generated in <italic>P. falciparum</italic>. An additional point of uncertainty was the subcellular location of FtsH1, with one report claiming mitochondrial localization and another linking FtsH1 to the apicoplast. In the current report, the authors used a slow, dose escalation method to generate actinonin resistance in <italic>P. falciparum</italic> parasites. Resistant parasites contained a mutation in FtsH1 and did not have mutations in peptide deformylase or other potential target proteins. To confirm the link between drug resistance and the mutation, genome editing was used to add the mutation to a wild type line, generating resistance in this line. These experiments were carefully conducted with a genome editing control to generate a synonymous mutation that did not confer actinonin resistance. Assuming FtsH1 functions in the apicoplast, the authors used isoprenoid supplementation to disrupt the apicoplast and observed a reduced sensitivity to actinonin. Taken together, the results establish that FtsH1 is the primary target of actinonin in malaria parasites and show that parasites can generated significant resistance to this drug (18-35x).</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic></p><p>The identification of a PfFtsH1<sup>G489C</sup> variant that confers actinonin resistance strongly supports the previous work indicating PfFtsH1 as the target of actinonin. The conclusion is well-supported by allelic replacement that recapitulated the resistance phenotype that matches well with actinonin resistance in apicoplast-minus parasites.</p><p>1) Introduction.

Please provide more background on uncertainty of FtsH1 localization. The authors cite Tanveer et al., 2013 for mitochondrial localization of FtsH1. In Amberg-Johnson, 2017, cleavage of FtsH1 dependent on presence of apicoplast also indicates possible apicoplast localization. [related but different reviewer] What are the authors' thoughts about FtsH1 localization? The isoprenoid supplementation in this report and experiments in Amberg-Johnson, 2017, link the function of FtsH1 to the apicoplast, but the reported localization is to the mitochondrion (Tanveer et al., 2013).</p></disp-quote><p>We have expanded the discussion of this contradiction in the Introduction as follows.</p><p>“Compounding this uncertainty is a report that <italic>Pf</italic>FtsH1 is localized in the mitochondrion (Tanveer et al., 2013), which is inconsistent with the demonstrated impact of actinonin on the malaria parasite apicoplast (Goodman and McFadden, 2014; Uddin, McFadden and Goodman, 2017). […] Given the complexity of FtsH1 processing and localization in <italic>P. falciparum</italic>, it is unlikely that cell biological studies alone will be able to definitively resolve the issue of whether <italic>Pf</italic>FtsH1 is the primary target of actinonin.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Figure 1, Please show dose-response curves for D10 ActS, D10 ActR, FtsH1<sup>G489G</sup> and rFtsH1<sup>G489Ca/b</sup>.

The reference referred to the transfection method used, not the vector. We have modified this statement for clarity. It now reads</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>“Each allelic replacement vector was linearized by digestion with EcoRI and co-transfected with pAIO-Pfftsh1 using standard transfection methods (Ghorbal et al., 2014).”</p></disp-quote><p>Please note, we also added “µM” to the concentration of DSM-1.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Does the DHOD enzyme function in pAIO to the extent that this plasmid confers DSM1 resistance? It did not look like DSM1 was used to select for pAIO in Spillman et al., 2017.</p></disp-quote><p>While the authors of this paper did not report selection with DSM-1 in their study, they did report the presence of a functional DHOD enzyme in pAIO. From the Materials and methods in Goodman, Su and McFadden, 2007, <italic>“</italic>This CAM promoter‐ yDHOD‐2A‐Cas9 amplicon was inserted into the sgRNA expression vector between XbaI/XhoI, removing the hDHFR and thymidine kinase selection cassettes, and fusing Cas9 to the <italic>P. berghei</italic> dihydrofolate reductase/thymidylate synthase (DT) 3′ UTR (previously supporting expression of thymidine kinase). The resulting plasmid containing both Cas9 and sgRNA expression cassettes was named pAll‐In‐One (pAIO).<italic>”</italic> The method of vector construction and resulting drug resistance cassette were unremarkable and it is to be expected that transfection of this construct would confer DSM-1 resistance. Our results proved this to be true.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) The authors describe the dose escalation process of generating drug resistance, but it would be nice if they provided a sense of how long it took to achieve high level resistance.</p></disp-quote><p>This has been included in the Materials and methods. “This selection procedure required 10 weeks of constant drug selection to recover resistant parasites and 10 months of selection to develop parasites with the highest levels of resistance.”</p><p>Please note, for clarity we have made some minor edits. These include changes to gene names to be consistent with Amberg-Johnson et al., 2017, correction of small typographical errors, and reporting the specific concentration of actinonin used in drug resistance selection rather than relating it to IC<sub>50</sub>.</p></body></sub-article></article>
