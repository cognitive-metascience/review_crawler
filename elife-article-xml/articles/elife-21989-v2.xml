Here, we report C-terminus mediated inhibition (CMI) for Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3 that multiple motifs coordinate to tune down Ca<sup>2+</sup> current and Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx toward the lower limits determined by end-stage CDI (Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent inactivation). Among IQ<sub>V</sub> (preIQ<sub>3</sub>-IQ domain), PCRD and DCRD (proximal or distal C-terminal regulatory domain), spatial closeness of any two modules, <italic>e.g.</italic>, by constitutive fusion, facilitates the trio to form the complex, compete against calmodulin, and alter the gating. Acute CMI by rapamycin-inducible heterodimerization helps reconcile the concurrent activation/inactivation attenuations to ensure Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx is reduced, in that Ca<sup>2+</sup> current activated by depolarization is potently (~65%) inhibited at the peak (full activation), but not later on (end-stage inactivation, ~300 ms). Meanwhile, CMI provides a new paradigm to develop Ca<sub>V</sub>1 inhibitors, the therapeutic potential of which is implied by computational modeling of Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3 dysregulations related to Parkinson’s disease.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.21989.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.21989.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.21989.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>All cells need calcium ions to stay healthy, but having too many calcium ions can interfere with important processes in the cell and cause severe problems. Proteins known as calcium channels on the cell surface allow calcium ions to flow into the cell from the surrounding environment. Cells carefully control the opening and closing of these channels to prevent too many calcium ions entering the cell at once. Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3 channels are a type of calcium channel that are important for the heart and brain to work properly. Defects in Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3 channels can lead to irregular heart rhythms and neurodegenerative diseases such as Parkinson’s disease.</p><p>Studies have shown that part of the Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3 channel that sits inside the cell – known as the “tail” – responds to increases in the levels of calcium ions inside the cell by closing the channel. The tail region of Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3 contains three modules, but how these modules work together to regulate channel activity is not clear.</p><p>Liu, Yang et al. investigated whether the three modules need to be physically connected to each other in the channel protein. For the experiments, several versions of the protein were constructed with different combinations of tail modules being directly linked as part of the same molecule or present as separate molecules. When any two modules were directly linked, the third module could bind to them and this was enough to close the Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3 channel. However, the channel did not close if the modules were totally isolated from each other as three separate molecules.</p><p>Certain types of neurons in the brain produce electrical signals in a rhythmic fashion that depends on Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3 channels. In Parkinson’s disease, increased movement of calcium ions into these neurons via Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3 channels interferes with the rhythms of the signals and can cause these cells to die. Liu, Yang et al. performed computer simulations to analyse the effects of closing Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3 channels in these neurons. The results suggest that this can restore normal rhythms of electrical activity and prevent these cells from dying.</p><p>The next step is to understand the molecular details of how the tail region closes Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3 channels and its role in healthy and diseased cells. This may lead to new ways to block Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3 channels in different types of diseases.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.21989.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.21989.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>L-type Ca2+ channels</kwd><kwd>Ca2+ channel inhibition</kwd><kwd>calmodulin</kwd><kwd>distal carboxyl terminus</kwd><kwd>Ca2+ dependent inactivation</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd>None</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001809</institution-id><institution>National Natural Science Foundation of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>81171382</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Liu</surname><given-names>Xiaodong</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004826</institution-id><institution>Natural Science Foundation of Beijing Municipality</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>7142089</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Liu</surname><given-names>Xiaodong</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001809</institution-id><institution>National Natural Science Foundation of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>81371604</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Liu</surname><given-names>Xiaodong</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001809</institution-id><institution>National Natural Science Foundation of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>31370822</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Liu</surname><given-names>Xiaodong</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>RO1 GM107585</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Colecraft</surname><given-names>Henry M.</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>C-terminus mediated inhibition is one emerging modality of intervention for L-type Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels, which coordinate multiple motifs to acutely tune Ca<sup>2+</sup> current and Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx down to the lower limits preset by end-stage Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent inactivation.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>L-type Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels (LTCC or Ca<sub>V</sub>1 channels) play pivotal roles in numerous physiological functions by mediating Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx and membrane excitability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Striessnig et al., 2014</xref>). Among four isoforms of Ca<sub>V</sub>1.1–Ca<sub>V</sub>1.4 in LTCC family, Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3 channels exhibit unique biophysical properties (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Lieb et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Xu and Lipscombe, 2001</xref>) involving diverse regulatory mechanisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Ben-Johny and Yue, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Christel and Lee, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Huang et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Tan et al., 2011</xref>). Widely distributed in various excitable tissues, including both cardiovascular and nervous systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Brandt et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Mangoni et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Nemzou et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Striessnig, 2007</xref>), Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3 is also involved in a wide spectrum of pathology, including multiple inheritable diseases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Pinggera and Striessnig, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Platzer et al., 2000</xref>). As one prominent exemplar of its pathophysiological linkage, Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3 expressed in substantia nigra pars compacta (SNc) neurons tightly controls the autonomous subthreshold Ca<sup>2+</sup> oscillations which have been considered to underlie the pathophysiology of Parkinson’s disease (PD) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Chan et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Guzman et al., 2009</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">2010</xref>).</p><p>Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3 is tuned by its own distal carboxyl tail (DCT) to compete with apoCaM (Ca<sup>2+</sup>-free calmodulin), which is pre-associated with the carboxyl terminus of the channel at preIQ<sub>3</sub>-IQ domain (denoted as IQ<sub>V</sub>). Closely involved in both apoCaM and Ca<sup>2+</sup>/CaM binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Jurado et al., 1999</xref>), IQ<sub>V</sub> plays important roles in channel functions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Ben Johny et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Liu et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Singh et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Wahl-Schott et al., 2006</xref>). The competitive tuning is highly regulated by fluctuations of [apoCaM], the strength of particular DCT isoforms, or the apoCaM affinity with IQ<sub>V</sub> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Adams et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bazzazi et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Liu et al., 2010</xref>). DCT consists of two putative α-helical domains—a proximal and a distal C-terminal regulatory domain (termed PCRD and DCRD, respectively) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Hulme et al., 2006</xref>). Positively charged PCRD could coordinate with negatively charged DCRD, in the context of Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Liu et al., 2010</xref>), to regulate effective CaM affinity to the IQ<sub>V</sub> region of the channel. Besides the reported inhibition on Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent inactivation (CDI) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Liu et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Singh et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Wahl-Schott et al., 2006</xref>), several studies suggest that DCT also concurrently attenuates voltage-gated activation (VGA), reducing the maximum open probability and positively shifting the voltage dependence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Hulme et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Lieb et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Liu et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Scharinger et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Singh et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Wahl-Schott et al., 2006</xref>). Altogether, this competitive tuning of Ca<sub>V</sub>1 gating (activation/inactivation) emerges as a new modality distinct from conventional inhibitions such as intensively-studied Ca<sup>2+</sup> channel blockers (CCBs) that normally only reduce VGA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Hockerman et al., 1997</xref>), or Ca<sup>2+</sup>/CaM-triggered conformational changes that induce CDI (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Ben-Johny and Yue, 2014</xref>). However, several key matters still remain to be clarified before such new CMI (<underline>C</underline>-terminus <underline>M</underline>ediated <underline>I</underline>nhibition) could be fully established. First, PCRD, DCRD and IQ<sub>V</sub> seemingly work cooperatively to mediate CMI as suggested by aforementioned analyses, but the exact interrelationships among these three motifs are yet to be elucidated. Second, CMI is supposed to act on channels in an acute manner similar to widely-applied CCBs or like interventions, but direct evidence is still lacking. Third, CMI is expected to reduce the overall Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx; however, it is still unclear whether and how CMI is able to ensure the actual inhibition when both VGA and CDI are attenuated, apparently leading to contradictory effects on Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx.</p><p>Embarking on these frontiers regarding CMI, we unveiled the principle of cooperation among the three key C-terminal motifs, with which we developed chemical-inducible CMI for Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3 channels. We then resolved all the aforementioned questions crucial to establish CMI, and gained new insights into Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3 gating by comparing CMI and CDI. In addition, with computational modeling of Ca<sup>2+</sup> oscillations and pacemaking behaviors under the control of Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3 channels in SNc neurons, we explored the potentials of CMI-based inhibitors as therapeutic interventions for Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3-related PD.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Provisional CMI concurrently attenuates both CDI and VGA</title><p>Alternative splicing at the carboxyl terminus of α<sub>1D</sub> results into two important native variants of long and short forms: α<sub>1DL</sub> (exon 42) and α<sub>1DS</sub> (exon 42A). Short variant of α<sub>1DS</sub> terminates shortly after the IQ<sub>V</sub> motif and lacks almost entire DCT domain, and its Ca<sup>2+</sup> current (<italic>I<sub>Ca</sub></italic>) exhibited strong CDI and VGA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Regarding CDI, α<sub>1DS</sub> still contains all the core elements including the IQ<sub>V</sub> domain for apoCaM pre-association and the EF-hand motifs and N-terminal Ca<sup>2+</sup>/CaM binding NSCaTE motif (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Dick et al., 2008</xref>) for CDI transduction. <italic>I<sub>Ca</sub></italic> upon depolarization rapidly decayed (second row, red trace), indicative of strong CDI. In contrast, Ba<sup>2+</sup> current (<italic>I<sub>Ba</sub></italic>) decayed rather slowly (trace in grey) representing the background voltage-dependent inactivation (VDI). Thus, the fraction of peak current (<italic>I<sub>peak</sub></italic>) remaining after depolarization for 50 ms (third row, <italic>r<sub>50</sub></italic>) is closely correlated with inactivation, with the difference between the <italic>r<sub>50</sub></italic> profiles in Ba<sup>2+</sup> and Ca<sup>2+</sup> serving as the ideal index of CDI. In practice, due to rather weak VDI of Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3 at 50 ms (<italic>r<sub>50,Ba</sub></italic> close to 1) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Tadross et al., 2010</xref>), thus for simplicity the value of 1−<italic>r<sub>50,Ca</sub></italic> at −10 mV was taken as the index of CDI strength (<italic>S<sub>Ca</sub></italic>). VGA was evaluated by peak current density <italic>J<sub>peak</sub></italic> (<italic>pA</italic>/<italic>pF</italic>), measured at different voltages while excluding potential artifacts due to cell-size factor (capacitance). Throughout this study, <italic>S<sub>Ca</sub></italic> and <italic>J<sub>Ca</sub></italic> (<italic>J<sub>peak</sub></italic> at −10 mV) served as the quantitative indices for CDI and VGA respectively. Thus, by way of DCT competition against apoCaM, the provisional CMI was expected to attenuate both <italic>S<sub>Ca</sub></italic> and <italic>J<sub>Ca</sub></italic>, as suggested by prior studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Liu et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Singh et al., 2008</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Tan et al., 2011</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Wahl-Schott et al., 2006</xref>). However, most of these reports focused on either CDI or VGA only; or even when both were studied for whole-cell <italic>I<sub>Ca</sub></italic>, CDI and VGA were separately evaluated with different experimental groups. Here, we conducted a side-by-side analysis for each variant or condition, not only more confirmative since concurrent changes in CDI and VGA would be mutually supportive, but also critical to later insights into CMI mechanisms and significance originated from such concurrency. Technically, compared to VGA and <italic>J<sub>Ca</sub></italic>, CDI and <italic>S<sub>Ca</sub></italic> are more robust so more favorable since CDI of Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3 is independent of global Ca<sup>2+</sup> so insensitive to Ca<sup>2+</sup>-buffer capacities and variations in channel expressions partly due to transient transfections (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Dick et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Tadross et al., 2008</xref>). In general, for data and analyses we provided for both CDI and VGA, CDI (<italic>S<sub>Ca</sub></italic>) was considered as the major index for CMI evaluations and VGA as the supplement.<fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.21989.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Inhibition of Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3 gating by carboxyl terminal motifs.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Parameters and indices illustrated by the control group of short Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3 channels.

We decided to employ homologous DCT<sub>F</sub> from Ca<sub>V</sub>1.4 (α<sub>1F</sub>) with the strongest DCT tuning effects (stronger than DCT<sub>D</sub>) among the Ca<sub>V</sub>1 members (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>), to construct the channel variant by fusing PCRD<sub>F</sub>-DCRD<sub>F</sub> onto α<sub>1DS</sub> right after IQ<sub>V</sub> motif; meanwhile, since the potency of DCT effects is mainly determined by DCRD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Liu et al., 2010</xref>), PCRD from either Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3 or Ca<sub>V</sub>1.4 supposedly makes no or little difference and thus we did not distinguish these two PCRD isoforms in this work. Such channel variant was simply denoted as α<sub>1DS</sub>-PCRD-DCRD, which represents CMI intrinsic to the long variant of Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3 (α<sub>1DL</sub>) but with higher potency since strong DCRD<sub>F</sub> replaces endogenous DCRD<sub>D</sub>. Compared with α<sub>1DS</sub> control, <italic>S<sub>Ca</sub></italic> and <italic>J<sub>Ca</sub></italic> from α<sub>1DS</sub>-PCRD-DCRD were substantially attenuated, which provided ample dynamic ranges (highlighted by green areas) to explore CMI effects on CDI/VGA and its mechanisms (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Differential roles of DCRD and PCRD unveiled by low [apoCaM]</title><p>With such baseline CMI effects of PCRD-DCRD, we went further to examine whether both PCRD and DCRD are required, by fusing only PCRD or DCRD onto α<sub>1DS</sub>. Since DCRD might need some structural freedom as in DCT or PCRD-DCRD, a glycine linker of different length (G<sub>X</sub>) was inserted between DCRD and IQ<sub>V</sub> to construct α<sub>1DS</sub>-G<sub>X</sub>-DCRD, mimicking the configurations that permit potent effects. From all these channel variants, we concluded no alteration in CDI in comparison with the α<sub>1DS</sub> control, similarly from VGA results and analyses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A</xref>). In general, current densities should be more carefully scrutinized before any conclusive claim on VGA; and effects on <italic>J<sub>peak</sub></italic> profiles and <italic>J<sub>Ca</sub></italic> values normally need to be backed up by evaluations on concurrent CDI. For instance, current densities of α<sub>1DS</sub>-G<sub>X</sub>-DCRD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A</xref>, the three columns on right) seemed different from the control, potentially interpreted as mild CMI; however, considering that the changes in CDI of these channels were rather small, the mild changes in VGA should be considered as variations instead of conclusive attenuations. Statistical test of significance (Student’s t-test) was performed subsequently to help identify significant CMI effects. Based on the fact that all the configurations under test failed to mediate <italic>S<sub>Ca</sub></italic> and <italic>J<sub>Ca</sub></italic> attenuations, all the three motifs of PCRD, DCRD and IQ<sub>V</sub> might be required for effective CMI, consistent with the preliminary analyses on DCT subsegments from Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3 and Ca<sub>V</sub>1.4, in which the segment between PCRD and DCRD (‘B’ region) was dispensable but neither PCRD nor DCRD could be excluded (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Liu et al., 2010</xref>).<fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.21989.005</object-id><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>DCRD is indispensable and sufficient to induce CMI in low [apoCaM].</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) All the channel variants including α<sub>1DS</sub>, α<sub>1DS</sub>-PCRD and α<sub>1DS</sub>-G<sub>24</sub>-DCRD exhibited strong CDI, indexed with <italic>S<sub>Ca</sub></italic>.

This explained why the potential contributions of these secondary interactions may or may not be evidenced, depending on whether the trio complex would come into being in particular settings. Our FRET binding analyses are consistent with the functional data shown earlier, thus providing additional information for the collaborations among CMI motifs. For instance, coexpression of all the three but separate components would not produce CMI (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>).

FKBP (rapamycin-binding protein) and FRB fragment (FKBP and rapamycin binding domain of the kinase mTOR) as the tags were fused onto DCRD and PCRD, respectively. A small immunosuppressant molecule rapamycin that binds both FRB and FKBP was applied to link one FKBP-DCRD together with one PCRD-FRB, aiming to bind to the IQ<sub>V</sub> domain of α<sub>1DS</sub> to compete off apoCaM and thus induce CMI according to the scheme of combination I (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>). This design, if successful, should be directly applicable to native Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3 since no modification is needed at the channel side.

Targeting the mechanisms of CDI, most structural efforts have been directed to channels in Ca<sup>2+</sup> conditions, evidenced by multiple studies focusing on Ca<sup>2+</sup>/CaM bound with key channel motifs such as IQ or IQ<sub>V</sub> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Ben Johny et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Fallon et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Kim et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Mori et al., 2008</xref>) and NSCaTE (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Dick et al., 2008</xref>), which have not achieved unequivocal viewpoints toward CDI mechanisms. CMI emphasizes on the importance of apoCaM-bound and apoCaM-off structures in Ca<sup>2+</sup>-free conditions, which represent the states of ‘Activated’ (pre-CMI) and ‘Inhibited’ (post-CMI), promisingly holding the key to understand the core mechanisms that control the gating of Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels. Functionally, CMI helps clarify the long-standing complication on the overall effects of CDI on the actual Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx into the cell. Historically, CDI is considered as a negative feedback to autonomously reduce Ca<sup>2+</sup> entries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Alseikhan et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Budde et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Liu et al., 2010</xref>). On the other hand, stronger CDI is often accompanied with larger amplitude or facilitated activation of <italic>I<sub>Ca</sub></italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Adams et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Liu et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Singh et al., 2008</xref>), altogether raising the question whether Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx is reduced or enhanced by CDI. Here we provide direct evidence that attenuation of CDI via endogenous factors and mechanisms is essentially a reduction of Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx, assured by the fixed level of Ca<sup>2+</sup> current at the late phase of <italic>I<sub>Ca</sub></italic>, <italic>i.e.</italic>, <italic>I<sub>300</sub></italic> measured in this work, remaining the same regardless of the changes in <italic>I<sub>peak</sub></italic> or <italic>S<sub>Ca</sub></italic>. In this context, CMI (in inverse correlation to CDI strength) is the more direct index of channel inhibition. In contrast, CDI strength itself (<italic>S<sub>Ca</sub></italic>) could be changed by various mechanisms of action besides [apoCaM] tuning, which may or may not actually reduce Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx. For instance, channel mutations in congenital diseases, <italic>e.g.</italic>, Timothy syndrome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Splawski et al., 2004</xref>), could cause less inactivation in <italic>I<sub>Ca</sub></italic> and thus elevate the Ca<sup>2+</sup> entries.

However, concerns are raised on developing PD therapeutics based on DHP or like inhibitors. First of all, it has been argued whether Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3 is indeed a prerequisite for pacemaking and autonomous oscillation, because of pharmacological complications of DHP, including non-specific side effects and discrepancies in dose dependence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Guzman et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Putzier et al., 2009</xref>).

Secondly, PD interventions deploying Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3 antagonists could be improved in the following aspects: (1) specificity, for which genetically-encoded CMI-based inhibitors provide the desired specificity intrinsic to Ca<sub>V</sub>1 channels; (2) assurance of Ca<sup>2+</sup> reduction, for which CMI is mechanistically guaranteed to reduce Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx; however, certain antagonists may not be able to provide such assurance due to aforementioned reasons.</p><p>CMI-based interventions and therapeutics could be beneficial to other diseases in addition to PD.

Here, to advance the understanding, we clarify that multiple C-terminal motifs cooperatively and acutely compete apoCaM off the channel; and unveil that CMI functionally resembles CDI such that the maximum potency of CMI is preset by end-stage CDI, which also ensures CMI reduces the overall Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx.

The internal solutions contained (in mM): CsMeSO<sub>3</sub>, 135; CsCl<sub>2</sub>, 5; MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 1; MgATP, 4; HEPES, 5; and EGTA, 5, adjusted to 290 mOsm with glucose and pH 7.3 with CsOH. The extracellular solutions contained (in mM): TEA-MeSO<sub>3</sub>, 140; HEPES, 10; CaCl<sub>2</sub> or BaCl<sub>2</sub>, 10, adjusted to 300 mOsm with glucose and pH 7.3 with TEAOH, all according to the previous reports (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Liu et al., 2016</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">2010</xref>). For run-down experiments, the content of MgATP (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO) in the internal solutions was intentionally reduced. Chemical reagents used for blockage experiments (isradipine, Sigma-Aldrich) and drug-inducible experiments (rapamycin, Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA) were dissolved in DMSO as 10 mM or 1 mM stock solution, stored at −20°C, and then diluted to 10 μM or 1 μM using extracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> solution right before experiments. Whole-cell currents were generated from a family of step depolarization (−70 to +50 mV from a holding potential of −70 mV) or a series of repeated step depolarization (−10 mV from a holding potential of −70 mV). Currents were recorded at 2 kHz low-pass filtering of the instrument. Traces were acquired at a minimum repetition interval of 30 s. P/8 leak subtraction was used throughout.</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>FRET optical imaging</title><p>FRET 2-hybrid imaging experiments were performed with an inverted microscope (Ti-U, Nikon, Japan) with Neo sCMOS camera (Andor Technology, UK).

Your article has been favorably evaluated by Richard Aldrich (Senior Editor) and three reviewers, one of whom, Kenton J Swartz (Reviewer #1), is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>This manuscript reports interactions among C-terminal structural components of L-type Ca channels IQ, PCRD and DCRD, and the effects of such interactions on voltage gated activation (VGA) and CaM mediated Ca dependent inactivation (CDI). The interactions among IQ, PCRD and DCRD can alter channel function (known as CMI) only when any two of them are tethered together by fusion protein or rapamycin-mediated heterodimerization. The spatial closeness of any two of these structural domains may strengthen their interactions enough to compete off the IQ-CaM interaction, which is suggested by experiments with reduced apoCaM and live cell FRET tw0-hybrid assays. This mechanism directly explains why the interactions among IQ, PCRD and DCRD reduce CDI. Previous studies suggest that CDI may actually close the channel by reducing activation and results in this study show that at the end of CDI and CMI the currents levels are the same, the overall results suggest that CMI may alter channel function similarly as CDI. The mechanism revealed by this manuscript explains well the different phenotypes of various L-type Ca channels. By computational modeling, the manuscript suggests physiological importance of CMI, and rapamycin-mediated heterodimerization experiments provided a novel rationale for pharmacological intervention of Ca channel function. The study is significant and the results in general provide a strong argument for the proposed mechanism.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) An overarching and major weakness of the manuscript is the lack of clarity in the written presentation. The text requires extensive editing to be acceptable for publication in <italic>eLife</italic>. The authors need to provide clear and logical rationale for each of the experiments performed and for what the results mean. The current presentation assumes that the reader is familiar with the authors previous work, as well as an extensive body of work on CDI. The authors need to undertake a major revision of the text to make the work accessible to a broad audience, and for the authors to provide more details on how each experiment was performed. The Abstract is full of hyperbole and needs to be rewritten to convey the main findings of the study and why they are important. We emphasize that we think this is an interesting study, but that the written presentation needs a lot of work. The comments below give more specific guidance.</p><p>2) The manuscript uses a lot of jargon and abbreviations, but does not give clear definition for all of them. The authors need to clearly explain, using correct and simple English sentences, in the beginning of Results the important molecular processes and parameters, such as CMI, CDI, S<sub>Ca</sub>, VGA, J<sub>Ca</sub> and r<sub>50</sub> etc., and use both text and figures to illustrate the definition, the experimental phenomena of these processes, and how they are measured.</p><p>3) Since CMI inhibits both voltage gated activation (VGA) and Ca dependent inactivation (CDI), it is too simplistic to measure CMI only based on CDI size (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">4</xref>). It would be better to measure both VGA and CDI at various voltages and the variation in VGA and CDI changes observed with different experimental conditions need better explanation and discussion.</p><p>4) The authors tend to make conclusions by simply referring to figures without convincing analyses or clear explanation. The authors should describe the most relevant feature of the result in the text and point out how the result leads to the conclusion. The authors should also explain clearly if the conclusion is novel or seemingly at odds with previously established mechanisms.</p><p>5) Structural domains from α<sub>1F</sub> and α<sub>1D</sub> such as PCRD-F and PCRD-D are intermittently used in different experiments without justification or explanation. In the text or figure legend, prior to the description of results, briefly explain why D or F form is used; do not label D or F if the two forms do not make any difference to the result.</p><p>6) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>. CMI is supposed to inhibit both activation and CDI, but in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref> the right two panels only show a reduction of CDI but not activation.

Please report fitting parameters.</p><p>11) The rapamycin experiments are elegant and insightful. However, it is not clear why 300ms pulses were chosen, as it does not appear steady state for CMI (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref> red current traces). This is also evident in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>, where the current does not seem to level off at 300ms. The end stage of CMI and CDI may not be the same with longer pulses (true steady-state). This point seems crucial to the authors' conclusion that CDI and CMI functionally result into indistinguishable gating at the ending stage. Experiments with longer depolarizing pulses or measurements of CDI and CMI time constants may help to discuss this point.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.21989.022</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>Essential revisions:</italic> </p><p><italic>1) An overarching and major weakness of the manuscript is the lack of clarity in the written presentation.

It would be better to measure both VGA and CDI at various voltages and the variation in VGA and CDI changes observed with different experimental conditions need better explanation and discussion.</italic> </p><p>We have revised all related figures to include both VGA and CDI (with the indices of J<sub>Ca</sub>and S<sub>Ca</sub>), which are <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A-C</xref>. We agree with the reviewer about measuring both VGA and CDI. Technically, CDI and its index SCa are more favorable because for Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3 channels CDI is independent of global Ca<sup>2+</sup> so insensitive to buffer capacities, variations in expression levels, or the general health of the cells, thus more robust than VGA (J<sub>Ca</sub>). In general, VGA and J<sub>Ca</sub>are less stable even when experimental conditions are well controlled. Basically, any conclusion on J<sub>Ca</sub>needs to be carefully drawn from pronounced changes. In fact, this was one of the motivations underlying chemical-inducible CMI, for us to confidently count on each individual cell to quantify VGA and other properties. In some cases, the mild changes in J<sub>Ca</sub>may lead to uncertainties which need to be confirmed by analyzing concurrent CDI changes. We have discussed these aspects with relevant data (subsection “Differential roles of DCRD and PCRD unveiled by low [apoCaM]” and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A</xref>).</p><p><italic>4) The authors tend to make conclusions by simply referring to figures without convincing analyses or clear explanation. The authors should describe the most relevant feature of the result in the text and point out how the result leads to the conclusion. The authors should also explain clearly if the conclusion is novel or seemingly at odds with previously established mechanisms.</italic> </p><p>We have paid attention to these aspects in the revision, by providing more details of the experiments and data in the main text in addition to the figure captions, especially for <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figures 4</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">6</xref>, which represent the major conclusions in this work (subsections “Cooperative scheme of CMI consists of three major combinations”, “Acute CMI based on rapamycin-inducible heterodimerization and cooperation” and “CMI is a unique type of inhibition but sharing similarities with CDI”). Also, we thank the reviewer for the suggestion about scrutinizing the novelty of particular results. It has been well taken to emphasize on the key findings of this work and we have revised the relevant text accordingly, to list a few:</p><p>A) Subsection “Differential roles of DCRD and PCRD unveiled by low [apoCaM]” and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C, D</xref>, surprising observations from α<sub>1DS</sub>-G<sub>X</sub>-DCRD that CDI and VGA were attenuated at low [apoCaM];</p><p>B) Subsection “Cooperative scheme of CMI consists of three major combinations” and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>, novel roles of PCRD unveiled by effective CMI (combination III);</p><p>C) Subsection “CMI is a unique type of inhibition but sharing similarities with CDI” and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>, findings about stable end-stage CDI (I<sub>300</sub>) from both versions of inducible CMI, distinct from known modalities such as run-down and small-molecule blockage;</p><p>D) Subsection “CMI is a unique type of inhibition but sharing similarities with CDI”and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>, new discovery that CMI attenuation on CDI is achieved by inhibiting the peak amplitude of Ca<sup>2+</sup> current while maintaining its late-phase levels, which also reconciles the concurrent VGA/CDI attenuations apparently leading to contradictory effects on Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx.</p><p><italic>5) Structural domains from α<sub>1F</sub> and α<sub>1D</sub> such as PCRD-F and PCRD-D are intermittently used in different experiments without justification or explanation. In the text or figure legend, prior to the description of results, briefly explain why D or F form is used; do not label D or F if the two forms do not make any difference to the result.</italic> </p><p>We agree with the reviewer that it is unnecessary in the context of this work to distinguish between PCRD<sub>D</sub>and PCRD<sub>F</sub>(subsection “Provisional CMI concurrently attenuates both CDI and VGA”). We have updated the sequence alignment for homology among different Ca<sub>V</sub>1 isoforms including α<sub>1D</sub> and α<sub>1F</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). And the functional roles of the two motifs in CMI are essentially very close, because PCRD<sub>D</sub>-DCRD and PCRD<sub>F</sub>-DCRD peptides attenuated α<sub>1DS</sub> similarly (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref> and subsection “Cooperative scheme of CMI consists of three major combinations”). Following the suggestion, we have also simplified the nomenclature for DCRD and IQ<sub>V</sub>, since in this work either only one isoform was used (DCRD<sub>F</sub>); or even different isoforms were used but functionally similar (PCRD<sub>D</sub> vs. PCDR<sub>F</sub>; IQ<sub>V</sub> from Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3 vs. Ca<sub>V</sub>1.2). Meanwhile, details on various constructs including their original templates have been provided in the section of “Materials and methods” (“Molecular biology”).</p><p><italic>6) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>. CMI is supposed to inhibit both activation and CDI, but in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref> the right two panels only show a reduction of CDI but not activation. The authors should explain and discuss this.</italic> </p><p>We thank the reviewer for the comment with specifics. As the reviewer pointed out, it is true that both CDI and activation (VGA) were inhibited in the mentioned cases. Due to the reasons as stated in item 3, we prefer to take advantages of CDI (S<sub>Ca</sub>) as the major index to examine CMI effects and thus we did not show VGA data. In response to this comment and also for further assurance, we have provided full profiles of VGA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>), with J<sub>Ca</sub>values summarized in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>. These results have also been described accordingly in the text (subsection “Differential roles of DCRD and PCRD unveiled by low [apoCaM]”).</p><p><italic>7) Do the authors suggest that in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>, with IQ or IQ/PCRD, the channel can have CDI without CaM?</italic> </p><p>BSCaM<sub>IQ</sub>, a specific apoCaM (Ca<sup>2+</sup>-free CaM) chelator, was to substantially reduce free apoCaM levels. However, in practice, BSCaM<sub>IQ</sub> cannot eliminate all the free apoCaM in cells. Since CaM is generally needed, supposedly no cells with complete elimination of apoCaM would be available for experimental assessment. We have modified the illustration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>) accordingly. Under the residue apoCaM in realistic cells, without DCRD competition, α<sub>1DS</sub> or α<sub>1DS</sub>-PCRD is still able to produce pronounced CDI similarly as in control conditions, owing to the fact that under these conditions apoCaM binds the channels (IQ<sub>V</sub> or IQ<sub>V</sub>-PCRD) reasonably well (Liu et al. 2010). Although such low apoCaM would not affect α<sub>1DS</sub> or α<sub>1DS</sub>-PCRD, it does reduce the CDI of some variants besides α<sub>1D</sub>-G<sub>X</sub>-DCRD, such as the native α<sub>1DL</sub> variants containing full-length DCTs. The established principles for CaM-mediated CDI are still valid and applicable in all these cases, regardless of actual CaM levels. We have revised the text to clarify this notion (subsection “Differential roles of DCRD and PCRD unveiled by low [apoCaM]”).</p><p><italic>8) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>. There is no experimental evidence that PCRD or DCRD were actually expressed separately.</italic> </p><p>For the peptide experiments in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>, both PCRD and DCRD were tagged with fluorescent proteins. And in the case of PCRD/DCRD coexpression, PCRD and DCRD were fused with YFP vs. CFP to make sure both were present in the same cell (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref> and subsection “Cooperative scheme of CMI consists of three major combinations”). We have amended the construct names with explicit information of the tags in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>and also other peptide experiments (mainly in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). In addition, subsequent inducible-CMI experiments (e.g., <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>) demonstrate that the ultrastrong CDI as in control was substantially attenuated upon induced PCRD-DCRD dimerization, which provides another proof that both peptides can be separately expressed very well in the same cell without affecting CDI of α<sub>1DS</sub>.</p><p>We assume this comment is also concerned with the potential binding/assembly between the two individual peptides of PCRD and DCRD, which should be unlikely according to this work and previous reports. For PCRD and DCRD peptides, no binding was detected with the FRET two-hybrid assay (Liu et al. 2010). Nevertheless, this would not completely exclude all potential interactions between PCRD and DCRD. For instance, electrostatic interactions might exist between PCRD and DCRD in the holo-channel of Ca<sub>V</sub>1.2 (Hulme et al. 2005), provided that the major binding has been established in the first place, e.g., between IQ<sub>V</sub>-PCRD and DCRD. The important consensus here is that even if the putative PCRD/DCRD interactions exist, they should be weaker than the binding between IQ<sub>V</sub> and DCRD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>); and the latter binding is further enhanced by the presence of PCRD in the close vicinity to IQ<sub>V</sub> or DCRD, which might be partly contributed by PCRD/DCRD interaction. We have revised the text to incorporate some of the above facts and analyses (subsection “Cooperative scheme of CMI consists of three major combinations”).</p><p><italic>9) There is a lack of clarity about the chimeric constructs used. The authors explain that they will &quot;employ homologous DCTF from α1F with the strongest CMI among Ca<sub>V</sub>1 family to construct chimeric Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3 channels by fusing PCRDF-DCRDF onto IQ motif of α1DS&quot;. However, some of the experiments are conducted with PCRDD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">2B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">4C, 4E</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">6B</xref>) without giving an explanation or rationale.</italic> </p><p>Please see item 5.</p><p><italic>10) The quantification of the FRET experiments is missing: what is the equation fitting FRET strength (as in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>, etc.)? Please report fitting parameters.</italic> </p><p>The fitting procedures were based on established protocols and algorithms (Erickson et al. 2001; Liuet al. 2010; Butz et al. 2016). In the “Materials and methods” section (“FRET optical imaging”) we have added a brief description of the FRET two-hybrid binding assay (3-cube FRET) used in this work. We appreciate the reviewer for this suggestion reminding us to provide the values for the key binding parameters (effective dissociation equilibrium constant K<sub>d</sub> indicating affinity and also the maximum FRET ratio FR<sub>max</sub> intrinsic to the bound pair, which we obtained from the iterative curve fitting procedures with a customized Matlab program. Accordingly, for all the pairs of FRET binding, K<sub>d</sub> and FR<sub>max</sub> values have been included for <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref> in the caption and the main text (subsection “Cooperative scheme of CMI consists of three major combinations”), and in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2</xref>, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s3">Figure 6—figure supplement 3</xref>.</p><p><italic>11) The rapamycin experiments are elegant and insightful. However, it is not clear why 300ms pulses were chosen, as it does not appear steady state for CMI (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref> red current traces). This is also evident in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>, where the current does not seem to level off at 300ms. The end stage of CMI and CDI may not be the same with longer pulses (true steady-state). This point seems crucial to the authors' conclusion that CDI and CMI functionally result into indistinguishable gating at the ending stage. Experiments with longer depolarizing pulses or measurements of CDI and CMI time constants may help to discuss this point.</italic> </p><p>We thank the reviewer for bringing up this important matter. We have conducted the experiments with longer depolarization pulses as suggested for both constitutive and rapamycin-inducible CMI (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2</xref>). Briefly, for Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3 channels, 300 ms is already very close to the end stage or the steady state of CDI; and with both 300 ms and 1000 ms pulses, the “end-stage” CMI (or full- strength CMI) is very close to the end-stage CDI (or steady-state CDI).</p><p>The decreasing trend or tendency observed from the Ca<sup>2+</sup> current at 300 ms is largely due to VDI (voltage-dependent inactivation), as confirmed by the comparison between current traces in Ba<sup>2+</sup> and Ca<sup>2+</sup>. VDI varies slightly from cell to cell, but generally much slower than CDI so often observable at 300 ms or even later phase during the depolarization step. Therefore, “unsteady” I<sub>Ca</sub> is not necessarily a sign of incomplete CDI.</p><p>Meanwhile, we agree with the reviewer that longer pulse such as 1000 ms would be informative and potentially more confirmative. Consistent with J<sub>300</sub>-based results, J<sub>1000</sub> (Ca<sup>2+</sup> current density measured at 1000 ms) profiles from α<sub>1DS</sub> control vs. α<sub>1DS</sub>-PCRD-DCRD were nearly identical, both suggesting that end-stage CDI remained unaltered even with potent CMI attenuation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6— figure supplement 2A</xref>). For rapamycin-inducible CMI, both I<sub>1000</sub> and I<sub>300</sub> remained stable throughout the experiments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2B</xref>), as compared to decaying I<sub>peak</sub> and I<sub>100</sub> (measured at 0 and 100 ms respectively) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2C</xref>). Taken together, the performance of I<sub>300</sub> is comparable to I<sub>1000</sub>, so both are qualified indices of end-stage CDI (for channels with or without CMI) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2C</xref>).</p><p>We would like to clarify that “end-stage” of inducible CMI refers to its steady state in the time-dependent profile, and its actual level of attenuation is dependent on the potency of particular CMI competition. For constitutive CMI, “end-stage” CMI refers to the full-strength CMI or complete competition, which was closely approached but not yet fully reached in most experiments (but see very strong CMI effects in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). In contrast, end-stage CDI in this work always refers to the time domain, reaching its steady state at ~300 ms or later. As suggested by the whole-cell I<sub>Ca</sub> from ensemble channels, we have concluded that the particular channel inhibited by CMI (with CDI abolished) should be functionally equivalent to the channel (e.g., with no CMI) into its end-stage CDI. Provided that VDI is negligible, I<sub>Ca</sub> attenuated by full-strength CMI (evaluated at 0 ms, I<sub>peak</sub>) would be equal to I<sub>Ca</sub> at the end stage of CDI (≥300 ms, e.g., I<sub>300</sub>), as our data of rapamycin-inducible CMI (version 2) strongly suggest (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2</xref>).</p><p>Some of these discussions have been included in the revision (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>, subsection “CMI is a unique type of inhibition but sharing similarities with CDI”).</p></body></sub-article></article>
