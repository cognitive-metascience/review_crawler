Here we show that the putative actin regulator cyclase-associated protein (CAP) is present in two different isoforms and its deletion leads to significant defects in some but not all actin dependent processes. We observe defects in cell-cell communication, daughter cell orientation and the juxtanuclear accumulation of actin, but only modest defects in synchronicity of division and no defect in the replication of the apicoplast. 3D electron microscopy reveals that loss of CAP results in a defect in formation of a normal central residual body, but parasites remain connected within the vacuole. This dissociates synchronicity of division and parasite rosetting and reveals that establishment and maintenance of the residual body may be more complex than previously thought. These results highlight the different spatial requirements for F-actin regulation in <italic>Toxoplasma</italic> which appear to be achieved by partially overlapping functions of actin regulators.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd><italic>Toxoplasma gondii</italic></kwd><kwd>parasitology</kwd><kwd>actin</kwd><kwd>cell biology</kwd><kwd>cyclase-associated protein</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Other</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100010438</institution-id><institution>Francis Crick Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>FC001189</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Hunt</surname><given-names>Alex</given-names></name><name><surname>Wagener</surname><given-names>Jeanette</given-names></name><name><surname>Collinson</surname><given-names>Lucy</given-names></name><name><surname>Treeck</surname><given-names>Moritz</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>NIH</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>AI1218885</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Carmeille</surname><given-names>Romain</given-names></name><name><surname>Heaslip</surname><given-names>Aoife</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>NIH</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>AI139201</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kent</surname><given-names>Robyn</given-names></name><name><surname>Ward</surname><given-names>Gary E</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100010438</institution-id><institution>Francis Crick Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>FC001999</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Russell</surname><given-names>Matthew Robert Geoffrey</given-names></name><name><surname>Peddie</surname><given-names>Christopher J</given-names></name><name><surname>Collinson</surname><given-names>Lucy</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>NIH</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>AI137767</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kent</surname><given-names>Robyn</given-names></name><name><surname>Ward</surname><given-names>Gary E</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Partially overlapping functions of a limited subset of actin binding proteins allow the parasite <italic>Toxoplasma gondii</italic> to achieve actin regulation required for complex cellular processes.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p><italic>Toxoplasma gondii</italic> is an obligate intracellular parasite, belonging to the Apicomplexa phylum. The Apicomplexa, which also include <italic>Plasmodium</italic> and <italic>Cryptosporidium</italic> species, pose a significant global public health burden. <italic>Toxoplasma</italic>, specifically, is one of the most prevalent human pathogens, chronically infecting ~30% of the world’s population (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Swapna and Parkinson, 2017</xref>). While most infections are asymptomatic, in congenitally infected and immunocompromised patients, disease outcomes are often severe and potentially fatal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Halonen and Weiss, 2013</xref>). During acute infection of the host, the asexual tachyzoite stage of <italic>Toxoplasma gondii</italic> undergoes cycles of active invasion, replication and egress from host cells. This lytic cycle leads to rapid proliferation and dissemination of the parasite throughout the host (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Black and Boothroyd, 2000</xref>). To facilitate these processes, <italic>Toxoplasma</italic> utilises a unique form of locomotion, called gliding motility, which relies on actin and an unconventional myosin motor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Frénal et al., 2017a</xref>). This motor allows the parasite to actively invade host cells, where it forms a protective parasitophorous vacuole. Parasitophorous vacuole structural integrity and stability is sustained through the parasite’s release of dense granule proteins from secretory vesicles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Heaslip et al., 2016</xref>). Additionally, several dense granule proteins are transported into the host cell where they co-opt or interfere with host cell functions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Hakimi et al., 2017</xref>). Within the parasitophorous vacuole, <italic>Toxoplasma</italic> begins a unique form of cell division called endodyogeny (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Sheffield and Melton, 1968</xref>). Here, two daughter cells are synchronously assembled within the mother cell before daughter cell budding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Delbac et al., 2001</xref>). This initiates at the apical pole of the mother cell and once complete, the daughter cells bud from the mother cell but remain attached at their basal pole to a central residual body: a membranous compartment containing maternal remnants of organelles and cytoskeletal elements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Muñiz-Hernández et al., 2011</xref>). During cell division, organelles such as mitochondria and the apicoplast, a unique and essential organelle which contributes to isoprenoid synthesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Vaishnava and Striepen, 2006</xref>), also divide and are distributed between the two daughter parasites. Following multiple rounds of cell division, parasites organise into a rosette-like pattern around the residual body. Formation of the characteristic rosette pattern requires actin, several myosins, and other actin-binding proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Frénal et al., 2017b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Haase et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Jacot et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Periz et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Tosetti et al., 2019</xref>). It has been hypothesised that the inter-parasite connections via the residual body are not only important for parasite organisation, but also play a key role in cell-cell communication. Such communication was measured by the transfer of reporter proteins between parasites and is believed to ensure the synchronous division of parasites within a vacuole (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Frénal et al., 2017b</xref>). The parasites continue to replicate until host cell lysis and parasite egress. Following egress, parasites migrate to and invade new host cells and the lytic cycle repeats, leading to tissue destruction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Black and Boothroyd, 2000</xref>). Actin plays an essential role in the parasite’s lytic cycle through function of the actin cytoskeleton and actomyosin motor complex. Despite this crucial role in apicomplexan biology, there has been difficulty visualising actin filaments in apicomplexan species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bannister and Mitchell, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Sahoo et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Shaw and Tilney, 1999</xref>) and it has been suggested that as much as 98% of parasite actin is monomeric (G-actin) and not incorporated into filaments (F-actin) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Dobrowolski et al., 1997</xref>). This, along with structural differences found in actin of Apicomplexa (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Pospich et al., 2017</xref>), led to the hypothesis that <italic>Toxoplasma</italic> F-actin has reduced stability, forming abnormally short filaments that are rapidly recycled to maintain essential cellular function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Pospich et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Skillman et al., 2011</xref>). However, recent development of the actin-chromobody has allowed for the visualisation of F-actin structures both in the parasite and extensive networks within the parasitophorous vacuole (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Periz et al., 2017</xref>). Taken together, along with biochemical evidence, apicomplexan actin appears to be different to actin from other organisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Frénal et al., 2017a</xref>).</p><p>Actin turnover is regulated by actin binding proteins, of which <italic>Toxoplasma</italic> possesses a reduced repertoire, including ADF, profilin, coronin and cyclase-associated protein (CAP) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Baum et al., 2006</xref>). Functional studies have shown ADF and profilin to be essential for <italic>Toxoplasma</italic> progression through the lytic cycle, while coronin depletion had a modest impact on parasite invasion and egress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Mehta and Sibley, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Plattner et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Salamun et al., 2014</xref>). Apart from its localisation, the function of CAP in <italic>Toxoplasma</italic> has not been investigated. In the majority of eukaryotes, CAP is a highly conserved multidomain protein that regulates actin filament dynamics via two distinct mechanisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Ono, 2013</xref>). CAP can bind and sequester G-actin using its CAP and X-linked retinitis pigmentosa two protein (CARP) domain and can regulate actin filament disassembly by promoting ADF/cofilin mediated severing using its helical folded domain (HFD). Through regulation of actin dynamics, by interacting with actin and other actin binding proteins, it has been shown that mouse CAP1 plays important roles in cell morphology, migration and endocytosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bertling et al., 2004</xref>). However, species belonging to the Apicomplexa phylum possess a truncated form of CAP, retaining only the conserved C-terminal G-actin-binding CARP domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Hliscs et al., 2010</xref>). This conserved β-sheet domain has been shown to interact directly with monomeric actin, providing either sequestration or nucleotide exchange of G-actin in a concentration-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Hliscs et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Makkonen et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Mattila et al., 2004</xref>). As such, apicomplexan CAP is hypothesised to regulate actin turnover solely through interaction with monomeric actin. Biochemical analysis of <italic>Cryptosporidium parvum</italic> CAP identified the formation of a dimer and G-actin sequestering activity, while <italic>Plasmodium falciparum</italic> CAP was shown to facilitate nucleotide exchange, loading ADP-actin monomers with ATP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Hliscs et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Makkonen et al., 2013</xref>). A <italic>Plasmodium berghei</italic> CAP KO demonstrated that while PbCAP is dispensable for asexual blood stages in vivo, there is a complete defect in oocyst development in the insect vector which was overcome through complementation with <italic>C. parvum</italic> CAP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Hliscs et al., 2010</xref>). A PbCAP overexpression study revealed no defect in ookinete motility or oocyst development, however sporozoites displayed impaired gliding motility, invasion and salivary gland colonisation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Sato et al., 2016</xref>). Taken together, these results suggest that apicomplexan CAP may function as a dimer with the ability to interact with G-actin monomers to sequester them and/or facilitate their nucleotide exchange. While CAP has yet to be functionally characterised in <italic>Toxoplasma</italic>, Lorestani et al reported that CAP localises to the apex of intracellular parasites, a hub for events leading to egress and motility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Graindorge et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Lorestani et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Tosetti et al., 2019</xref>). Intriguingly, following host cell lysis, relocalisation of CAP to the parasite cytosol was observed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Lorestani et al., 2012</xref>). Furthermore, we have previously identified differential phosphorylation of CAP in parasites with a delayed egress phenotype (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Treeck et al., 2014</xref>). The correlation between CAP redistribution and phosphorylation, following host cell lysis, hints at a potential role for CAP in actin regulation during rapid egress. Taken together, these results prompted us to characterise the role of CAP in <italic>Toxoplasma</italic> biology.</p><p>Here we show that <italic>T. gondii</italic> CAP is produced in two distinctly localised isoforms through alternative translation initiation: a membrane bound isoform, localised to the apical tip (longCAP) and a cytosolically dispersed isoform (shortCAP). Conditional knockout of CAP, using a second generation DiCre strain, identified an important function of CAP in some, but not all, actin-dependent processes. Invasion, egress, motility, correct daughter cell orientation and dense granule trafficking were all perturbed in CAP depleted parasites, while apicoplast inheritance was not. This suggests different spatial requirements for CAP in actin turnover within the cell. Furthermore, the characteristic rosette organisation of parasites in the vacuole was completely lost, but synchronicity of division was largely unaffected. Strikingly, while we observe rapid protein transfer only between two adjacent cells in a vacuole, all parasites remain connected through a decentralised residual body, potentially explaining why synchrony of division is unaffected. Using chromobody expressing parasites lines we show that CAP deletion leads to a dysregulation of actin in some, but not all subcellular localisations. In the mouse in vivo infection model, CAP-depleted type I RH parasites display normal lethality, while CAP depletion renders type II Pru parasites avirulent, with markedly reduced cyst formation. Furthermore, the cytoplasmic isoform of CAP was sufficient for the infection of mice and the formation of latent stages in the brain, indicating that the apically localised CAP isoform provides only a small fitness benefit under the conditions tested here.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title><italic>T. gondii</italic> CAP contains two translational start sites which results in the production of two differentially localised protein isoforms</title><p>CAP was previously shown to localise to the apex of intracellular parasites and rapidly redistribute to the cytoplasm of extracellular parasites following host cell lysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Lorestani et al., 2012</xref>). This suggested that CAP localisation may be influenced by post-translational modifications that enable CAP to regulate actin dynamics at different locations in the cell. <italic>T. gondii</italic> CAP, and CAP from <italic>Neospora</italic> and <italic>Hammondia</italic> species contain a unique predicted N-terminal extension that is not present in other Apicomplexa, such as <italic>Plasmodium</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). The extension contains two predicted palmitoylation sites and CAP was identified in an analysis of palmitoylated proteins in <italic>Toxoplasma gondii</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Foe et al., 2015</xref>). Furthermore, two phosphorylation sites in the N-terminus of <italic>T. gondii</italic> CAP are substantially phosphorylated upon ionophore-induced egress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Treeck et al., 2014</xref>). These phosphorylation events are dependent on the calcium-dependent kinase 3 (CDPK3) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Treeck et al., 2014</xref>), which has been shown to be important in mediating rapid exit from the host cell and is localised to the plasma membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Black et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Garrison et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Lourido et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">McCoy et al., 2012</xref>). Collectively, these observations allow for the possibility that re-localisation of CAP is important for egress and is mediated by dynamic post-translational modifications. To visualise CAP we expressed it as a GFP fusion. CAP-GFP localises to the apex of the parasite, as previously shown, but also to the cytoplasm of intracellular tachyzoites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). We additionally demonstrated this dual localisation of CAP by C-terminally tagging the endogenous CAP locus with a HA epitope tag (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). To rule out any mis-localisation of the protein as a result of tagging, we expressed recombinant <italic>T. gondii</italic> CAP, spanning residues 37 to 203, and generated antibodies against CAP which confirmed the dual localisation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). Western blot analysis of parasite lysates revealed the presence of two bands close to the expected size of CAP, which are expressed at a constant level, relative to the <italic>Toxoplasma</italic> loading control, across the first 24 hr following host cell invasion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). The dual localisation of CAP could be due to the expression of two isoforms from a single gene, through use of alternate translational start sites, as previously observed for protein kinase G (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Brown et al., 2017</xref>). Indeed, sequence comparison of <italic>T. gondii</italic> CAP to <italic>P. falciparum</italic> CAP reveals a second in-frame methionine at position 37 in <italic>Toxoplasma</italic> that aligns with the <italic>P. falciparum</italic> CAP start methionine (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Two additional methionine residues, M71 and M161, are present in the CAP primary sequence. However, these are unlikely used as translational start sites as their products would lead to a truncated and potentially inactive CARP domain.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.50598.002</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Alternative translational start sites lead to the generation of two different CAP isoforms.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Sequence alignment of the first 57 amino acid residues of <italic>T. gondii</italic> CAP with that of other Apicomplexa.

Consensus translation initiation sequences have been determined for many different organisms and are known as the Kozak sequence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Nakagawa et al., 2008</xref>). In <italic>Toxoplasma</italic>, the Kozak sequence was elucidated by identifying nucleotides commonly found in the 26 genes assessed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Seeber, 1997</xref>). This Kozak sequence contains an adenine at the −3 position, relative to the start ATG, which was identified as the most important factor in ribosomal recognition of the start ATG (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Seeber, 1997</xref>). Absence of an adenine can result in ribosome ‘leaky scanning’ and translation from an internal ATG. We therefore analysed the translation initiation sequence around CAP’s first (M1) and second (M37) putative translational start sites. The M1 translation initiation sequence conforms less with the <italic>Toxoplasma</italic> Kozak sequence than the sequence preceding M37; as the former is lacking an adenine at the −3 position (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). This suggested that alternative translation could lead to the generation of two CAP isoforms: longCAP, which is translated from the first start ATG, and shortCAP, which is translated from the second start ATG. To test this, we generated parasite strains that expressed either the WT sequence or variants where either the first (M1), or the second methionine (M37) of CAP was mutated to leucine, precluding their use as translational start sites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>). We used the endogenous promotor (i.e. 969 bp upstream of the first start ATG) and introduced the C-terminal HA-tagged CAP variants into the <italic>UPRT</italic> locus of the RH DiCre∆<italic>ku80</italic>∆<italic>hxgprt</italic> parasite strain. To determine whether longCAP and shortCAP show differential localisation, as predicted by the presence of putative palmitoylation sites in longCAP, we analysed their subcellular localisation using the HA-tag. While WT CAP parasites showed the expected dual localisation, mutants expressing shortCAP showed exclusively cytoplasmic staining while those expressing longCAP showed predominantly apical staining, with some further signal throughout the parasite (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>). As longCAP contains two putative palmitoylation sites not present in the shortCAP sequence, we next evaluated whether palmitoylation was important for the apical localisation of the long CAP isoform. We mutated the two cysteines in the N-terminus to alanine residues (CAP_C6,8A). CAP_C6,8A appeared cytosolic with no detectable accumulation of CAP at the apical end of the parasites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>). Western blot analysis of the HA-tagged CAP variants confirmed that WT CAP is identified as two distinct protein bands, which correlate with the predicted size for longCAP and shortCAP (23.9 and 20 kDa). Parasites expressing shortCAP displayed only the lower molecular weight band, while longCAP-expressing parasites only showed the higher molecular weight band. We observed that the protein levels of longCAP appear reduced compared to its isoform in parasites expressing WT CAP, whereas the shortCAP isoform shows an increase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1H</xref>). As expected, despite CAP_C6,8A not being detected at the apical end of the parasite, both isoforms were detected by Western blot at levels comparable to parasites expressing WT CAP. Collectively, these results show that in <italic>Toxoplasma</italic>, and potentially closely related coccidian parasites of <italic>Hammondia</italic> and <italic>Neospora</italic>, CAP is produced as two differentially localised isoforms using alternative translational start sites and the apical localisation of the long isoform is likely palmitoylation dependent.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Generation of a more stable RH DiCre ∆<italic>ku80</italic> cell line</title><p>While attempting to generate a conditional knock out (cKO) of CAP using the DiCre strategy, we observed a frequent loss of one of the DiCre subunits, resulting in dysfunctional floxed CAP parasite strains that lacked the ability to excise CAP. This is possibly because both DiCre subunits are driven by identical 5’ and 3’ UTRs, allowing for potential recombination in the ∆<italic>ku80</italic> parental line, which possesses an increased efficiency of homologous recombination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Fox et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Huynh and Carruthers, 2009</xref>). To prevent loss of DiCre subunits, we generated a new DiCre construct, DiCre_T2A, that expresses the two DiCre subunits from a single promotor using T2A skip peptides (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Kim et al., 2011</xref>). To further minimise the potential for loss of DiCre, we placed a chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) selectable marker between the two subunits (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). This would lead to the production of the two separate Cre subunits and the CAT selectable marker. We inserted this construct, into the modified <italic>KU80</italic> locus of the RH ∆<italic>ku80</italic>∆<italic>hxgprt</italic> strain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Huynh and Carruthers, 2009</xref>) using CRISPR/Cas9. To test whether expression of the DiCre subunits in the resulting line, RH DiCre_T2A ∆<italic>ku80</italic>∆<italic>hxgprt</italic>, is stable over time, we integrated the loxP-KillerRed-loxP-YFP reporter construct used in Andenmatten et al., into the <italic>UPRT</italic> locus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Andenmatten et al., 2013</xref>). As expected, non-treated parasites express KillerRed which, upon RAP treatment, is excised and leads to expression of YFP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). As extracellular stress can lead to increased loss of DiCre activity in the original DiCre line (M. Meissner, personal communication, 02.2019), we subjected the new DiCre parasite line (RH DiCre_T2A ∆<italic>ku80</italic>∆<italic>hxgprt</italic>) to frequent extracellular stress over the course of 65 days. On average, parasites were passaged every 2.3 days, leaving parasites extracellular for ~32 hr in the presence or absence of continuous chloramphenicol selection. We also simultaneously passaged the original DiCre line (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Andenmatten et al., 2013</xref>) under standard, non-stressing, culturing conditions. The new DiCre_T2A line excision efficiency varied between 98% and 99% for replicates on day 1 and was maintained throughout the experiment with a maximal loss of 3% of excision efficiency, irrespective of the presence or absence of chloramphenicol selection, by day 65 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). In contrast, the original DiCre line, cultured under standard non-stress conditions, lost 42% of excision capacity by day 65 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>), although this was only done as a single replicate.

Complementation with single isoforms shows that initiation of motility can be largely rescued by either CAP isoform and, once motile, either can maintain speed and track length.</p><p>As invasion and egress of host cells rely on active motility, we next compared invasion efficiency of ∆CAP and the different complementation lines. ∆CAP showed a reduction of invasion capacity (50.2% reduction compared to the WT complemented line), which was restored by both the short and long isoforms (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>). We also performed egress assays in the presence of 5-Benzyl-3-isopropyl-1H-pyrazolo[4,3-d]pyrimidin-7(6H)-one (BIPPO). BIPPO is a phosphodiesterase inhibitor which results in a strong calcium response in <italic>Toxoplasma</italic> parasites leading to cell motility and synchronised, rapid egress from host cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Howard et al., 2015</xref>). ∆CAP parasites showed a substantial delay in egress from host cells at 30 s after induction (73.1% less egress in ∆CAP compared to ∆CAP<sup>CAP</sup>), while at 2 min the majority of parasites have egressed (10.6% less egress in ∆CAP compared to ∆CAP<sup>CAP</sup>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>). This defect was fully restored in ∆CAP<sup>shortCAP</sup> parasites, while ∆CAP<sup>longCAP</sup> showed slightly lower levels of egress after 30 s of treatment but by 60 s were indistinguishable from WT or short CAP complemented lines.

Both the mean run length and the mean velocity were significantly increased in ∆CAP (34.8% and 52.9%, respectively), but not in either of the complements.

This has been established by photobleaching of individual parasites in a vacuole, which express a fluorescent reporter protein.

We chose vacuoles that contained eight parasites/vacuole as at this stage parasites organise in rosettes and individual cells can be easily monitored. We bleached one parasite in the vacuole and recorded both the recovery of fluorescence in the bleached parasite and the fluorescence levels of all other parasites in the vacuole. As expected, the WT-complemented ∆CAP<sup>CAP</sup> photobleached parasites display rapid recovery of fluorescence to which, in most cases, all parasites in the vacuole appear to contribute (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5Bi and C</xref> and <xref ref-type="video" rid="video5">Video 5</xref>). Conversely, ∆CAP photobleached parasites were supported in their rapid fluorescence recovery predominantly by just one other parasite, usually the parasite closest to the bleached cell, resulting in slow recovery (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5Bii and C</xref> and <xref ref-type="video" rid="video6">Video 6</xref>).

However, in addition to the residual body, an intravacuolar network (IVN) of tubule-like structures is present in the parasitophorous vacuole. Because of its tubular structure, it could also be involved in cell-cell communication. To determine whether the observed defect in the RTORP was dependent on the presence of the IVN, we performed a FRAP assay in RH ∆<italic>ku80</italic>∆<italic>gra2</italic> parasites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Rommereim et al., 2016</xref>) where the IVN fails to form but parasites still organise in rosettes.

These experiments revealed that if ∆CAP<sup>longCAP</sup> parasites rosette, they show normal RTORP between all cells in the vacuole, while non-rosetting parasites display the same defect as the ∆CAP line, with fluorescence recovery from only one other parasite in the vacuole (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>). Interestingly, ∆<italic>gra2</italic> vacuoles showed a slight increase in the frequency of photobleach recovery from multiple parasites, but we have not further investigated this phenomenon here. The connectivity of parasites was also assessed based on the percentage of recovery after photobleaching. As expected, ∆CAP and non-rosetting ∆CAP<sup>longCAP</sup> photobleached parasites recovered significantly less fluorescence than their rosetting counterparts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>).</p><p>Next, we sequentially photobleached individual ∆CAP parasites in a vacuole and identified which parasites appear to be physically connected based on the transfer of mCherry (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>). This revealed that only parasite pairs in close proximity are rapidly communicating. Collectively the results show that CAP deletion leads to a loss of both rosetting and the rapid transfer of reporter proteins between more than two parasites.

To determine whether ∆CAP parasites display phenotypes previously observed for mutants with defective cell-cell communication, we used IMC3 antibodies to visualise synchronicity of forming daughter cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>). At 20 hr post-infection, in the complete absence of rosettes, ∆CAP vacuoles exhibited synchronous division with no significant difference to the WT complemented line (98.3% and 99.6% synchronous division, respectively). (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>). At 24 hr and 30 hr post-infection, synchronous division was reduced to 93.4% and 87.8%, respectively, in the ∆CAP line (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>). IMC3 staining was also used to assess daughter cell orientation. While in WT CAP complemented parasites 94.6% of daughter cells grew in the same orientation, a significant defect was observed in ∆CAP and ∆CAP<sup>longCAP</sup> strains; only 42.9% (∆CAP) and 67.7% (∆CAP<sup>longCAP</sup>) of daughter cells orientated in the same direction. ∆CAP<sup>shortCAP</sup> parasites were able to largely overcome this defect, with 89.5% of daughter cells growing in the same orientation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>).

Given CAP’s hypothesised actin regulatory function, as well as its importance in forming a centralised residual body, we sought to determine whether CAP is playing a role in regulating these F-actin structures. For live visualisation of F-actin, we utilised a line expressing an emerald fluorescent protein fused to F-actin chromobodies (Cb-EmFP) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Periz et al., 2017</xref>).

To visualise F-actin and potentially correlate this to the tubular residual body connections between parasites, we performed CLEM experiments with the chromobody expressing ∆CAP line using serial block face scanning electron microscopy (SBF SEM). In the vacuole we identified regions with a strong chromobody signal and others with much weaker, or no detectable, chromobody signals (indicated by magenta arrowheads) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9Ai</xref>). Using the EM images, we followed the tubular connections in the vacuole and overlaid the chromobody signal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9Aii and iii</xref>). This analysis showed that the accumulation of chromobody in the vacuole is found within regions of the tubular connections between parasites. Interestingly, tubular connections with strong chromobody accumulation appeared morphologically distinct from the other parts of the tubular connections with lower or undetectable chromobody signal. Close examination of tubules with low chromobody signal revealed that they contain membranous structures within the tubule lumen (magenta 3D model and arrows) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9Biii and iv</xref>). These membranous structures are reminiscent of those seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7E</xref> for ∆CAP parasites not expressing the chromobody.

Collectively these results show that the chromobody, and by extension F-actin, is found in most if not all tubular connections, although of varying intensity. It is worth noting that in this particular vacuole, all parasites appear to be synchronised in their division and the daughter cells are not uniformly orientated.

This raises the question about the evolutionary roles of the two different isoforms. To better discriminate the functions of the short and longCAP isoforms, we wanted to examine their respective roles in natural infections, where parasites encounter a number of additional stresses, including shear stress and the immune system. Accordingly, we addressed the essentiality of CAP and its isoforms in mouse infections. We hypothesised that if both isoforms are essential for parasite survival in a natural host, loss of either of the two isoforms would manifest in a fitness cost. First, we injected male C57BL/6 mice with ~25 ∆CAP or ∆CAP<sup>CAP</sup> tachyzoites of the virulent RH strain, and monitored them over the course of 12 days. In both instances mice began to succumb to infection after 9 days, indicating that, despite the motility and rosetting phenotypes, CAP depletion in a type I RH background still results in high virulence in mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10A</xref>). As RH parasites have frequently been associated with hypervirulence and do not form cysts in vivo, we next generated ∆CAP parasites and complemented versions in the type II Pru strain. In stark contrast to the RH line, upon injection of ~50,000 tachyzoites, Pru ∆CAP parasites showed no virulence in mice while the Pru ∆CAP<sup>CAP</sup>, Pru ∆CAP<sup>shortCAP</sup>, and Pru ∆CAP<sup>longCAP</sup> complemented parasites led to a lethal infection, with most mice succumbing to the parasites 8–10 days post-infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10B</xref>). These data show that expression of either individual isoform is sufficient to cause a lethal infection. Next, to look at formation of tissue cysts, which leads to a chronic infection, we injected a lower dose of ~5000 tachyzoites of the Pru lines into mice. The majority of mice survived until day 32 post-infection, although 2 ∆CAP<sup>CAP</sup>-infected mice and 1 ∆CAP<sup>shortCAP</sup>-infected mouse died before reaching this end-point. At day 32, the mice were sacrificed, brain samples were collected and serum tested for anti-<italic>Toxoplasma</italic> antibodies, confirming that all mice were successfully infected with <italic>Toxoplasma</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10C</xref>). Both the Pru ∆CAP and Pru ∆CAP<sup>longCAP</sup> infections demonstrated considerably lower cyst loads compared to Pru ∆CAP<sup>CAP</sup> and Pru ∆CAP<sup>shortCAP</sup> infected mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10D</xref>). These results show that CAP plays an essential role in the virulence of the type II Pru parasite strain, but not the type I RH strain. Moreover, while the short CAP isoform is able to fulfil all functions of CAP in cell culture and in the mouse model, the long isoform, despite its ability to complement most phenotypes to at least ~50% of WT complement levels, has a significant defect in establishing a chronic infection at the infectious dose used here.</p><fig id="fig10" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.50598.034</object-id><label>Figure 10.</label><caption><title>CAP is essential for virulence in type II but not type I parasites.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Survival rates of C57BL/6 mice infected with ~25 RH ∆CAP<sup>CAP</sup> or RH ∆CAP parasites.

Despite the key role of actin in parasite biology, our understanding of actin dynamics and its regulation remains incomplete. CAP is a ubiquitous protein with a conserved role in regulating actin dynamics. In this study, we have established that <italic>Toxoplasma</italic> CAP, while dispensable for growth in cell culture, plays an important role in a range of actin-dependent processes. CAP is expressed by an alternative translation initiation site, giving rise to two independent isoforms: shortCAP and longCAP. Through sequence alignment we identified that the alternate translation initiation site is conserved only within <italic>Toxoplasma, Neospora and Hammondia</italic>. These are all members of the Toxoplasmatinae, a subfamily of the Apicomplexa phylum, suggesting that while CAP is present in all apicomplexa, the long isoform is specific to <italic>Toxoplasma</italic> and its closest relatives.</p><p>Here we investigated the role of CAP and both CAP isoforms in the <italic>Toxoplasma</italic> lytic cycle. Through in vitro competition assays, we show that complementation with shortCAP is enough to overcome the majority (87.6%), but not all, of the growth defect associated with CAP depletion. This suggests that longCAP is performing a specific function important for parasite fitness, which shortCAP is unable to compensate for. Furthermore, longCAP complementation restored 56.9% of the growth defect, arguing for a degree of functional overlap between the two isoforms. Our experiments have not uncovered a phenotype that only longCAP can rescue, which would have revealed a unique function. Its apical localisation, however, makes it tempting to speculate a function in actin regulation during invasion, which is a phenotype it can fully rescue. It could be that higher actin turnover is required at the apex. The concentration of longCAP at the apex could fulfil this need by influencing G-actin levels required for Formin one dependent actin dynamics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Tosetti et al., 2019</xref>). Indeed, it has previously been hypothesised in other organisms that increased local concentration of CAP results in the sequestration of actin monomers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Ono, 2013</xref>). However, providing evidence for this hypothesis is limited by the fact that the shortCAP isoform can rescue all phenotypes in cell culture under the conditions tested. Given that cell culture assays do not fully represent the environment <italic>Toxoplasma</italic> normally encounters, we aimed to tease apart the functions of the two isoforms in mice. Surprisingly, even here the short isoform appears able to compensate for the lack of longCAP. This suggests that even under conditions encountered in the natural host, the longCAP isoform plays only a minor role, although dosage effects or routes of infection may well be confounding factors when assessing virulence of the different strains. We cannot rule out that the differences in proteins levels of longCAP and shortCAP in the single isoform producing lines are affecting the phenotypic observations. However, both isoforms are able to rescue most phenotypes despite longCAP being expressed at lower levels than the parental strain, indicating that the protein levels do not appear to substantially affect CAP function.</p><p>Through use of the actin chromobody-expressing line, we show a link between CAP and F-actin. CAP deletion not only results in loss of an actin polymerisation centre but also the appearance of extensive actin filaments within the parasitophorous vacuole. Furthermore, CAP depletion led to loss of the juxtanuclear actin polymerisation centre but, interestingly, had no impact on apicoplast segregation which occurs in the same region. This is somewhat of an unexpected result given the actin-dependent nature of apicoplast segregation, along with the previous published results that both Formin two and ADF mutants display a loss of the juxtanuclear actin centre and defects in apicoplast segregation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Jacot et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Rosario et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Stortz et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Tosetti et al., 2019</xref>). An explanation for efficient apicoplast inheritance in the ∆CAP line, despite loss of the visible actin polymerisation centre, could be that F-actin dynamics are not completely abrogated. It is likely that Formin 2-mediated actin nucleation is still occurring in this region and is sufficient to ensure apicoplast segregation. Similar to Formin two depletion, Cb-EmFP ∆CAP parasites show loss of the juxtanuclear actin polymerisation centre and abnormal daughter cell orientation. In summary, this data suggests that the juxtanuclear actin polymerisation centre is not required for apicoplast inheritance, but may be required for the positioning of daughter cells during their formation.</p><p>One of the most pronounced phenotypes of CAP deletion is loss of rosetting: the highly symmetrical physical distribution of parasites within the vacuole. Previous studies on actin, myosin I, myosin J, ADF and Formin three have suggested that the actomyosin motor is important for rosetting (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Frénal et al., 2017a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Haase et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Periz et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Tosetti et al., 2019</xref>). Our ∆CAP data further supports this hypothesis. Interestingly, complementing ∆CAP parasites with longCAP restored rosetting in just under half of all vacuoles, with the remainder appearing as equally disordered as the ∆CAP vacuoles. Despite this mixed population, we did not observe vacuoles with a combination of organised and disorganised parasites, suggesting rosetting is a binary outcome; either all parasites in a vacuole are connected by a central residual body, or not. This may suggest that the ability to produce highly organised rosettes is established during the first round of cell division when the residual body forms. This mixed population of rosetting and non-rosetting parasites, in an isogenic strain, gave us a unique opportunity to determine whether rosetting is important for efficient intravacuolar cell-cell communication. Using longCAP complemented parasites, we show that in rosetting vacuoles there is efficient RTORP with all parasites able to transfer material to the bleached parasite. Within the same clonal population, non-rosetting vacuoles displayed severe defects in the RTORP with parasites seemingly only communicating in pairs. This strongly suggests that highly organised parasite rosetting within the parasitophorous vacuole is important for rapid material transfer between cells. The majority of rosetting ∆CAP<sup>longCAP</sup> parasites do not contain the juxtanuclear actin polymerisation centre, suggesting this actin accumulation is not required for rosetting, as previously observed for Formin two depleted parasites. Furthermore, most ∆CAP parasites in the vacuole remained synchronised in their stage of replication (89–93%) at various timepoints (24–30 hr). This is different to other studies where mutants with defects in rosetting and RTORP between parasites show only 25–75% of synchronicity at various timepoints (24–30 hr) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Frénal et al., 2017b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Tosetti et al., 2019</xref>). Our results therefore indicate that neither RTORP between daughter cells nor the formation of a rosette are predictors for synchronicity of division.</p><p>The largely synchronous division in ∆CAP parasites could be explained by our CLEM results. Despite their disorganised appearance and loss of rapid cell-cell communication, ∆CAP parasites are still connected by a decentralised residual body. This connection, although not facilitating rapid transfer of proteins between parasites that are further apart, could allow for slow or minimal transfer of proteins which is sufficient to synchronise divisions. An alternative hypothesis could be that metabolites, not proteins, are required to synchronise divisions, and their diffusion through the decentralised residual body is quicker. Whatever the basis for synchronicity is, rosetting and rapid cell-cell communication are not essential and their analysis cannot be reliably used to predict whether connections between parasites exist. At 30 hr post-infection, when the number of parasites in the vacuole has further increased, 11% of ∆CAP parasites divide in asynchrony. Whether this is due to connections between parasites being severed/lost, or if it’s a consequence of the increased distance between parasites is not known. The differing rates of synchronous division in mutants that affect rosetting may be explained by their ability to sustain connections through several rounds of division. It is a possibility that F-actin maintains tubular connections throughout divisions. To test this, other mutants with rosetting phenotypes would need to be assessed for their connectivity. In the non-chromobody expressing ∆CAP lines, we observed a continuous membranous structure within the tubules connecting all parasites. We speculate that this may be the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). However, In the Cb-EmFP ∆CAP line, membranous structures were only observed in residual body tubules with low or undetectable levels of chromobody signal. In contrast, tubules with high levels of chromobody expression did not contain any membranous structures. As we imaged only single vacuoles for the chromobody and non-chromobody expressing ∆CAP lines, we cannot be certain whether the chromobody may affect tubular content or whether this is natural variation between cells. As all parasites in the chromobody expressing vacuole appear to divide in synchronicity, it is unlikely that the ER-like structure contributes to exchange of material.</p><p>The modest phenotypic defect associated with the loss of a highly conserved actin regulator in cell culture prompted us to investigate CAP function in animal infections. Despite being dispensable for type I RH parasite virulence, CAP is essential for type II Pru parasite virulence in mice, and complementation with either shortCAP or longCAP restored lethality. At lower non-lethal doses, longCAP complementation led to markedly reduced cyst formation in the brain. The underlying basis for this has not been explored here and it could be that it is the reduced fitness of the strain, rather than stage conversion phenotype, that causes a reduction of parasites reaching the brain and forming cysts.</p><p>In summary, our results support a biologically important role for CAP in <italic>Toxoplasma</italic>, potentially through its predicted function in regulating the monomeric actin pool. Interestingly, actin dependent processes were affected to differing extents in ∆CAP parasites, such as rosetting being completely lost while apicoplast inheritance was unaffected. This surely reflects the different spatial requirements for actin turnover within a cell. It is likely that the local concentration of actin, actin binding proteins such as the formins and the different myosins facilitate this. It is interesting to note here that CAP deletion led to only partial overlapping phenotypes with the formins, indicating that the interplay of CAP and the different formin proteins is complex. The results obtained here raise a few questions that will be interesting to study in the future. How does actin help to initiate and maintain the centralised residual body? How are ER connections between parasites in a decentralised residual body maintained and what is the function of this connection? What is the functional role of longCAP with its concentration at the apex of the parasite? Why are some actin dependent processes completely reliant on CAP while others are not? Why does loss of CAP appear to prevent F-actin formation in the juxtanuclear region of the cytosol and appear to increase F-actin formation in the residual body? This suggests that CAP might have different mechanisms of action dependent on its association with other actin binding proteins at different cellular locations. Each of these questions will require careful analysis and the cell lines described here will likely provide useful tools to investigate these in the future.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Plasmid construction</title><p>All primers used in this study are listed in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>.

The coverslips were immediately used for imaging. The acquisitions were made with an Olympus IX71 coupled to a DELTAVISION Elite imaging system in a 37°C environmental chamber. The acquisition for each condition were made sequentially from the washing step to the acquisition with a random order to avoid any artifactual data. The acquisition analysis was made with Fiji and the MTrackJ plugin. The data represent three independent experiments. At least 42 parasites and 273 direct runs were counted per strain. The results were statistically tested with a one-way ANOVA test plus a multiple comparison Dunnett’s test comparing all means to the ΔCAP<sup>CAP</sup> mean in GraphPad Prism 7. The data presented are as mean ± s.d.</p></sec><sec id="s4-19"><title>FRAP</title><p>Parasites were inoculated on a confluent layer of HFFs 20 hr before experiments were performed using a Zeiss LSM-780 inverted confocal laser scanning microscope at 37°C. Acquisition and processing were performed with the Zeiss Zen Black software. Images were taken for 2 min (one image per second). Three pre-bleach images were recorded before the region of interest was photobleached ten times with a 561 nm laser at 100% power. Fluorescence intensity is presented as a percentage relative to the same area pre-bleach. These normalised intensity values were also used for the calculations below. To calculate percentage of fluorescence recovery, the final reading (116 s post-bleach) was subtracted from the reading immediately post-bleach, t = 3 s, to give percentage recovery after 116 s. To calculate percentage loss of fluorescence, the reading immediately post-bleach, t = 3 s, was subtracted from the final reading (116 s post-bleach) to give percentage loss after 116 s. These percentages were used to generate the heat map. At least 11 vacuoles were counted per strain across at least two independent experiments. The results were statistically tested with a one-way ANOVA test plus a multiple comparison Dunnett’s test comparing all means to the ΔCAP<sup>CAP</sup> mean in GraphPad Prism 7. The data presented are as mean ± s.d. To assess recovery type, at least 11 vacuoles were counted per strain across at least two independent experiments. The results were statistically tested with a Chi-square in GraphPad Prism 7.</p></sec><sec id="s4-20"><title>Tape unroofing SEM</title><p>Parasites were inoculated on a confluent HFF monolayer 24 hr before fixation in EM fixative (2.5% gluteraldehyde, 4% formaldehyde in 0.1 M phosphate buffer) for 30 min. Cells were washed in 0.1 M phosphate buffer (PB) and stored in 1% formaldehyde in PB at 4°C. Cells were then washed in PB at room temperature, then washed in ddH<sub>2</sub>O at RT. The cells were dehydrated stepwise from 70% to 100% ethanol before critical point drying from acetone in a CPD300 (Leica Microsystems, Vienna, Austria). After drying, the coverslips were mounted on stubs, and the HFF cells were unroofed by placing Scotch tape on the coverslips and gently peeling it off, exposing the host cytoplasm and the parasitophorous vacuoles. The cells were coated with 7 nm platinum in a Q150R Sputter Coater (Quorum Tech, East Sussex, UK) before viewing in a Phenom ProX SEM (Thermo Scientific) at 10 kV, 1024 × 1024 pixel frame, on ‘high’ quality.</p></sec><sec id="s4-21"><title>FIB SEM</title><p>Immediately following FRAP experimentation, as described above, parasites were fixed in 4% formaldehyde for 15 min at 37°C before washing in 0.1 M PB. Cells were then fixed in EM fixative (2.5% gluteraldehyde, 4% formaldehyde in 0.1 M PB) for 30 min at room temperature. Cells were washed in 0.1 M PB and stored in 1% formaldehyde in 0.1 M PB. After fixation, samples were transferred to a Pelco BioWave Pro+ microwave (Ted Pella) for processing using a protocol adapted from the NCMIR protocol (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Deerinck et al., 2010</xref>). See <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp3">Supplementary file 3</xref> for full BioWave program details. The SteadyTemp plate was set to 21°C unless otherwise indicated. Each step was performed in the microwave, except for the buffer and ddH<sub>2</sub>O wash steps, which consisted of two washes on the bench and two washes in the microwave (250 W for 40 s). The cells were washed (as above) in 0.1 M PB, stained with 2% osmium tetroxide and 1.5% potassium ferricyanide (v/v) for 14 min under vacuum (with/without 100 W power at 2 min intervals), and then washed in ddH<sub>2</sub>O (as above). Next, the cells were incubated in 1% thiocarbohydrazide in ddH<sub>2</sub>O (w/v) (14 min,vacuum, 100 W on/off at 2 min intervals) with SteadyTemp plate set to 40°C, followed by ddH<sub>2</sub>O washes (as above), and then a further stain with 2% osmium tetroxide in ddH<sub>2</sub>O (w/v) (14 min,vacuum, 100 W on/off at 2 min intervals), followed by ddH<sub>2</sub>O washes (as above). The cells were then incubated in 1% aqueous uranyl acetate (vacuum, 100 W on/off at 2 min intervals, SteadyTemp 40°C), and then washed in ddH<sub>2</sub>O (as above, except with SteadyTemp at 40°C). Walton's lead aspartate was then applied (vacuum, 100 W on/off at 2 min intervals, SteadyTemp 50°C), and the cells were washed (as above) and dehydrated in a graded ethanol series (70%, 90%, and 100%, twice each), at 250 W for 40 s without vacuum. Exchange into Durcupan ACM resin (Sigma-Aldrich, Missouri, United States) was performed in 50% resin in ethanol, at 250 W for 3 min, with vacuum cycling (on/off at 30 s intervals), and then pure Durcupan was infiltrated in four microwave steps with the same settings, before embedding at 60°C for 48 hr.</p><p>Focused ion beam scanning electron microscopy (FIB SEM) data was collected using a Crossbeam 540 FIB SEM with Atlas 5 for 3-dimensional tomography acquisition (Zeiss). Segments of the cell monolayer containing the cells of interest were trimmed, polished with a diamond knife (removing uneven resin at the base of the monolayer to provide a flat surface for tracking marks), mounted on a standard 12.7 mm SEM stub using conductive epoxy (ITW Chemtronics), and coated with a 5 nm layer of platinum.</p><p>The specific cells of interest were relocated by imaging through the platinum coating at an accelerating voltage of 20 kV and correlating to previously acquired fluorescence microscopy images. After preparation for milling and tracking, images were acquired at 5 nm isotropic resolution throughout each region of interest, using a 10 µs dwell time. During acquisition the SEM was operated at an accelerating voltage of 1.5 kV with 1 nA current. The EsB detector was used with a grid voltage of 1,200 V. Ion beam milling was performed at an accelerating voltage of 30 kV and current of 700 pA.</p><p>After cropping to the specific region of interest comprising the entire extent of the parasitophorous vacuole (∆CAP<sup>CAP</sup>; 3080 × 634×2509 pixels; 15.4 × 3.17 × 12.545 µm; ∆CAP; 4065 × 1136×4490 pixels; 20.325 × 5.68 × 22.45 µm) and aligning the dataset (gradient align; Atlas 5), the images were processed to supress noise and slightly enhance sharpness (gaussian blur 0.75 radius, followed by unsharp mask radius 1, strength 0.6; Fiji) prior to reorienting and reslicing in the YZ plane (assigned as the XY plane for segmentation), and scaling to 10 nm isotropic resolution for segmentation and display.</p><p>Selected structures were segmented manually from the FIB SEM datasets and 3D reconstructions were made using the 3dmod program of IMOD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Kremer et al., 1996</xref>). The normal and decentralised residual body structures were manually skeletonised by tracing the approximate central axis of the structure from the posterior pore of each tachyzoite using open contours. Thus, the green skeleton follows the lumen of the connections between parasites. The minimum number of points were placed that would still ensure the contour remained at the central axis of the volume. Where the structure branched, points linking contours from multiple extensions were placed at the approximate centre of the branch point volume. The contours were then rendered as a 50 or 100 nm tube to aid visualisation (tube diameter chosen depending on view). This model was then inspected in the X, Y, and Z-planes and corrections made to ensure the skeleton followed the approximate centre through the volume. Since not all RB-like structure extensions ended at the posterior pole of a tachyzoite, the posterior poles were highlighted by segmenting them with open contours with points at every 40 nm in Z, following the edge of the cytosol (the ribosome-containing electron lucent space where it meets the intermediate electron density surrounding the inner membrane complex), and meshing the contour as a 50 nm tube. A selected region of the putative ER lipid bilayer outer leaflet was segmented with closed contours drawn every 5–20 nm in Z (smaller Z intervals where needed to capture fenestrations/complexity); from an approximately square region around the inner face of two of the basal pores up to an arbitrary point along the decentralised residual body structure. Contour gaps were placed at the edge of this region. Two tachyzoites were also highlighted by partial coarse segmentation; closed contours drawn every 250 nm in Z through the main body of the cell (segmentation of the complex top and bottom of the tachyzoites was omitted for clarity).</p></sec><sec id="s4-22"><title>SFB SEM</title><p>Following fluorescence imaging, parasites were fixed and embedded in resin as described for FIB SEM. The area of interest was then trimmed, mounted, and approached for SBF SEM as described in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Russell et al. (2017)</xref>. SBF SEM images were collected using a 3View 2XP system (Gatan Inc) with charge compensation, mounted on a Sigma VP scanning electron microscope (Zeiss). Images were collected at 2.1 kV with a 30 μm aperture at high vacuum with a progressive 50–65% gas charge compensation, and a 2 μs dwell time. The dataset was 32.12 × 32.12 × 3.4 μm in xyz, consisting of 68 serial images of 50 nm thickness and a pixel size of 7.8 × 7.8 nm. The total volume of the dataset was ∼3508 μm<sup>3</sup>.</p><p>Selected structures were segmented manually from the SBF SEM dataset and 3D reconstructions were made using the 3dmod program of IMOD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Kremer et al., 1996</xref>), essentially as for the FIB SEM datasets. Briefly, the approximate central axes of the decentralised residual body structures were manually skeletonised from the posterior pore of each tachyzoite using open contours and rendered as 100 nm tubes. These structures were segmented with reference to the chromobody fluorescence dataset rendered in three dimensions using the ClearVolume Fiji plugin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Royer et al., 2015</xref>); those tubes whose path in three dimensions resembled the path of strong green fluorescent signal were rendered as green 100 nm tubes, while magenta was used for tubes whose path followed areas of low green fluorescent signal or where fluorescence was undetectable. Posterior pores were segmented as for the FIB SEM datasets, except points were placed at 50 nm intervals in Z. Segmentation was done on unprocessed SBF SEM images, while figures were prepared after denoising SBF SEM images with a 0.5 sigma Gaussian blur in Fiji. Since both LM and EM datasets lacked point landmarks for correlative registration, orthogonal views of the datasets were coarsely registered by eye in Adobe Illustrator; the chromobody fluorescence was aligned with the decentralised residual body skeleton model by linear adjustments of size and position only (no rotation and non-linear alterations).</p></sec><sec id="s4-23"><title>Animals</title><p>C57BL/6 (wild type) mice were bred and housed under pathogen-free conditions in the biological research facility at the Francis Crick Institute in accordance with the Home Office UK Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act 1986.

The first decision letter after peer review is shown below.]</p><p>Thank you for submitting your work entitled &quot;Differential requirements of cyclase associated protein for actin turnover during the lytic cycle of <italic>Toxoplasma gondii</italic>&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and a Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Markus Meissner (Reviewer #1).</p><p>Our decision has been reached after consultation between the reviewers. Based on these discussions and the individual reviews below, we regret to inform you that your work will not be considered further for publication in <italic>eLife</italic> at the current time.</p><p>However, as you will see the reviewers each praised the high quality of the work and would be all happy to look at a revised manuscript. The consultation session found that it would be pertinent to perform the actin chromobody experiments to investigate directly the dynamics of actin in the parasite (suggested by reviewer 1 and 2 and reviewer 3 agreed). For other, in my view mostly doable, but of course time consuming suggestions please see the individual reviews appended below.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic></p><p>In the study Hunt et al., the authors perform a careful phenotypic characterisation of parasite mutants for the actin capping protein of the apicomplexan parasite <italic>Toxoplasma gondii</italic>, TgCAP. Using state of the art and cutting edge technologies the authors demonstrate that CAP is alternatively translated, localised and that it's deletion causes effects in parasite growth, probably caused by defects in host cell invasion and egress. Furthermore, deletion of CAP causes alteration of the residual body, a structure connecting parasites within the parasitophorous vacuole and consequently to inefficient parasite connectivity and material transfer. In contrast, other actin dependent processes, such as apicoplast segregation or dense granule motility appear to be not or only minimally affected in absence of CAP, leading the authors to speculate that CAP is only required in the regulation of certain actin-dependent processes.</p><p>The authors present a tour-de-force to analyse the phenotype caused by deletion of cap focussing on processes, previously described to be dependent on parasite actin and/or myosins. The variety of techniques, from FIB SEM, SEM, FRAP, mouse challenge, FACs, western blot and live 3D motility assay, gives a great overview of the phenotypic consequences caused by deletion of CAP. While this characterisation is very well performed, it does not directly demonstrate a role of CAP in F-Actin dynamics in the parasite. It is now possible to measure and visualise F-actin dynamics in apicomplexan parasites, which allowed to demonstrate the role of F-actin in material transfer (Periz et al., 2017) and the independent functions of apicomplexan Formins in F-actin nucleation (see Tosetti et al., 2019). While the interpretation of the authors is certainly likely, no direct functional data regarding the role of CAP for the regulation of F-actin dynamics is provided and the conclusions are drawn based on the phenotypes obtained for other F-actin regulatory proteins. Therefore, in their resubmission, the authors should directly analyse the role of CAP in F-actin dynamics.</p><p>1) This study is about a major actin modulating protein and does not look at actin dynamics directly. However, this is now possible using the F-actin nanobody and should be done. It would be of great interest, how short CAP, long CAP and ∆CAP influence actin dynamics during intracellular replication, egress, gliding motility and invasion.</p><p>2) The authors did not look at the dynamics of CAP during these processes, which would be relatively straight forward, given that parasites expressing GFP-tagged versions are already available.</p><p>Especially the dynamics of apically localized CAP would be interesting to analyse in more detail, since it might suggest an association with Formin1, whereas the cytoplasmic CAP might be more associated with Formin2/3. This might also reflect the different effects in the complementation assays.</p><p>This should at least be discussed in more detail in a resubmission.</p><p>3) The rosetting phenotype as well as the RTORP are very interesting findings. It is great to do CLEM on FRAP / FIB imaging, which to our knowledge is the first time this has been done in <italic>Toxoplasma</italic>. It is technically extremely challenging, as is indicated by the lack of statistical analysis for the FIB data. However, the discussion of the part of the analysis is a bit biased. One could immediately question if the correct time scale was analyzed for the FRAP analysis in those parasites lacking a central residual body. A long and tubular cytoplasmic bridge connecting two parasites might result in much longer diffusion times for cytoplasmic proteins. Also, as actin was not visualized, more prominent actin filaments (caused by deletion of CAP) within the tubular residual body might delay diffusion of mCherry.</p><p>Similar results as the FIB SEM could have been generated in a quantifiable manner by expressing the actin-binding chromobody (depending on the localization within the various CAP mutants) or a strong fluorescent reporter expressed at the plasma membrane.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>Actin plays a critical role in the lytic cycle of apicomplexan parasites, and is known to be important for motility, organelle inheritance, and cell-cell communication. This manuscript explores the role of the putative actin regulator cyclase-associated protein (TgCAP) in a variety of such actin-dependent processes. A methodological improvement introduced in this manuscript is the stable DiCre construct, which retains its excision capacity over long periods of time.</p><p>The authors provide evidence for two protein isoforms of TgCAP that arise from two translation start sites and result in a cytosolic short isoform and a long isoform that is apically localized through palmitoylation sties not present in the short isoform. While effects on a number of different processes are measured for TgCAP mutants, the authors never directly observe how or whether actin turnover is affected, nor do they explore how the distinct localizations contribute to the role of each isoform.</p><p>Previous studies (Frénal et al., 2017, Tosetti et al., 2019) have observed asynchronous division in parasites with defects in intravacuolar cell-cell communication, upon disruption of F-actin and a specific myosin. One contrasting finding in the current manuscript is that loss of TgCAP can decouple these two phenotypes: reporter proteins do not readily diffuse between parasites in the entire vacuole, yet cell division remains synchronous. As detailed below, more work is needed to determine whether the TgCAP phenotype is truly distinct from the previously reported phenotypes. However, based on the previous reports involving actin and myosin in intravacuolar contact/communication, and the lack of mechanistic information regarding TgCAP, the current study does not significantly advance our understanding of the role of actin in the <italic>Toxoplasma</italic> lytic cycle.</p><p>1) This manuscript focuses on phenotypic assessment of processes for which actin is important, but there are no direct observations of the effects of TgCAP on actin turnover, as is suggested in the title. This could be addressed by using modified actin-chromobodies, which have been employed to study actin dynamics in <italic>Toxoplasma</italic> (Periz et al., 2017), to visualize filamentous actin throughout the cells and networks of cells in the various TgCAP mutants.</p><p>2) In all the phenotypic assays, the short isoform of TgCAP is able to complement the knockout as well as or better than the long isoform of TgCAP. While the authors provide compelling evidence that the two isoforms have distinct cellular localizations, there is no clear evidence that the localization is playing a critical role. One explanation for the more severe defects in complementation observed with the long isoform is that it is expressed at substantially lower levels relative to the short isoform (Figure 3F), and that overall levels of TgCAP are critical for its function. A prediction of this would be that a palmitoylation mutant (C6,8A) that could only be expressed as the long isoform (M37L mutant) would be unable to rescue the phenotypes as well as the short isoform.</p><p>3) An important finding in this manuscript is that while TgCAP mutants have defects in protein diffusion between all parasites within a vacuole, they are still able to divide synchronously. Parasite division synchronicity assays presented in this manuscript are performed at 20 hours post infection. Frénal et al., showed increased severity in defects in synchronized division of myosin knockouts that occurred from 24 to 30 hours post infection. To ensure that the lack of synchronization defects observed in this manuscript is not simply due to earlier measurements, the authors should measure whether TgCAP mutants are still able to maintain synchronous divisions at these slightly later timepoints when there might be differences compared to wildtype.</p><p>4) If levels of TgCAP are important for function, it is important to understand how the levels in the complemented strains compare to wildtype cells. This can be measured using the TgCAP antibody presented in this manuscript.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic></p><p>You've asked me to read this manuscript from the point of view of an actin biologist.

Briefly, the authors demonstrate that depletion of CAP results in loss of the previously identified F-actin polymerization centre, close to the Golgi/apicoplast), while the intravacuolar network is still formed. Intriguingly, loss of F-actin polymerization close to the apicoplast does not result in a defect in apicoplast inheritance, as observed in case of a mutant for Formin-2 or the actin depolymerization factor ADF.</p><p>Based on these findings the authors speculate that F-actin polymerisation at/close to the apicoplast is not solely responsible for segregation of this organelle. However a detailed analysis of F-actin dynamics is still missing and the authors reach this conclusion based on differences in F-actin accumulation.</p><p>Therefore, another (potentially more plausible) interpretation is that in absence of FH-2 F-actin nucleation at the apicoplast is completely abrogated, while depletion of CAP leads to a significant reduction, but not abolishment of F-actin dynamics. This slower dynamics would still result in a thicker intravacuolar network, but could still be sufficient for segregation of the apicoplast. While it would be interesting to analyse and compare F-actin dynamics in these mutants in more detail, within this study, it is in my opinion sufficient to weaken the discussion accordingly (see below).</p><p>A major concern is the invasion assay employing Cb-EmeraldFP parasites. While the authors show convincingly that the junction is formed using the junctional marker Ron4 (Figure 8H), this is expected, since depletion of actin (or other components of the acto-myosin system) has no influence on junction formation (Whitelaw et al., 2017; Egarter et al., 2014).</p><p>However, the images provided in Figure 8G, indicating F-actin accumulation at the junction, are not convincing and the signal could well be due to a compression effect at the junction during invasion. Also, potential differences in F-actin accumulation at the junction need to be compared with WT parasites. Since this would be a longer endeavour and would not significantly add to the current study, this reviewer suggests to remove this set of data until a more convincing analysis has been performed.</p><p>In summary the authors addressed my major concerns. The study is a thorough phenotypic characterisation and the additional data presented demonstrate that CAP has indeed a function in F-actin dynamics and will open the door for future experiments.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>Speaking (again) as a worker on actin genetics, with a side interest in apicomplexan actin.</p><p>This paper now justifies the way it positions itself as an actin paper. Figure 8 in particular is clear and adds another chapter to the huge range of functions that actin seems to mediate. CAP is a bit of a mystery as it is; it is even more interesting as an unusually conserved molecule.</p><p>It is still overwhelmingly a parasite paper, and makes a demanding read for someone who's not soaked in the field; and I'll again have to leave it to the other reviewers to comment on whether the parasitology is sound.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic></p><p>In this work, Hunt et al. analyzed the function of the <italic>Toxoplasma</italic> cyclase-associated protein (CAP).

Using state of the art and cutting edge technologies the authors demonstrate that CAP is alternatively translated, localised and that it's deletion causes effects in parasite growth, probably caused by defects in host cell invasion and egress. Furthermore, deletion of CAP causes alteration of the residual body, a structure connecting parasites within the parasitophorous vacuole and consequently to inefficient parasite connectivity and material transfer. In contrast, other actin dependent processes, such as apicoplast segregation or dense granule motility appear to be not or only minimally affected in absence of CAP, leading the authors to speculate that CAP is only required in the regulation of certain actin-dependent processes.</p><p>The authors present a tour-de-force to analyse the phenotype caused by deletion of cap focussing on processes, previously described to be dependent on parasite actin and/or myosins. The variety of techniques, from FIB SEM, SEM, FRAP, mouse challenge, FACs, western blot and live 3D motility assay, gives a great overview of the phenotypic consequences caused by deletion of CAP. While this characterisation is very well performed, it does not directly demonstrate a role of CAP in F-Actin dynamics in the parasite. It is now possible to measure and visualise F-actin dynamics in apicomplexan parasites, which allowed to demonstrate the role of F-actin in material transfer (Periz et al., 2017) and the independent functions of apicomplexan Formins in F-actin nucleation (see Tosetti et al., 2019). While the interpretation of the authors is certainly likely, no direct functional data regarding the role of CAP for the regulation of F-actin dynamics is provided and the conclusions are drawn based on the phenotypes obtained for other F-actin regulatory proteins. Therefore, in their resubmission, the authors should directly analyse the role of CAP in F-actin dynamics.</p><p>1) This study is about a major actin modulating protein and does not look at actin dynamics directly. However, this is now possible using the F-actin nanobody and should be done. It would be of great interest, how short CAP, long CAP and ∆CAP influence actin dynamics during intracellular replication, egress, gliding motility and invasion.</p></disp-quote><p>To monitor F-actin using the chromobody we have deleted CAP in the chromobody-expressing line and complemented a clone with either WT, short or long CAP.</p><p>These experiments, now shown in Figure 8D and E, show a loss of the actin polymerisation centre in intracellular ∆CAP parasites that is rescued by short CAP, but only partially by long CAP. A second striking phenotype observed in CAP deficient intracellular parasites is the presence of extensive chromobody positive structures throughout the disorganised rosette, indicating actin filamentation. This is rescued by WT and short CAP, but not/only partially by long CAP in a rosette-dependent manner.</p><p>We also attempted to perform live invasion and egress videos with these parasite lines. While we could observe egress, and a modest amount of invasion events, with the WT CAP line, the combination of motility and egress phenotypes meant we only observed, despite many hours of microscopy time, only 3 successful invasion events for ∆CAP parasites. While these appeared to be slower than WT CAP, none were events captured from the very onset of invasion so timings could not be reported. We do recognise that analysis of the ∆CAP could contribute to our understanding of <italic>Toxoplasma</italic> invasion, especially in light of recent work which shows parasite nucleus entry into the host cell is a limiting step for which actin is an important player (Rosario et al., 2019 pre-print), however, we believe that doing so carefully for the mutant strains (and maybe more mutants as suggested by reviewer 2) are a huge undertaking and better suited for subsequent studies.</p><p>We were able to identify actin ring formation and presence of a MJ during invasion of ∆CAP parasites (Figure 8G). While the moving junction still appeared to form, CAP did not localise to the moving junction, suggesting that CAP is not required for moving junction formation. However, we cannot exclude that it is the turnover of actin at the moving junction that is important for successful invasion. Again, a very careful analysis of actin in CAP deletions and its variants during invasion would be required.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) The authors did not look at the dynamics of CAP during these processes, which would be relatively straight forward, given that parasites expressing GFP-tagged versions are already available.</p><p>Especially the dynamics of apically localized CAP would be interesting to analyse in more detail, since it might suggest an association with Formin1, whereas the cytoplasmic CAP might be more associated with Formin2/3. This might also reflect the different effects in the complementation assays.</p><p>This should at least be discussed in more detail in a resubmission.</p></disp-quote><p>We have not tried to image the GFP-tagged CAP version because the CAP-GFP line still has endogenous CAP so it is an over-expression. We know from <italic>Plasmodium</italic> that over-expressing CAP can have negative effects not seen in a KO (Sato et al., 2016). So it might not be worth doing experiments on a line that has not been carefully assessed for such effects.</p><p>However, to still answer this question we decided to use the HA-tagged CAP parasites (∆CAP, ∆CAP<sup>CAP</sup>, ∆CAP<sup>CAP</sup> and ∆CAP<sup>longCAP</sup>) and co-stain with RON4, that marks the moving junction. These assays show that CAP does not appear to localise to the moving junction and, in the absence of CAP, the moving junction still forms as shown by RON4 and the actin chromobody in invading parasites (Figure 8G and H).</p><p>The potential interplay of CAP with the Formins is now discussed further given that we see only partially overlapping phenotypes between CAP and these actin regulators.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) The rosetting phenotype as well as the RTORP are very interesting findings. It is great to do CLEM on FRAP / FIB imaging, which to our knowledge is the first time this has been done in Toxoplasma. It is technically extremely challenging, as is indicated by the lack of statistical analysis for the FIB data. However, the discussion of the part of the analysis is a bit biased. One could immediately question if the correct time scale was analyzed for the FRAP analysis in those parasites lacking a central residual body. A long and tubular cytoplasmic bridge connecting two parasites might result in much longer diffusion times for cytoplasmic proteins.</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewer is correct that these experiments are very time consuming and technically challenging and we were aware that we could not exclude slow transfer of proteins between parasites, which we have discussed in the manuscript (see quote below from our Discussion). We have previously attempted to visualize photobleached parasites over longer periods of time, however, we see substantial drift of parasites, which makes quantification on individual ROIs very difficult. We therefore decided not to include these data in the original manuscript. We have not been able to improve the drift issues. This prevents analysis of slower diffusion leading us to report only rapid protein transfer differences.</p><p>From our Discussion:</p><p>“This connection, although not facilitating rapid transfer of proteins between parasites that are further apart, could allow for slow or minimal transfer of proteins which is sufficient to synchronise divisions. An alternative hypothesis could be that metabolites, not proteins, are required to synchronise divisions, and their diffusion through the decentralised residual body is quicker.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Also, as actin was not visualized, more prominent actin filaments (caused by deletion of CAP) within the tubular residual body might delay diffusion of mCherry.</p></disp-quote><p>Agreed but very hard to prove definitively. We thought hard about how to solve this and the only way we think this was doable was to perform CLEM on FRAP-ed parasites where we observe strong actin filaments between some parasites and prove that these are within the tubules. However, as controls we would need tubules that are of equal length with a similar tubular content. As explained in the text and further below, levels of chromobody in the tubules appears to correlate with, and may be affecting, the tubular content. At this stage we think it is hard to be certain what reduces diffusion rates. It could be due to actin within the tubules, the presence/absence of the ER-like structures in the tubules, the distance between the parasites or another factor.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Similar results as the FIB SEM could have been generated in a quantifiable manner by expressing the actin-binding chromobody (depending on the localization within the various CAP mutants) or a strong fluorescent reporter expressed at the plasma membrane.</p></disp-quote><p>This was considered: however, the suggested experiment assumes that there would be chromobody signal in all of the decentralised residual body connections and is therefore a readout for cell connectivity, which may not be accurate.</p><p>We decided to invest more time to answer this important question first by performing CLEM on a chromobody expressing strain in which CAP has been deleted. We show, in Figure 9 and Video 10, that the extensive actin filaments in the vacuole are found within the decentralised residual body tubules that connect the parasites, however, the signal is highly heterogenous and appears to affect the overall tubular content. While this may explain how parasites remain connected throughout divisions, correlating FRAP signals to these highly heterogenous tubular connections would be challenging and require a substantial amount of CLEM experiments.</p><p>However, we believe that the quantification of FRAP and synchronicity of division, together with the CLEM data we provide lends sufficient data to support our claims that the CAP mutants are still connected and that this maintains high rates of synchronous division. However, in the future it would be interesting to see whether the few parasites that do not divide in synchronicity (~10%) are indeed not connected, which is what we would hypothesise.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2:</p><p>Actin plays a critical role in the lytic cycle of apicomplexan parasites, and is known to be important for motility, organelle inheritance, and cell-cell communication. This manuscript explores the role of the putative actin regulator cyclase-associated protein (TgCAP) in a variety of such actin-dependent processes.

As detailed below, more work is needed to determine whether the TgCAP phenotype is truly distinct from the previously reported phenotypes. However, based on the previous reports involving actin and myosin in intravacuolar contact/communication, and the lack of mechanistic information regarding TgCAP, the current study does not significantly advance our understanding of the role of actin in the Toxoplasma lytic cycle.</p><p>1) This manuscript focuses on phenotypic assessment of processes for which actin is important, but there are no direct observations of the effects of TgCAP on actin turnover, as is suggested in the title.

While the authors provide compelling evidence that the two isoforms have distinct cellular localizations, there is no clear evidence that the localization is playing a critical role. One explanation for the more severe defects in complementation observed with the long isoform is that it is expressed at substantially lower levels relative to the short isoform (Figure 3F), and that overall levels of TgCAP are critical for its function. A prediction of this would be that a palmitoylation mutant (C6,8A) that could only be expressed as the long isoform (M37L mutant) would be unable to rescue the phenotypes as well as the short isoform.</p></disp-quote><p>LongCAP expression contributes ~25% of all CAP in the cell (Figure 3E), yet it can rescue most phenotypes to WT levels, apart from rosetting, the competition assay and the juxtanuclear actin polymerisation centre. If it was only the levels that make a difference, we would expect all phenotypes be affected in a similar way. In addition, the shortCAP isoform, which does not display reduced levels of expression, shows reduced growth in the competition assay, arguing for some localisation dependent phenotypes for the two isoforms. A more detailed study using mutants as proposed by the reviewer would surely be interesting, but we think better suited in a subsequent study that carefully investigates the isoforms in processes such as invasion and in combination with other actin regulators. We have added to the Discussion that the levels of expression may be a contributing factor to the phenotypes although we believe they are insufficient to explain all phenotypic differences.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) An important finding in this manuscript is that while TgCAP mutants have defects in protein diffusion between all parasites within a vacuole, they are still able to divide synchronously. Parasite division synchronicity assays presented in this manuscript are performed at 20 hours post infection. Frénal et al., showed increased severity in defects in synchronized division of myosin knockouts that occurred from 24 to 30 hours post infection. To ensure that the lack of synchronization defects observed in this manuscript is not simply due to earlier measurements, the authors should measure whether TgCAP mutants are still able to maintain synchronous divisions at these slightly later timepoints when there might be differences compared to wildtype.</p></disp-quote><p>This is a good suggestion and we have now also looked at 24 h and 30 h timepoints and indeed observe a slight, but statistically significant increase of asynchrony of daughter cell division at these later timepoints (Figure 6B). However, this reduction in synchronous division is small compared to that previously observed in Frénal et al., where only 30-40% divide synchronously for MyoI and MyoJ KO at the 30 h mark compared to ~88% in our analysis, despite complete lack of rosetting in all of these strains. Furthermore, Tosetti et al. reported that Formin 3 had only ~35% synchronous division but the time post-infection was not mentioned. In our study we propose that synchronicity may be achieved by parasites connected through the decentralised residual body. Lack of RTORP and rosetting does not predict connectivity as cells with a defect in either can still divide predominantly in synchronicity.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) If levels of TgCAP are important for function, it is important to understand how the levels in the complemented strains compare to wildtype cells. This can be measured using the TgCAP antibody presented in this manuscript.</p></disp-quote><p>This was an important suggestion and we now provide this data in the manuscript, for the RH line (Figure 3E) as well as for the chromobody expressing line (Figure 8C). In both these instances, we see levels of CAP expression in the ∆CAP<sup>CAP</sup> line comparable to WT parasites. We do observe a reduction of longCAP compared to WT parasites though, which is now mentioned in the text. However, the longCAP isoform can rescue the majority of ∆CAP phenotypes to WT levels, indicating that precise level of expression is not the main factor in longCAP function.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3:</p><p>You've asked me to read this manuscript from the point of view of an actin biologist.

Also, potential differences in F-actin accumulation at the junction need to be compared with WT parasites. Since this would be a longer endeavour and would not significantly add to the current study, this reviewer suggests to remove this set of data until a more convincing analysis has been performed.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that this set of data does not significantly add to the current study and would require considerable further experimentation to provide reasonable insight. As such, Figure 8G and H have been removed, as well as associated text in the Results and Discussion.</p></body></sub-article></article>
