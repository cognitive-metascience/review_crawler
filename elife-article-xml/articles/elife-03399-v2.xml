The PCM expands dramatically as cells enter mitosis, but it is unclear how this occurs. In this study, we show that the centriole protein Asl initiates the recruitment of DSpd-2 and Cnn to mother centrioles; both proteins then assemble into co-dependent scaffold-like structures that spread outwards from the mother centriole and recruit most, if not all, other PCM components. In the absence of either DSpd-2 or Cnn, mitotic PCM assembly is diminished; in the absence of both proteins, it appears to be abolished. We show that DSpd-2 helps incorporate Cnn into the PCM and that Cnn then helps maintain DSpd-2 within the PCM, creating a positive feedback loop that promotes robust PCM expansion around the mother centriole during mitosis. These observations suggest a surprisingly simple mechanism of mitotic PCM assembly in flies.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.03399.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.03399.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.03399.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Long protein filaments called microtubules perform a range of roles inside cells—for example, they give the cell its shape and help to divide its genetic material during cell division. In animal cells, microtubules emerge from structures called centrosomes. These contain two cylindrical structures called centrioles that are surrounded by a matrix of pericentriolar material made from several hundred different proteins. Problems with centrosomes have been linked to several disorders, including cancer.</p><p>In the fruit fly <italic>Drosophila</italic>, it was long thought that the pericentriolar material assembles on an underlying ‘scaffold’, the composition of which had remained unclear. A protein called Centrosomin was a good candidate molecule, as it is required to maintain the proper structure of the pericentriolar material. In addition, Centrosomin molecules continuously spread away from the centrioles into the matrix providing a clear centriole–matrix connection. However, if Centrosomin is not present in a cell, some protein is still recruited around the centrioles. Conduit et al. therefore suspected that Centrosomin works together with another protein to build the scaffold.</p><p>Conduit et al. used super-resolution microscopy to observe the behaviour of several proteins, thought most likely to help Centrosomin to form the scaffold. Only one, called DSpd-2, builds outwards from the centrioles like Centrosomin. Genetic tests showed that both Centrosomin and DSpd-2 are important for the other proteins to localize to the pericentriolar material. If one of either Centrosomin or DSpd-2 is missing from the cell, reduced amounts of protein are recruited around the centrioles but the matrix still partially forms. Without both proteins, however, the matrix does not form at all.</p><p>Conduit et al. found that a third protein helps to recruit Centrosomin and DSpd-2 to the older of the two centrioles (also known as the mother centriole). DSpd-2 then draws in more Centrosomin. As Centrosomin helps to hold the DSpd-2 proteins in the pericentriolar material, this enables even more Centrosomin to be recruited, and so forms a positive feedback loop that helps the scaffold to continue growing.</p><p>The findings of Conduit et al. provide a simple mechanism for building the scaffold that supports the formation of the centrosome in the fruit fly <italic>Drosophila</italic>. Whether a similar mechanism is used to construct centrosomes in other species remains to be investigated.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.03399.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.03399.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author keywords</title><kwd>centrosome</kwd><kwd>PCM</kwd><kwd>centrosome maturation</kwd><kwd>live super-resolution</kwd><kwd>FRAP</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>D. melanogaster</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000289</institution-id><institution>Cancer Research UK</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>C5395/A10530</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Conduit</surname><given-names>Paul T</given-names></name><name><surname>Richens</surname><given-names>Jennifer H</given-names></name><name><surname>Wainman</surname><given-names>Alan</given-names></name><name><surname>Dix</surname><given-names>Carly I</given-names></name><name><surname>Raff</surname><given-names>Jordan W</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100004440</institution-id><institution>Wellcome Trust</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>097297</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Holder</surname><given-names>James</given-names></name><name><surname>Vicente</surname><given-names>Catarina C</given-names></name><name><surname>Novak</surname><given-names>Zsofia A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000769</institution-id><institution>University Of Oxford</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>EPA</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Pratt</surname><given-names>Metta B</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100004440</institution-id><institution>Wellcome Trust</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>091911</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Wainman</surname><given-names>Alan</given-names></name><name><surname>Dobbie</surname><given-names>Ian M</given-names></name><name><surname>Schermelleh</surname><given-names>Lothar</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The proteins DSpd-2 and Centrosomin assemble into dynamic scaffolds that build from the inside out around the mother centriole and support centrosome maturation.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Centrosomes help regulate many cell processes, including cell shape, cell polarity, and cell division (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Doxsey et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bettencourt-Dias and Glover, 2007</xref>), and centrosome defects have been implicated in several human pathologies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Nigg and Raff, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Zyss and Gergely, 2009</xref>). Centrosomes are the major microtubule (MT)-organising centres (MTOCs) in many animal cells. They form when centrioles assemble a matrix of pericentriolar material (PCM) around themselves. Several hundred proteins are concentrated in the PCM, including many MT-organising proteins, cell-cycle regulators, and checkpoint and signalling proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Müller et al., 2010</xref>); thus, the centrosome appears to function as an important co-ordination centre in the cell (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Doxsey et al., 2005</xref>). Although centrioles usually organize only small amounts of PCM in interphase cells, the PCM expands dramatically as cells prepare to enter mitosis—a process termed centrosome maturation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Khodjakov and Rieder, 1999</xref>).</p><p>Many proteins have been implicated in mitotic PCM assembly.

In recent super-resolution microscopy studies, several of these proteins appeared to be highly organized around interphase centrioles, but the organisation of proteins within the extended mitotic PCM was much less apparent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Fu and Glover, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Lawo et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Mennella et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Sonnen et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>It has long been thought that the mitotic PCM is assembled on an underlying scaffold structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Dictenberg et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Schnackenberg et al., 1998</xref>). We recently showed that <italic>Drosophila</italic> Centrosomin (Cnn) can form such a scaffold around centrioles and that this scaffold is assembled from the inside out (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Conduit et al., 2014</xref>): Cnn molecules continuously incorporate into the scaffold around the centrioles and the scaffold then fluxes slowly outward, away from the centrioles. This inside out assembly mechanism could be important, as it potentially allows the assembly of the mitotic PCM to be regulated by the centrioles.</p><p>Many PCM proteins, however, can be recruited to mitotic centrosomes in the absence of Cnn, albeit at reduced levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Lucas and Raff, 2007</xref>), suggesting that at least one other protein must be able to form a scaffold around centrioles that can recruit other PCM components. We reasoned that such a scaffold might also be assembled from the inside out. To identify such a protein(s), we analyzed the dynamic behaviour of the eight <italic>Drosophila</italic> centrosomal proteins that, in addition to Cnn, have been most strongly implicated in mitotic PCM recruitment: Asl, Sas-4, D-PLP, DSpd-2, γ-tubulin, DGp71WD, Polo, and Aurora A. We found that only DSpd-2 behaves like Cnn, as it incorporates into the PCM close to the centrioles and then spreads slowly outward to form a scaffold-like structure that recruits other PCM components. Importantly, in the absence of either DSpd-2 or Cnn, PCM recruitment is diminished, but in the absence of both proteins, it is abolished. We show that Asl appears to initiate the recruitment of DSpd-2 and Cnn exclusively to the mother centrioles; DSpd-2 then helps to recruit more Cnn, while Cnn helps to maintain DSpd-2 within the PCM, thus creating a positive feedback loop that promotes the scaffold assembly. Thus, mitotic PCM assembly appears to be a surprisingly simple process in flies: Asl initiates the recruitment of Spd-2 and Cnn to mother centrioles, and these proteins then assemble into scaffolds that spread out from the mother centriole and form a platform upon which most, if not all, other PCM proteins ultimately assemble.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Most PCM proteins are recruited to centrosomes by binding sites that are distributed throughout the PCM</title><p>We used spinning disk confocal microscopy to perform fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP) experiments in combination with radial-profiling to quantify the spatio-temporal dynamics of various GFP-fusion proteins in <italic>Drosophila</italic> syncytial embryos.

Remarkably, we show here that the assembly of the mitotic PCM in flies appears to depend on just two proteins, Cnn and DSpd-2. Both proteins appear to form scaffolds that initially assemble around the mother centriole and then spread outward, forming a dynamic platform upon which most, if not all, other PCM proteins ultimately assemble. DSpd-2 and Cnn partially depend on each other for their centrosomal localization, and both proteins are required to ensure robust centrosome maturation. In the absence of one of these proteins, reduced levels of the other protein still localize around the centrioles and can support the partial assembly of the mitotic PCM. In the absence of both the proteins, mitotic PCM assembly appears to be abolished (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>).</p><p>How are DSpd-2 and Cnn recruited to mother centrioles? Our results strongly suggest that in fly embryos Asl initially helps recruit DSpd-2 to centrioles and DSpd-2 then helps to recruit Cnn. Cnn does not appear to be required to recruit either Asl or DSpd-2 to centrosomes, but it is required to properly maintain DSpd-2 within the PCM. We speculate that this interaction between DSpd-2 and Cnn creates a positive feedback loop that drives the dramatic expansion of the PCM scaffold around mother centrioles during mitosis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10A</xref>). Although, we have identified direct interactions between Asl and DSpd-2 and between DSpd-2 and Cnn by Y2H, and the endogenous proteins can all co-immunoprecipitate with one another in fly embryo extracts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Conduit et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Gopalakrishnan et al., 2011</xref>), we stress that we cannot be certain that these interactions are direct in vivo.<fig id="fig10" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.03399.023</object-id><label>Figure 10.</label><caption><title>A model for mitotic PCM assembly in flies.</title><p>Schematics illustrate a putative pathway of mitotic PCM assembly in a WT cell (<bold>A</bold>), or in cells lacking either Cnn (<bold>B</bold>), DSpd-2 (<bold>C</bold>), or both Cnn and DSpd-2 (<bold>D</bold>). A top view of the mother centriole is shown surrounded by a layer of Asl (grey); solid arrows represent recruiting interactions, dotted arrows represent maintaining interactions. Arrow thickness reflects the relative strength of the recruitment or maintenance, and the size of the text reflects the amount of protein localized at centrosomes. In WT cells (<bold>A</bold>), Asl has an important role in recruiting DSpd-2 to centrosomes, which in turn has an important role in recruiting Cnn; Cnn then has an important role in maintaining DSpd-2 at centrosomes. Thus, a positive feedback loop is generated where increasing amounts of DSpd-2 can recruit increasing amounts of Cnn, which can then maintain increasing amounts of DSpd-2. DSpd-2 and Cnn both independently recruit other PCM components (red), which themselves help support the PCM structure and can recruit further PCM components. In the absence of Cnn (<bold>B</bold>), Asl can still recruit DSpd-2 normally, but DSpd-2 cannot efficiently accumulate around the centrioles. The reduced levels of DSpd-2 recruit reduced levels of PCM. In the absence of DSpd-2 (<bold>C</bold>), an alternative pathway recruits reduced levels of Cnn. This pathway most likely involves Asl (as indicated here), as inhibiting Asl reduces the rate of Cnn incorporation into the PCM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Conduit et al., 2010</xref>) and Asl and Cnn appear to weakly interact in a Y2H analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>); other pathways, however, could also be involved. The reduced levels of Cnn recruit reduced levels of PCM. In the absence of Cnn and DSpd-2 (<bold>D</bold>), no mitotic PCM can be assembled.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.03399.023">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.03399.023</ext-link></p></caption><graphic xlink:href="elife-03399-fig10-v2.tif"/></fig></p><p>The requirement for Asl to initiate the mitotic recruitment of DSpd-2 and Cnn probably explains why these proteins are specifically recruited to mother centrioles. We recently showed that although Asl is essential for centriole duplication, it is not incorporated into daughter centrioles until they have passed through mitosis and matured into new mother centrioles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Novak et al., 2014</xref>), and Asl/Cep152 proteins mainly localize to mother centrioles in several species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Sir et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Fu and Glover, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Lawo et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Mennella et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Sonnen et al., 2012</xref>). The PCM appears to be preferentially associated with mother centrioles in many systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Piel et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Conduit et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Wang et al., 2011</xref>). Our findings provide a potential explanation for why this is so, and raise the intriguing possibility that <italic>all</italic> mitotic PCM may be organized exclusively by mother centrioles.</p><p>Although DSpd-2 seems to be the major recruiter of centrosomal Cnn in embryos, there must be an alternative recruiter, as the centrosomal localization of Cnn is not abolished in the absence of DSpd-2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9C</xref>). Asl is an attractive candidate as anti-Asl antibodies perturb Cnn recruitment to centrioles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Conduit et al., 2010</xref>) (although this could be an indirect consequence of their effect on DSpd-2 recruitment), and Asl and Cnn interact in our Y2H analysis. Moreover, human Cep152/Asl has a role in the centrosomal recruitment of human Cdk5Rap2/Cnn (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Firat-Karalar et al., 2014</xref>). Interestingly, in flies this alternative pathway appears to be stronger in larval brain cells than in eggs/embryos: in the absence of DSpd-2, Cnn levels are reduced by only ∼35% in brains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9C</xref>) but by ∼80% in eggs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref>). Thus, the detail of mitotic PCM assembly pathway may vary between different cell types even in the same species.</p><p>Our data suggest that after DSpd-2 and Cnn have been recruited to centrioles, they rapidly assemble into scaffolds that then move slowly away from the centrioles. For Cnn, there is strong data indicating that scaffold assembly is regulated by phosphorylation. Cnn contains a phospho-regulated multimerization (PReM) domain that is phosphorylated by Polo/Plk1 in vitro and at centrosomes during mitosis in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Dobbelaere et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Conduit et al., 2014</xref>). Mimicking phosphorylation allows the PReM domain to multimerize in vitro and Cnn to spontaneously assemble into cytosolic scaffolds in vivo that can organize MTs. Conversely, ablating phosphorylation does not interfere with Cnn recruitment to centrioles, but inhibits Cnn scaffold assembly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Conduit et al., 2014</xref>). We speculate that, like Cnn, DSpd-2 can assemble into a scaffold and that this assembly is regulated in vivo so that it only occurs around mother centrioles. It remains unclear, however, whether DSpd-2 itself can form a scaffold, or whether it requires other proteins to do so.</p><p>It is striking that both DSpd-2 and Cnn exhibit an unusual dynamic behaviour at centrosomes. Both proteins incorporate into the PCM from the inside out, and are in constant flux, as the molecules that move slowly outward away from the centrioles are replaced by newly incorporated molecules close to the centriole surface (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1I</xref>). This inside out assembly is likely to have important consequences, as it means that the events close to the centriole surface, rather than at the periphery of the PCM, can ultimately regulate mitotic PCM assembly. This may be particularly important in cells where centrioles organise centrosomes of different sizes, as is the case in certain asymmetrically dividing stem/progenitor cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Lesage et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Nigg and Stearns, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Pelletier and Yamashita, 2012</xref>). Fly neural stem cells, for example, use centrosome size asymmetry to ensure robust asymmetric division (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Rebollo et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Rusan and Peifer, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Januschke et al., 2013</xref>), and there is strong evidence that new and old mother centrioles differentially regulate the rate of Cnn incorporation in these cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Conduit and Raff, 2010</xref>). Moreover, mutations in human Cdk5Rap2/Cnn have been implicated in microcephaly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bond et al., 2005</xref>), a pathology linked to a failure in neural progenitor cell proliferation, although the precise reason for this is unclear (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Bond and Woods, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Megraw et al., 2011</xref>).</p><p>Although DSpd-2 and Cnn have a major role in centrosome maturation, we stress that other PCM components are likely to make important contributions. Pericentrin, for example, has been implicated in PCM recruitment in several systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Martinez-Campos et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Zimmerman et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Lee and Rhee, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Lawo et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Mennella et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Kim and Rhee, 2014</xref>), and the fly homologue, D-PLP, forms ordered fibrils in cultured S2 cells that extend away from the centriole wall and support PCM assembly in interphase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Mennella et al., 2012</xref>). These centriolar fibrils, however, cannot explain how centrioles organize such a vastly expanded PCM matrix during mitosis, and D-PLP appears to have an important, but more minor, role in mitotic PCM assembly in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Martinez-Campos et al., 2004</xref>). Nevertheless, proteins like D-PLP will certainly help recruit other PCM proteins and help form structural links within the PCM, thus strengthening the mitotic PCM matrix. The important distinction is that, in flies at least, most proteins, including the PCM fraction of D-PLP, are recruited into the PCM by an underlying PCM scaffold, whereas DSpd-2 and Cnn appear to form this scaffold.</p><p>Homologues of Asl, DSpd-2, and Cnn have been implicated in PCM assembly in many species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Pelletier et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Gomez-Ferreria et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Zhu et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Haren et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Barr et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Cizmecioglu et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Hatch et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Joukov et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Decker et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Kim and Rhee, 2014</xref>), suggesting that the mechanism of mitotic PCM recruitment we identify here in flies may be conserved through evolution. To our knowledge, however, no PCM component has yet been shown to assemble from the inside out and to flux away from the centrioles in any other system. Nevertheless, although the precise molecular details will likely vary from cell type to cell type and from species to species, we suspect that this unusual dynamic behaviour of an underlying mitotic PCM scaffold will prove to be a general feature of mitotic centrosome assembly in many systems.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Transgenic <italic>Drosophila</italic> lines</title><p>P-element-mediated transformation vectors were made by introducing a full-length DGp71WD or D-PLP cDNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Kawaguchi and Zheng, 2004</xref>) into the Ubq-GFPCT Gateway vector (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Basto et al., 2008</xref>).

Photobleaching was carried out in S phase, which is when mitotic PCM is most actively recruited in these rapidly cycling embryos. We used ImageJ to calculate the fluorescence profile of each centrosome at each time-point. We first scaled the images so that each pixel was split into 25 (5 × 5) pixels in order to increase the resolution of our radial profiling. We then calculated the centre of mass of the centrosome by thresholding the image and running the ‘analyze particles’ (centre of mass) macro on the most central Z plane of the centrosome. We then centred concentric rings (spaced at 0.028 μm and spanning across 3.02 μm) on this centre and measured the average fluorescence around each ring (radial profiling). After subtracting the average cytosolic signal and normalising, so the peak intensity of the pre-bleached image was equal to 1, we mirrored the profiles to show a full symmetric centrosomal profile.

Your article has been favorably evaluated by Tony Hunter (Senior Editor) and 3 reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors.</p><p>The Reviewing Editor and the other reviewers discussed their comments before we reached this decision, and the Reviewing Editor has assembled the following comments to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>The combination of 3D super-resolution imaging and FRAP has given interesting insights into how the PCM may be generated. This shows that DSpd-2 is initially incorporated into a tight toroid that coincides with the localization of the outer centriole wall and subsequently moves outward, whereas Cnn is initially incorporated into a broader structure that coincides with the full localization pattern of DSpd-2 (and other PCM proteins including D-PLP, Dgrip71WD and gamma-tubulin), from which it then moves outwards. These data are solid but the analysis of how these proteins are recruited is more tenuous. In particular the proposed pathway that Asl recruits D-Spd2, which forms a scaffold that recruits CNN, with partial feedback between D-Spd2 and CNN, is only one possible interpretation of the data and stronger evidence is required to make this conclusion. The reviewers were convinced by the evidence that Asl recruits D-Spd2 but not that D-Spd2 forms a matrix. Moreover, the yeast two-hybrid analysis does not stand well by itself since ambiguity remains over whether interactions are direct or not, and whether the interactions are conserved in their physiological setting. Similarly, the antibody injection results cannot be used as evidence that DSpd2 binds directly to CNN.</p><p>More experimental data will be required to address the following points:</p><p>1) More direct assays are required for the protein interactions between D-Spd2, CNN and Asl, or the conclusions must be toned down.</p><p>2) An important omission is that the authors should analyse the behaviour of D-PLP, because they have previously implicated it in PCM assembly, and because the human homologue has also been shown to have an important role.</p><p>3) The authors rely on transgenic flies expressing key centrosome proteins tagged with fluorescent proteins where expression levels may alter their dynamics and/or their distribution. This is particularly relevant when overexpressed since it has been well established that the overexpression of centrosome protein can modulate centrosome size. The authors should show data concerning the relative expression levels of the fusion proteins and mention how this may affect their results and interpretation.</p><p>4) The authors argue that DSpd-2 and Cnn form a lattice. Is this an inherent property of these two proteins or do the structures observed require MTs? Their linear extension could be consistent with them binding to MTs. Do they observe the same morphology in presence of nocodazole for example?</p><p>Minor comments (from Reviewer 2):</p><p>The authors would need to be more precise, throughout the manuscript, in what they mean by PCM, and the relative effects on PCM recruitment in different mutants. From this reviewer's perspective, there seems to be two steps in PCM recruitment, one in which PCM is recruited in close proximity to the centriole (i.e. toroidal appearance), the other in which the PCM moves from that location towards the periphery allowing more PCM to be recruited near the centriole and so forth. The generic use of PCM recruitment does not seem appropriate.</p><p>Several observations and key conclusions have been previously reported by the authors and other groups. For instance, it was known that DSpd-2 localization at the centrosome requires Asl activity and is independent to D-PLP, Cnn, -tubulin, DGrip91 and D-TACC. Also it was known that the centrosomal localization of Cnn is dependent on DSpd-2. The authors need to focus on their novel findings.</p><p>In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure4A-B</xref>, the authors compared the central region of the DSpd-2-GFP and GFP-Cnn at 30s and 60s post-bleach respectively. Is there a reason why they are not both compared at 30s? Is 60s the first time point authors could detect recovery signal from GFP-Cnn, if so, why the recovery so much slower than DSpd-2-GFP considering authors proposed that Cnn is recruited to centrosome mostly by DSpd-2.</p><p>In Figure S1L, the authors claimed D-PLP-GFP normalized recovery profiles were wider than the pre-bleached profile, but did not give a clear explanation for it. This should be clarified.</p><p>The time scale in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E and 2G</xref> is much shorter than <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>, can authors provide a longer recovery profile to show the extent of the recovery?</p><p>The authors report an extensive overlap between the distribution of DSpd-2-GFP and mCherry-Cnn (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). The authors should provide quantitative data</p><p>The sample authors pointed (arrowhead) in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref> did not support the claim they made in terms of DSpd-2-GFP, which did not extend outwards as far as mCherry-Cnn since the pointed area is at the edge of the Cnn positive area.</p><p>I do not think I saw any mention of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref> in the text.

Similarly, the antibody injection results cannot be used as evidence that DSpd2 binds directly to CNN</italic>.</p><p>We were delighted with the generally positive tone of the comments, and I describe below how we have revised the manuscript in light of these comments/suggestions.</p><p>The major concern of the reviewers was that our putative recruitment pathway was tenuous. The evidence for this pathway is strong, as it is based on several lines of data: 1) Anti-Asl antibodies specifically suppress DSpd-2 recruitment, while anti-DSpd-2 antibodies specifically suppress Cnn recruitment; 2) Cnn, but not Asl, localisation is dramatically reduced in embryos lacking DSpd-2; 3) Neither DSpd-2 nor Asl recruitment is effected in embryos lacking Cnn, but DSpd-2 cannot be properly maintained at centrosomes. Moreover, the endogenous proteins all co-immunoprecipitate from embryo extracts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Conduit et al., 2010</xref>) and we can detect strong direct interactions between Asl and DSpd-2 and between DSpd-2 and Cnn in Y2H assays. Nevertheless, we agree that there are other ways of interpreting this data so we have now toned down our statements on this point throughout the manuscript.</p><p>The reviewers were convinced that Asl recruits DSpd-2, but not that DSpd-2 forms a matrix. While our previous study provided compelling evidence that Cnn forms a matrix (Conduit et al., Dev. Cell, 2014) we agree that this is less clear for DSpd-2. We now provide additional super-resolution data on Cnn and DSpd-2 behaviour in colchicine treated embryos that we think strengthens the argument for a DSpd-2 scaffold. Nevertheless, this is not conclusive, so we have toned down our conclusions throughout the text, and we explicitly state that it is unclear whether DSpd-2 itself can form a scaffold.</p><p>The reviewers raised some concerns about the physiological relevance of the Y2H interactions, and points out that the antibody injection experiments do not address whether DSpd-2 interacts directly with Cnn. We agree and now explicitly state that we cannot be certain that these interactions are direct in vivo.</p><p><italic>More experimental data will be required to address the following points:</italic></p><p><italic>1) More direct assays are required for the protein interactions between D-Spd2, CNN and Asl, or the conclusions must be toned down</italic>.</p><p>They requested that we either provide more direct assays to confirm the interactions between these proteins or that we tone down our conclusions on this point. As described above, we have toned down our conclusions accordingly.</p><p><italic>2) An important omission is that the authors should analyse the behaviour of D-PLP, because they have previously implicated it in PCM assembly, and because the human homologue has also been shown to have an important role</italic>.</p><p>The reviewers requested that we analyse the behaviour of D-PLP as this protein has been implicated in PCM recruitment. We now describe our analysis of D-PLP behaviour in more detail, and explain why the quantitative analysis of this protein is complicated by the presence of a slowly turning over fraction in the centriole and a rapidly turning over fraction in the PCM (legend to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1–figure supplement 2</xref>). As we now state, it is clear that D-PLP in the PCM does not function like DSpd-2 or Cnn as a component of an underlying PCM scaffold during mitosis.</p><p><italic>3) The authors rely on transgenic flies expressing key centrosome proteins tagged with fluorescent proteins where expression levels may alter their dynamics and/or their distribution. This is particularly relevant when overexpressed since it has been well established that the overexpression of centrosome protein can modulate centrosome size. The authors should show data concerning the relative expression levels of the fusion proteins and mention how this may affect their results and interpretation</italic>.</p><p>The reviewers request data on the expression levels of the various GFP-fusions relative to their endogenous proteins. We now provide this data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1–figure supplement 1</xref>, and discuss its implications in the legend. While the overexpression of GFP-fusion proteins can lead to differences in the rate of protein binding to centrosomes (and we have shown that this is the case for some of these proteins; Conduit et al., Curr. Biol., 2010), this does not seem to effect the mechanism of how the proteins bind to centrosomes, and we have shown this to be the case for several of the proteins we analyse here, including GFP-Cnn (Conduit et al., Curr. Biol., 2010).</p><p><italic>4) The authors argue that DSpd-2 and Cnn form a lattice. Is this an inherent property of these two proteins or do the structures observed require MTs? Their linear extension could be consistent with them binding to MTs. Do they observe the same morphology in presence of nocodazole for example?</italic></p><p>The reviewers queried whether the DSpd-2 and Cnn lattices require MTs for their formation. This is an excellent question, and we now include a 3D-SIM analysis of DSpd-2 and Cnn behaviour in living embryos injected with colchicine to depolymerise the MTs. This analysis has been very informative. Although both proteins clearly associate with MTs in the peripheral region of the PCM, this is not the case in the central region. For DSpd-2 in particular, a clear structured lattice is still apparent in the central region even when the MTs have been depolymerised.</p><p><italic>Minor comments (from Reviewer 2):</italic></p><p><italic>The authors would need to be more precise, throughout the manuscript, in what they mean by PCM, and the relative effects on PCM recruitment in different mutants. From this reviewer's perspective, there seems to be two steps in PCM recruitment, one in which PCM is recruited in close proximity to the centriole (i.e. toroidal appearance), the other in which the PCM moves from that location towards the periphery allowing more PCM to be recruited near the centriole and so forth. The generic use of PCM recruitment does not seem appropriate</italic>.</p><p>The reviewer points out that there appear to be two steps to PCM recruitment. We agree, although we were slightly confused as to whether the reviewer meant two phases to general PCM recruitment (i.e. interphase, where the PCM is recruited to a tight area around the centrioles [as shown by others], and mitosis, where the PCM is recruited to an expanded scaffold of DSpd-2 and Cnn that forms around the centrioles) or that there were two phases to the specific recruitment of DSpd-2 and Cnn (where both proteins are initially recruited to centrioles [step 1], and they then assemble into lattices that move outwards away from the centrioles [step 2]). In either case we have attempted to emphasise both points throughout the revised manuscript.</p><p><italic>Several observations and key conclusions have been previously reported by the authors and other groups. For instance, it was known that DSpd-2 localization at the centrosome requires Asl activity and is independent to D-PLP, Cnn, -tubulin, DGrip91 and D-TACC. Also it was known that the centrosomal localization of Cnn is dependent on DSpd-2. The authors need to focus on their novel findings</italic>.</p><p>The reviewer pointed out that some of our observations had already been reported previously, and we now make sure we properly acknowledge where this is the case. In most of these instances, however, we feel that our new observations add important extra information. For example, the reviewer is right that Giansanti et al., (Curr. Biol., 2008) concluded that the centrosomal localisation of DSpd-2 was independent of D-PLP, Cnn, ©-tubulin, DGrip71 and D-TACC; our live cell studies now show, however, that although Cnn is not required to recruit DSpd-2 to centrosomes, it is required to maintain DSpd-2 at centrosomes, and this is central to our proposed pathway.</p><p><italic>In</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4"><italic>Figure4A-B</italic></xref><italic>, the authors compared the central region of the DSpd-2-GFP and GFP-Cnn at 30s and 60s post-bleach respectively. Is there a reason why they are not both compared at 30s? Is 60s the first time point authors could detect recovery signal from GFP-Cnn, if so, why the recovery so much slower than DSpd-2-GFP considering authors proposed that Cnn is recruited to centrosome mostly by DSpd-2</italic>.</p><p>The reviewer raises the important point that DSpd-2-GFP recovers faster than GFP-Cnn, and this is indeed why we show a first recovery time-point of 30s for the former and 60s for the latter. We are grateful to the reviewer for pointing this out, as we realise we did not explain this aspect of our model very well. Although DSpd-2 recruits Cnn, our data strongly suggests they are not recruited to the centrosome together as part of the same complex (hence the differential recruitment rates). We believe that DSpd-2 is recruited to centrosomes primarily by Asl; once recruited, DSpd-2 then becomes a platform for recruiting Cnn. We now clarify this important point.</p><p><italic>In Figure S1L, the authors claimed D-PLP-GFP normalized recovery profiles were wider than the pre-bleached profile, but did not give a clear explanation for it. This should be clarified</italic>.</p><p>The reviewer asks for clarification of the D-PLP-GFP FRAP recovery curve. As discussed in point (2) above, we now provide much more information on this.</p><p><italic>The time scale in</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2"><italic>Figure 2E and 2G</italic></xref> <italic>is much shorter than</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2"><italic>Figure 2B</italic></xref><italic>, can authors provide a longer recovery profile to show the extent of the recovery?</italic></p><p>The reviewer points out that the time scale of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E and 2G</xref> is much shorter than <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref> and asks that we provide a longer recovery profile for E and G. These graphs show FRAP recovery curves for Polo-GFP, Aurora A-GFP and DSpd-2-GFP, respectively, and the reason for the different time scales is that Polo and Aurora A recover much more quickly than DSpd-2. Throughout this study we have concentrated on comparing initial recovery rates and distribution profiles and have not attempted to show full recovery curves or to calculate mobile/immobile fractions for all these proteins. This is because each protein has a unique behaviour and because the centrosomes grow in size, so these proteins accumulate throughout S-phase to different extents, making simple comparisons very difficult. We feel it would significantly distract from the main point of the paper if we were to provide and properly document a full description of the dynamic behaviour of all individual proteins we analyse here.</p><p><italic>The authors report an extensive overlap between the distribution of DSpd-2-GFP and mCherry-Cnn (</italic><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3"><italic>Figure 3B</italic></xref><italic>). The authors should provide quantitative data</italic></p><p>The reviewer requests a more quantitative analysis of the overlap between the distribution of DSpd-2-GFP and mCherry-Cnn. Quantifying this in a meaningful way is problematic as these 3D-SIM images are all calculated reconstructions from multiple image stacks that, for technical reasons, have to be acquired sequentially (red first then green); the PCM is rapidly moving in these embryos making voxel by voxel comparisons unreliable, particularly in the crowded environment of the centrosome. What we think is clear from our analysis is that there is substantial (but not complete) overlap between the distributions of DSpd-2 and Cnn (at least by eyeball) in the central region of the PCM, but that Cnn strongly extends out into the more peripheral regions, where DSpd-2 is much weaker (although there is usually some DSpd-2 detectable in the peripheral regions that contain Cnn). We now explain this more clearly, and provide an additional <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3–figure supplement 1</xref> that shows examples of line plots through a centrosome that we hope illustrate these points in a semi-quantitative manner (although we are not big fans of this type of analysis as they can be very subjective).</p><p><italic>The sample authors pointed (arrowhead) in</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3"><italic>Figure 3B</italic></xref> <italic>did not support the claim they made in terms of DSpd-2-GFP, which did not extend outwards as far as mCherry-Cnn since the pointed area is at the edge of the Cnn positive area</italic>.</p><p>The reviewer commented on whether the DSpd-2-GFP extended out as far as the mCherry-Cnn. There may have been a typo in this comment as it was a little difficult to understand exactly what the reviewer meant here. I hope that the changes described in our response to the above point address this issue.</p><p>Finally, your Features Editor, Peter Rodgers, wrote to us asking us to change the title, pointing out that most readers would not be familiar with the term PCM or with any of the protein names. We have now done this.</p></body></sub-article></article>
