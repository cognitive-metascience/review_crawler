pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.12669.001</object-id><p>In humans, activation of the ventral striatum, a region associated with reward processing, is associated with the extinction of fear, a goal in the treatment of fear-related disorders. This evidence suggests that extinction of aversive memories engages reward-related circuits, but a causal relationship between activity in a reward circuit and fear extinction has not been demonstrated. Here, we identify a basolateral amygdala (BLA)-ventral striatum (NAc) pathway that is activated by extinction training. Enhanced recruitment of this circuit during extinction learning, either by pairing reward with fear extinction training or by optogenetic stimulation of this circuit during fear extinction, reduces the return of fear that normally follows extinction training. Our findings thus identify a specific BLA-NAc reward circuit that can regulate the persistence of fear extinction and point toward a potential therapeutic target for disorders in which the return of fear following extinction therapy is an obstacle to treatment.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.12669.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.12669.001</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>fear extinction</kwd><kwd>reward conditioning</kwd><kwd>basolateral amygdala</kwd><kwd>nucleus accumbens</kwd><kwd>infralimbic cortex</kwd><kwd>prelimbic cortex</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd>Rat</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000185</institution-id><institution>Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>W911NF-10-1-0059</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Graybiel</surname><given-names>Ann M</given-names></name><name><surname>Goosens</surname><given-names>Ki A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000183</institution-id><institution>Army Research Office</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Graybiel</surname><given-names>Ann M</given-names></name><name><surname>Goosens</surname><given-names>Ki A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000025</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Mental Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01 MH084966</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Goosens</surname><given-names>Ki A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Behavior- or optogenetic-driven activation of a basolateral amygdala projection to the nucleus accumbens enhances infralimbic cortex activity and long-term fear extinction.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Anxiety, trauma, and stress-related disorders have a high lifetime prevalence rate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Kessler et al., 2005</xref>) and can be debilitating. The most common treatment for these disorders is exposure therapy, in which trauma-associated or anxiety-provoking cues are presented in a safe environment in order to decrease gradually, or to extinguish, cue-evoked recollection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Rothbaum and Davis, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Felmingham et al., 2013</xref>). A challenge in treating these disorders, however, is the re-emergence of symptoms following therapy, a phenomenon called spontaneous recovery (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Pavlov, 1927</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Rescorla, 2004</xref>). The existence of spontaneous recovery suggests that aversive memories associated with the traumatic incident are temporarily inhibited, but not erased, by exposure therapy and that extinction memories are weakened by the passage of time. Understanding how to strengthen extinction memories so that fear return is lessened is thus critical in designing improved treatment of many fear-related and anxiety disorders.</p><p>In the laboratory, traumatic events and exposure therapy are modeled using Pavlovian fear conditioning and extinction training. During fear conditioning, neutral cues (conditional stimuli, CSs) are paired with aversive cues (unconditional stimuli, USs), to induce learned fear. During extinction training, the CSs are presented in the absence of aversive stimuli in order to decrease CS-elicited fear. Associative fear memories that result from fear conditioning can be extinguished, but they exhibit spontaneous recovery (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Quirk, 2002</xref>), providing a powerful behavioral model by which to identify and study the neural circuits that support these phenomena.</p><p>The nucleus accumbens (NAc), a striatal region classically linked to rewarding experiences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Ambroggi et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Ghitza et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Wan and Peoples, 2006</xref>), is thought also to participate in aversive memory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Cassaday et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Haralambous and Westbrook, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Jongen-RÃªlo et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Riedel et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Schwienbacher et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Reynolds and Berridge, 2008</xref>). Numerous studies have shown that activity in the NAc is correlated with several measures of learned aversive behaviors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Reynolds and Berridge, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Delgado et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Kim et al., 2006a</xref>). Moreover, the NAc receives strong glutamatergic inputs from the basolateral amygdala (BLA) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Ambroggi et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Brog et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Christie et al., 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Floresco et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">O'Donnell and Grace, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Wright et al., 1996</xref>), a brain region necessary for the acquisition and consolidation of fear extinction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Herry et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Laurent et al., 2008</xref>) but not for retrieval or expression of the fear extinction memory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Herry et al., 2008</xref>). It has been suggested, accordingly, that activity in the NAc is important for fear extinction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Holtzman-Assif et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Whittle et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Rodriguez-Romaguera et al., 2012</xref>). The mechanisms underlying such a function of the NAc remain unclear, however, and it is not known whether the NAc is implicated in the persistence of extinction memory, a critical therapeutic question. Based on evidence that the BLA is essential for many forms of motivated learning, including fear extinction and reward learning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Holtzman-Assif et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">LeDoux et al., 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Falls et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Herry et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Sotres-Bayon et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Schoenbaum et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Sugase-Miyamoto and Richmond, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Kim et al., 2006b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Quirk et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bouton, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Kelley et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Gold et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Belova et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Paton et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Uwano et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Tye et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Britt et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Stuber et al., 2011</xref>), and that connections between the BLA and the NAc are important for generating goal-directed behavior in response to reward-predictive cues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Ambroggi et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Wright et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Britt et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Stuber et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Setlow et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">McDonald, 1991a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Di Ciano and Everitt, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Johnson et al., 1994</xref>), we here asked whether fear extinction itself engages a BLA-NAc circuit in rodents and, if so, whether enhancing activity in this circuit during extinction training could reduce the return of fear at a remote time point.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>A BLA-NAc circuit is recruited by fear extinction</title><p>To test whether a BLA-NAc circuit is engaged by fear extinction, we first used a double-labeling strategy to search for NAc-projecting BLA neurons that could be activated by extinction training after fear conditioning. We labeled BLA neurons projecting to the NAc by infusing a fluorescent retrograde tracer, cholera toxin B (CTB) conjugated to Alexa fluor 488 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Conte et al., 2009</xref>), into the NAc to allow subsequent detection of labeled BLA-NAc projecting neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>).

Consistent with previous studies showing that the BLA-NAc projection is heavy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">McDonald, 1991a</xref>), in the BLA sections that we analyzed, 26.68 Â± 1.81% of all BLA cells projected to the NAc. Thus, 5% of this significant projection is a large number of individual cells.</p><p>These data suggest that fear extinction produces stronger activation of the BLA, including NAc-projecting neurons, than fear expression. However, it is also possible that the lower cFos+ numbers found in the <italic>Fear recall</italic> group compared to the <italic>Long ext</italic> group were related to the length of the behavior session (7.8âmin versus 31.1âmin). To examine this, we tested an additional group of rats in which CTB was infused into the NAc; the rats were later subjected to auditory fear conditioning followed by only one session of fear extinction (<italic>Short ext</italic> group, 31.1âmin; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1âfigure supplement 2A</xref>).

However, the number of double-labeled cells was significantly higher after two extinction sessions (<italic>Long ext</italic> group) compared to one extinction session (<italic>Short ext</italic> group) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1âfigure supplement 2D</xref>).</p><p>To determine whether the activation of the BLA-NAc pathway was specific to fear extinction, we ran an additional group of rats in which CTB was infused into the NAc.

This possibility is supported by a strong negative correlation between activation of the BLA-NAc pathway and the strength of freezing during the extinction session (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1âfigure supplement 2F</xref>): greater recruitment of this pathway was associated with weaker fear memories.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Reward conditioning during fear extinction reduces the return of fear</title><p>Our finding that a BLA-NAc circuit is recruited by fear extinction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>), together with evidence that a BLA-NAc circuit is involved in reward-seeking (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Britt et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Stuber et al., 2011</xref>), suggested that reward-related activity in the NAc during fear extinction could reinforce extinction learning.

In patients with fear and anxiety disorders, exposure therapy is regularly administered by exposing patients to aversive cues in the absence of aversive outcomes and in limited instances, counterconditioning has been used to treat post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) by pairing fear-eliciting stimuli with the recollection of positive memories during exposure therapy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">PaunoviÄ, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Wolpe, 1958</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">PaunoviÄ, 2011</xref>). However the mechanism by which counterconditioning achieves therapeutic efficacy is completely unknown. We therefore tested the effects of counterconditioning not only on immediate fear recallÂ but also on fear recallÂ after a delay of nearly two months.</p><p>We trained rats with auditory fear conditioning and then followed the initial training either with exposure to four sessions of auditory fear extinction (<italic>Ext-Ext</italic> group), or with exposure to two sessions of auditory fear extinction followed by two sessions of fear extinction and discriminative reward conditioning (<italic>Ext-RC</italic> group). The two sessions of auditory fear extinction that preceded the two sessions of discriminative reward conditioning in the <italic>Ext-RC</italic> group allowed for the reduction of fear expression and initiation of exploratory behavior necessary for the acquisition of reward conditioning. During the discriminative reward conditioning, the tone that was originally paired with footshock was paired with sucrose delivery at a port on the chamber wall (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>), and, as a control, a second novel tone was presented without sucrose delivery. We assessed tone-elicited freezing behavior and reward-seeking behavior (nose-pokes in the reward port) both during reward conditioning and also 55 days after fear conditioning. This paradigm enabled us to determine the effect of reward conditioning during fear extinction on the persistence of long-term extinction memory, a critical yet unexplored assessment when considering the translational significance of counterconditioning in humans with anxiety and trauma-related disorders.</p><p>Rats in the two groups displayed comparable levels of tone-elicited freezing during fear conditioning and auditory fear extinction training (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>).Â On Days 4 and 5, only the rats that received reward conditioning (<italic>Ext-RC</italic> group) displayed discriminative tone-elicited reward responses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2âfigure supplement 1A</xref>). Long-term fear memory, measured 55 days after fear conditioning, was significantly lower in the <italic>Ext-RC</italic> group compared to the <italic>Ext-Ext</italic> group (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2âfigure supplement 1BâD</xref>), despite the low overall number of reward port entries during the fear recall test on Day 55 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2âfigure supplement 1E</xref>). Plasma corticosterone levels were also lower in the <italic>Ext-RC group</italic>, as compared to the <italic>Ext-Ext</italic> group, on Day 55 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>), suggesting that the reduced fear recall on Day 55 in the <italic>Ext-RC</italic> group was accompanied by lower stress levelsÂ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Kelley et al., 2009</xref>).</p><p>The lower freezing observed in the <italic>Ext-RC</italic> group did not simply reflect reward-seeking behavior that masked conditional freezing. During the fear recall test on Day 55, freezing in the time bins during which a port entry occurred was not significantly different from freezing during time bins without port entries (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2âfigure supplement 1F</xref>). There was also no correlation between the number of reward port entries and the amount of freezing displayed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2âfigure supplement 1G</xref>).</p><p>The lower freezing observed in the <italic>Ext-RC</italic> group also could not be attributed to consumption of sucrose (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2âfigure supplement 2</xref>). We ran an additional experiment to determine whether the tone-reward association formed during fear extinction (counterconditioning) would be preserved after several weeks and whetherÂ having sucrose present during the remote fear recall test would promote aÂ greater decrease in fear (<italic>Ext-RC</italic> Group; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2âfigure supplement 2A</xref>).Â We assessed tone-elicited freezing behavior and reward-seeking behavior (nose-pokes in the reward port) during reward conditioning and also 55 days after fear conditioning (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2âfigure supplement 2A</xref>). During this remote test, the extinguished tone was paired with sucrose delivery for both groups, and the return of the original fearful memory was measured.</p><p>Rats in the two groups displayed comparable levels of tone-elicited freezing during fear conditioning and auditory fear extinction training (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2âfigure supplement 2B</xref>; Days 1â3). Similar freezing levels across the two groups were also observed on Days 4 and 5 (data not shown). On Days 4 and 5, only rats that received reward conditioning (<italic>Ext-RC</italic> group) displayed discriminative tone-elicited nose-pokes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2âfigure supplement 2CâD</xref>). Rats that received only auditory fear extinction showed significant fear memory on Day 55 (in blue, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2âfigure supplement 2EâG</xref>), but rats that received fear extinction followed by reward conditioning, surprisingly, exhibited virtually no conditional freezing (in magenta, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2âfigure supplement 2EâG</xref>). Notably, for rats in the <italic>Ext-RC</italic> group, the discriminative responding on the reward task on Day 55 was as robustÂ as on Day 5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2âfigure supplement 2H</xref>).</p><p>The lower freezing observed in the <italic>Ext-RC</italic> group also could not be attributed to the acquisition of a new rewarding association <italic>per se</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2âfigure supplement 3</xref>). To test whether it is specifically the reversal of the valence associated with the predictive tone that is critical for enhancing the persistence of auditory extinction memory, we performed an additional control experiment in which rats were trained with auditory fear conditioning followed by two sessions of auditory fear extinction and two sessions of reward conditioning, similar to the training regimen for the <italic>Ext-RC</italic> group. However, in contrast to the procedure for the <italic>Ext-RC</italic> group, during reward conditioning, the tone that was originally paired with footshock was presented in the absence of footshock, and a second, novel tone was paired with sucrose delivery (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2âfigure supplement 3A</xref>). Despite the successful discriminative reward learning in this group of rats (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2âfigure supplement 3B</xref>), the reward conditioning during extinction did not significantly change the return of fear when compared to rats that received only extinction training (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2âfigure supplement 3C</xref>). Thus simply consuming sucrose or forming a new reward association with a novel cue during fear extinction was not sufficient to enhance fear extinction memory.</p><p>These findings demonstrate (1) that shifting the associative value of a tone cue during extinction from aversive to rewarding is possible, and that the positive value can be preserved for many weeks, (2) that reward conditioning during fear extinction does not alter across-session acquisition of fear extinction, although it is possible that a potential enhancement of extinction learning could have been masked in our experiments by the overall low levels of freezing observed on Days 4 and 5 and (3) that enhancing activation of reward circuits during fear extinction via a behavioral counterconditioning manipulation leads to more persistent weakening of the original fear memory than fear extinction alone.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Reward conditioning during fear extinction promotes recruitment of a BLA-NAc circuit</title><p>We next tested whether the persistent reduction of fear return that we observed in the <italic>Ext-RC</italic> rats could reflect enhanced recruitment of the BLA-NAc circuit resulting from the reward training during fear extinction.

We addressed this issue directly by pairing optogenetic stimulation of BLA terminals in the NAc with tone presentations during extinction training (Figure 5B). To establish the feasibility of this approach, we first infused either an adeno-associated virus (AAV; serotypeÂ 9) expressing channelrhodopsin fused to enhanced yellow fluorescent protein (eYFP; ChETA-eYFP) or, as a control, a similar AAV expressing eYFP alone into the amygdala. After one month to allow anterograde expression of the virus, we used confocal imaging to analyze the distribution of the ChETA-eYFP or eYFP proteins in the BLA and NAc. We found eYFP expressed broadly in both brain regions, indicating successful expression and transport of the protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). To test whether ChETA-eYFP was expressed in the presynaptic terminals of BLA neurons projecting to the NAc, we double-labeled NAc sections for eYFP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>, in green) and synaptophysin, a marker for presynaptic terminals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>, in red). ChETA-eYFP expression exhibited overlap with synaptophysin staining (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>, white arrows).

We observed no immediate effects of the laser treatment during the two sessions of training when light stimulation followed tone presentation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5âfigure supplement 2AâB</xref>). Strikingly, when we tested the rats again, without further experimental intervention 60 days after fear conditioning, the rats that had received optogenetic stimulation of the ChETA-eYFP-expressing BLA terminals in the NAc exhibited significantly reduced freezing behavior relative to control rats expressing eYFP alone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5âfigure supplement 2C</xref>). These results demonstrate that activation of the BLA-NAc circuit during fear extinction can significantly reduce the return of fear at a remote time point without affecting the acquisition of fear extinction, thus providing causal evidence that activity in the specialized BLA-NAc circuit promotes the persistence of fear extinction memory.</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>Activation of a BLA-NAc circuit increases activity in the infralimbic cortex but not in the BLA</title><p>The prelimbic (PL) and infralimbic (IL) areas of the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) are known to modulate fear, with the PL promoting fear learning and the IL promoting fear extinction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Sotres-Bayon and Quirk, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Senn et al., 2014</xref>).

To test for such potential effects, we used cFos immunolabeling to estimate potential activation of these cortical regions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>). Because the projections from the BLA to the NAc are predominantly ipsilateral (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Christie et al., 1985</xref>), we stimulated the BLA terminals in the NAc of one hemisphere in anesthetized rats [10â20 mW, 473 nm, 20âHz, 5 ms pulses, 65 s interstimulation interval, matching the parameters of the prior experiment in which optogenetic stimulation was administered during fear extinction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>)] (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6âfigure supplement 1</xref>) but visualized immunolabeling bilaterally to compare the effects of stimulation on the ipsilateral and contralateral mPFC.

Anesthetized rats received bilateral intra-NAc infusion of muscimol-bodipy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>) 20â40âmin before bilateral stimulation of the BLA-NAc (10â20 mW, 473 nm, 20âHz, 5 ms pulses, 65 s interstimulation interval). Muscimol infusion significantly reduced the number of cFos+ cells in the IL, as compared to the number observed following stimulation in the absence of muscimol (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>). Altogether, these results indicated that BLA-NAc stimulation results in activation of the IL, which is mediated, at least in part, by activity within the NAc.</p><p>Given our evidence that the BLA-NAc circuit is especially activated when reward conditioning was paired with extinction training, we next asked whether reward conditioning during fear extinction could also result in increased activity in the IL. We performed cFos immunolabeling of sections containing the mPFC from rats in the <italic>Ext-Ext</italic> and <italic>Ext-RC</italic> groups from <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>. We found significantly higher numbers of cFos+ neurons in the IL in the <italic>Ext-RC</italic> group than in the <italic>Ext-Ext</italic> group (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E</xref>), and we did not observe a difference in the PL (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6F</xref>).</p><p>These results suggest that activation of the BLA-NAc circuit results in activation of the IL, a brain region widely implicated in fear extinction learning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Sotres-Bayon and Quirk, 2010</xref>), and that this BLA-NAc circuit activation affected the PL, implicated in fear learning, to a lesser degree. These findings raise the possibility that activation of the NAc during fear extinction may facilitate the recruitment of a cortical brain circuit that promotes the decrease of long-term fear expression.</p><p>Targeting terminals of BLA neurons in the NAc could also lead to antidromic activation of the BLA itself. We tested for this possibility by performing <italic>in vivo</italic> recordings and cFos immunostaining in the BLA of anesthetized rats in which we optogenetically stimulated BLA terminals in the NAc expressing ChETA-eYFP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6âfigure supplement 2A</xref>). This stimulation did not alter multiunit activity in the BLA ipsilateral to the stimulation site in the NAc (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6âfigure supplement 2B</xref>). Since the projections from the BLA to the NAc are predominantly ipsilateralÂ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Christie et al., 1985</xref>), we stimulated the terminals from the BLA to the NAc unilaterally and imaged bilaterally to compare the effects of stimulation in the ipsilateral and contralateral BLA. The number of cFos+ cells in the BLA ipsilateral to the BLA-NAc optogenetic stimulation site was not significantly different from the BLA in naÃ¯ve rats (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6âfigure supplement 2C</xref>), nor was it significantly different in the BLA contralateral to the stimulation site (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6G</xref>). This result indicates that the stimulation we used does not significantly activate BLA neurons. However, it is possible that this stimulation results in selective antidromic activation of BLA neurons that express ChETA-eYFP.</p><p>To test this hypothesis, we used a double-labeling strategy to search for BLA neurons that were active (cFos+) and that express ChETA-eYFP (eYFP+). The number of cells double-positive for cFos and eYFP in the BLA was similarly low in the BLA ipsilateral to the stimulation site as compared to the BLA contralateral to the stimulation site (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6H</xref>). Also, we did not observe selective activation of BLA cells that express ChETA-eYFP (eYFP+): the number of cFos+ and eYFP+ double-positive cells was not higher than the cells that were both cFos+ and eYFP- in the BLA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6H</xref>).</p><p>In summary, we found no change in the firing rates of BLA neurons, nor changes of cFos labeling in the BLA during optogenetic stimulation of a BLA-NAc circuit. These results indicate that we likely achieved activation of the BLA-NAc projection terminals without major alterations of spike activity in the BLA.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>We found that a BLA-NAc pathway is activated by fear conditioning and fear extinction training. The enhanced recruitment of this circuit during extinction learning, achieved either by pairing reward with fear extinction training or by optogenetic stimulation of this circuit during fear extinction, increases the activation of the IL and reduces the return of fear months after fear extinction.</p><p>While activation of this pathway by extinction training scales proportionally with activation of the BLA by extinction training (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>), additional findings also bolster the claim that extinction training recruits the BLA-NAc circuit. The recruitment of this pathway by extinction is strongly related to the degree of extinction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1âfigure supplement 2</xref>) and activation of the BLA-NAc projection deepens long-termÂ extinction memoryÂ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). If activation of the BLA-NAc pathway was simply the result of chance, then one would not expect to observe a relationship between the magnitude of extinction learning and activation within this pathway.</p><p>This evidence provides support for the proposal that fear extinction may engage an opponent-process reward system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Luo et al., 2015</xref>), as suggested by studies in human subjects in whichÂ ventral striatum activations were observed on trials on which the aversive stimulus (shock) was omitted in fear extinction sessions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Raczka et al., 2011</xref>). Exposure therapy combined with recall of pleasant memories has been successfully used to treat PTSD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Hawk and Abel, 2011</xref>), but the mechanism by which this method achieves therapeutic efficacy and the relative efficacy of this treatment as compared to exposure therapy are not known. Previous rodent studies have tested the effect of reward conditioning on avoidance behavior shortly after fear extinction (24Â hr), but these studies have yielded conflicting results (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Nelson, 1966</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Richardson et al., 1982</xref>) and did not address long-term fear recall at remote time points. We found hereÂ that long-term spontaneous recovery of fear was significantly reduced when rats received reward conditioning combined with fear extinction, as compared to rats that received only extinction training following fear conditioning.</p><p>It may seem counterintuitive that the BLA-NAc pathway is similarly activated by the opposing behaviors induced by fear conditioning and fear extinction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1âfigure supplement 2D</xref>). One possibility is that fear conditioning and fear extinction activate valence-segregated populations of NAc-projecting cells within the BLA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Correia and Goosens, 2016</xref>). However, our observations that indiscriminate optogenetic stimulation of BLA terminals in the NAc promotes reward-seeking (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5âfigure supplement 1D</xref>) and the weakening of fear memory (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>) suggests that if such valence segregation exists, appetitive subcircuits dominate, consistent with previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Namburi et al., 2015</xref>). An alternative possibility is suggested by the observation that cFos expression is induced by both synaptic strengthening and synaptic weakening (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Lindecke et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Kemp et al., 2013</xref>). By this logic, cFos-related activation of the BLA-NAc pathway by fear conditioning may indicate synaptic weakening within the BLA-NAc circuit. Although activation of the BLA-NAc pathway is not selective for fear extinction, our data nonetheless support an important and novel role for this pathway in the long-term reduction of fear memory.</p><p>Neither reward conditioning during fear extinction nor optogenetic activation of the BLA-NAc circuit during fear extinction led to changes in across-session acquisition of fear extinction on Days 4 and 5, although it is possible that the overall low levels of freezing observed on Days 4 and 5 could make such a difference difficult to detect. However, both manipulations result in a significant reduction of fear expression two months after fear conditioning. Little is known about how fear recovers across time after extinction; future studies aimed at understanding this complex process and the BLA-NAc circuit effects on limbic networks could help to understand the efficacy of fear extinction-based treatments in humans.</p><p>The magnitude of the effects reported here are similar to those observed following manipulations of the IL region highlighted by our findings and known to regulate fear extinction memory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Sotres-Bayon and Quirk, 2010</xref>). The decrease in fear recall observed in rats that experience fear extinction with reward conditioning is comparable to the decrease of fear recall in animals subjected to microstimulation of theÂ IL during fear extinction: in previous studies, IL activity wasÂ positively correlated with fear extinction recall (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Milad and Quirk, 2002</xref>). We found here that optogenetic stimulation of the BLA-NAc circuit and also reward conditioning in combination with fear extinction lead to increases in activity, measured by cFos expression, in IL as well as in NAc itself, suggesting that these two brain regions may cooperate to decrease fear expression through mechanisms yet to be fully understood.</p><p>We did not find the optogenetic stimulation of BLA terminals in the NAc to be inherently rewarding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5âfigure supplement 1A</xref>), as shown in previous experiments in mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Britt et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Stuber et al., 2011</xref>). One possibility is that the optogenetic stimulation we applied targeted a smaller or specialized part of the NAc: the estimated volume of NAc in the rat is more than double that of the mouse, and the NAc is a heterogeneous structure. We did find, however, that stimulation of the BLA-NAc projection can increase reward-seeking (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5âfigure supplement 1CâD</xref>), which is consistent with the idea that the BLA-NAc circuit exerts a reward-related modulatory effect upon emotional learning.</p><p>Our findings demonstrate that the administration of reward conditioning during fear extinction training also reduces the return of fear memory approximately two months after fear conditioning. We show that such enhancement of the enduring reduction of fear could be induced by the engagement of the BLA-NAc circuit during fear extinction training. Connections from the BLA to the NAc have already been recognized as important for generating goal-directed behavior in response to appetitive cues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Ambroggi et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Ghitza et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Wan and Peoples, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Day et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Nicola et al., 2004a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">2004b</xref>). For example, by using a cue discrimination task similar to the one used in our reward conditioning paradigm, it has been shown that the BLA drives NAc neurons to encode the value of a reward-predictive cue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Ambroggi et al., 2008</xref>). It is possible that such cue-related plasticity is involved in the BLA-NAc circuit effects that we demonstrate here. Testing this idea by pharmacological inhibition of the BLA or temporally specific inhibition of the BLA-NAc circuit using cue-paired optogenetic silencing during fear extinction with reward conditioning is a natural further step, but these manipulations would produce ambiguous results because they would interfere with the successful acquisition of the rewarding conditioning by reducing or eliminating responding to the reward predictive cue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Ambroggi et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Stuber et al., 2011</xref>). Thus, determining the cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying the contribution of the BLA-NAc circuit activity during fear extinction with reward conditioning to the persistent reduction of fear remains to be determined.</p><p>We did not determine whether different populations of neurons are recruited by fear extinction with reward conditioning versus reward conditioning alone. An interesting possibility raised by our findings is that fear extinction and fear extinction combined with reward conditioning activate substantially overlapping populations of cells in the NAc, at least if the predictive cue is shared between the two experiences. In our experiments, fear extinction with reward conditioning was only effective when the tone paired with sucrose reward was the same as that previously paired with footshock (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>,<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2âfigure supplements 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2âfigure supplement 2</xref> versus <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2âfigure supplement 3</xref>). Even lacking a full understanding of NAc single neuron encoding of aversion, reward, or the absence of expected reinforcement, our findings suggest that fear extinction in which no explicit reward was present activates a BLA-NAc circuit, as does reward conditioning, but less effectively.</p><p>The NAc, the target of the BLA-NAc circuit identified here, regulates both aversive and appetitive behaviors, and evidence suggests that the NAc regions modulating these opposing behaviors are partially segregated along a rostro-caudal axisÂ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Basso and Kelley, 1999</xref>). The rostral-caudal border separating reward-related and aversive-related processing within the NAc is dynamic and altered by experience; for instance, stressful environments cause caudal fear-generating zones to expand rostrally (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Reynolds and Berridge, 2008</xref>). Because emotional experience changes across the fear extinction training, it is difficult to assess systematically whether recruitment of a BLA-NAc circuit by extinction varies along the rostral-caudal axis of the NAc, but our findings do indicate that the NAc can exert a modulatory role during fear extinction through activity of a BLA-NAc circuit. Of note, high frequency stimulation of the BLA produces synaptic depression in rostral NAc, but synaptic potentiation in caudal NAc (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Gill and Grace, 2011</xref>), and these synaptic changes are thought, respectively, to reduce fearful behaviors and to promote appetitive states (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Reynolds and Berridge, 2008</xref>). Because the presynaptic terminals originating in the BLA are broadly distributed across the NAc, it is possible that the BLA-NAc circuit biases the appetitive-aversive balance towards an appetitive state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Britt et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Stuber et al., 2011</xref>). Our observation that BLA-NAc optogenetic stimulation promotes reward-seeking (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5âfigure supplement 1CâD</xref>) is consistent with this interpretation.</p><p>The reduction of long-term fear memory that we found by adding reward conditioning to extinction training could be due to increased exploratory behavior or elevated blood glucose levels, but our findings do not favor these possibilities. Optogenetic stimulation of the BLA-NAc pathway produced a reduction of long-term fear memory similar in size to the reduction of long-term fear memory that we found by adding reward conditioning to extinction training. These results suggest that reward conditioning during fear extinction did not enhance extinction learning simply by promoting exploration, as there was no reward port in the optogenetic experiment to induce behaviors that could compete with freezing responses. Our optogenetic findings also suggest that reward conditioning during fear extinction did not enhance extinction learning by increasing blood glucose levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Gold et al., 2012</xref>). Rats receiving optogenetic stimulation did not receive reward (sucrose), and rats that did receive reward (sucrose) conditioning with a novel tone never paired with shock did not exhibit decreased fear recall. Our results instead favor the novel view that activation of the BLA-NAc circuit during extinction of fear reduces fear recall by strengthening extinction memory <italic>per se</italic>.</p><p>Potential confounds of the projection optogenetics strategy thatÂ we used include back-propagation of ChETA-induced action potentials or activation of fibers of passage running through the NAc region targeted by the laser illumination. We used optogenetic stimulation of the BLA-NAc circuit in anesthetized rats to examine the effect of this stimulation on different brain areas in the absence of behavioral confoundsÂ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6âfigure supplement 2</xref>). Our results suggest that back-propagation was unlikely to be responsible for the effects of stimulation on behavior because the laser stimulation in the NAc did not alter multiunit activity in the BLA ipsilateral to the stimulation site or the number of cFos+ nuclei in the BLA. Also, muscimol infusion in the NAc reduced IL activation mediated by BLA-NAc stimulation. These results indicate that optogenetic stimulation-induced activity in the NAc, contributes, at least in part, to the increased activity in the IL, a region known to modulate fear extinction. These results in anesthetized animals parallel our findings in awake, behaving rats: reward conditioning combined with fear extinction produced activation of the IL and, to a lesser extent, the PL (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). In addition, other studies have shown that stimulation of the NAc in awake animals activates the IL (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Vassoler et al., 2013</xref>), as we report here in anesthetized rats. However, the level of neuronal activation measured in the anesthetized rats does not reflect the level of neuronal activation in awake, behaving rats.</p><p>While anesthesia eliminates variability in cFos expression attributable to behavior, it suffers from a different set of caveats. Anesthesia alters the balance of neuronal excitation and inhibition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Hentschke et al., 2005</xref>), which could result in either false positive cFos signal (due to disinhibition) or a reduction in cFos signal (due to anesthesia-induced inhibition). Our data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6G</xref>) show that anesthetized and naÃ¯ve, awake rats express similar levels of cFos protein in the BLA, suggesting that it is unlikely that isoflurane anesthesia induces false positive cFos signal in the BLA. Nonetheless, it is possible that anesthesia could increase activity of inhibitory interneurons in the BLA and therefore mask potential antidromic activation of BLA neurons. Therefore, we must acknowledge that in the experiments where optogenetic stimulation wasÂ delivered toÂ anesthetized rats, the level of neuronal activation reported in the BLA, NAc, IL and PL is likely to be different from what would be measured in awake animals.</p><p>In addition, we cannot rule out a contribution by fibers of passage or collateral fibers stimulated by laser treatment of the BLA-NAc circuit. The ventral striatum contains fiber bundles from the ventral mPFC (a homolog of IL) and the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (a homolog to PL) to the amygdala and thalamusÂ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Lehman et al., 2011</xref>). Additionally, some BLA neurons projecting to the NAc have axon collaterals within the mPFC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">McDonald, 1991b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Shinonaga et al., 1994</xref>). Therefore, it is possible that activation of these collateral projections or fibers of passage could partially account for the increased activation of the IL as a result of optogenetic stimulation of the BLA-NAc circuit or of reward conditioning in combination with fear extinction. However our results clearly show that NAc activation itself contributes to the activation of the IL following stimulation of the BLA-NAc circuit.</p><p>An additional problem of our optogenetic strategy is that we undoubtedly activated a greater proportion of the BLA-NAc pathway with stimulation than is activated by fear conditioning or fear extinction. This is supported by the observation that the NAc shows greater expression of Nr4a3 after stimulation than is observed afterÂ extinction training alone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3âfigure supplement 1F</xref>). However, the degree to which our stimulation produced greater activation of this pathway than natural extinction training is difficult to quantify for several reasons, including: 1) Viral expression of the opsin targeted only a portion of the BLA, and light delivery targeted only a portion of the NAc, thus only a fraction of the BLA terminals within the NAc could be stimulated, and 2) Our CTB infusions targeted only a small portion of the NAc, and thus identified only a subset of the BLA cells that project to this area. By using activity-dependent expression of channelrhodopsin, as has been used in other experimental contexts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Redondo et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Gore et al., 2015</xref>), we could more precisely enhance activation of the extinction-related portion of the BLA-NAc circuit. In the absence of such a strategy, optogenetic stimulation may induce supra- or non-physiological changes. For example, the degree of activation that we observed in IL after optogenetic stimulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>) might be much greater than is achieved by any behavior. Also, our non-specific strategy may not only have activated BLA-NAc circuits that underlie fear extinction, but also those that may be activated by fear conditioning (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1âfigure supplement 2</xref>). Nevertheless, the fact that optogenetic stimulation produces a similar enhancement to the persistence of fear extinction memory (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>) as reward conditioning (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>) supports our claim that reward conditioning deepens the persistence of fear extinction memory via more effective recruitment of the BLA-NAc circuit than extinction alone.</p><p>Some of our experiments characterizing the impact of BLA terminal stimulation in the NAc were conducted in animals anesthetized with isoflurane (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figures 4</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">6</xref>). While some studies have shown that isoflurane anesthesia has no impact on reward-related induction of cFos in the NAc (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Kufahl et al., 2015</xref>) and that it does not induce cFos expression in either the NAc or IL (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Smith et al., 2016</xref>), many studies clearly show that anesthesia does alter neuronal properties (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chen et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Purtell et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Joksovic and Todorovic, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Ogawa et al., 1992</xref>). Therefore, we must acknowledge the possibility that the magnitude of the stimulation-induced changes that we report are different from what occurs in an awake, behaving animal.</p><p>Deep brain stimulation (DBS) in the NAc region has been found to reduce fear recall (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Whittle et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Rodriguez-Romaguera et al., 2012</xref>). It is still unclear if DBS therapeutic effects are due to increases or decreases in neuronal activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Nauczyciel et al., 2013</xref>). Using optogenetics, we found that stimulating BLA terminals within the NAc increased spike activity in the NAc (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figures 4DâE</xref>). Such activation accords with other optogenetic studies of BLA projection activation of BLA-NAc connections (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Britt et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Stuber et al., 2011</xref>), in which the optical stimulation of the BLA-NAc circuit results in local glutamate receptor-mediated excitatory postsynaptic currents in NAc neurons. Since local glutamate antagonism within the NAc elicits appetitive or aversive behaviors on its ownÂ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Reynolds and Berridge, 2008</xref>), the role of NAc glutamate receptors during optogenetic stimulation of the BLA-NAc circuit is difficult to assess.</p><p>Our findings raise the possibility that recruitment of a selective BLA-NAc circuit contributes to the mechanism by which counterconditioning achieves therapeutic efficacy. It may also explain a recent finding that replacing expected threat with a neutral, unexpected outcome also enhanced the short-term persistence of extinction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Dunsmoor et al., 2015</xref>). These results raise the possibility that the BLA-NAc circuit could be a valuable target for therapeutic intervention across a range of disorders in which extinction-based therapies are applied.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MaterialsÂ andÂ methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Subjects</title><p>All experiments used adult male Long-Evans rats (250â350âg, Taconic, Germantown, NY or Harlan, Indianapolis, IN), housed individually (20â22.2Â°C; 12-hr light-dark cycle, lights on from 6:45 am to 6:45 pm).

The animals were placed in individual chambers and video of each session was recorded. Each experiment used auditory fear conditioning wherein rats received 5 pairings of tone (2Â KHz, 8 KHz or white noise, 85dB, 10âs) and footshock (1âs, 0.6 mA) in a unique context (context A: metal shock grid floors, chamber fan on, 1% acetic acid odor, house and room lights off). Animals were allowed 3âmin to habituate to the chamber before tone-footshock pairings (5 pairings total) were given at intervals of 1âmin (tone exposure groups were subjected to the same context and tone but no footshock was administered). Thus, each fear conditioning session lasted a total of 8âmin 50 s.</p><p>Fear extinction was conducted 1, 2, 3, 4 and 55 (or 60) days after fear conditioning by placing the animals in a novel context (context B: white Plexiglas plastic floors, curved Plexiglas wall inserts, fans off, 0.3% Pine-Sol odor, house and room lights on or context C: white Plexiglas box, 0.3% Pine-Sol odor and room lights on). Two minutes after placement in context B or C, fear to the tone was assessed by presenting multiple discrete tones (10 for plasma corticosterone measurement experiments and 25 for all other experiments), with a 10âs duration and 1âmin inter-stimulus interval. In some cases, extinction sessions consisted of presentation of two different tones (as indicated in the figures; one of the tones was the same as used during the fear conditioning session and the other was a second novel tone). During the fear extinction sessions with two tones, the two tones were presented in a pseudorandom order (25 presentations of each tone). For tone or context exposure sessions, rats were subjected to the same tone and context or context only, respectively. Thus, for extinction sessions in which only one tone was presented, the total length of the session was 31âmin, 16 s. For extinction sessions in which two tones were presented, the total length of the session was 73âmin, 30 s. For extinction sessions in which plasma corticosterone was measured, the total length of the session was 13âmin, 10 s.</p><p>For some experiments, reward conditioning was used during the fear extinction sessions in Context B (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2âfigure supplement 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). In these experiments, the reward port was available to all animals in all groups during all sessions conducted in Context B, however sucrose was delivered through this port only to a subset of these groups in a subset of these sessions (as indicated in the respective experimental design panels). The reward port was never available during the fear conditioning in Context A.</p><p>Freezing was measured using commercial software (VideoFreeze, MedÂ Associates), automated video analysis (MATLAB) or human scoring (performed by people blind to the experimental conditions). Raw freezing levels, computed as the percent of the relevant time period spent freezing, is depicted in panels labeled '% Freezing'. The '% fear memory' measure was calculated to assess the spontaneous recovery of fear at remote time points (Day 55 or Day 60) following extinction training. The% fear memory recovered on Day 55 or 60 was expressed as a percentage of the original fear memory acquired according to the following formula: (% freezing on Day 55 or 60 Ã 100) Ã· (% freezing of Day 2). TheÂ % freezing on Day 55 or 60 was calculated asÂ % freezing during all Tone 1 trials on the first 5 trials on Day 55 or 60; theÂ % freezing on Day 2 was calculated as the% freezing on the first 5 trials of Tone 1 presentations on Day 2 (thus reflecting the maximum fear memory acquired). Due to lack of equipment, video recordings (and thus freezing measures) on Days 4 and 5 were not captured for a subset of the animals whose data is illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2âfigure supplement 2B</xref>.

The reward paired and neutral auditory stimuli (50 presentations in total) were presented in a pseudo-random order at intervals of 1âmin. The total length of each session was 73âmin, 30 s.

Reward port entries were calculated by recording beam breaks at the reward port during the 10 s tones and during the 10 s that preceded each tone. Normalized reward port entries were computed according to the following formula: [average port entries during the 25 tones â average port entries during the 25 pre-tone periods (10 s before each tone)].

See below for the details.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic> </p><p>This is an interesting paper on the role of a basolateral(BLA)-nucleus accumbens (NAc) circuit in fear extinction learning and counterconditioning in which animals undergo extinction in combination with appetitive learning. They show behaviorally that counterconditioning enhances the retention of extinction memories, while having no effect on the initial extinction learning. They then show that this pathway is recruited by extinction and that this recruitment is enhanced when extinction is done in combination with reward (counterconditioning). Furthermore, they demonstrate that direct stimulation of the BLA-NAc circuit enhances the retention of extinction memories. While the results are intriguing I have a number of substantive concerns which should be addressed:</p><p>1) For <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>, it is not clear whether the increase in cfos labeled BLA cells occurs preferentially in the NAc projecting cells or generally in the BLA. While the authors mention in the fifth paragraph of the subsection A BLA-NAc circuit is recruited by fear extinction that the a third of the cfos labeled cells are NAc projecting, they need to use a more rigorous statistical test to demonstrate that recruitment of this pathway is actually selective.</p><p>2) Related to the counterconditioning data presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>, the authors mention in the Methods that &quot;Rats that never displayed reward-seeking (failure to nose-poke) or discriminative reward conditioning (failure to nose-poke significantly more or faster to the CS paired with reward than to the neutral CS) were excluded from all analyses.&quot; This is potentially a major issue as they are selectively removing animals from one group. This could bias their results in the counterconditioning group such that the animals in this group have reduced fear specifically because these animals were removed and not because the counterconditioning enhanced extinction memory retention. For example, it is possible that animals that couldn't learn reward seeking had higher fear levels or more spontaneous recovery of extinction. The authors need to do something to address this problem. One possibility is to identify animals that would be excluded and then do extinction training and compare these animals that would have been excluded to a normal group of extinction animals to see if there are differences in spontaneous recovery. If not, then there is not a problem with the exclusion criteria.</p><p>Related to the above comment, they should state somewhere how many animals were excluded. Also, for the data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>, the authors should clarify whether this does or does not include excluded animals.</p><p>3) The authors should clarify in the Methods section whether the exact same box was used (including the availability of all apparatuses in box except reward) for both ext-ext and ext-RC groups? This is important as differences in the box could produce differences in extinction.</p><p>4) There are a number of issues with data presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>:</p><p>A) It is not clear why there is an inset to compare Ext-RC and RC groups. Ext-Ext, Ext-RC and RC groups should be in a single graph with appropriate statistical comparisons.</p><p>B) A negative control group should be included here to determine whether there is an increase above baseline in fos activation. One of the control groups used in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> would be sufficient.</p><p>C) For the BLA data in 3B and C, representative images should be shown somewhere.</p><p>D) One possibility is that extinction (or reward) preferentially activates NAc projectors early in learning and that the differences you see between extinction and reward learning are due to that and not because the extinction and reward are summating to activate more cells. It would ideal to run another group where tissue is collected after 1 day of extinction to match the single day of reward learning.</p><p>E) Also need negative control for the NAc Nr4a3 data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref> as it is not clear whether there is a significant Nr4a3 activation above baseline in the ext-ext group.</p><p>5) For the data presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>, they should show supplemental data with raw% freezing levels on day 2 and day 60 in supplement as they do for the data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>.</p><p>6) Though not absolutely necessary, inhibition of BLA-NAc terminals during extinction would be ideal to directly test whether the BLA-NAc projection participates causally in generating extinction. As it stands they present correlative evidence that the circuit is engaged, but the paper would much more compelling if they could make a causal link.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic> </p><p>This paper explores the role of the amygdala to ventral striatum (BLA to NAc) circuit in decreasing long-term fear. The paper makes a nice series of observations that emphasize the potential importance of this circuit -long recognized as mediating reward-related behavior in potentially modifying neural circuitry responsible for modulating fear responses on a long-term basis. Thus overall, I am supportive of publication of the paper. However, I have a number of issues that I think the authors should address to improve the paper.</p><p>1) Specificity of the recruitment of the BLA-NAc circuit during extinction and/or reward conditioning.</p><p>The authors' data largely rely on an observed increase following extinction or reward conditioning in double labeled cells in BLA using c-fos and CTB+ to mark activated cells that project to NAc. However, the authors do not address whether this increase in double labeling could be occurring by chance as a result of simply increasing the number of c-fos positive cells in BLA. In other words, increased double labeling would be expected simply by virtue of increasing the number of c-fos positive cells. If this is occurring by chance, then the evidence for specific recruitment of the BLA-NAc pathway would not be provided. Moreover, the statement that the proportion of activated BLA neurons that project to NAc increases with reward conditioning can't be supported without such statistical testing.</p><p>2) Potential non-physiological effects of optogenetic manipulation.</p><p>The authors report that only 5% of the NAc-projecting BLA neurons were double-labeled by c-fos and CTB+. This implies that 95% of the neurons activated by optogenetic manipulation were not activated by fear conditioning and extinction. The authors need to consider whether the effects they observe are non-physiological effects (essentially activating neurons not normally activated during the relevant behavior) given that they don't know much about the response properties of most of the neurons they are activating optogenetically. This type of issue applies to many (if not most) studies employing optogenetic methodology, but it is one that I think we all need to worry about more. A missing link in this paper is the specific activation only of those BLA cells that are activated by either extinction or reward conditioning. Approaches for accomplishing this type of manipulation are being developed, but it is not clear whether such approaches will work in these experimental paradigms. Nonetheless, recent work from Redondo et al. and Gore et al. both accomplished this type of manipulation in BLA, and these papers probably should have been discussed in the paper, as well as the recent paper from Namburi et al., which, though not using the type of manipulation used by Redondo and Gore, is also highly relevant.</p><p>3) Evaluation of physiological effects of optogenetic stimulation in anaesthetized rats.</p><p>I was disappointed that the examination of modulation in neural activity that could result from activation by optogenetic stimulation was done in anaesthetized rats. I understand why the authors may have done this for c-fos assays, but electrophysiology could have been performed in awake animals and short latency changes in activity could be observed in the absence of behavioral confound issues. Further, the authors could also inactivate the BLA while photoactivating terminals in NAc to test whether antidromic activation is playing a role. While I would not insist that the authors re-do all of these experiments, appropriate text needs to be added to the Discussion given that the findings may not hold in the absence of anaesthesia.</p><p>4) Accessibility of the manuscript.</p><p>I found the manuscript a difficult read. There is a lot of data, and it is often densely presented. Some of the figure legends are a page long, and many readers just won't engage them. Transitions between paragraphs often lack conceptual links. The Discussion reads in a somewhat rambling way, and parts of it are quite repetitive with the results. It takes many paragraphs for the authors to summarize their data rather having 1 or at most 2 succinct paragraphs followed by focused discussion. Again, I will not insist on changes here, but I think the authors would be well-served to revise the manuscript with these issues in mind; readers will find the work more accessible if they do so.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic> </p><p>This is an interesting and innovative report that shows that the activation of BLA-NAc circuit may underlie the facilitation effect on fear extinction caused by reward pairing. The data are important, and may provide a neural circuit mechanism for the counterconditioning therapy used to treat fear-related disorders. The topic has significant clinical relevance and is of great general interest. It is potentially suitable for publication in <italic>eLife</italic>. However, several issues need to be addressed or clarified before the full impact of these results can be determined.</p><p>In a first series of experiments, the authors performed double labeling experiments with retrograde tracer and cFos staining to show that the BLA-NAc circuit is recruited by fear extinction. However, I'm not fully convinced by the authors' implication that fear extinction activated extra NAc-projection neurons in BLA compared with the Fear group (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C and 1D</xref>). This is an unfair comparison for the following reasons. First, the authors chose to perfuse the animals 1 hr after the final behavior session. cFos signals usually peaks at 1.5~2hr after the behavior onset. As fear recall session perhaps lasts much shorter than fear extinction (I could not find details for the behavior protocol. How long is the extinction session? How many trials does it consist? Such essential information is missing from the Methods.), it is likely that less cFos signals in the Fear group was simply due to a shorter expression time from the stimulus onset. Second, the fear extinction session consists many more trials than the fear recall session, so should naturally induce more signals. It will be useful to compare the percentage of double-labeled neurons relative to cFos+ neurons following fear recall and fear extinction. The authors showed 31% for the extinction group. Is the percentage lower for the recall group?</p><p>To rule out the antidromic effect on behavior, a standard way would be inactivating the upstream BLA region while optogenetically activating the terminals in NAc. If the effect still lasted, it would be much more convincing than recording or cfos counting in anesthetized animals. This is technically feasible, as demonstrated by the NAc inactivation experiment in this manuscript.</p><p>Anesthetized animals are not the most ideal if awake behaving animals can be used. For measuring of IL cFos after BLA-NAc stimulation, the authors should use awake animals, since that's the physiological condition under which behaviors are measured.</p><p>Have the authors analyzed the correlation between the level of extinction and that of reward conditioning at the individual level?</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were requested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Amygdala-ventral striatum circuit activation decreases long-term fear&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and a Senior Editor. C Daniel Salzman (Reviewer #2) has agreed to reveal his identity.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>All the reviewers thought that the authors have addressed many of the previous concerns by adding new data and revising the manuscript (please see below for individual comments). However, during discussion, the reviewers found that there are some concerns that need to be addressed before publication. Specifically, although reviewers 1 and 2 initially found the revisions satisfactory, after discussion with reviewer 3 and the reviewing editor, all of us concurred that the request for additional experiments was reasonable.</p><p>In the previous review, the reviewers were concerned that there is no evidence supporting the specificity of the BLA-NAc circuit recruitment during fear extinction and/or reward conditioning. The authors have addressed this concern by removing &quot;specific&quot; from the texts. In addition, it was pointed out, in the previous review, that only 5% of the BLA-NAc circuit was labeled by c-fos while this pathway was activated optogenetically without further specificity. Although the authors point out that ChR2 is expressed in only a fraction of BLA-NAc projections, this does not solve the issue that ~95% of stimulated neurons are not c-fos positive. Furthermore, in response to the reviewer #3's comments regarding c-fos experiments in anesthetized animals (which was not &quot;essential&quot; in the decision letter), the authors state that &quot;it is unclear to us what additional information could be provided by the experiment suggested&quot;. We believe that performing c-fos experiments in awake animals is necessary to remedy the concern that the neuronal activity in anesthetized animals might not be normal.</p><p>Overall, the authors' responses to the above points were judged unsatisfactory. Whether the recruitment of BLA-NAc circuit has any predominant role in fear extinction remains unclear, and it is unclear whether optogenetic stimulation mimics physiological activities. The reviewers thought that these points are central to the present work and it is unlikely that these issues can be addressed simply by removing &quot;specific&quot;. Ideally, the specificity of BLA-NAc circuit recruitment should be tested experimentally by showing that there is less c-fos activation of another projection after late extinction (which we believe can be done in 1 month). In addition, performing c-fos experiments in awake animals is necessary to support the authors' claims that ontogenetic stimulation did not cause activation of collaterals and that the c-fos expressions observed after optogenetic stimulation reflect normal circuit effects.</p><p>Overall, we strongly prefer that you perform the above experiments. Even if the authors decide not to perform these experiments, the above issues must be discussed more carefully and thoroughly so that the readers can appreciate the major potential caveats of the experiments and interpretations.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic> </p><p>The authors have adequately addressed my concerns.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic> </p><p>I think the authors have fully taken into account my previous concerns, and I now support publication.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic> </p><p>The authors have addressed many of the comments and the manuscript has been improved with a good amount of data. However, I 'm surprised that the authors insisted on using c-fos data in anesthetized animals as critical evidence for specific circuit activation.</p><p>It is well known that anesthesia strongly alters the excitation/inhibition balance in the brain. Some neurons which are activated under normal physiological conditions could be silenced by unnaturally strong inhibition under anesthetized state, and appear c-fos negative. On the other hand, if the anesthesia hits more heavily on a group of GABAergic neurons that disinhibits other neurons, the latter neurons may appear falsely c-fos positive. Therefore, interpretation of c-fos data from anesthetized animals could be very misleading.</p><p>As the author was not able to show that BLA-NAc is selectively activated by extinction, the NAc terminal stimulation experiment became critical in addressing the specific role of the pathway in extinction. The authors took the absence of c-fos signals in YFP+ BLA neurons in anesthetized animals as the only evidence to rule out antidromic effect by the terminal stimulation. While I understand there might be technical issues involved in inactivating upstream BLA region, I do not see why the authors should not perform the c-fos experiment in awake animals, which is much more physiologically-relevant.</p><p>Similarly, activation of IL is an important mechanism the authors proposed to explain why BLA-NAc stimulation facilitates extinction. I am disappointed that this was again only supported by results in anesthetized animals. c-fos experiments in awake animals are totally feasible and not much more tedious than in anesthetized animals. The authors should repeat these two sets of experiments in awake animals.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.12669.025</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>Essential revisions:</italic> </p><p><italic>1) Specificity of the recruitment of the BLA-NAc circuit during extinction and/or reward conditioning. It is not clear whether the increase in c-fos labeled BLA cells occurs preferentially in the NAc projecting cells or generally in the BLA. If this is occurring by chance, then the evidence for specific recruitment of the BLA-NAc pathway would not be provided. This point needs to be explicitly analyzed.</italic> </p><p>We did not intend to claim that the activation of the BLA-NAc pathway is selective to extinction. We believe this issue may have arisen because we used the term specific to describe the anatomical and temporal specificity of our manipulations. It is clear that the double-labeling of cFos and CTB (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>), indicating activation of the BLA-NAc pathway, strongly parallels the elevated levels of cFos observed in all cells of the BLA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). We have modified the language of the text in our manuscript to clarify what we mean by specific each time it is used, and we also have almost eliminated our use of this term.</p><p>To directly address the issue of behavioral specificity, we conducted an additional experiment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1âfigure supplement 2</xref>). We examined the activation of this pathway by fear conditioning (<italic>Fear Cond</italic> group) and the activation of this pathway by lower levels of extinction training (<italic>Short ext</italic> group). We found that the BLA-NAc pathway was activated by fear learning. However, more importantly, and more relevant to our claims, we found that one session of extinction training recruited this pathway to a lesser degree than two sessions of extinction training. Critically, we also found that there is a strong, negative association between the extent to which the BLA-NAc pathway is activated and the fear expressed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1âfigure supplement 2F</xref>). We have added a paragraph to the Discussion to consider why both fear conditioning and fear extinction may activate the same BLA-NAc circuit.</p><p><italic>2) Data exclusions. It was noted that the authors excluded some samples/data, which might have biased some of the data analyses. The authors need to clarify this.</italic> </p><p>We have modified the Methods to explicitly disclose the number of rats excluded for these behavioral exclusion criteria. Of particular concern, Reviewer 1 noted that we excluded rats from the <italic>Ext-RC</italic> and <italic>RC</italic> groups that failed to display any indication of learning (either a failure to discriminate between the tone paired with sucrose and the tone never paired with sucrose, or a failure to nose-poke). The number of rats excluded for these reasons was very low (n=6). As requested by the Reviewer, we show that their behavior during fear conditioning and the first two extinction sessions did not differ from the other groups (see below). Thus, there is no data to support the claim that the data analysis is biased by the exclusions.</p><p><italic>3) Potential non-physiological effects of optogenetic manipulation. The data suggests that 95% of the neurons activated by optogenetic manipulation were not activated by fear conditioning and extinction. The authors need to consider whether the effects they observe are non-physiological effects.</italic> </p><p>We have added a paragraph to our Discussion to thoughtfully consider this point. While we acknowledge that optogenetic stimulation may produce supraphysiological effects, it is unlikely that the effects we observe are nonphysiological. The criticism that 95% of the neurons activated by optogenetic manipulation were not activated by fear conditioning+extinction rests on a faulty assumption that optogenetic stimulation activates 100% of the BLA-NAc circuit. However, it should be noted that viral expression of opsins in the BLA targeted only a subset of BLA cells, and thus only a portion of the BLA cells that project to the NAc. It is also important to note that our CTB infusions targeted only a small portion of the NAc, and thus identified only a subset of the BLA cells that project to this area. It is likely that our optogenetic manipulation likely targeted a portion of cells not activated by fear conditioning and extinction, but not nearly to the dramatic degree indicated here (95%). In addition, the magnitude of enhanced extinction persistence seen with stimulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>) is highly similar to the magnitude of enhanced extinction persistence seen with reward conditioning (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>), and these conditions that lead to greater persistence of extinction memory are associated with stronger activation of the IL but not PL (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C-F</xref>). Thus, the effects of optogenetic stimulation strongly parallel the effects induced by natural behavior.</p><p>As suggested by Reviewer 2, we have added text to the Discussion to consider how behavior-specific expression of opsins could be used to better restrict stimulation to the portion of the BLA-NAc circuit that is relevant to extinction. We greatly appreciate this suggestion.</p><p><italic>4) One of the reviewers raised various concerns in the experimental design and data analysis regarding the conclusion that the BLA-NAc circuit is recruited by fear extinction. See below for the details.</italic> </p><p>It is unclear whether this is a reference to Reviewer 1, point 3, or Reviewer 2, point 1. We have made extensive revisions in response to both comments. Please see below for the details.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic> </p><p><italic>1) For <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>, it is not clear whether the increase in cfos labeled BLA cells occurs preferentially in the NAc projecting cells or generally in the BLA. While the authors mention in the fifth paragraph of the subsection A BLA-NAc circuit is recruited by fear extinction that the a third of the cfos labeled cells are NAc projecting, they need to use a more rigorous statistical test to demonstrate that recruitment of this pathway is actually selective.</italic> </p><p>This is an important point, and we appreciate the Reviewer asking us to provide additional clarification. It was never our intention to claim that the activation of the BLA-NAc pathway is selective to extinction. While we did use the term specific to describe the recruitment of the BLA-NAc pathway during this behavior, we were using this to describe the anatomical and temporal specificity of our manipulations. Indeed, it is clear that the double-labeling of cFos and CTB (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>), showing activation of the BLA-NAc pathway, strongly parallels the elevated levels of cFos observed in all cells of the BLA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). We have modified the language of the text in our manuscript to clarify what we mean by specific, and we also greatly reduced our use of this term.</p><p>To better address this issue, we conducted an additional experiment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1âfigure supplement 2</xref>). We examined the activation of this pathway by fear conditioning (<italic>Fear Cond</italic> group), and the activation of this pathway by lower levels of extinction training (<italic>Short ext</italic> group). We found that the BLA-NAc pathway was activated by fear learning. However, more importantly, and more relevant to our claims, we found that one session of extinction training recruited this pathway to a lesser degree than two sessions of extinction training. Critically, we also found that there is a strong, negative association between the extent to which the BLA-NAc pathway is activated and the fear expressed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1âfigure supplement 2F</xref>).</p><p>It is important to note that brain circuits are rarely, if ever, behaviorally specific. Thus, the finding that the BLA-NAc pathway is recruited by fear conditioning does not detract from its role in fear extinction. Our data demonstrate clearly that optogenetic activation of this pathway enhances the persistence of extinction memory.</p><p>We have added a paragraph to the Discussion (third paragraph) to consider the surprising observation that the BLA-NAc pathway is activated by fear conditioning. In this paragraph, we explicitly state that the BLA-NAc circuit is not selective for fear extinction and we offer two possible explanations for why this circuit may be activated by both behaviors.</p><p><italic>2) Related to the counterconditioning data presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>, the authors mention in the Methods that &quot;Rats that never displayed reward-seeking (failure to nose-poke) or discriminative reward conditioning (failure to nose-poke significantly more or faster to the CS paired with reward than to the neutral CS) were excluded from all analyses.&quot; This is potentially a major issue as they are selectively removing animals from one group. This could bias their results in the counterconditioning group such that the animals in this group have reduced fear specifically because these animals were removed and not because the counterconditioning enhanced extinction memory retention. For example, it is possible that animals that couldn't learn reward seeking had higher fear levels or more spontaneous recovery of extinction. The authors need to do something to address this problem. One possibility is to identify animals that would be excluded and then do extinction training and compare these animals that would have been excluded to a normal group of extinction animals to see if there are differences in spontaneous recovery. If not, then there is not a problem with the exclusion criteria.</italic> </p><p>This is an important issue to address. We now report the numbers of these rats excluded for the three experiments affected by this criterion (subsection Reward conditioning, second paragraph). As suggested by the Reviewer, we examined their freezing behavior on Days 1-3 of the experiment, and did not observe any difference in fear acquisition or extinction during this period. These data are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Author response image 1</xref>. It is clear that the freezing behavior on Days 1-3 does not differ between the excluded rats (Ext-RC and did not learn RC) and the included rats (Ext-RC and Learned RC) (Mann-Whitney, p = 0.46).<fig id="fig7" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.12669.020</object-id><label>Author response image 1.</label><caption><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.12669.020">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.12669.020</ext-link></p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="x-tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-12669-resp-fig1-v1"/></fig></p><p><italic>A) Related to the above comment, they should state somewhere how many animals were excluded. Also, for the data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>, the authors should clarify whether this does or does not include excluded animals.</italic> </p><p>The numbers of rats excluded and the reasons for exclusion are now specified in the second paragraph of the subsection Reward conditioning. We now clarify in the Methods (subsection Statistical methods, second paragraph) that no data from excluded animals were included in any graph or analysis.</p><p><italic>3) The authors should clarify in the Methods section whether the exact same box was used (including the availability of all apparatuses in box except reward) for both ext-ext and ext-RC groups? This is important as differences in the box could produce differences in extinction.</italic> </p><p>This information is now provided in the Methods. To summarize, the reward port was present as an environmental cue for all Context B sessions for all groups in experiments where reward counterconditioning was used. The only difference was whether reward was delivered through the port during the session.</p><p><italic>4) There are a number of issues with data presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>:</italic> </p><p><italic>A) It is not clear why there is an inset to compare Ext-RC and RC groups. Ext-Ext, Ext-RC and RC groups should be in a single graph with appropriate statistical comparisons.</italic> </p><p>We used insets simply to highlight the relevant comparisons, and also draw attention to the critical comparison of interest (Ext-Ext vs. Ext-RC). The appropriate statistical comparisons are reported in the Results and figure caption.</p><p><italic>B) A negative control group should be included here to determine whether there is an increase above baseline in fos activation. One of the control groups used in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> would be sufficient.</italic> </p><p>The Reviewer is questioning whether the cFos activation in the Ext-Ext group is above baseline (the Nave group). This comparison was previously included in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>, but has also been examined in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1âfigure supplement 2</xref> of the revised manuscript. The expression of cFos in the BLA of Nave rats is extremely low and the expression of cFos cells in the <italic>Ext-Ext</italic> group is well above baseline.</p><p><italic>C) For the BLA data in 3B and C, representative images should be shown somewhere.</italic> </p><p>We have added representative images as <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref> (bottom panel).</p><p><italic>D) One possibility is that extinction (or reward) preferentially activates NAc projectors early in learning and that the differences you see between extinction and reward learning are due to that and not because the extinction and reward are summating to activate more cells. It would ideal to run another group where tissue is collected after 1 day of extinction to match the single day of reward learning.</italic> </p><p>Whether NAc-projecting BLA cells are preferentially activated by early or late learning is an important question. As requested, we have added a new experiment presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1âfigure supplement 2</xref> to address this point. It is clear from this new data that NAc-projecting BLA cells are activated to a greater extent in late extinction as compared to early extinction. Thus, it is highly unlikely that the greater activation of the BLA-NAc pathway in the Ext-RC or RC groups arises because these groups were sacrificed after the first day of learning the reward task.</p><p><italic>E) Also need negative control for the NAc Nr4a3 data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref> as it is not clear whether there is a significant Nr4a3 activation above baseline in the ext-ext group.</italic> </p><p>This data has been added as <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3âfigure supplement 3</xref>. The software that we used for imaging in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref> was replaced with an updated version with substantial differences. Because we could not image using the same parameters in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>, we could not add data from a Nave group to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>. We performed new labeling of tissue from Nave, Ext-Ext and Ext-RC groups.</p><p><italic>5) For the data presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>, they should show supplemental data with raw% freezing levels on day 2 and day 60 in supplement as they do for the data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>.</italic> </p><p>We apologize for the omission of some of the raw data. The raw % freezing for Day 2 was depicted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref> of our original submission and it is also depicted in this panel in the revised manuscript. The raw % freezing for Day 60 is now shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5âfigure supplement 2C</xref>. In addition, we have confirmed that all raw freezing levels are depicted in graphs labeled as % Freezing, whereas our measure of spontaneous recovery at remote time points after extinction training is shown in graphs labeled % Fear memory. We have revised our Methods (subsection Pavlovian fear conditioning, last paragraph) to clearly indicate this distinction.</p><p><italic>6) Though not absolutely necessary, inhibition of BLA-NAc terminals during extinction would be ideal to directly test whether the BLA-NAc projection participates causally in generating extinction. As it stands they present correlative evidence that the circuit is engaged, but the paper would much more compelling if they could make a causal link.</italic> </p><p>We fully agree that a causal link would be compelling. We present evidence that the enhanced recruitment of the BLA-NAc pathway during extinction facilitates long term fear extinction. However, we do not claim the necessity of this pathway for fear extinction learning.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic> </p><p><italic>1) Specificity of the recruitment of the BLA-NAc circuit during extinction and/or reward conditioning.</italic> </p><p><italic>The authors' data largely rely on an observed increase following extinction or reward conditioning in double labeled cells in BLA using c-fos and CTB+ to mark activated cells that project to NAc. However, the authors do not address whether this increase in double labeling could be occurring by chance as a result of simply increasing the number of c-fos positive cells in BLA. In other words, increased double labeling would be expected simply by virtue of increasing the number of c-fos positive cells. If this is occurring by chance, then the evidence for specific recruitment of the BLA-NAc pathway would not be provided. Moreover, the statement that the proportion of activated BLA neurons that project to NAc increases with reward conditioning can't be supported without such statistical testing.</italic> </p><p>This is an important point also noted by Reviewer 1. It was never our intention to claim that the activation of the BLA-NAc pathway is selective to extinction.

This implies that 95% of the neurons activated by optogenetic manipulation were not activated by fear conditioning and extinction.</italic> </p><p>This is not an accurate statement. While it is true that we found that 5% of the NAc-projecting BLA cells were double-labeled, this is an underestimate of this population. The CTB infusions target only a small portion of the NAc, and thus identify only a small subset of the BLA cells that project to this area. In addition, viral expression of the opsin in the BLA targets only a portion of the BLA, and thus only a portion of the BLA cells that project to the NAc. It is correct that our optogenetic manipulation likely targeted a substantial portion of cells not activated by fear conditioning and extinction, but not nearly to the dramatic degree indicated here (95%).</p><p><italic>The authors need to consider whether the effects they observe are non-physiological effects (essentially activating neurons not normally activated during the relevant behavior) given that they don't know much about the response properties of most of the neurons they are activating optogenetically. This type of issue applies to many (if not most) studies employing optogenetic methodology, but it is one that I think we all need to worry about more.</italic> </p><p>We fully agree with these statements and have added a new paragraph to the Discussion to acknowledge this shortcoming (twelfth).</p><p><italic>A missing link in this paper is the specific activation only of those BLA cells that are activated by either extinction or reward conditioning. Approaches for accomplishing this type of manipulation are being developed, but it is not clear whether such approaches will work in these experimental paradigms. Nonetheless, recent work from Redondo et al. and Gore et al. both accomplished this type of manipulation in BLA, and these papers probably should have been discussed in the paper, as well as the recent paper from Namburi et al., which, though not using the type of manipulation used by Redondo and Gore, is also highly relevant.</italic> </p><p>We agree with the Reviewer and have added citations for these three references in the Discussion. In addition, we now acknowledge that activity-dependent expression of opsins is an appealing approach for overcoming the non-physiological effects of stimulation.</p><p><italic>3) Evaluation of physiological effects of optogenetic stimulation in anaesthetized rats.</italic> </p><p><italic>I was disappointed that the examination of modulation in neural activity that could result from activation by optogenetic stimulation was done in anaesthetized rats. I understand why the authors may have done this for c-fos assays, but electrophysiology could have been performed in awake animals and short latency changes in activity could be observed in the absence of behavioral confound issues. Further, the authors could also inactivate the BLA while photoactivating terminals in NAc to test whether antidromic activation is playing a role. While I would not insist that the authors re-do all of these experiments, appropriate text needs to be added to the Discussion given that the findings may not hold in the absence of anaesthesia.</italic> </p><p>We have now added a paragraph to the Discussion (thirteenth paragraph) to explicitly acknowledge that quantitative findings may not hold in the absence of anesthesia. We also provide citations showing that cFos in the NAc and IL is not impacted by isoflurane anesthesia in other studies.</p><p><italic>4) Accessibility of the manuscript.</italic> </p><p><italic>I found the manuscript a difficult read. There is a lot of data, and it is often densely presented. Some of the figure legends are a page long, and many readers just won't engage them. Transitions between paragraphs often lack conceptual links. The Discussion reads in a somewhat rambling way, and parts of it are quite repetitive with the results. It takes many paragraphs for the authors to summarize their data rather having 1 or at most 2 succinct paragraphs followed by focused discussion. Again, I will not insist on changes here, but I think the authors would be well-served to revise the manuscript with these issues in mind; readers will find the work more accessible if they do so.</italic> </p><p>We thank the Reviewer for these comments; we appreciate the difficulty of presenting substantial quantities of data in an approachable manner. We have thoroughly edited our figure captions to shorten them by removing all redundant details. We have revised both our Results and Discussion sections to be more concise, while also adding in the new data and discussion points requested by all three Reviewers. We have added a brief summary at the start of the Discussion and removed redundant summary statements from the remainder of the Discussion.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic> </p><p><italic>In a first series of experiments, the authors performed double labeling experiments with retrograde tracer and cFos staining to show that the BLA-NAc circuit is recruited by fear extinction. However, I'm not fully convinced by the authors' implication that fear extinction activated extra NAc-projection neurons in BLA compared with the Fear group (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C and D</xref>). This is an unfair comparison for the following reasons. First, the authors chose to perfuse the animals 1 hr after the final behavior session. cFos signals usually peaks at 1.5~2hr after the behavior onset.</italic> </p><p>We performed an additional experiment to test this. We trained additional rats with two extinction sessions (as per <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>) and harvested the brains either 1 or 1.5 hr following the last extinction session. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1D</xref>, cFos protein expression in the BLA was significantly lower at 1.5 hr post-extinction than at 1 hr post-extinction.</p><p>It should also be noted that while reward-induced cFos mRNA expression in the BLA peaks 1.5 hr after behavioral onset and declines thereafter, cFos protein expression in the BLA reaches its peak at 1.5 hr after behavioral onset and remains at its asymptotic level for at least 30 min beyond this (see Xiu et al., Nat. Neurosci., 2014). Because our extinction sessions last approximately one hour and we sacrificed the rats one hour following this, we examined cFos expression at roughly two hours after behavioral onset, a time point consistent with the expected peak of cFos protein expression in the BLA.</p><p> <italic>(I could not find details for the behavior protocol. How long is the extinction session? How many trials does it consist? Such essential information is missing from the Methods.),</italic> </p><p>We apologize that this information was not included in the Methods. We have revised the text to explicitly state the length and the total number of trials in the fear conditioning, extinction, and recall sessions (subsection Pavlovian fear conditioning, last paragraph).</p><p><italic>As fear recall session perhaps lasts much shorter than fear extinction, it is likely that less cFos signals in the Fear group was simply due to a shorter expression time from the stimulus onset.</italic> </p><p>The Reviewer has made an astute observation, noting that the lower levels of activation of the BLA-NAc pathway in the <italic>Fear recall</italic> group compared to the <italic>Long ext</italic> group (formerly the <italic>Ext</italic> group) could be because these groups spend different amounts of time in the chamber. To address this, we added a new experiment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1âfigure supplement 2</xref>) in which we compared activation of the BLA-NAc pathway in a group of rats that received one day of extinction training (<italic>Short ext</italic> group) to activation of this pathway in a group of rats that received two days of extinction training (<italic>Long ext</italic> group). Importantly, the brains from both groups of animals were collected after the same behavioral experience (extinction lasting roughly 30 min); they differed only in whether they also experienced an extinction session the day before. We found that one session of extinction training recruited the BLA-NAc pathway to a lesser degree than two sessions of extinction training. Critically, we also found that there is a strong, negative association between the extent to which the BLA-NAc pathway is activated and the fear expressed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1âfigure supplement 2F</xref>).</p><p><italic>Second, the fear extinction session consists many more trials than the fear recall session, so should naturally induce more signals. It will be useful to compare the percentage of double-labeled neurons relative to cFos+ neurons following fear recall and fear extinction. The authors showed 31% for the extinction group. Is the percentage lower for the recall group?</italic> </p><p>As we note above, our new data show that session length does not determine the degree of activation of the BLA-NAc pathway. The Reviewer suggests that we could compare the percentage of the BLA-NAc pathway that is activated under different conditions. It is 31% for the <italic>Long ext</italic> group and 37% for the <italic>Fear recall</italic> group. In general, we find that any condition that activates the BLA-NAc pathway activates ~1/3 of the pathway. We do not understand why this occurs. It may be related to the fact that CTB infused into the NAc only labels a portion of the pathway. Alternatively, it may be that the number of cells activated by learning in the BLA is the result of a conserved, competitive process (Han et al., Science, 2007), and that the downstream impact in the NAc reflects this conserved process.</p><p><italic>To rule out the antidromic effect on behavior, a standard way would be inactivating the upstream BLA region while optogenetically activating the terminals in NAc. If the effect still lasted, it would be much more convincing than recording or cfos counting in anesthetized animals. This is technically feasible, as demonstrated by the NAc inactivation experiment in this manuscript.</italic> </p><p>We agree that this is technically feasible, but we believe that this labor-intensive experiment is unlikely to yield interpretable results. We show that optogenetic activation of BLA terminals in NAc deepens the persistence of fear extinction learning. Temporary inactivation of the BLA strongly impairs extinction learning and long-term extinction memory (Sierra-Mercado et al., Neuropsychopharmacology, 2011). If inactivation of the BLA during extinction learning <italic>without</italic> optogenetic stimulation impairs long-term extinction memory, then one cannot use this manipulation to determine whether the modulatory effect of optogenetic stimulation is eliminated. It is for this reason that we performed the experiment to characterize the impact of BLA terminal stimulation in the NAc in anesthetized animals. If substantial antidromic activation of the BLA occurred, it should have induced cFos expression in the BLA cells expressing the opsin (eYFP+), but we did not observe this (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6H</xref>). This provides strong evidence that there was minimal antidromic activation of the BLA when stimulating BLA terminals in the NAc.</p><p><italic>Anesthetized animals are not the most ideal if awake behaving animals can be used. For measuring of IL cFos after BLA-NAc stimulation, the authors should use awake animals, since that's the physiological condition under which behaviors are measured.</italic> </p><p>It is unclear to use what additional information could be provided by the experiment suggested. We show clearly, in anesthetized rats, that optogenetic stimulation of BLA terminals in the NAc leads to activation of the IL (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>). We make no claims that this is a quantitative representation of what occurs in awake, behaving rats. We also show, in awake, behaving rats, that the IL is more strongly recruited by extinction training followed by reward conditioning than extinction training alone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E</xref>). It is this latter point which is the most important and relevant to our claims.</p><p><italic>Have the authors analyzed the correlation between the level of extinction and that of reward conditioning at the individual level?</italic> </p><p>We have performed this analysis, correlating the% Freezing on Day 55 with the latency to nose-poke on Day 5 (after the second day of reward conditioning), across individual animals. As can be seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Author response image 2</xref>, there is no significant correlation (R<sup>2</sup> = 0.035).

The authors have addressed this concern by removing &quot;specific&quot; from the texts.</italic></p><p><italic>Overall, the authors' responses to the above points were judged unsatisfactory. Whether the recruitment of BLA-NAc circuit has any predominant role in fear extinction remains unclear, and it is unclear whether optogenetic stimulation mimics physiological activities. The reviewers thought that these points are central to the present work and it is unlikely that these issues can be addressed simply by removing &quot;specific&quot;. Ideally, the specificity of BLA-NAc circuit recruitment should be tested experimentally by showing that there is less c-fos activation of another projection after late extinction.</italic></p><p>This criticism pertains to a fundamental issue of whether the BLA-NAc recruitment by extinction is <italic>specific</italic>. There are several definitions of specificity, and it is incorrect to characterize our response to this criticism as simply removing the word specific from the text.</p><p>Specificity may refer to behavioral specificity. We previously performed an additional experiment to show that activation of the BLA-NAc circuit was <italic>not</italic>specific to fear extinction; fear conditioning produced a similar activation of this circuit.</p><p>Specificity may also refer to anatomical specificity, meaning that only certain outputs of any given brain region are recruited by behavior. It has been argued by the Reviewers that the activation of the BLA-NAc pathway that we reported is not anatomically specific because it simply mirrors overall activation [measured by immediate early gene (IEG) expression] within BLA after extinction learning. However, to argue that activation measured by IEG expression is not related to behavior requires that IEG expression be expressed randomly. However, IEG expression during memory encoding and retrieval forms the basis for tag and manipulate strategies to identify engrams, and is thus a reliable marker for cells that participate in memory formation or retrieval (Josselyn, Keler, Frankland, Nat. Neurosci. Rev., 2015). Our claim is that lengthy extinction training activates a greater proportion of the BLA than is observed in nave rats or rats in the early stages of extinction, including BLA cells that project to the NAc.</p><p>It was argued that anatomical specificity should be shown by demonstrating that at least one other BLA projection is not activated by extinction learning. While we agree that the proposed experiment is an interesting idea, this is not a simple experiment. It is not obvious what BLA projection would exhibit little to no cFos activity after fear extinction (particularly because cFos may mark both synaptic strengthening and synaptic weakening), and thus multiple projections would need to be tested. This systematic analysis of different projections from the BLA would be very informative for the field and would, on its own, provide data for a single publication.</p><p>The Reviewing Editor suggested that a promising pathway to show the absence of activation by extinction learning might be the BLA-CeM because Namburi et al. (2015) have argued that this pathway is specifically activated by fear learning, not reward learning. It is important to acknowledge two specific considerations regarding this point. First, fear extinction sessions involve both the expression of previously acquired fear as well as the acquisition of extinction. Thus, it is highly likely that the BLA-CeM pathway is activated during fear extinction. Second, although the Namburi et al. paper is often cited as a demonstration of anatomical specificity, this is a mis-interpretation of the findings. The authors delivered retrobeads to either the CeM or the NAc to visualize BLA cells that projected to these brain regions. The findings reported by Namburi et al. hinge on the argument that BLA cells project to exclusively to the NAc or the CeM. However, the mutual exclusivity of these BLA projections was not quantified or demonstrated. It is apparent from <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Author response image 3</xref> (modified from Figure 1B in Namburi et al.) that a substantial portion of BLA cells project to both the CeM and NAc (shown by orange arrows which indicate cell bodies which contain retrobeads from both CeM and NAc). In this regard, for all of the experiments in Namburi et al., a substantial proportion of NAc projectors or CeM projectors actually projected to both targets. Thus, this paper should not be used to support claims of anatomical specificity.<fig id="fig9" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.12669.022</object-id><label>Author response image 3.</label><caption><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.12669.022">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.12669.022</ext-link></p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="x-tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-12669-resp-fig3-v1"/></fig></p><p>It is essential to recognize that our claim that extinction learning recruits a BLA-NAc circuit is supported by multiple findings. For example, the recruitment of this pathway by extinction is strongly related to the degree of extinction (greater pathway activation = less fear; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1âfigure supplement 2</xref>) and we had already shown that selective activation of the BLA-NAc projection deepens extinction learning (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). We also observe that activation of the NAc by extinction training (measured via Nr4a3 expression in NAc) is strongly related to the degree of extinction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Author response image 4</xref>; greater NAc activation = less fear). If activation of the BLA-NAc pathway was truly the result of chance, then one would not expect to observe a relationship between the magnitude of extinction learning and activation within this pathway. We have added text to consider this point in the Discussion (second paragraph).<fig id="fig10" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.12669.023</object-id><label>Author response image 4.</label><caption><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.12669.023">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.12669.023</ext-link></p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="x-tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-12669-resp-fig4-v1"/></fig></p><p><italic>In addition, it was pointed out, in the previous review, that only 5% of the BLA-NAc circuit was labeled by c-fos while this pathway was activated optogenetically without further specificity. Although the authors point out that ChR2 is expressed in only a fraction of BLA-NAc projections, this does not solve the issue that ~95% of stimulated neurons are not c-fos positive.</italic> </p><p>An additional concern was raised because we report that extinction learning produces activation of only 5% of the BLA-NAc pathway. However, there are several additional points which are not being considered when making this assertion. First, as we noted in the text, nearly one third of all cFos induced by extinction training is expressed in BLA cells that project to the NAc. This is a large proportion of the cFos induced by extinction training. Second, the projection from the BLA to the NAc is substantial. We have added a new analysis showing that ~27% of the cells in the BLA regions we analyzed have projections to the NAc, a finding consistent with previous studies (McDonald, 1991). We have modified the text of the Results (subsection A BLA-NAc circuit is recruited by fear extinction, fourth paragraph) to include this information.</p><p>Regardless, we do agree that optogenetic stimulation cannot precisely model physiological activities under the experimental conditions used, as we are randomly infecting and stimulating BLA neurons with terminals in the NAc. We have provided additional text to more deeply consider this caveat in the Discussion of the paper (fourteenth paragraph).</p><p><italic>Furthermore, in response to the reviewer #3's comments regarding c-fos experiments in anesthetized animals (which was not &quot;essential&quot; in the decision letter), the authors state that &quot;it is unclear to us what additional information could be provided by the experiment suggested&quot;. We believe that performing c-fos experiments in awake animals is necessary to remedy the concern that the neuronal activity in anesthetized animals might not be normal.</italic> </p><p>We agree that doing stimulations in awake and anesthetized animals is very different, but both approaches are hampered by different caveats:</p><p>In the case of anesthetized recordings, we agree with Reviewer 3 that the isoflurane anesthesia may alter the balance of excitation and inhibition, which could result in false positive cFos (due to disinhibition) or lack of normally activated cFos neurons (due to extra inhibition). However, previous studies looking at cFos expression in the amygdala, infralimbic cortex, nucleus accumbens and other brain areas have not found a significant difference between animals exposed to a room versus animals that undergo isoflurane anesthesia (Smith et al., Neurosci., 2016). Additionally, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6G</xref> shows that anesthesia does not alter cFos numbers in the BLA as compared to Nave awake rats, indicating that, in the absence of stimuli, false positive cFos (due to disinhibition) is highly unlikely. It remains possible that anesthesia could increase activity of inhibitory interneurons in the BLA and therefore mask potential antidromic activation of BLA neurons. We have modified our Discussion to acknowledge the important caveats in experiments with anesthetized preparations (twelfth and fifteenth paragraphs).</p><p>It is also important to note that other studies have shown that stimulation of the nucleus accumbens in awake animals activates the IL (Vassoler et al., J. Neurosci., 2013), just as we report here in anesthetized animals. Thus, this provides further evidence that our stimulation paradigm produces physiologically relevant effects in circuits known to regulate fear extinction. It is also important to note that our stimulation produced activation of IL only in the IL contralateral to the hemisphere of stimulation, consistent with the finding that the dominant projection of the NAc to the IL is contralateral. It is also important to note that stimulation produced a much smaller activation within PL, consistent with previous findings that the NAc projections to the IL are much greater than to the PL. Finally, we also reported that extinction training activated the IL, but not the PL. We also agree with the comments of Reviewer 3 and now we consider these as potential caveats in the interpretation of the results from the optogenetic stimulation experiments in anesthetized rats. But we also note that there were strong parallels between what we observed in anesthetized rats and what we observed in awake, behaving rats.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic> </p><p><italic>The authors have addressed many of the comments and the manuscript has been improved with a good amount of data. However, I 'm surprised that the authors insisted on using c-fos data in anesthetized animals as critical evidence for specific circuit activation.</italic> </p><p><italic>It is well known that anesthesia strongly alters the excitation/inhibition balance in the brain. Some neurons which are activated under normal physiological conditions could be silenced by unnaturally strong inhibition under anesthetized state, and appear c-fos negative. On the other hand, if the anesthesia hits more heavily on a group of GABAergic neurons that disinhibits other neurons, the latter neurons may appear falsely c-fos positive. Therefore, interpretation of c-fos data from anesthetized animals could be very misleading.</italic> </p><p><italic>As the author was not able to show that BLA-NAc is selectively activated by extinction, the NAc terminal stimulation experiment became critical in addressing the specific role of the pathway in extinction. The authors took the absence of c-fos signals in YFP+ BLA neurons in anesthetized animals as the only evidence to rule out antidromic effect by the terminal stimulation. While I understand there might be technical issues involved in inactivating upstream BLA region, I do not see why the authors should not perform the c-fos experiment in awake animals, which is much more physiologically-relevant.</italic> </p><p>As the editor noted above, this experiment (BLA inactivation during stimulation) was not &quot;essential&quot; in the previous decision letter; because it was a non-essential revision and because of the lengthy nature of these experiments, we decided not to pursue this experiment after the first review. We performed the experiments in anesthetized animals because we believed that the anesthesia was likely to interfere less with the cFos induced by optogenetic stimulation in different brain areas than behavior, which itself induces cFos expression in multiple brain circuits. We fully agree with the Reviewer that these are important concerns. We have thoroughly revised the Discussion to provide a fuller and more balanced perspective on the caveats of anesthetized preparations (twelfth and fifteenth paragraphs).</p><p><italic>Similarly, activation of IL is an important mechanism the authors proposed to explain why BLA-NAc stimulation facilitates extinction. I am disappointed that this was again only supported by results in anesthetized animals. c-fos experiments in awake animals are totally feasible and not much more tedious than in anesthetized animals. The authors should repeat these two sets of experiments in awake animals.</italic> </p><p>We fully understand the reviewers concerns. However, again we would like to point out that studies looking at cFos expression in the amygdala, infralimbic cortex and nucleus accumbens have not found a significant difference between animals exposed to the anesthesia room versus animals that undergo isoflurane anesthesia (Smith et al., Neurosci., 2016). Therefore, while we consider the possibility that the increase in cFos+ cells in the IL after BLA-NAc stimulation could be due to false positive cFos (due to disinhibition), we also note that 1) other studies have shown that stimulation of the nucleus accumbens in awake animals activates the IL (Vassoler et al., J. Neurosci., 2013), just as we report here in anesthetized animals, 2) our stimulation produced activation of IL only in the IL contralateral to the hemisphere of stimulation, consistent with the finding that the dominant projection of the NAc to the IL is contralateral, 3) stimulation produced a much smaller activation within PL, consistent with previous findings that the NAc projections to the IL are much greater than to the PL, and 4) extinction training activated the IL, but not the PL. Thus, there were strong parallels between what we observed in anesthetized rats and what we observed in awake, behaving rats. Nonetheless, we have revised the Discussion to fully acknowledge the shortcomings of using anesthesia (twelfth and fifteenth paragraphs).</p></body></sub-article></article>
