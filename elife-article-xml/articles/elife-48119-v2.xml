Evolution of isoform function is a potential route to adapt to new environments. Here we show that de novo, beneficial alleles in the <italic>nurf-1</italic> gene became fixed in two laboratory lineages of <italic>C. elegans</italic> after isolation from the wild in 1951, before methods of cryopreservation were developed. <italic>nurf-1</italic> encodes an ortholog of BPTF, a large (&gt;300 kD) multidomain subunit of the NURF chromatin remodeling complex. Using CRISPR-Cas9 genome editing and transgenic rescue, we demonstrate that in <italic>C. elegans</italic>, <italic>nurf-1</italic> has split into two, largely non-overlapping isoforms (NURF-1.D and NURF-1.B, which we call Yin and Yang, respectively) that share only two of 26 exons. Both isoforms are essential for normal gametogenesis but have opposite effects on male/female gamete differentiation. Reproduction in hermaphrodites, which involves production of both sperm and oocytes, requires a balance of these opposing Yin and Yang isoforms. Transgenic rescue and genetic position of the fixed mutations suggest that different isoforms are modified in each laboratory strain. In a related clade of <italic>Caenorhabditis</italic> nematodes, the shared exons have duplicated, resulting in the split of the Yin and Yang isoforms into separate genes, each containing approximately 200 amino acids of duplicated sequence that has undergone accelerated protein evolution following the duplication. Associated with this duplication event is the loss of two additional <italic>nurf-1</italic> transcripts, including the long-form transcript and a newly identified, highly expressed transcript encoded by the duplicated exons. We propose these lost transcripts are non-functional side products necessary to transcribe the Yin and Yang transcripts in the same cells. Our work demonstrates how gene sharing, through the production of multiple isoforms, can precede the creation of new, independent genes.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>other <italic>Caenorhabditis</italic> species</kwd><kwd>Isoform evolution</kwd><kwd>adaptive conflict</kwd><kwd>alternative transcripts</kwd><kwd>chromatin remodeling</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>C. elegans</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000057</institution-id><institution>National Institute of General Medical Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01GM114170</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>McGrath</surname><given-names>Patrick T</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000057</institution-id><institution>National Institute of General Medical Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01GM121688</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ellis</surname><given-names>Ronald E</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Gene sharing through different isoforms can precede the formation of independent genes.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>There is general interest in understanding how animals adapt to new environments. What are the alleles that matter to positive selection and what sort of genes do they target? Since methods were developed to map and identify the genes harboring causative genetic variation, researchers have often isolated changes in the same gene in different populations or species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib101">Wood et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Martin and Orgogozo, 2013</xref>). Besides targeting specific genes, evolution can target classes of genes that share molecular features such as biochemical (<italic>e.g.</italic> chemoreceptor genes; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bachmanov and Beauchamp, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Keller et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib100">Wisotsky et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Lunde et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">McRae et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">McBride et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Greene et al., 2016a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Greene et al., 2016b</xref>) or developmental function (<italic>e.g.</italic> master regulators of cell fate; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Sucena et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Colosimo et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Chan et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib105">Yang et al., 2018</xref>). One molecular feature predicted to be important for evolution is the ability of genes to produce multiple protein isoforms. A single protein-coding gene can produce multiple isoforms using alternative transcription initiation and termination sites combined with alternative splicing between exons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Pan et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Pal et al., 2011</xref>). Isoform-specific evolution is found throughout vertebrates, including recent evolution of transcript expression in primates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Barbosa-Morais et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Merkin et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Shabalina et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib107">Zhang et al., 2017</xref>). Whether the increase in transcriptomic diversity is important for adaptive evolution remains an important question, and only a few examples have shown how isoform evolution could be involved in phenotypic diversity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Mallarino et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>The ability of a gene to produce multiple protein isoforms might also play a role in the genesis of new genes. Over long evolutionary timescales, gene duplication and diversification can create paralogous genes with different functions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Ohno, 1970</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Innan and Kondrashov, 2010</xref>). One central mystery in this process is the order of these two events; do mutations that duplicate genes occur first or does functional diversification preclude the duplication event? One mechanism the latter route can happen through is by gene sharing, or the ability of a gene to create multiple protein products (or a single protein product) that have two or more distinct functions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Hughes, 1994</xref>). If each isoform acts in different tissues or plays distinct roles in biological processes, subsequent duplication mutations can result in the separation of these isoforms into two distinct genes.</p><p>As a model for understanding the genetic basis of adaptive evolution in an animal model, we use the small nematode <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans.</italic> Besides its genetic tractability, use of this organism allows the analysis of evolution at different timescales. For example, experimental evolution can be used to study evolutionary processes in controlled environments on the order of 10â1000 generations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Gray and Cutter, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">TeotÃ³nio et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Penley et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Chelo et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Saxena et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib99">Wernick et al., 2019</xref>). For longer timescales, a growing number of isolated and sequenced <italic>Caenorhabditis</italic> species can be used to study genetic differences responsible for species-level differences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Ting et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib106">Yin et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Bi et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Stevens et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>For understanding short-term adaptation, we study two laboratory strains of <italic>C. elegans</italic>, called N2 and LSJ2, which descended from a single hermaphrodite isolated in 1951 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). These two lineages split from genetically identical populations between 1957 and 1958 and evolved in two very different laboratory environments â N2 grew on agar plates seeded with <italic>E. coli</italic> bacteria and LSJ2 in liquid cultures containing liver and soy peptone extracts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">McGrath et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">McGrath et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Sterken et al., 2015</xref>). By the time permanent means of cryopreservation were developed, approximately 300â2000 generations had passed, andÂ ~Â 300 new mutations arose and fixed in one of the two lineages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">McGrath et al., 2011</xref>). Despite their genetic similarity, substantial divergence has occurred between these strains in terms of phenotype and fitness, including a large number of developmental, behavioral, and reproductive traits. Use of these strains allow us to identify causal genetic variants responsible for phenotypic and fitness changes. To date, five de novo, causal genetic variants have been identified in either the N2 or LSJ2 lineage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">de Bono and Bargmann, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">McGrath et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Persson et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">McGrath et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Duveau and FÃ©lix, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Large et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Large et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib108">Zhao et al., 2018</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.48119.002</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>An N2-derived genetic variant in the intron of <italic>nurf-1</italic> increases fitness in laboratory conditions.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) History of two laboratory adapted <italic>C. elegans</italic> strains N2 and LSJ2, which descend from the same individual hermaphrodite isolated in 1951.

The difference in fitness of this allele in the two laboratory environments is potentially determined by how the life-history tradeoffs map into reproductive success.</p><p>Studies of <italic>nurf-1</italic> and its orthologs provide fundamental support for its role as a life history regulator. <italic>nurf-1</italic> encodes an ortholog of mammalian BPTF, a subunit of the NURF chromatin remodeling complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Barak et al., 2003</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). <italic>BPTF</italic> encodes a large protein containing a number of domains that facilitate recruitment of NURF to specific regions of the genome for chromatin remodeling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Alkhatib and Landry, 2011</xref>), including domains that interact with sequence-specific transcription factors and three PHDs and a bromodomain that facilitate interactions with modified nucleosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Li et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib103">Wysocka et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Kwon et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Ruthenburg et al., 2011</xref>). Through its DDT domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Fyodorov and Kadonaga, 2002</xref>), BPTF cooperates with ISWI to slide nucleosomes along DNA, changing access of promoter regions to transcription factors that drive gene transcription. In mammals, BPTF regulates cellular differentiation and homeostasis of specific cell-types and tissues, including the distal visceral endoderm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Landry et al., 2008</xref>), ecoplacental cone (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Goller et al., 2008</xref>), hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib104">Xu et al., 2018</xref>), mammary stem cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Frey et al., 2017</xref>), T-cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib102">Wu et al., 2016</xref>), and melanocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Koludrovic et al., 2015</xref>). In <italic>Drosophila</italic>, the ortholog to BPTF, NURF301, regulates the heat shock response, pupation, spermatogenesis, and innate immunity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Badenhorst et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Badenhorst et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Kwon et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Kwon et al., 2009</xref>). Many of these traits can be viewed as life-history tradeoffs, <italic>e.g.</italic> large energetic investments in individual survival through the development of the immune system vs. energetic transfers to offspring in the placenta or mammary glands. The evolution of BPTF/NURF-1 function might also be relevant in human disease. Genetic alterations in <italic>BPTF</italic> have been reported in tumors, including gene amplification and point mutations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Buganim et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">BalbÃ¡s-MartÃ­nez et al., 2013</xref>). In addition, BPTF has been shown to be required for the transcriptional activity of c-MYC, a major human oncogene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Richart et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>In this paper, we continue our studies of the evolution of the N2/LSJ2 laboratory strains. We demonstrate that an independent, beneficial mutation in the <italic>nurf-1</italic> gene was fixed in the N2 lineage, suggesting that <italic>nurf-1</italic> is a preferred genetic target for laboratory adaptation. To understand why <italic>nurf-1</italic> might be targeted, we explored the in vivo role in <italic>C. elegans</italic> development by taking advantage of CRISPR-Cas9 to test causal relationships that inform laboratory evolution and fitness effects. Our work suggests that the large, full-length isoform of <italic>nurf-1</italic>, primarily studied in mammals, is dispensable for development. Instead, two, largely non-overlapping isoforms are both essential for reproduction, having opposing effects on cellular differentiation of gametes into sperm or oocytes. Our results suggest that the ability of <italic>nurf-1</italic> to regulate life history tradeoffs is the result of exquisite regulation of NURF function through the balance of two competing isoforms, reminiscent of the principle of Yin and Yang. Finally, we demonstrate that these two isoforms have split into separate genes in a clade of related nematodes, potentially resolving transcriptional and functional conflict between the Yin and Yang isoforms transcription and function. Our work demonstrates how evolution of isoforms can precede the origin of a new gene, supporting a role for gene sharing in the origin of functionally novel proteins.</p><sec id="s1-1"><title>An N2-derived variant in the second intron of <italic>nurf-1</italic> increases fitness and brood size in laboratory conditions</title><p>We previously mapped differences in a number of traits (including reproductive rate, fecundity, toxin and anthelmintic sensitivity, and laboratory fitness) between N2 and LSJ2 to a QTL centered over <italic>nurf-1,</italic> which contains a derived mutation in both the N2 and LSJ2 lineages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A and B</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Large et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Large et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib109">Zhao et al., 2019</xref>). The LSJ2 allele of <italic>nurf-1</italic> contains a 60 bp deletion in the 3â end of the coding region of the gene, overlapping the stop codon and probably resulting in the translation of parts of the 3â UTR. The N2 allele of <italic>nurf-1</italic> contains an SNV that converts an A to a T in a homopolymer run of Ts in the 2<sup>nd</sup> intron (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). Using CRISPR-Cas9-based genome editing, we previously demonstrated that the LSJ2-derived deletion accounted for a large portion of the trait variance in reproductive rate explained by the QTL. However, it did not explain the entire effect of this locus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Large et al., 2016</xref>). We decided to test whether this additional genetic variant or variants affected fitness of the animals in laboratory conditions using a previously described pairwise competition assay (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib108">Zhao et al., 2018</xref>). To do so, we took advantage of three strains we had previously created; CX12311 is a near isogenic line with ancestral (non-N2) alleles of <italic>npr-1</italic> and <italic>glb-5</italic> crossed into an otherwise N2 genetic background, which we have used to eliminate the fitness and phenotypic effect of derived (N2) alleles of <italic>npr-1</italic> and <italic>glb-5</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib108">Zhao et al., 2018</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref> - referred to as N2*), NIL<sub>(<italic>nurf-1</italic>,LSJ2&gt;N2*)</sub> is a near isogenic line containing LSJ2 alleles of both <italic>nurf-1</italic> mutations backcrossed into an N2* background (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Large et al., 2016</xref>), and ARL<sub>(del</sub>,<sub>LSJ2&gt;N2*)</sub> is an allelic replacement line containing the LSJ2-derived 60 bp deletion edited into the N2* strain using CRISPR-Cas9. Phenotypic differences between the NIL<sub>(<italic>nurf-1</italic>,LSJ2&gt;N2*)</sub> and ARL<sub>(del</sub>,<sub>LSJ2&gt;N2*)</sub> strains are caused by the N2-derived intron SNV in <italic>nurf-1</italic>, or one of the additional seven linked LSJ2-N2 genetic variants near <italic>nurf-1.</italic></p><p>We measured the relative fitness of the N2*, NIL<sub>(<italic>nurf-1</italic>,LSJ2&gt;N2*)</sub>, and ARL<sub>(del</sub>,<sub>LSJ2&gt;N2*)</sub> strains against PTM288, a version of N2* that also contains a silent mutation in the <italic>dpy-10</italic> gene (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). The <italic>dpy-10</italic> silent mutation provides a common genetic variant that can be used to quantify the relative proportion of each strain on a plate using digital droplet PCR. Both the NIL<sub>(<italic>nurf-1</italic>,LSJ2&gt;N2*)</sub> and ARL<sub>(del</sub>,<sub>LSJ2&gt;N2*)</sub> strains showed dramatically reduced fitness comparing to PTM288, consistent with our previous report showing that the 60 bp deletion is deleterious on agar plates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Large et al., 2016</xref>). However, the NIL<sub>(<italic>nurf-1</italic>,LSJ2&gt;N2*)</sub> was quantitatively and significantly less fit than the ARL<sub>(del</sub>,<sub>LSJ2&gt;N2*)</sub> strain, suggesting additional genetic variant(s) in the NIL<sub>(<italic>nurf-1</italic>,LSJ2&gt;N2*)</sub> strain further reduced its fitness. To confirm this result, we also directly competed the NIL<sub>(<italic>nurf-1</italic>,LSJ2&gt;N2*)</sub> and ARL<sub>(del</sub>,<sub>LSJ2&gt;N2*)</sub> strains against each other, using a nearly neutral background mutation in <italic>spe-9(kah132)</italic> to distinguish the two strains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>).</p><p>To determine if the N2-derived intron SNV in <italic>nurf-1</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>) was responsible for the fitness gains (as opposed to one of the seven linked LSJ2/N2 variants), we used CRISPR-Cas9 to directly edit the LSJ2 allele of the intron SNV into the standard N2 strain to create a strain we will refer to as ARL<sub>(intron</sub>,<sub>LSJ2&gt;N2)</sub>. We measured the relative fitness of the ARL<sub>(intron</sub>,<sub>LSJ2&gt;N2)</sub> and N2 strains against PTM229 (a strain which again contains a <italic>dpy-10</italic> silent mutation). The ARL<sub>(intron</sub>,<sub>LSJ2&gt;N2*)</sub> strain was significantly less fit than the N2 strain at a level similar to the difference between the NIL<sub>(<italic>nurf-1</italic>,LSJ2&gt;N2*)</sub> and ARL<sub>(del</sub>,<sub>LSJ2&gt;N2)</sub> strains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). These results indicate that beneficial alleles of <italic>nurf-1</italic> arose in both laboratory lineages - the 60 bp deletion makes LSJ2 animals more fit in liquid, axenic media (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Large et al., 2016</xref>), and the intron SNV makes N2 animals more fit on agar plates seeded with bacteria.</p><p>In <italic>C. elegans,</italic> brood-size of hermaphrodites is negatively correlated to the timing of initial egg-laying. It has been suggested that this life-history tradeoff has been optimized in N2 animals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Hodgkin and Barnes, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Cutter, 2004</xref>). After sexual maturation, gonads in the hermaphroditic sex initially undergo spermatogenesis before transitioning to oogenesis; a concomitant lengthening of spermatogenesis time increases the total brood size of hermaphrodites but also delays when reproduction can start. When we compared the total fecundity produced by the N2 and ARL<sub>(intron,LSJ2&gt;N2)</sub> strains, we found a significant difference, with the ARL<sub>(intron,LSJ2&gt;N2)</sub> strain producingÂ ~Â 30 fewer offspring than N2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). This could indicate that spermatogenesis occurs for a longer period of time in N2 animals (to produce more sperm), or, alternatively, indicate that sperm are less likely to fertilize an egg in the ARL<sub>(intron,LSJ2&gt;N2)</sub> strain. The reproductive rate of the N2 and ARL<sub>(intron,LSJ2&gt;N2)</sub> strains was largely unchanged throughout their reproductive lifespan (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1</xref>).</p><p>RNA-seq analysis identified transcriptional differences caused by the intron SNV during spermatogenesis, supporting our hypothesis that sperm development is affected by this SNV. We collected RNA from synchronized N2 and ARL<sub>(intron,LSJ2&gt;N2)</sub> hermaphrodites at two timepoints, 52 and 60 hr after hatching, which occur during spermatogenesis (52 hr) or oogenesis (60 hr). Interestingly, a large number of genes are differentially expressed between the two strains but only during the 52 hr timepoint (3384 genes vs. 25 genes) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1âfigure supplement 2A</xref>, and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>). Inspection of these differentially-expressed genes in a single-cell RNAseq dataset (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Cao et al., 2017</xref>) demonstrated that although a portion of these 3384 genes are expressed in the germline, these genes are also expressed in additional tissues (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1âfigure supplement 2B</xref>). Gene ontology analysis suggests that cuticle development and innate immune responses are regulated by <italic>nurf-1</italic> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref>) consistent with the role of its orthologs in regulating immunity and melanocyte proliferation in <italic>Drosophila</italic> and humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Kwon et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Landry et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Koludrovic et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib102">Wu et al., 2016</xref>). The restriction of most of these transcriptional changes to a specific timepoint (i.e. 52 hr) could reflect a specific-role for <italic>nurf-1</italic> in regulating genes undergoing short bursts of transcriptional upregulation during this developmental timepoint (e.g. molting), a specific-role for <italic>nurf-1</italic> in regulating cell number or activity of specific cell-types that are transiently present during this timepoint (e.g. spermatocytes), or some combination of both. These results suggest that the intron SNV regulates a number of developmental processes including spermatogenesis, molting, and innate immunity.</p></sec><sec id="s1-2"><title><italic>nurf-1</italic> produces multiple transcripts encoding multiple protein isoforms</title><p>Our results suggest that selection acted repeatedly on <italic>C. elegans nurf-1</italic> during laboratory growth.

Immunoblot analysis supported the expression of the B, D, and F isoforms, but not the A or Q isoforms (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). Although larger proteins, such as the A isoform, can be difficult to transfer during immunoblots, the lack of a band matching the small Q isoform suggests the highly expressed <italic>nurf-1.q</italic> transcript is not translated into protein or the protein is rapidly degraded.</p><p>Based upon these results, we speculated that the intronic SNV, which we have shown regulates total fecundity and fitness in laboratory conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>), could specifically alter the expression level of the <italic>nurf-1.b</italic> transcript. However, analysis of all five <italic>nurf-1</italic> transcript levels, using the previously described RNA-seq data on the N2 and ARL<sub>(intron,LSJ2&gt;N2)</sub> strains, did not reveal any significant expression differences (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2âfigure supplement 3</xref>). Potentially the effect of this SNV has cell-type specific effects in spermatocytes, however, our data, using RNA collected from the whole animal, does not allow us to test this hypothesis.</p><p>We also investigated whether similar isoforms could be expressed in human cells, using western blots on a small panel of human cancer cell lines. Interestingly, besides a band matching the expected size of the canonical full-length isoform, a number of additional bands were observed between 150â250 kD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s4">Figure 2âfigure supplement 4A</xref>). Using mass-spectrometry, we confirmed the presence of multiple BPTF peptides in the bands detected by western blotting (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s4">Figure 2âfigure supplement 4</xref>), consistent with one or more of these bands representing novel BPTF isoforms. Potentially, these isoforms could play a role in cancer metastasis, although we provide no such evidence here. Despite the presence of these additional bands, the full-length version of BPTF is the most highly expressed isoform (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s4">Figure 2âfigure supplement 4D</xref>), consistent with its importance in mammalian species.</p></sec><sec id="s1-3"><title>The B and D isoforms are both essential for reproduction and the F isoform modifies the heat shock response</title><p>Genetic analysis of <italic>nurf-1</italic> primarily relied on two deletion alleles, <italic>n4293</italic> and <italic>n4295</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Andersen et al., 2006</xref>).

Although the qualitative phenotypes of these four alleles agreed, we observed interesting quantitative differences between them. The second stop codon in the second exon (<italic>kah106</italic>) and the stop codon in the 7<sup>th</sup> exon (<italic>kah142</italic>) reduced growth and fecundity more than the first exon stop codon (<italic>kah90</italic>) or the first stop codon in second exon (<italic>kah91</italic>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B and C</xref>). We suspect this result indicates the presence of an internal ribosome entry site in the middle of the second exon at the 122<sup>nd</sup> Methionine, causing the expression of two isoforms from a single transcript. The reduced severity of the first two stop codon alleles can be explained by their inability to affect the protein sequence of the second isoform. An alternative possibility is a difference in frequency of translational read-through of each stop codon, which are interpreted as sense codons at a low frequency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Jungreis et al., 2011</xref>).</p><p>Unexpectedly, engineering stop codons in the 18<sup>th</sup> and 19<sup>th</sup> exons also caused a mortal germline phenotype (<italic>kah96</italic> and <italic>kah99</italic>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). This result was surprising, because the <italic>n4295</italic> allele, predicted to be a loss-of-function allele for the D and F isoforms due to the loss of the PHD and bromodomains, does not have a mortal germline phenotype. We excluded a number of potential explanations for this discrepancy. A suppressor for the <italic>n4295</italic> allele could have fixed during the construction of this strain. However, the <italic>kah68</italic> allele, which contains a stop codon within the <italic>n4295</italic> deleted region, phenocopies the <italic>n4295</italic> allele and not the <italic>kah96</italic> and <italic>kah99</italic> animals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B and C</xref>, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3âfigure supplement 2</xref>)). Another possibility is that the D isoform suppresses the F isoform; loss of both isoforms (in the <italic>n4295</italic> background) is tolerated, but loss of just the D isoform (in the <italic>kah96</italic> or <italic>kah99</italic> backgrounds) allows the F isoform to prevent reproduction. However, we could exclude this possibility as the double mutant containing both the <italic>n4295</italic> allele and the 18<sup>th</sup> exon stop allele phenocopied the <italic>kah96</italic> single mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3âfigure supplement 3</xref>). Additionally, specific loss of the F isoform by the 23<sup>rd</sup> exon stop allele (<italic>kah11</italic>) did not affect the phenotype of animals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B and C</xref>). Our data suggest that, unlike human BPTF, the ability of NURF-1 to bind modified histones is not required for its function. We further confirmed this hypothesis by editing conserved residues in these the PHD and bromodomains necessary for recognition of the H3K4me3 and H4K16ac marks (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3âfigure supplement 1</xref>).</p><p>The most parsimonious explanation of our data is that either the A or D isoform is essential for reproduction in <italic>C. elegans</italic>. Compound heterozygote tests allowed us to distinguish between these possibilities, indicating that the D isoform is required for reproduction and wild-type growth rate, and the A isoform is dispensable for reproduction and development (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). We first verified that the <italic>kah93</italic>, <italic>kah96</italic>, and <italic>kah106</italic> alleles were recessive by measuring the fecundity of heterozygous animals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). Next, we examined the fecundity of <italic>kah106/kah96</italic> compound heterozygotes, which are predicted to lack only the A isoform, due to the production a single unaffected copy of the B isoform from the <italic>kah96</italic> haplotype and a single unaffected copy of the D isoform from the <italic>kah106</italic> haplotype. If the A isoform was essential for reproduction, we would expect these compound heterozygotes to be sterile or have severe defects in fecundity. However, these animals were indistinguishable from wild-type, suggesting that the full-length A isoform is not essential (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). The <italic>kah106/kah93</italic> compound heterozygotes showed similar results. These animals are predicted to encode one unaffected copy of the D isoform, one truncated copy of the B isoform, and zero unaffected copies of the A isoform. These animals were mostly wild-type, with a small reduction in total fecundity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). We interpret this to mean that the A isoform is not essential and the truncation of the B isoform slightly perturbs its function, causing a slight reduction in fecundity. Finally, we analyzed <italic>kah93/kah96</italic> compound heterozygotes. These animals are predicted to encode zero wild-type copies of the D isoform, one wild-type copy of the B isoform, and zero wild-type copies of the A isoform. These animals were essentially sterile. Taken together, we conclude that the B and the D isoform are both essential for reproduction.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig4" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.48119.021</object-id><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><title>Genetic analysis suggests the NURF-1.</title><p>B and NURF-1.D isoforms are essential for reproduction in <italic>C. elegans</italic>.Â (<bold>A</bold>) Genomic positions of stop codon or classical deletion mutations used for compound heterozygote or transgenic rescue analysis of B and C. <italic>kah3</italic> is a CRISPR/Cas9 genomic edit of the LSJ2-derived 60 bp deletion.

One possibility is that the long-form of NURF-1 has split into two subunits - both isoforms participate as part of the NURF complex, cooperating together to regulate reproduction. However, the D isoform might instead modify NURF activity by competing for binding with transcription factors or regions of the genome to which NURF is recruited. A third possibility is that the D isoform acts through a NURF-independent pathway.</p><p>To gain insights into the molecular nature of the D isoform, we decided to determine precisely how the B and D isoforms regulate reproduction, using three <italic>nurf-1</italic> stop alleles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>). For hermaphrodites to produce a fertilized egg, the gonads must produce both male and female gametes at different developmental times (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>). Initially, gametogenesis produces sperm, creating approximately 300 sperm at which point a permanent sperm-to-oocyte switch occurs. From this time, gametogenesis produces oocytes until the animal dies or the gonad ceases to function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Hubbard and Greenstein, 2005</xref>). A number of defects could cause sterility â inability to form gametes, inability to create sperm, inability to create oocytes, or defects in the sperm and/or oocyte function. We used DAPI staining to characterize the production of sperm and oocytes in three <italic>nurf-1</italic> mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C and D</xref>). We first tested <italic>kah106</italic> mutants, which lack the B isoform (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>), for the ability to produce sperm. Compared with N2 animals, which createÂ ~Â 300 sperm per animal, the number of sperm produced by <italic>kah106</italic> animals was greatly reduced, resulting in the production of only approximately 60 sperm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>).

While there is growing appreciation of isoform-specific regulation of many genes, <italic>nurf-1</italic> appears to be unusually complex in this regard (although not unprecedented â see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">MÃ¼ller and Basler, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Berry et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib97">Wang et al., 2009</xref>).</p><p>We propose a molecular mechanism to explain the actions of the B and D isoforms to regulate transcription (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>). These two isoforms share 207 amino acids of protein sequence, which falls in a region that is thought to facilitate physical interactions with transcription factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Alkhatib and Landry, 2011</xref>). NURF-1.B participates as part of the NURF complex, which is recruited to certain promoters by binding to transcription factors. At these loci, NURF promotes or represses expression of target genes by remodeling the chromatin surrounding promoters and gene bodies. For unknown molecular reasons, NURF-1.D preferentially binds to these transcription factors, displacing the NURF complex from these genomic regions, causing a change of chromatin state and gene expression.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Microevolution of NURF-1/BPTF</title><p>We showed that independent, beneficial alleles in <italic>nurf-1</italic> were fixed in two laboratory strains of <italic>C. elegans</italic> that each experienced an extreme shift in environment from their natural habitats. The N2-derived SNV results in the change of a run of homopolymers in the 2<sup>nd</sup> intron of the <italic>nurf-1.b</italic> transcript. Such a change could act as an enhancer for the <italic>nurf-1.d</italic> promoter, but the nature of the genetic change and position is more consistent with a role in regulating the <italic>nurf-1.b</italic> transcript. Analysis of RNA sequencing data did not identify any obvious changes in levels of any of the <italic>nurf-1</italic> transcripts and it is unclear by what molecular mechanism it regulates <italic>nurf-1</italic> activity. Potentially, it could increase pausing of the RNA polymerase at the homopolymer run or could regulate RNA splicing by changing the secondary structure of the RNA molecule. In general, such a mutation would not be predicted by most bioinformatic approaches to have a phenotypic effect. Only the low genetic diversity between the LSJ2 and N2 strains allowed us to focus on this variant, and eventually demonstrate this particular variant is causal.</p><p>The probability of two beneficial mutations happening in both lineages by random chance is quite small. Less than 300 genes (out ofÂ ~Â 20,000 total) harbor derived mutations in either the N2 or LSJ2 lineage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">McGrath et al., 2011</xref>). Only a handful of these fixed mutations are expected to be beneficial; our recent QTL mapping of fitness differences on agar plates only identified the <italic>nurf-1</italic> locus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib109">Zhao et al., 2019</xref>) and the small effective population sizes (~4â100) are expected to lead to the fixation of a number of nearly-neutral mutations through genetic drift and draft. Our work suggests <italic>nurf-1</italic> is a genetic target for adaptation to the extreme changes in environments associated with laboratory growth.</p><p>Targeting of <italic>nurf-1</italic> is consistent with its role as a regulator of life history tradeoffs. Many traits influence individual and offspring survival; however, the mapping of these traits onto fitness is thought to be dependent on the environmental niche an organism occupies. The LSJ2-derived deletion in <italic>nurf-1</italic> modified life history tradeoffs to prioritize individual survival over reproduction; by shunting energy away from reproduction and growth, they increased their chances of surviving on poor, unnatural food. N2 animals grew on agar plates seeded with <italic>E. coli</italic> bacteria, which they can readily consume and metabolize into a useful energy source. In these conditions, survival is not the primary concern; each animal has three days to eat as much food as possible and produce as many progenies as possible to maximize the probability one of their offspring is transferred to the new food source. It is reasonable to think that the N2 and LSJ2 laboratory conditions represent opposite extremes along a life history axis encompassing individual survival and reproduction. The N2 mutation favors reproduction while the LSJ2 mutation favors survival.</p><p>In humans, genetic alterations in <italic>BPTF</italic> have been reported in several types of cancer and a role of BPTF in transcriptional regulation by c-MYC has been demonstrated, in agreement with its chromatin-binding function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Richart et al., 2016</xref>). Using well-characterized and validated antibodies against BPTF, we found several molecular species with unexpected electrophoretic mobilities in human cancer cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s4">Figure 2âfigure supplement 4</xref>). Using mass-spectrometry, we confirmed the presence of multiple BPTF peptides in the bands detected by western blotting (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s4">Figure 2âfigure supplement 4</xref>). These findings raise the possibility that these protein sequence variants have non-canonical functions. Given that stress adaptation is a hallmark of cancer - allowing tumor cells to survive and evolve following Darwinian selection processes - and the role of <italic>nurf-1</italic> in <italic>C. elegans</italic> demonstrated here, it is tempting to speculate a role for such diversity of isoforms in the life histories of cancer cells. However, our work simply shows that additional forms of BPTF exist. Whether they have a biological role still needs to be determined.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title><italic>Split of</italic> nurf-1 <italic>into separate genes potentially resolves conflict between the Yin and Yang isoforms caused by shared exons</italic></title><p>In a clade of <italic>Caenorhabditis</italic> nematodes, the <italic>nurf-1</italic> gene has split into two separate genes, an example of gene birth resulting in the duplication of a portion of the <italic>nurf-1</italic> gene. Multigene families are common in most species and protein domains are often shuffled between genes. While the importance of gene duplication is not controversial, the exact mutational events and evolutionary forces responsible for the fixation of independent genes with different functions is less understood. Here we seem to have uncovered an example of how gene sharing, specifically through the creation of unique isoforms, can contribute to this process. In the lineage that led to the <italic>C. elegans species</italic>, <italic>nurf-1</italic> first evolved changes in isoform use, resulting in the creation and essential action of the <italic>nurf-1.d</italic> transcript, and the loss of essentiality of the long <italic>nurf-1.a</italic> transcript. In this case, partitioning of the biological function and protein domains in each <italic>nurf-1</italic> isoform created diversification of protein products.</p><p>What are the evolutionary forces responsible for the split of <italic>nurf-1</italic> into two genes? One possibility is developmental systemÂ drift. Under this scenario, the separation of the two isoforms into two distinct genes does not signify any important evolutionary change in the function of the two genes. Neutral processes are responsible for the initial fixation of the duplication and the change does not provide any future evolutionary benefit.</p><p>However, there are a few additional possible ways adaptive evolution could play a role. First, correlated with the separation of the Yin and Yang transcripts into two genes is the loss of the full-length <italic>nurf-1.a</italic> and <italic>nurf-1.q</italic> transcripts. Loss of these transcripts could have provided a fitness benefit for animals. Consider, in order to produce both the <italic>nurf-1.b</italic> and <italic>nurf-1.d</italic> transcripts (i.e. the Yin and Yang transcripts) in the same cell, there must be a mechanism to distinguish between transcripts containing the 1<sup>st</sup> to 15<sup>th</sup> exons (the <italic>nurf-1.b</italic> transcripts) and transcripts initiating from the 14<sup>th</sup> exon (the <italic>nurf-1.d</italic> transcripts). In the former case, the 15<sup>th</sup> exon is spliced to the 16<sup>th</sup> exon to terminate the transcript. In the latter case, the 15<sup>th</sup> exon is spliced to the 17<sup>th</sup> exon, along with the remaining 3' exons. Alternatively, the cell might not distinguish between transcripts, but uses each alternative splice site at a constant ratio (i.e. 80% of the time, the 15<sup>th</sup> exon is spliced to the 16<sup>th</sup> exon and 20% of the time, the 15<sup>th</sup> exon is spliced to the 17<sup>th</sup> exon). In the latter scenario, two additional transcripts must be produced. Intriguingly, these two transcripts match <italic>nurf-1.a</italic> and <italic>nurf-1.q,</italic> suggesting these transcripts are non-functional biproducts of molecular conflict between <italic>nurf-1.b</italic> and <italic>nurf-1.d</italic>. Potentially, production of the <italic>nurf-1.a</italic> and <italic>nurf-1.q</italic> transcripts could come at an energetic cost.</p><p>Multiple lines of evidence are consistent with the <italic>nurf-1.a</italic> and <italic>nurf-1.q</italic> transcripts playing non-biological roles. First, while the <italic>nurf-1.q</italic> transcript is produced at high levels, we were unable to observe its product in our immunoblots, suggesting that it is either not translated or the protein product is rapidly degraded. Second, our genetic tests were unable to identify a biological role for <italic>nurf-1.a.</italic> Third, we observe a loss of both the <italic>nurf-1.a</italic> and <italic>nurf-1.q</italic> transcripts in the species that have split <italic>nurf-1</italic> into two genes. It would have been quite easy for these species to retain expression of <italic>nurf-1.q</italic> in their current configuration, either through a promoter in front of the 14<sup>th</sup> exon in the <italic>nurf-1â1</italic> gene, or an alternative stop exon after the 2<sup>nd</sup> exon of the <italic>nurf-1â2</italic> gene, since both of these elements existed in the ancestral state.</p><p>Second, duplication of the shared exons could facilitate future evolutionary change. Escape from adaptive conflict is a mechanism by which gene duplication can resolve the situation where a single gene is selected to perform multiple roles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Des Marais and Rausher, 2008</xref>). After duplication, each copy is free to improve its function independently. As organisms evolve, recruitment of NURF to specific loci could be accomplished by changing its binding with specific transcription factors through amino acid changes in NURF-1. The most rapidly evolving portion of the protein is within the 14<sup>th</sup> and 15<sup>th</sup> exons, suggesting positive selection acts on this region of the protein, potentially changing the transcription factors NURF-1 binds to. One issue that arises in species containing a single <italic>nurf-1</italic> gene is the pleiotropy of genetic changes in the shared region; changing the amino acid sequence of the B isoform also changes the D isoform. Are there situations where modifying one isoform but not the other is preferred? In the clade of nematodes that have duplicated <italic>nurf-1</italic>, each gene is free to evolve independently. We present evidence that in these species, the duplicated region is free to evolve more rapidly. It should be interesting to characterize the exact function of this duplicated region and determine if these changes in protein sequence facilitate changes in transcription factor binding in an adaptive manner.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>Conclusion</title><p>A fundamental problem in evolutionary biology is understanding the genetic mechanisms responsible for phenotypic diversity in extant species. Here, we present one route to address this problem. Experimental evolution and genetic analysis can be used to identify evolutionary relevant genes and understand their function. This knowledge can be leveraged to understand patterns of evolution of these genes in other species. We believe that merging genetics, genomics, and molecular evolution is a powerful approach to understand the evolutionary mechanisms responsible for long-term adaptation and species level differences.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table

transparency, eLife includes the editorial decision letter and accompanying author responses. A lightly edited version of the letter sent to the authors after peer review is shown, indicating the most substantive concerns; minor comments are not usually included.</p></boxed-text><p>[Editorsâ note: this article was originally rejected after discussions between the reviewers, but the authors were invited to resubmit after an appeal against the decision.]</p><p>Thank you for submitting your work entitled &quot;Evolution of Yin and Yang isoforms of a chromatin remodeling subunit results in the creation of two genes&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>.</p><p>We regret to inform you that we cannot, at present, accept your paper for publication in <italic>eLife</italic>. Because your paper's scientific work is of high quality, we are willing to reconsider a thoroughly revised version. However, we can only do so if you can satisfactorily address each of the three problems discussed below.</p><p>Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, including Erich M Schwarz as the Reviewing Editor and Reviewer #1, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Eric Haag (Reviewer #3). Our decision has been reached after consultation between the reviewers.</p><p>The problems raised by the reviewers that necessitated this decision are as follows.</p><p>1) The domestication story is interesting, and the evidence that the first intron harbors an important variant vis-a-vis fitness in lab culture is quite strong. However, there is no mechanistic explanation for how it impacts nurf-1 function. This is a major deficiency for an <italic>eLife</italic> paper.</p><p>2) The authors prove that the full-length transcript of nurf-1 is not needed, and they provide evidence that one clade of <italic>Caenorhabditis</italic> have split the ancestral, single complex nurf-1 gene. However, there remains the question of whether nurf-1's 5'-ward and 3'-ward halves remain connected as part of one operon, with SL2 splicing to the 3'-ward half. Moreover, why the splitting of nurf-1 happened is a) not clear, and b) not connected to the domestication phenotype. It is thus a curiosity unrelated to a major biological event (thus far).</p><p>3) Although some evidence of accelerated evolution of the overlap region between Yin and Yang isoforms is provided, there is no compelling evidence that there was an &quot;adaptive conflict&quot; that needed to be resolved and was indeed resolved. The null hypothesis of &quot;both work, and developmental systems drift happens&quot; cannot be rejected. This issue is at the core of your article's claim to biological importance.</p><p>All three reviewers agreed that the paper has abundant experimental data of high quality. The problem is that these data are not convincingly linked to the explanations claimed, and the results seem to fall naturally into two distinct papers (one on domestication alleles, the other on the molecular biology and evolution of isoforms arising from the genetically complex nurf-1 locus). Unless the three points above can be addressed, this work may fare better as two shorter studies focused on these two topics.</p><p>We have attached the individual reviews by the three reviewers below.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic></p><p>Using molecular biology, reverse genetics, and transcriptomics, Xu et al. make a compelling case for the evolution of two isoforms of nurf-1/BPTF in <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic> that subdivide functions within this gene; they go on to show that a subgenus of <italic>Caenorhabditis</italic> species have evolved two entirely separate genes from these isoforms. Their observations provide a coherent explanation for many functions of the nurf-1 gene that had been intermittently seen over the years, but not reconciled. Their analysis of nurf-1 provides a beautiful instance of evolutionary adaptation, both in the sense of nurf-1's evolving into two functional isoforms, and in the sense that nurf-1 itself (as the authors show) mediates phenotypic tradeoffs in life history between early spermatocyte production and later oocyte production, which ultimately affects speed and output of the <italic>C. elegans</italic> reproductive life cycle that have different optima in different laboratory environments (plate culture for the N2 strain, versus liquid culture for the LSJ2 strain).</p><p>The experimental work described here is thorough, rigorous, and adroit.</p><p>The manuscript is very well composed. Background material is scholarly but appropriately concise. Generally, text is clean and direct. I was struck by the clarity with which the figures presented data visually. Papers such as this one that rely on genomic or transcriptomic analysis can be, in my experience, quite obtusely written or illustrated with figures that do not convey data well; Xu et al. have opposed these tendencies, for which I thank them.</p><p>I was impressed with the authors' efficient use of previously published RNA-seq data for heat shock expression, and of prepublication Nanopore long-RNA-seq data from Roach et al., 2019. By the time Xu et al. is published, I hope that the preprint Roach et al. can be cited as a published journal article.</p><p>In the text, I encountered only two points that I found difficult to decipher, a few missing data points, and one issue about nomenclature.</p><p>The first unclear point involved strain PTM417 versus strain PTM88. In Figure 1D, one of the strains shown is PTM417, but this is referred to as PTM88 in the figure legend. Reading the text carefully twice and reviewing the Materials and methods did not clarify for me which was the correct strain for Figure 1, although I suspect the correct strain is PTM417 rather than PTM88. In particular, the description of PTM417 in the Strains list (Materials and methods) is not consistent with the description of how PTM417 was constructed (subsection âCRISPR-generated allelic replacement lines (ARLs)â). I request that the authors entirely resolve this confusion.</p><p>The second unclear point involved the &quot;Normalized Size&quot; assay shown in Figure 3C. Two readings of the manuscript and one careful reading of the Materials and methods did not clarify, for me, what was meant by 'size' (though my guess was that it was body size). I went back to their key reference for many methods (Large et al., 2016) and concluded that the authors actually mean &quot;Normalized body size&quot;. This should be made completely clear to the reader, both in the y-axis labeling of Figure 3C and in the legend text for Figure 3C, as well as in the Materials and methods.</p><p>One missing data point is in Table 2. This table should list a stop-codon location for kah11 in the isoform NURF-1.F, and only in that one isoform. Instead, Table 2 currently gives no stop-codon mutations for kah11 at all. In addition, Figure 3D (which is supposed to show all stop codons in their structural context) also omits kah11. These omissions from both Table 2 and Figure 3D should be corrected.</p><p>A second missing data point appears to be in the genotype table of Figure 4B. For the genotype +/kah96, this table claims that there are 0 functional copies of the isoform nurf-1.d; however, I do not see how this can be possible, given that the wild-type allele [+] should encode at least 1 functional copy of nurf-1.d. Unless there is something that I am badly misunderstanding (always possible), please correct this.</p><p>About nomenclature: the authors have dubbed the NURF-1.B isoform &quot;Yin&quot; and the NURF-1.D isoform &quot;Yang&quot;. I assume that this is because of their order of expression (NURF-1.B is expressed before NURF-1.D), so that calling them &quot;Yin and Yang&quot; follows their times of activity. However, I found the nomenclature confusing because Yang is associated with stereotypically masculine traits and entities, whereas Yin is associated with feminine ones. Yet, the authors' current nomenclature has Yin assigned to the isoform promoting spermatogenesis (NURF-1.B), while Yang is assigned to the isoform promoting oogenesis (NURF-1.D). Since I assume that the authors would like to make it *easy* for people to properly remember which isoform does what, I would strongly encourage them to switch their nomenclature (so that NURF-1.B gets called Yang, and NURF-1.D gets called Yin).</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>Here, Xu et al. report several splice isoforms of the <italic>C. elegans</italic> nurf-1 gene and show that they have different, possibly opposite, effects on certain aspects of gametogenesis.

Conversely, are oocyte production defects of kah93 an issue in mutants that only produce oocytes? Addressing these questions could help to support the notion that different isoforms contribute to different aspects of the tradeoff between sperm and oocyte production. Are the observed defects in the numbers of gametes due to erroneous timing of the switch or some other problem? Can anything be said about the functions of different isoforms in gonochoristic species in which sperm vs. egg conflict is not a concern?</p><p>4) The concluding sentence of the Results section claims that the rate of amino acid replacements has accelerated in the duplicated exons. I did not find a formal test supporting this assertion.</p><p>5) Are the authors aware of this paper â Hughes, 1994?</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic></p><p>In this paper, Xu et al. present a meticulous examination of the nurf-1 locus of <italic>C. elegans</italic>. The study presents several interesting findings:</p><p>1) New evidence (beyond published studies) is presented indicating that nurf-1 has been a target of selection during domestication of laboratory strains, including the N2 and LSJ2 strains. In particular, the authors make a strong case for a major role of an intronic single nucleotide variant (SNV) in mediating adaptation to the NGM plate culture in the N2 lineage.</p><p>2) The authors then shift to a detailed characterization of the various nurf-1 transcripts and their necessity for growth and sustained fertility. This is most impressively supported by a battery of engineered stop codons. The results strongly suggest that the nurf-1.b and nurf-1.d transcripts, which overlap slightly, are the key effectors of nurf-1 function, and that the full-length nurf-1.a transcript is likely dispensable.</p><p>3) While isoform-restricted stop codons that reduce or eliminate nurf-1.b and nurf-1.d function both reduce self-fertility, they do so via opposite effects. nurf-1.b appears to be necessary to support robust spermatogenesis (i.e. it's loss leads to a partial Fog), while nurf-1.d has a role in promoting the switch from spermatogenesis to oogenesis (i.e. it is a partial Mog).</p><p>4) In the clade of Caenorhabiditis species that includes <italic>C. brenneri</italic>, the partially overlapping transcripts have been completely separated via a lineage-specific duplication of the exons that were historically shared.</p><p>Overall, this paper is a genetics tour de force. I do have a few suggestions, that if addressed, would tighten up the story:</p><p>1) While there appears to be a surprisingly major effect of the intronic SNV on both global gene expression and fitness, nothing is said about how this change in a homopolymeric run alters nurf-1's own gene expression. One might expect this to impact nurf-1.b transcription or splicing, and this could, in turn, alter NURF-1.B levels. Can the authors provide any data about the functional impact of the SNV on nurf-1? For example, an isoform frequency chart like that for Figure 2C, but comparing PTM228 and the ARL(intron, LSJ2&gt;N2), would be very informative as to the mechanism by which the intron SNV impact phenotype.</p><p>2) We are told that &quot;brood size of <italic>C. elegans</italic> hermaphrodites is an important trait for evolutionary fitness in laboratory conditions.&quot; Indeeed it is, but the timing also matters, with early progeny much more valuable than late progeny. Looking at the reproductive schedules in Figure 1âfigure supplement 1 (and also in the Large et al., 2016 paper), there is a real shift in timing. Can the authors model, or at least speculate on, the expected impact of this?</p><p>3) In the species that have a fully separated nurf-1.1 and nurf-1.2 genes, there is very little space between the two. Have the authors looked to see if the 5' end of the transcript from the downstream gene is spliced to SL2? If so, that would indicate these have formed an operon.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.48119.050</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>[Editorsâ note: the author responses to the first round of peer review follow.]</p><p>The problems raised by the reviewers that necessitated this decision are as follows.</p><p>1) The domestication story is interesting, and the evidence that the first intron harbors an important variant vis-a-vis fitness in lab culture is quite strong. However, there is no mechanistic explanation for how it impacts nurf-1 function. This is a major deficiency for an eLife paper.</p></disp-quote><p>To address mechanism of the intron SNV, we include analysis of nurf-1 isoform expression using RNA-seq that was already included in the paper (Figure 2âfigure supplement 3). This analysis demonstrates that the effect on nurf-1 expression is subtle, as we were unable to identify significant differences in expression at timepoints that when phenotypic effects were observed (i.e.</p><p>spermatogenesis and expression of other genes). While disappointing from a mechanistic perspective, this serves as an interesting demonstration that the effect of a genetic variant on fitness can be significant despite having a subtle effect on transcription.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) The authors prove that the full-length transcript of nurf-1 is not needed, and they provide evidence that one clade of Caenorhabditis have split the ancestral, single complex nurf-1 gene. However, there remains the question of whether nurf-1's 5'-ward and 3'-ward halves remain connected as part of one operon, with SL2 splicing to the 3'-ward half. Moreover, why the splitting of nurf-1 happened is a) not clear, and b) not connected to the domestication phenotype. It is thus a curiosity unrelated to a major biological event (thus far).</p></disp-quote><p>We do not believe that this is the case for the following reasons: 1. In <italic>C. elegans</italic>, the b and d isoforms are expressed from independent promoters. For these genes to be expressed as an operon, additional genetic changes must have fixed. 2. Previously published work from the Ellis lab supports that sl1 leader sequence is spliced to nurf-1-2 (Chen et al. â âDependence of the sperm/oocyte decision on the nucleosome remodeling factor complex was acquired during recent <italic>Caenorhabditis briggsae</italic> evolutionâ). 3. We searched RNAseq data for sl2 sequence in clipped reads directly upstream of nurf1-2 without success. In <italic>C. briggsae</italic> and <italic>C. brenneri</italic>, we were able to identify three reads (2 and 1, respectively) that matched sl1 sequence. 4. In <italic>C. tropicalis</italic>, nurf-1-1 and nurf-1-2 are separated by ~10kb (Figure 6âfigure supplement 3), which would be quite unusual for genes expressed in a operon. 5. In some species, nurf-1-1 and nurf-1-2 display different levels of expression, consistent with independent promoters being responsible for their expression (e.g. <italic>C. brenneri</italic> in Figure 6âfigure supplement 3).</p><p>Finally, we note that even if the two genes are expressed in a single operon, this would not take away from the main parts of the story as they are free to evolve independently in the shared exon region.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Although some evidence of accelerated evolution of the overlap region between Yin and Yang isoforms is provided, there is no compelling evidence that there was an &quot;adaptive conflict&quot; that needed to be resolved and was indeed resolved. The null hypothesis of &quot;both work, and developmental systems drift happens&quot; cannot be rejected. This issue is at the core of your article's claim to biological importance.</p></disp-quote><p>First, we want to clarify with the reviewers (in case it was not clear from the 1<sup>st</sup> submission) that there are two separate arguments we are making as to why this the duplication might be beneficial. 1. Loss of non-functional (a and q) transcripts necessary for expressing both functional isoforms (b and d) using the shared exons. 2) Adaptive conflict in the shared exon region.</p><p>While we agree with reviewers that we cannot reject developmental drift and must rely on circumstantial evidence to make the case, we also note that this is almost always the case for any analysis of extant species. Ideally, we would have biochemical information about activity changes in the shared exon regions, however, this is out of scope for this paper. Besides providing evidence that the duplicated regions experience accelerated evolution, we believe that including the evidence that nurf-1 is targeted by laboratory evolution strengthens the case that variation in nurf-1 is under selection in natural environments as well. Additional evidence that nurf-1 is under selection in the wild was previously provided by the Ellis labâs paper (Chen et al. â âDependence of the sperm/oocyte decision on the nucleosome remodeling factor complex was acquired during recent <italic>Caenorhabditis briggsae</italic> evolutionâ).</p><p>We have rewritten the Discussion to make all of this clearer.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>All three reviewers agreed that the paper has abundant experimental data of high quality. The problem is that these data are not convincingly linked to the explanations claimed, and the results seem to fall naturally into two distinct papers (one on domestication alleles, the other on the molecular biology and evolution of isoforms arising from the genetically complex nurf-1 locus). Unless the three points above can be addressed, this work may fare better as two shorter studies focused on these two topics.</p><p>We have attached the individual reviews by the three reviewers below.</p><p>Reviewer #1:</p><p>Using molecular biology, reverse genetics, and transcriptomics, Xu et al. make a compelling case for the evolution of two isoforms of nurf-1/BPTF in Caenorhabditis elegans that subdivide functions within this gene; they go on to show that a subgenus of Caenorhabditis species have evolved two entirely separate genes from these isoforms. Their observations provide a coherent explanation for many functions of the nurf-1 gene that had been intermittently seen over the years, but not reconciled. Their analysis of nurf-1 provides a beautiful instance of evolutionary adaptation, both in the sense of nurf-1's evolving into two functional isoforms, and in the sense that nurf-1 itself (as the authors show) mediates phenotypic tradeoffs in life history between early spermatocyte production and later oocyte production, which ultimately affects speed and output of the C. elegans reproductive life cycle that have different optima in different laboratory environments (plate culture for the N2 strain, versus liquid culture for the LSJ2 strain).</p><p>The experimental work described here is thorough, rigorous, and adroit.</p><p>The manuscript is very well composed. Background material is scholarly but appropriately concise. Generally, text is clean and direct. I was struck by the clarity with which the figures presented data visually. Papers such as this one that rely on genomic or transcriptomic analysis can be, in my experience, quite obtusely written or illustrated with figures that do not convey data well; Xu et al. have opposed these tendencies, for which I thank them.</p><p>I was impressed with the authors' efficient use of previously published RNA-seq data for heat shock expression, and of prepublication Nanopore long-RNA-seq data from Roach et al., 2019. By the time Xu et al. is published, I hope that the preprint Roach et al. can be cited as a published journal article.</p><p>In the text, I encountered only two points that I found difficult to decipher, a few missing data points, and one issue about nomenclature.</p><p>The first unclear point involved strain PTM417 versus strain PTM88. In Figure 1D, one of the strains shown is PTM417, but this is referred to as PTM88 in the figure legend. Reading the text carefully twice and reviewing the Materials and methods did not clarify for me which was the correct strain for Figure 1, although I suspect the correct strain is PTM417 rather than PTM88. In particular, the description of PTM417 in the Strains list (Materials and methods) is not consistent with the description of how PTM417 was constructed (subsection âCRISPR-generated allelic replacement lines (ARLs)â). I request that the authors entirely resolve this confusion.</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewer correctly points out the errors in the figure legend. PTM417 is a derivative of PTM88, constructed by backcrossing out the spe-9 mutation while leaving the 60bp deletion.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The second unclear point involved the &quot;Normalized Size&quot; assay shown in Figure 3C. Two readings of the manuscript and one careful reading of the Materials and methods did not clarify, for me, what was meant by 'size' (though my guess was that it was body size). I went back to their key reference for many methods (Large et al., 2016) and concluded that the authors actually mean &quot;Normalized body size&quot;. This should be made completely clear to the reader, both in the y-axis labeling of Figure 3C and in the legend text for Figure 3C, as well as in the Materials and methods.</p></disp-quote><p>A figure legend for 3C was accidentally deleted from the submitted manuscript. Additionally, the Materials and methods section was poorly written and incorrect. The label and legend for Figure 3C and Materials and methods section have been fixed.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>One missing data point is in Table 2. This table should list a stop-codon location for kah11 in the isoform NURF-1.F, and only in that one isoform. Instead, Table 2 currently gives no stop-codon mutations for kah11 at all. In addition, Figure 3D (which is supposed to show all stop codons in their structural context) also omits kah11. These omissions from both Table 2 and Figure 3D should be corrected.</p></disp-quote><p>Corrected.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>A second missing data point appears to be in the genotype table of Figure 4B.

Using the n4295 allele (which removes much of the d isoform), we can demonstrate a role for the d isoform in playing a role in spermatogenesis (i.e. sperm size) in both males and hermaphrodites. However, the n4295 has an opposite effect on body-length in hermaphrodites (shorter) vs. males (longer). This indicates that nurf-1 has sex-specific roles, consistent with our central hypothesis that nurf-1 is a life history regulator and the fact that life history tradeoffs are influenced by sex. We would predict that the traits that nurf-1 controls will be sex and species specific (of course some will be shared).
