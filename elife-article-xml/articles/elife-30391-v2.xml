This process, if unchecked, can also generate cell types that are inappropriate for a given location. We conducted a screen for genes that negatively regulate the frequency of notum-to-wing transformations following genetic ablation and regeneration of the wing pouch, from which we identified mutations in the transcriptional co-repressor <italic>C-terminal Binding Protein (CtBP).</italic> When CtBP function is reduced, ablation of the pouch can activate the JNK/AP-1 and JAK/STAT pathways in the notum to destabilize cell fates. Ectopic expression of Wingless and Dilp8 precede the formation of the ectopic pouch, which is subsequently generated by recruitment of both anterior and posterior cells near the compartment boundary. Thus, CtBP stabilizes cell fates following damage by opposing the destabilizing effects of the JNK/AP-1 and JAK/STAT pathways.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.30391.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Some animals are more able to replace damaged tissue than others. A salamander, for example, can re-grow an amputated limb but a mouse or human cannot. After damage or injury certain types of cells are lost and need to be replaced by cells that are left behind. The remaining cells – or new cells that develop from them – must change their characteristics to better resemble the lost cells. This property, known as plasticity, needs to be controlled tightly. Excessive plasticity can result in forming tissues that are completely inappropriate for that location in the animal.</p><p>The fruit fly <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> can be used to investigate plasticity during regeneration. Fruit fly larvae contain structures known as imaginal discs that can regenerate if damaged. Occasionally, when the imaginal discs regenerate, they produce the wrong kind of tissue.</p><p>Worley et al. set out to look for genes that would normally prevent such mistakes. Their search began with looking for flies with mutations that caused regeneration to go awry following damage. Specifically, Worley et al. looked for mutant flies that grew extra wings after a structure was damaged that would normally only generate a single wing. Once such flies had been found, further experiments were used to narrow down the search and confirm which gene was mutated.</p><p>This approach revealed that flies with mutations in the gene for a protein called CtBP (which is short for C-terminal binding protein) made more errors during regeneration and commonly regenerated inappropriate structures such as an extra wing. Importantly, mammals have very similar genes, but few researchers had previously studied if they also play a role in regeneration.</p><p>Worley et al. went on to show that CtBP dampens the activity of two signaling pathways (namely the JNK/AP-1 pathway and the JAK-STAT pathway), both of which promote plasticity. Thus, when CtBP levels are reduced, there is excessive plasticity.</p><p>These findings implicate CtBP as a regulator of plasticity during regeneration. This is an important first step in thinking of strategies that would allow researchers to guide and reshape the development of tissues during regeneration.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>regeneration</kwd><kwd>Drosophila</kwd><kwd>plasticity</kwd><kwd>tissue repair</kwd><kwd>transdetermination</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>D. melanogaster</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000057</institution-id><institution>National Institute of General Medical Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>GM061672</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Hariharan</surname><given-names>Iswar K</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000048</institution-id><institution>American Cancer Society</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>RP-16-238-06-COUN</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Hariharan</surname><given-names>Iswar K</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000057</institution-id><institution>National Institute of General Medical Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>GM085576</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Hariharan</surname><given-names>Iswar K</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000057</institution-id><institution>National Institute of General Medical Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>GM122490</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Hariharan</surname><given-names>Iswar K</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The CtBP protein stabilizes cell fates in regenerating tissue.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>As development proceeds in multicellular organisms, cells become more restricted in developmental potential. This results initially from the expression of lineage-specific transcription factors and is then stabilized by heritable chromatin states that restrict accessibility of the transcriptional machinery to subsets of genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Britten and Davidson, 1969</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Levine, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Allis and Jenuwein, 2016</xref>). The relative stability of these ‘epigenetic landscapes’ is thought to protect cells from patterns of gene expression that are inappropriate to that particular lineage. The paradigm that progressive restrictions in cell fate during development are unidirectional and irreversible was challenged by the demonstration that nuclei from differentiated cells could be reprogrammed to a more naïve state either by transferring them into an enucleated fertilized egg (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Gurdon, 1962</xref>) or by expressing a combination of transcription factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Takahashi and Yamanaka, 2006</xref>). Indeed, pluripotent stem cells have been derived from highly specialized cell types including neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Kim et al., 2011</xref>) and lymphocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Loh et al., 2009</xref>).</p><p>Even earlier, studies of <italic>Drosophila</italic> imaginal discs by Ernst Hadorn and colleagues showed that cells determined to one fate could switch to a very different fate. During embryogenesis, groups of cells at particular locations are specified to form particular imaginal discs (e.g. genital disc, wing disc, eye-antennal disc) depending on their location in the embryo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Cohen, 1993</xref>). Although these fates are determined during embryogenesis, disc cells do not differentiate to form adult structures until many days later, when metamorphosis occurs. To investigate the stability of the determined state, Hadorn’s group transplanted imaginal disc fragments into abdomens of female adult flies where regeneration occurred. Most often, the tissue generated was appropriate for the implanted imaginal disc. However, at low frequency, regeneration resulted in tissue that was appropriate for a different disc (e.g. leg disc tissue generated from a fragment of genital disc). Hadorn termed this phenomenon transdetermination (a switch from one determined state to another) (reviewed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Hadorn, 1968</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">McClure and Schubiger, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Worley et al., 2012</xref>]).</p><p>While transdetermination has been studied for years, many aspects are still mysterious. First, the fate change does not happen in a single cell, but rather, initiates in a small group of cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Gehring, 1967</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Hadorn et al., 1970</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Maves and Schubiger, 1998</xref>). How a group of cells coordinately changes fate is not known. Second, certain fate changes seemed more likely than others. For example, genital-to-leg transformations or leg-to-wing transformations were far more frequent than transformations in the opposite direction. Third, transdetermination can be viewed as an aberrant form of regeneration that occurs following tissue damage and correlates with increased local proliferation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Sustar and Schubiger, 2005</xref>). Increased JNK activity, which is observed following damage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bosch et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Mattila et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bergantiños et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Fan et al., 2014</xref>), reduces Polycomb-mediated repression and increases the frequency of transdetermination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Lee et al., 2005</xref>) as well as other types of fate changes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Herrera and Morata, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Schuster and Smith-Bolton, 2015</xref>) by mechanisms that have not been elucidated. Finally, not all regions within a given disc have the same probability of undergoing a change of fate; Gerold Schubiger and colleagues described a region in the leg disc called the ‘weak point’ that has drastically higher rates of leg-to-wing transdetermination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Schubiger, 1971</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Maves and Schubiger, 1995</xref>).</p><p>Our understanding of cell fate plasticity during regeneration is still at an early stage. Based on gene expression changes in regenerating discs, mutations in several candidate genes examined were shown to change the frequency of transdetermination, but the underlying mechanisms are not known (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Klebes et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">McClure et al., 2008</xref>). To systematically screen for mutations that increase the frequency of cell fate changes during regeneration, we used a genetic system developed in our laboratory that reproducibly ablates a specific portion of the wing pouch and then allows it to regenerate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Smith-Bolton et al., 2009</xref>). We identified mutations in the gene encoding the transcriptional co-repressor, C-terminal Binding Protein (CtBP), and show that CtBP opposes the destabilization of cell fates during regeneration caused by JNK and the JAK/STAT pathway.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>To study changes in cell determination during regeneration, we used a genetic system to damage specific parts of imaginal discs and investigated genetic alterations that modify the response of surviving cells.

Normal halteres were still observed, indicating that the ectopic wings were not generated by a haltere-to-wing transformation (such as those caused by mutations in the Hox gene <italic>Ubx</italic>).

However, we observed that in some <italic>CtBP<sup>Q229*/+</sup></italic> discs, only <italic>STAT-DGFP</italic> expression was detected, without a spot of MMP1 expression, suggesting that JAK/STAT activity in the notum can occur independently of ectopic JNK activation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>).</p><p>If JAK/STAT activation occurs in the notum following damage to the pouch, where is the ligand being produced? It is known that Unpaired-family ligands are upregulated following damage to discs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Pastor-Pareja et al., 2008</xref>) and during regeneration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Katsuyama et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Santabárbara-Ruiz et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">La Fortezza et al., 2016</xref>). We used the reporter <italic>upd3-lacZ</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Bunker et al., 2015</xref>), which is not expressed at high levels in undamaged late L3 discs, to investigate where Upd3 ligand is being produced (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6G</xref>). At 0 hr of recovery, <italic>upd3-lacZ</italic> expression was observed in the region of the ablated pouch in both wild type (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6H</xref>) and <italic>CtBP<sup>Q229*/+</sup></italic> discs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6I</xref>), but not in the notum, even though <italic>STAT-DGFP</italic> expression was detected there (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6I’</xref>). Since ligands of the Upd family are known to diffuse considerable distances, it is possible that the Upd ligands were generated by tissue damage and JNK activation in the pouch region and then diffused to the notum and activated JAK/STAT signaling. Indeed, the expression of <italic>UAS-upd1</italic> in the myoblasts, which are basal to the notum epithelium, caused the activation of the JAK/STAT pathway in the notum and the disruption of the notum Wg stripe, but not the formation of an ectopic pouch (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2</xref>). A similar disruption of the notum Wg stripe was observed following <italic>rn<sup>ts</sup>&gt;egr</italic> damage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>). Thus disruption of the notum Wg stripe appears insufficient to trigger ectopic pouch formation and other events seem necessary.</p><p>If JAK/STAT activation is needed to form ectopic wings, then a decrease in JAK/STAT activity may suppress the frequency of ectopic wings. The removal of one copy of the JAK/STAT transcription factor <italic>Stat92E</italic> (<italic>FRT82B Stat92E<sup>85C9</sup></italic>) significantly decreased the frequency of ectopic wings (EWs) when compared to <italic>FRT82B</italic> (which had a background rate of EWs) in both a wild type and <italic>CtBP<sup>Q229*/+</sup></italic> genetic background (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6J</xref>). The reduction in the levels of the Upd-family ligands, by removal of one copy of either <italic>upd2</italic> or <italic>upd3,</italic> or both <italic>upd2</italic> and <italic>upd3</italic> significantly reduced the frequency of ectopic wings (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6K</xref>). In addition, this suppression was completely rescued by the addition of <italic>UAS-upd1,</italic> which indicates that the different Upd-family ligands are acting similarly in this situation. Together, this strongly indicates that the levels of JAK/STAT signaling can modulate the frequency of the notum-to-pouch cell fate change.</p><p>Does <italic>CtBP</italic> modulate the JAK/STAT pathway? First, we tested if <italic>upd3</italic> expression was altered in <italic>CtBP<sup>-/-</sup></italic> clones and found no change under undamaged conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s3">Figure 6—figure supplement 3</xref>).

In the imaginal disc, cells at each location have distinct patterns of gene expression. Hence, if portions of the disc are eliminated and replaced by the proliferation of nearby cells, the newly generated cells will need to adopt characteristics distinct from the cells that they are derived from. At the same time, other cells need to preserve established patterns of gene expression. Our work suggests that the limited plasticity that is necessary for regeneration results from an interplay of pathways that promote plasticity such as JNK/AP-1 and JAK/STAT with regulators that limit the activity of these pathways such as CtBP.</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>The relationship between ablation of the pouch and activation of the JNK/AP-1 and JAK/STAT in the notum</title><p>Activation of two pathways, JNK/AP-1 and JAK/STAT, appears to be necessary for promoting cells in the notum to adopt a pouch fate. How does ablation of the pouch promote the activation of these pathways in the notum? Neither ablation of the pouch using <italic>rpr</italic> nor activation of the Egr-receptor Grind in the pouch suffices. Thus, Egr is necessary and it either activates additional Grnd-independent pathways, or, more likely, activation of the Egr pathway in cells outside the <italic>rn-GAL4</italic> expression domain is necessary. This could be both to activate JNK/AP-1 signaling locally around the damaged pouch and at a greater distance in the notum. The local signal to the hinge cells surrounding the wing pouch may produce the <italic>upd</italic> ligands, as these cells normally express <italic>upd1</italic>. Egr may also signal directly to the notum, as a cleaved secreted ligand or from membrane fragments of cellular debris, much of which is trapped apically. In support of this idea, a secreted form of Egr is more effective than the membrane tethered form at inducing ectopic wings. Since reducing <italic>CtBP</italic> function increases AP-1 activity, the notum of <italic>CtBP<sup>-/+</sup></italic> discs will likely be more responsive to Egr signaling, leading to the activation of downstream AP-1 targets, such as <italic>dilp8</italic> and <italic>wg</italic>.</p><p><italic>STAT-DGFP</italic> expression in the notum is increased in <italic>CtBP</italic> heterozygotes following ablation of the pouch. Increased JNK activity in the dying cells of the pouch would be expected to generate increasing levels of Upd-family ligands since they are upregulated in regenerating discs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Katsuyama et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Santabárbara-Ruiz et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">La Fortezza et al., 2016</xref>) and regulatory elements of these genes have AP-1-binding sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Bunker et al., 2015</xref>). Consistent with their production by dying cells is the observation that more rapid killing of pouch cells by co-expression of <italic>rpr</italic> reduces notum-to-pouch transformations.</p><p>Increased STAT activity in the notum reduces notum-specific patterns of gene expression and promotes a hinge-like fate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Ayala-Camargo et al., 2013</xref>). Consistent with this, we found that reducing gene dosage of <italic>mirr</italic>, a homeodomain-containing protein expressed in the notum, increased the frequency of ectopic wings. A recent study reported the generation of ectopic wings simply by expression of <italic>UAS-upd1</italic> in the notum (without directed tissue damage) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Recasens-Alvarez et al., 2017</xref>). However, this study induced expression in the second larval instar (day 5 at 18°C) and did not report if expression of <italic>UAS-upd1</italic> at later time points could also induce ectopic wings. Of note, we have found that expression of high levels of <italic>UAS-upd1</italic> generates considerable levels of apoptosis. Conceivably, the generation of ectopic wings in that report could therefore also have resulted from the combined activation of the JAK/STAT and AP-1 pathways.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Why does formation of the ectopic pouch begin at a specific location in the notum?</title><p>Imaginal discs have been hypothesized to have ‘weak points’, where transdetermination occurs most often following physical fragmentation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Schubiger, 1971</xref>), (reviewed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">McClure and Schubiger, 2007</xref>]). Other cell fate transformations are also more likely to occur in particular regions of the discs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Salzer and Kumar, 2010</xref>). For leg-to-wing transdetermination in the prothoracic leg disc, the weak point is located where two different morphogens, Wg and Dpp, are co-expressed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Johnston and Schubiger, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Maves and Schubiger, 1998</xref>). In the wing disc, Dpp is expressed along the anteroposterior (AP) compartment boundary and Wg, is expressed along part of the dorsoventral (DV) compartment boundary through the wing pouch. The AP and DV boundaries likely intersect at two locations – one in the middle of the wing pouch and in the notum near the region where we observe ectopic pouch formation. In addition, the notum Wg stripe in the L3 disc generates an additional location where both Wg and Dpp are expressed. Therefore, it is possible that similar to the weak point in the leg disc, the presence of both these morphogens makes cells more prone to change fate, especially following damage.</p><p>This region of the notum could be predisposed to an increase in STAT activity. When <italic>UAS-upd1</italic> is expressed using <italic>dpp-GAL4</italic>, <italic>STAT-DGFP</italic> expression is not observed along the entire GAL4 domain. Rather, it is mostly restricted to the pouch, and importantly, a region of the notum. These regions are more responsive to Upd-family ligands than other parts of the disc and the area in the notum is likely the weak point for notum-to-pouch fate change. Recent studies have described regions in wing discs that are tumor hot-spots (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Tamori et al., 2016</xref>) and are resistant to apoptosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Verghese and Su, 2016</xref>) and found that they also have elevated JAK/STAT activity. Thus, parts of the disc that have elevated STAT activity may be more capable of surviving damage and then re-specifying cell fates.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Events during the formation of an ectopic pouch have similarities to specification of the pouch during normal development</title><p>During normal development, the initial specification of the wing pouch occurs towards the end of the first larval instar. At this time STAT is active through most of the wing disc and <italic>wg</italic> is expressed in a patch in the anterior and ventral portion of the disc. Subsequently, <italic>wg</italic> expression expands from its initial region of expression when cells surrounding the nascent pouch are recruited to a pouch fate by a feed-forward mechanism that is fueled by Wg (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Wu and Cohen, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Zecca and Struhl, 2007b</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">2010</xref>). In the absence of Wg expression, the pouch is not specified.</p><p>In our system, <italic>wg</italic> expression from the damage-responsive enhancer is important for triggering ectopic wings. However, we found that additional Wg (<italic>rn<sup>ts</sup></italic>&gt;egr, &gt;wg), if at all, decreased the frequency of ectopic wings and that Wg alone was incapable of transforming a more mature notum to an ectopic pouch; therefore JAK/STAT and AP-1 activity appear necessary. Based on our observations and those of others, JAK/STAT activity can reduce the expression of notum-specific genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Ayala-Camargo et al., 2013</xref>). This likely transforms that part of the notum to a less committed state. Thus, a region with elevated STAT activity leads to relatively uncommitted notum cells and within this region, the activation of AP-1 promotes Wg expression via a damage-responsive enhancer, which may create conditions similar to the initial specification of the wing pouch at earlier stages of development (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D</xref>).</p><p>Once the ectopic pouch has been specified, the nascent pouch could turn on the <italic>rn-GAL4</italic> driver, even briefly, prior to the downshift. Then <italic>egr</italic> expression would occur resulting in localized apoptosis and JNK activation.

This would then have the effect of reinforcing the conditions that are necessary for notum-to-pouch fate change and the generation of a new wing pouch. While this paper was under review, another paper was published that gives support to damage-induced fate changes relying on JAK/STAT and Wg signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Verghese and Su, 2017</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3-4"><title>Role of CtBP in resisting cell fate changes</title><p>We have shown that clones of cells lacking CtBP function have elevated levels of AP-1 activity and, in a few cases in specific portions of the disc, increased STAT activity. CtBP is a co-repressor that interacts with a number of transcriptional repressors via a PxDLS motif including Brinker (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Hasson et al., 2001</xref>) and Hairy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Poortinga et al., 1998</xref>) and hence multiple CtBP-containing complexes could be relevant for this role of CtBP. Intriguingly, some of the isoforms of the <italic>Drosophila</italic> Fos ortholog, Kayak, which heterodimerizes with Jun to form the AP-1 transcription factor, have PxDLS motifs. While AP-1 has mostly been studied as a transcription factor that activates gene expression upon phosphorylation of Jun by JNK, in the absence of sufficient activating signals, it may repress inappropriate expression of AP-1 target genes via CtBP. In this way, CtBP could buffer cell fates from destabilization caused by fluctuations in the level of JNK activity.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Fly stocks</title><p>The stocks that were used in this study include: <italic>rn-GAL4, tub-GAL80<sup>ts</sup>, rn-GAL4</italic>, <italic>tub-GAL80<sup>ts</sup></italic>, <italic>UAS-egr</italic> and <italic>rn-GAL4</italic>, <italic>tub-GAL80<sup>ts</sup></italic>, <italic>UAS-rpr</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Smith-Bolton et al., 2009</xref>), <italic>hh-GAL4</italic>, <italic>ptc-GAL4, tub-GAL80<sup>ts</sup>, nub-GAL4; tub-GAL80<sup>ts</sup></italic>, <italic>UAS-egr/TM6B-GAL80, dpp-GAL4</italic> (BL:1553), <italic>R15B03-GAL4</italic> (BL:49261), <italic>R76A01-GAL4</italic> (BL:46953) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Pfeiffer et al., 2008</xref>), <italic>G-TRACE</italic> (BL:28280, BL:28281) and <italic>Ubi&lt;stop&lt;GFP<sup>nls</sup></italic> (BL:32250, BL:32251)(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Evans et al., 2009</xref>), <italic>Act5C&gt;FRT.CD2&gt;GAL4, UAS-RFP</italic> (BL:30558), <italic>vgQE-RFP</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Zecca and Struhl, 2007a</xref>), <italic>hs-FLP; Act&lt;stop&lt;lacZ<sup>nls</sup>, Ubi&lt;stop&lt;GFP<sup>nls</sup></italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Worley et al., 2013</xref>), <italic>UAS-CtBP</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bhambhani et al., 2011</xref>), <italic>Genomic CtBP construct (gCtBP)</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Zhang and Arnosti, 2011</xref>), <italic>UAS-ecto-eiger</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Narasimamurthy et al., 2009</xref>), <italic>UAS-grind<sup>ICD</sup></italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Andersen et al., 2015</xref>)<italic>, MMP1-LacZ</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Uhlirova and Bohmann, 2006</xref>), <italic>AP-1-GFP</italic> and <italic>AP-1-RFP</italic> reporters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Chatterjee and Bohmann, 2012</xref>), <italic>upd3-lacZ</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Bunker et al., 2015</xref>), <italic>upd3.1-lacZ</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Jiang et al., 2011</xref>), <italic>BRV-B-GFP</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Harris et al., 2016</xref>), <italic>UAS-Dronc<sup>DN</sup> (UAS-Dronc<sup>C318S</sup></italic>)(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Hawkins et al., 2000</xref>), <italic>FRT82B, FRT82B CtBP<sup>Q229*</sup></italic> and <italic>FRT82B Stat92E<sup>85C9</sup>.</italic> Stocks obtained from Bloomington stock center include: <italic>CtBP<sup>87De-10</sup></italic> (BL:1663), <italic>CtBP<sup>03463</sup></italic> (BL:11590), <italic>UAS-CtBP<sup>RNAi</sup></italic> (BL:31334, BL:32889), <italic>mirr<sup>1486</sup></italic> (BL:23935), <italic>mirr<sup>1825</sup></italic> (BL:23928), <italic>hep<sup>r75</sup></italic> (BL:6761), <italic>UAS-Fos<sup>DN</sup></italic> (<italic>UAS-Fra.Fbz</italic>, BL:7214), <italic>UAS-JNK<sup>DN</sup></italic> (<italic>UAS-bsk<sup>K53R</sup>,</italic> BL:9311), <italic>UAS-p35</italic> (BL:5072, 5073), <italic>dIlp8<sup>MI00727</sup></italic> (BL:33079), <italic>UAS-wg</italic> (BL:5918, BL:5919), <italic>UAS-hep<sup>CA</sup></italic> (BL:6406), <italic>lexAOp-FLP</italic> (BL:55820), <italic>R81E08-lexA</italic> (BL:54377), <italic>R76B02-lexA</italic> (BL:54118), <italic>R76B06-lexA</italic> (BL:54225), <italic>R15C03-lexA</italic> (BL:52490), <italic>10XSTAT92E-GFP</italic> (BL:26197) and <italic>10XSTAT92E-DGFP</italic> (BL:26199) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bach et al., 2007</xref>)<italic>, Df(3R)Exel8157</italic> (BL:7973), and <italic>upd2<sup>Δ</sup></italic> (BL:55727)<italic>, upd2<sup>Δ</sup>upd3<sup>Δ</sup></italic> (BL:55729)<italic>, upd3<sup>Δ</sup></italic> (BL:55728)(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Osman et al., 2012</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-2"><title>Temperature shift and clone induction experiments</title><p>Genetic ablation experiments were conducted as described in (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Smith-Bolton et al., 2009</xref>).

Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, one of whom, Bruce Edgar (Reviewer #1), is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the evaluation has been overseen by Didier Stainier as the Senior Editor. The following individuals involved in review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Giovanni Bosco (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Reviewing Editor's comments:</p><p>All three reviewers appreciated the approaches used in this paper, and its content. However reviewer #1 felt that the paper was much too long and had many inconclusive sections that could be condensed or removed. In discussions, the other reviewers agreed with this perspective.</p><p>Reviewer #3 also felt that the paper should have delivered more mechanistic insight as to how CtBP affects transdetermination, but we understand that providing this could be challenging and time-consuming, and so we decided that it is not required at this stage. Hence we would like to invite you to submit a revised manuscript that is significantly shorter than the current version (30-50%) and more linear in presentation. Specific suggestions for how to do this can be found in the reviews, which I include below essentially in their entirety.</p><p>In addition, the points #4 and #6 from reviewer 1 merit special consideration – if you can provide further data addressing these points this would be much appreciated. At the very least, a clear discussion of the action of <italic>egr</italic> is needed. The reviewers also had a number of minor comments regarding controls, clarification of methods and interpretation of the results, which you should address in your revision. Overall we agreed that the paper was sufficiently developed and could be published without large amounts of additional data, provided the delivery is succinct and clear. <italic>eLife</italic> looks forward to receiving your revision.</p><p>Reviewer #1:</p><p>In this paper, Worley, Alexander, and Hariharan revisit the phenomenon of damage-initiated trans-determination in <italic>Drosophila</italic> wing imaginal discs, using new genetic methods to identify the genes involved. This is an interesting process with potentially broad relevance, but little progress has been made on it in years. The authors present a very nice genetic saturation screen of the third chromosome (~40% of the genome) that identifies many genes potentially involved. Then they focus on one gene, CtBP at 87D, and show how this affects transdetermination of notum cells to wing pouch cells. The process involves JNK and STAT activation (as expected) at the wound site, is multi clonal, and involves the activation of a number of other genes that are tracked. The effects of these genes are are clearly demonstrated, but the paper falls short of determining any clear mechanisms at the molecular level.</p><p>This manuscript starts out nicely with one of the best introductions on the subject of transdetermination that I've read, and succinct descriptions of the damage protocol (already detailed in a previous publication) and the modifier screen, which is clever and effective (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). The effect of CtBP is clear, but it was not obvious why the authors focused on this one gene, and this should be stated. Following this nice entry, the paper details a huge number of genetic tests of mechanism in the subsequent 7 figures and 15 pages of meandering text. The specific tests that were done are all logical, and the results are interpreted in a critical fashion, but unfortunately they don't come together in a very readable, coherent form. Although the effects of <italic>egr</italic>, Ap1, Stat, etc are clear, the authors don't succeed in demonstrating how these factors work together very well, and some obvious questions are left unresolved (see below). In addition, many tests that were relatively inconclusive are presented, as well as quite a few negative results and dead ends. Many paragraphs in the Results section don't have a conclusion at all. Overall the Results section meanders from one issue to the next, with too much discussion, and no obvious direction. It is far too long. It seems to be a very raw draft of a large body of work, essentially un-refined, and it really should be re-written in a much more concise, linear format to be digestible by a general audience. Much of what is here could probably be presented much more simply, or just omitted, without affecting the paper's final conclusions. I suggest trying to pare it down to about half the current length. While I think the core content of this paper is valuable and should be published, I cannot recommend it in its current form. Specific points follow below:</p><p>1) There is a long section about the Rga locus but then this locus is never mentioned again. What is it's map location? What is its relevance to the paper's overall conclusion? This locus justifies the screen, but if it is not relevant to the paper's conclusions the section devoted to it should be removed. The paper contains several other examples of discussion of this sort of irrelevant, distracting data.</p><p>2) The authors should note why they focused on region 87D after doing the screen. Further discussion of other loci that strongly affected transdetermination could enhance this paper, if the genes involved are known. Nevertheless, it is very nice that the authors include the complete results of their very elegant screen (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1I</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary File 1</xref>).</p><p>3) The long paragraph in subsection “Re-specifying cell fates requires the activation of the JNK/AP-1 pathway” is an example of a discussion of results that meanders and has no conclusion.</p><p>4) There are quite a few experiments that address the requirements of <italic>egr</italic>, Jnk, and apoptosis in promoting transdetermination, and much discussion about this. However the paper doesn't seem to have a clear conclusion about whether <italic>egr</italic> triggers transdetermination via JNK-mediated AP1 activation, or JNK-mediated apoptosis, or both. Egr is clearly sufficient, and <italic>JNK</italic> required but not sufficient, and apoptosis is not sufficient, but it's not clear what, downstream of <italic>egr</italic>, is doing it. Is apoptosis required? I think a few more experiments are required here, and a cleaner more definitive conclusion is needed about which downstream targets of <italic>egr</italic> are critical.</p><p>5) The effects on dILP8 expression are interesting and suggestive (“dilp8 expression in a secondary location is predictive of ectopic wing pouch formation”), but dILP8 function is not tested. It would be a nice addition to the paper if the role of dILP8 were tested using mutants, RNAi, and overexpression.</p><p>6) Upd ligand production, in response to <italic>egr</italic>, or Ap1, or apoptosis directly, seems to be an important aspect of the authors proposed mechanism (Figure 8Q, and Results). However they don't seem to have tested the requirement functionally, except by <italic>Upd1</italic> overexpression and in Stat+/- mutants. There are <italic>upd2, upd3</italic>, and <italic>upd2,3</italic> deletion lines that are viable and could be used to test the requirement of these damage-dependent ligands.</p><p>7) Given the multitude of tests presented, the summary diagram (Figure 8Q) is surprisingly simple. Could the authors add more detail to this? Alternatively, the paper could be much more readable if it included ONLY results that are directly relevant to this model.</p><p>Reviewer #2:</p><p>The manuscript by Worley et al. shows the requirement of the transcriptional co-repressor CtBP for proper cell fate specifications in regenerating <italic>Drosophila</italic> larval wing imaginal discs after apoptosis-induced damage. The authors first find that, in certain genetic backgrounds, regeneration after <italic>rn<sup>ts</sup></italic>&gt;<italic>egr</italic> damage produces ectopic wing tissues. They then conduct a genetic screen using stocks bearing deletions of the third chromosome in the <italic>rn<sup>ts</sup></italic>&gt;<italic>egr</italic> background and find that many deletions induce the formation of ectopic wings at varied penetrance. They then identify and focus on CtBP, a transcriptional co-repressor. Regarding the signaling pathway, the authors demonstrate that Egr-dependent JNK activation in the wing pouch is necessary for the generation of ectopic wings and that JAK-STAT signaling promotes the notum-to-pouch transformation. They further find that cells in the notum are re-specified to ectopic wing pouch, but maintain their compartment identity, show that epigenetic regulation plays an opposite role to STAT and Wg in modulating the frequency of ectopic growth. They finally show that loss of CtBP increases the AP-1 activity and propose a model to explain how CtBP prevents cell fate specifications in regenerating <italic>Drosophila</italic> imaginal discs.</p><p>The results presented in this manuscript are very interesting and will be of interest to the field of tissue regeneration and developmental signaling. The authors conduct a series of elegant genetic assays and provide compelling results to validate the conclusions they made, therefore the conclusions are convincing.</p><p>Specific Comments:</p><p>1) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4K</xref>. Since temperature shift and genetic background affect the frequency of ectopic wings, in order to conclude that &quot;expression of &gt;<italic>egr</italic> in the wing pouch is the major cause of generating ectopic wings&quot;, the authors also need to test the R15B03-, R76A01-, and dpp-Gal4 drivers using the same temperature shift protocol.</p><p>2) Scale bar is missing in some figures.</p><p>3) Since the clean genetic background did not produce ectopic wings in <italic>rn<sup>ts</sup></italic>&gt;<italic>egr</italic>, the description at the beginning part of the manuscript is misleading. This information should be included in the Abstract.</p><p>4) <italic>rn<sup>ts</sup></italic> control is needed for <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A</xref>.</p><p>5) G-trace with low- and high-flp needs to be better described in the text/(<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>).</p><p>6) Figure 8A-H, MMP1-lacZ is robustly upregulated in CtBP homozygous mutant clones, whereas, AP-1-GFP is only found in a few cells of CtBP mutant clones. What causes the dramatic difference of these two JNK signaling reporters upon CtBP loss?</p><p>Reviewer #3:</p><p>The manuscript by Worley and colleagues seeks to understand mechanisms of cellular reprogramming during tissue regeneration while keeping in check inappropriate cell fates and proliferation. The authors use the <italic>Drosophila</italic> wing disc as a model of regeneration after induced cell death in order to screen for factors that modify the formation of regenerated wings and wing tissue. This genetics screen reveals that the C-terminal Binding Protein (CtBP) likely inhibits changes in cell fates and limits inappropriate differentiation and proliferation. Through a series of tenacious and elegant genetic experiments the authors show that a combination of JAK/STAT activation and AP-1 activity cell specifically located at the &quot;weak point&quot; of the wing disc notum can switch cell fates when triggered to regenerate after tissue damage. Reduction of CtBP function (either in a heterozygous background or homozygous clones) increases AP-1, as assayed by an AP-1-GFP reporter and is proposed to increase the levels of cell fate changes. Although it is not clear how CtBP modulates AP-1 levels and/or what other CtBP target genes contribute to restricting cell fate changes, these observations are interesting in and of themselves as they lay the foundation upon which more molecular mechanistic experiments can be done. For example, what exactly constitutes &quot;weak points&quot;, how does CtBP co-repressor work to modulate AP-1 activity specifically at the proposed weak point, and consequently are Upd-family ligands directly involved in cell fate determination in the context of regenerating tissue? Although this study identifies CtBP as a previously unrecognized modulator of cellular plasticity, it remains unclear how it achieves this and how much more molecular mechanism could/should have been elucidated. Other than that I do not have substantive concerns.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.30391.033</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewing Editor's comments:</p><p>All three reviewers appreciated the approaches used in this paper, and its content.

This locus justifies the screen, but if it is not relevant to the paper's conclusions the section devoted to it should be removed. The paper contains several other examples of discussion of this sort of irrelevant, distracting data.</p></disp-quote><p>We have removed the section on the <italic>Rga</italic> locus since it is not particularly relevant to the overall conclusions of our study.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) The authors should note why they focused on region 87D after doing the screen. Further discussion of other loci that strongly affected transdetermination could enhance this paper, if the genes involved are known. Nevertheless, it is very nice that the authors include the complete results of their very elegant screen (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1I</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>).</p></disp-quote><p>The reason we focused on 87D was because this is the only region thus far, where we have been able to unambiguously identify the gene within the deletion, that when mutated, robustly enhanced the frequency of notum-to-pouch fate change. We did include all the data from our deficiency screen so others could use our data to explore candidate genes if they wish.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) The long paragraph in subsection “Re-specifying cell fates requires the activation of the JNK/AP-1 pathway” is an example of a discussion of results that meanders and has no conclusion.</p></disp-quote><p>We have eliminated this and other similar paragraphs.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) There are quite a few experiments that address the requirements of egr, Jnk, and apoptosis in promoting transdetermination, and much discussion about this. However the paper doesn't seem to have a clear conclusion about whether egr triggers transdetermination via JNK-mediated AP1 activation, or JNK-mediated apoptosis, or both. Egr is clearly sufficient, and JNK required but not sufficient, and apoptosis is not sufficient, but it's not clear what, downstream of egr, is doing it. Is apoptosis required? I think a few more experiments are required here, and a cleaner more definitive conclusion is needed about which downstream targets of egr are critical.</p></disp-quote><p>We have included additional data that address these issues. Our experiments show that apoptosis of the pouch, in itself does not promote the notum-to-pouch transformation. Ablation with <italic>reaper</italic> does not cause ectopic pouch formation nor does hastening death by co-expressing <italic>eiger</italic> and <italic>reaper</italic>. Our data suggest that cells with high levels of AP-1 activation, express target genes such as <italic>unpaired</italic>-family genes and <italic>dilp8</italic> which contribute to the fate change. We also show that strictly cell autonomous activation of Eiger signaling in the pouch does not suffice. It is possible that this is because cells in the hinge are more capable of expressing high levels of Upd-family proteins than cells in the pouch and do so when they are exposed to Eiger.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) The effects on dILP8 expression are interesting and suggestive (“dilp8 expression in a secondary location is predictive of ectopic wing pouch formation”), but dILP8 function is not tested. It would be a nice addition to the paper if the role of dILP8 were tested using mutants, RNAi, and overexpression.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for this suggestion. We have included additional data that show that reducing <italic>dilp8</italic> function reduces the frequency of ectopic pouches and increasing <italic>dilp8</italic> expression increases the frequency.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) Upd ligand production, in response to egr, or Ap1, or apoptosis directly, seems to be an important aspect of the authors proposed mechanism (Figure 8Q, and Results). However they don't seem to have tested the requirement functionally, except by Upd1 overexpression and in Stat+/- mutants. There are upd2, upd3, and upd2,3 deletion lines that are viable and could be used to test the requirement of these damage-dependent ligands.</p></disp-quote><p>We have now included these experiments. The <italic>upd 2,3</italic> deletion dominantly reduces the frequency of ectopic pouches and this effect is overcome by co-expression of <italic>upd1</italic>. These experiments show that <italic>upd 2</italic> and <italic>3</italic> are necessary for ectopic pouch formation and that the different upd family members can function interchangeably in this situation. This strengthens our argument that signaling from the damaged wing pouch to the notum is important for triggering this fate change.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2:</p><p>[…]</p><p>Specific Comments:</p><p>1) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4K</xref>. Since temperature shift and genetic background affect the frequency of ectopic wings, in order to conclude that &quot;expression of &gt;egr in the wing pouch is the major cause of generating ectopic wings&quot;, the authors also need to test the R15B03-, R76A01-, and dpp-Gal4 drivers using the same temperature shift protocol.</p></disp-quote><p>We conducted these experiments with <italic>tub-GAL80<sup>ts</sup></italic> and the same temperature shift protocol.
