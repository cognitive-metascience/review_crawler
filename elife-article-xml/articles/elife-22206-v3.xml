(US12-21) with poorly characterized function. We now identify novel natural killer (NK) cell evasion functions for four members: US12, US14, US18 and US20. Using a systematic multiplexed proteomics approach to quantify ~1300 cell surface and ~7200 whole cell proteins, we demonstrate that the US12 family selectively targets plasma membrane proteins and plays key roles in regulating NK ligands, adhesion molecules and cytokine receptors. US18 and US20 work in concert to suppress cell surface expression of the critical NKp30 ligand B7-H6 thus inhibiting NK cell activation. The US12 family is therefore identified as a major new hub of immune regulation.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.22206.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.22206.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.22206.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Cytomegalovirus (CMV) is one of eight herpesviruses that can infect humans. Most people will at some point become infected with CMV, yet the virus tends only to cause serious disease in people whose immune system is not working properly. Individuals living with HIV/AIDS and organ transplant recipients (who have to take drugs that suppress their immune system to prevent the organ being rejected) are particularly vulnerable to CMV infections. Critically, the virus can cross the placenta to infect of the foetus. CMV infection in the womb can cause miscarriage, lead to severe developmental problems in babies and is a major cause of deafness.</p><p>Herpesvirus infections are for life. While the immune system cannot eliminate CMV, it does have many systems that combine to sense and control infections. Natural killer cells are known to play a critical role in detecting and destroying cells infected with CMV. The virus, in turn, has nine genes that help to protect it against natural killer cells. This includes two genes that belong to a group of similar genes called the US12 family, but it is not clear whether other members of this gene family also provide protection against natural killer cells.</p><p>Fielding <italic>et al.</italic> now show that at least four members of the US12 gene family help CMV to evade natural killer cells. For example, two members work together to target a human protein called B7-H6 that acts a sensor to alert natural killer cells if a particular cell is infected. However, the impact of the US12 family goes even wider. The whole family works together to control proteins that are found on the surface of human cells, and many of these proteins appear to be involved in regulating the immune response.</p><p>The findings of Fielding et al. provide an insight into how the US12 gene family works, and how CMV has evolved to escape the human immune system. New therapies to control CMV infections are urgently needed so the next challenge is to design new antiviral agents that will target CMV’s defence systems.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link

cytomegalovirus (HCMV) genome is the largest of any characterized human virus and is comprised of long and short unique regions (U<sub>L</sub> and U<sub>S</sub>), each flanked by inverted terminal repeats. HCMV codes for around of 170 canonical protein-coding genes with 39 herpesvirus ‘core’ genes concentrated in the center of the U<sub>L</sub> region (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Dolan et al., 2004</xref>). The core genes mainly encode structural components of the virion and proteins required for virus DNA replication and have orthologues in the other human herpesviruses. The vast majority of the remaining HCMV genes are not essential for virus replication <italic>in vitro</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Dunn et al., 2003</xref>) yet are replete with accessory functions, many of which have been implicated in suppressing host immune responses. Unusually, HCMV encodes 15 gene families of variable size that are often clustered on the genome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Davison et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Holzerlandt et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Chee et al., 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Dolan et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Davison et al., 2003</xref>). Many of these gene families exhibit homology with cellular genes and are conserved to various extents in other primate CMVs. Consequently, these primate CMV gene families are likely to have arisen through gene capture and amplification driven by differential selective pressures in their various primate hosts over millennia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Davison et al., 2013</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">2003</xref>).</p><p>The US12 gene family consists of 10 genes, designated US12 to US21, arranged sequentially in the U<sub>S</sub> region and transcribed in the same orientation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Chee et al., 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Dolan et al., 2004</xref>). The genetic arrangement of the US12 family is reminiscent of ‘accordion’ gene expansions, which are generated when a cellular or virus resistance function is placed under strong selective pressure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Filée, 2013</xref>). Such an expansion was recently exemplified experimentally using a poxvirus interferon resistance function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Elde et al., 2012</xref>). The US12 family encodes a series of 7-transmembrane spanning proteins with low-level homology to the cellular transmembrane bax-inhibitor one motif-containing proteins (TMBIM). While not essential for virus replication, the US12 family has been implicated in HCMV tropism, virion maturation and immune evasion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Das and Pellett, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Cavaletto et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bronzini et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hai et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Gurczynski et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Fielding et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>Natural Killer (NK) cells play a critical role in controlling HCMV infections, and the virus invests a substantial proportion of its coding capacity to inhibit NK cell activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Wilkinson et al., 2013</xref>). We previously observed that US18 and US20 suppress cell surface expression of the NK cell-activating ligand MICA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Fielding et al., 2014</xref>) and posited that the synergistic action of US18 and US20 may be the vestige of an immune selective pressure that drove the original expansion of the US12 family. These data show that multiple US12 family members can co-operate to target the same cellular protein. Therefore individual functions, as identified with single gene viral mutants, may not be readily replicated by expressing these same viral genes in isolation, i.e. these viral genes may work more efficiently in the context of HCMV productive infection.</p><p>To investigate the function of <italic>all</italic> US12 family genes, we undertook a systematic functional analysis that showed four members were NK immunevasins. Conventional biochemical investigations on US12 family proteins are rendered problematic due to their extreme hydrophobicity. We therefore undertook multiplexed Tandem Mass Tag (TMT)-based proteomic analyses to systematically evaluate the capacity of all US12 family genes to modulate the cellular proteome, both individually and in concert. Such an approach has been enabled by our recent development of Plasma Membrane Profiling (PMP) to identify novel cell surface targets for the HCMV latency protein UL138 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Weekes et al., 2013</xref>) and individual viral immunevasins UL141 and US2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Hsu et al., 2015</xref>). Quantitative Temporal Viromics (QTV) allowed &gt;8000 cellular and 153 viral proteins to be tracked throughout the course of productive HCMV infection, thus building a comprehensive picture of cellular control by the virus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Weekes et al., 2014</xref>). Through comparative analysis of ~1300 cell surface and ~7200 cellular proteins during infection with HCMV US12 family deletion mutants, we now describe in detail how this family has a profound influence not only on NK cell recognition but other key functions that impact on immunity including cellular adhesion and cytokine signalling.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>US12 family members differentially affect NK cell activation</title><p>To determine whether the US12 family has a broader role in modulating NK cell responses, a series of HCMV US12 family deletion mutants were generated (10 single deletion mutants and the US12-21 ‘block’ deletion). The HCMV genome was manipulated by DNA recombineering in a strain Merlin BAC that did not express RL13 and UL128 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Stanton et al., 2010</xref>). Viruses were generated by DNA transfection and the complete genomic sequence of the virus stocks was validated by deep sequencing (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>). In NK functional assays, the △US12-21 block deletion mutant induced substantially higher levels of NK cell degranulation compared to the parent HCMV with all four different donors tested (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). Significantly increased levels of NK activation were detected in assays using deletion mutants of 5 different US12 family members: US12 (3 of 4 donors), US14 (1 of 4 donors, with a trend towards increased NK activation in the other three donors), US18 (3 of 4 donors), US20 (4 of 4 donors), US21 (4 of 4 donors) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>), while three US12 family deletion mutants (US15, US16, US19) reduced the level of NK cell activation in some donors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>).

Clusters of US12-related genes can be detected in cytomegaloviruses of New World primates, i.e. Green Monkey and Owl Monkey CMVs, thus the capture and expansion of an ancestral precursor presumably took place over 41 million years ago (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Davison et al., 2013</xref>). Within Cynomolgus and Rhesus macaques (Old World primates), chimpanzee and human CMVs, the US12 family is maintained as a well conserved contiguous tandem array of 10–11 genes located in the same relative position on each genome. Amongst circulating HCMV clinical strains, the US12 family exhibits relatively high levels of sequence conservation and genetic integrity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Sijmons et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>The complexity of the HCMV genome, its restricted host range in vitro and protracted replication cycle has frustrated studies into HCMV gene function. However, the advent of high-resolution multiplexed proteomics is revolutionizing our understanding of how HCMV orchestrates host cell gene expression and evades host defenses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Weekes et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Hsu et al., 2015</xref>). By systematically analyzing a bespoke panel of HCMV deletion mutants, we have discovered that the US12 family selectively targets a broad range of plasma membrane proteins that include, not only NK cell activating ligands, but also T-cell co-stimulatory molecules, cell adhesion molecules, and cytokine/cytokine receptors. The diversity of proteins targeted by many of the US12 family implies a broad strategy of redirecting cell surface receptors. A sizeable proportion of targeted plasma membrane proteins do not accumulate internally, but are degraded in lysosomes, as indicated by rescue with the inhibitor leupeptin. The overlap that exists between US12 gene family targets with those of the KSHV K5 viral E3 ubiquitin ligase (MICA, MICB, B7 family, ALCAM, IFNGR1, PTPRM, EPHA2, CD99, MPZL1/2) could represent convergent evolution and/or targeting of similar cellular pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Timms et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>The US12 family has a major impact on NK cell recognition with four US12 family members US12, US14, US18 and US20 consistently contributing toward significant levels of NK cell protection. Although the HCMV US21 deletion mutant also scored in functional assays, this could be due to enhanced expression of pUS20 associated with this construct. The NKG2DL MICB and ULBP2 are strongly upregulated during HCMV infection, but fail to reach the cell surface as they are retained in the ER by the NK evasion function gpUL16 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Rolle et al., 2003</xref>). Our proteomic data reveal that deletion of US12, US13 and US20 leads to increased cell surface and intracellular expression of MICB, ULBP2 and UL16 itself (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>). These observations are consistent with US12 family members acting in concert to direct UL16, MICB and ULBP2 towards proteolytic degradation, with leupeptin treatment clearly able to rescue MICB, and this may contribute to the NK evasion properties of US12 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). They also imply that some of the effects of the US12 family could be the result of co-operation with other HCMV genes. There is some precedent for this situation, although not previously on such a wide scale, as co-operation between US2 and UL141 was observed in the proteasomal degradation of some protein targets e.g. CD112 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Hsu et al., 2015</xref>). None of the US14 targets are recognized NK cell ligands, suggesting that this gene product utilizes a novel NK evasion mechanism.</p><p>B7-H6 is the major ligand identified for the natural cytotoxicity receptor (NCR) NKp30 and a tumor antigen (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Brandt et al., 2009</xref>). Previously, B7-H6 expression was shown to be induced by inflammatory stimuli, for example pro-inflammatory cytokines and bacterial-derived toll-like receptor (TLR) ligands (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Matta et al., 2013</xref>). We show here that B7-H6 expression is induced as a stress protein by HCMV infection (and potentially other virus infections) and that US18 and US20 act together to suppress cell surface expression of B7-H6 in the context of HCMV, thereby inhibiting NK cell activation. US18 and US20 were also able to regulate exogenously expressed B7-H6 when expressed individually. Therefore, they appear to target B7-H6 directly and not cellular pathways leading to the expression of B7-H6. The control of B7-H6 is likely to be of major significance as NKp30 is expressed on γδ T-cells (Vδ2<sup>-</sup>) that are induced during HCMV infection post-transplantation and correlate with control of disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Merville et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Lafarge et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Correia et al., 2011</xref>).</p><p>The US12 family clearly impacts on a broad range of cellular functions including adhesion molecules and cytokine receptors. Many of these adhesion molecules play roles in co-stimulation or immune synapse formation of T-cells e.g. ALCAM, ICOSLG, CXADR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Hassan et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Wang et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Witherden et al., 2010</xref>). The US12 family targets pro-inflammatory mediators, such as multiple members of the tumour necrosis factor receptor (TNFR) superfamily (TNFRSF8, TNFRSF12A, NGFR, LTBR), gp130 (IL6ST), the IL-6 receptor signaling receptor, pannexin-1 (PANX1) and the TLR4 ligand high-mobility group protein B1 (HMGB1) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Croft et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kanneganti et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Park et al., 2004</xref>). IL6ST signaling may also have antiviral effects in the context of HCMV (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Harwardt et al., 2016</xref>), which was suggested by the finding that disruption of gp130 STAT3 binding resulted in IFN-like signaling through STAT1(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Costa-Pereira et al., 2002</xref>).</p><p>The closest cellular homologues to the US12 family are the TMBIM family with recognised functions in controlling apoptosis, ER stress, ROS production, actin production, glucose metabolism and protein trafficking (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Rojas-Rivera and Hetz, 2015</xref>). The US12 family may have arisen through an ‘accordion’ gene expansion from a ‘captured’ ancestor TMBIM gene. Out of the entire US12 family, US21 displays the highest level of homology with TMBIM1/4, with the homologous region limited to the transmembrane domain and loops (unpublished observations, [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Lesniewski et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Holzerlandt et al., 2002</xref>]). The divergence of the US12 and TMBIM families is also reflected in their different membrane topologies, as TMBIM family have cytosolic N- and C-termini with six full transmembrane spanning regions, and US20 has a cytosolic N-terminus and lumenal C-terminus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Carrara et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Cavaletto et al., 2015</xref>). The functional relevance of the US12 family/TMBIM homology remains unclear, although it may represent a ‘functional scaffold’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Lesniewski et al., 2006</xref>), as a number of TMBIMs also target proteins for lysosomal degradation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Lee et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Yamaji et al., 2010</xref>).</p><p>Our data indicate that the US12 family targets multiple host immune ligands, consistent with the family having arisen, been selected and diverged in function as a consequence of immune selection. US12 family genes differ from the majority of characterised immune evasion viral genes, as they act together and do not exhibit single gene effects. The targeting of multiple proteins by a HCMV immunevasin or co-operation between HCMV gene products is not unprecedented, but was not previously observed on this scale or with this diversity of target proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Tomasec et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Prod'homme et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Smith et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Hsu et al., 2015</xref>).

A B7-H6 (NCR3LG1) expressing adenovirus was generated by synthesising the B7-H6 CDS (corresponding to Accession number NM_001202439.2, bases 209–1573 retaining the stop codon) with 5’ and 3’ arms of homology to the AdZ BAC (corresponding to the For and Rev primers used in the AdZ recombineering protocol) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Stanton et al., 2008</xref>) and flanking EcoRI sites (gene synthesis from Genscript, Piscataway, NJ). The cassette containing the B7-H6 CDS and both arms of homology was released from the pUC57 vector by EcoRI digest, gel purified and inserted into pAL1141 by recombineering to produce pAL1593. BAC DNA of pAL1593 purified by maxiprep (Macherey-Nagel, Dueren, Germany) was transfected into 293 TREX to generate the adenovirus, as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Stanton et al., 2008</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>HCMV infections</title><p>For proteomic analysis, 24 hr prior to each infection 1.5 × 10<sup>7</sup> HFFs were plated in a 150 cm<sup>2</sup> flask.

Infections were staggered such that all flasks were harvested simultaneously. For NK cell degranulation, flow cytometry and western blot analyses, cells were seeded in growth medium at appropriate cell densities (1 × 10<sup>6</sup> cells for a 25 cm<sup>2</sup> flask).

Briefly, we performed mass spectrometry using an Orbitrap Fusion, and quantified TMT reporter ions from the MS3 scan (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">McAlister et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Ting et al., 2011</xref>). Peptides were identified and quantified using a Sequest-based in-house software pipeline. A combined database was searched, consisting of: (a) human Uniprot, (b) Merlin strain HCMV Uniprot and (c) all additional novel HCMV ORFs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Stern-Ginossar et al., 2012</xref>). Peptides spectral matches (PSM) were filtered to a 1% peptide false discovery rate (FDR) using linear discriminant analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Huttlin et al., 2010</xref>). The resulting dataset was further collapsed to a final protein-level FDR of 1%. Protein assembly was guided by principles of parsimony. Where all PSM from a given HCMV protein could be explained either by a canonical gene or novel ORF, the canonical gene was picked in preference. Proteins were quantified by summing TMT reporter ion counts across all matching PSM after filtering based on isolation specificity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Pease et al., 2013</xref>). Reverse and contaminant proteins were removed, and protein quantitation values were exported for normalization and further analysis in Excel. Where all PSMs from a given HCMV protein could be explained either by a canonical gene or novel ORF, the canonical gene was picked in preference. For five viral proteins that had related novel ORFs (N-terminal extensions of the viral protein), some peptides could either have originated either from the canonical protein or the novel ORF. In these cases, each of the novel ORFs were quantified based only on unique peptides that could only have originated from that ORF. Peptides that could either have originated from the canonical protein or the novel ORF were assigned to the canonical protein. We estimated p values for the ratios of each mutant compared to HCMV Merlin or leupeptin-treated cells infected with HCMV Merlin to HCMV Merlin-infected cells, using Benjamini-Hochberg corrected Significance B values (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Cox and Mann, 2008</xref>).

Your article has been favorably evaluated by Wenhui Li (Senior Editor) and three reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal his identity: Michael G Brown (Reviewer #2).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>Human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) devotes a significant portion of its dsDNA genome to produce molecules that improve &quot;viral fitness,&quot; most often resulting in immune evasion. Here Fielding et al. focus on a region of the HCMV genome, termed US21 family (US12-US21). They took a comprehensive mass spectrometry approach to determine which molecules are affected by deleting these viral genes, using single and complete US21 family knockout viruses. The data strongly support the overall conclusion that these molecules affect NK cell activation against virus-infected cells. That the US21 family affects NKG2D ligands is not surprising but they also demonstrate nicely that US18 and US20 affect expression of B7-H6, that is induced upon viral infection with mutants lacking either one of these ORFs. Overall, the manuscript was favorably viewed but the reviewers felt that a number of issues need to be addressed.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>While the comments of the reviewers are attached and should be addressed, the reviewers request that the authors specifically address the following major points in a revision.</p><p>1) The regulation of B7-H6 by ectopic expression of US18 and/or US20. See reviewers #1 and #3.</p><p>2) Explicit demonstration that US20 effect on MIC-A is impacted by US21. This is mentioned as data not shown but the reviewers would like the authors to show the data. See reviewer #3.</p><p>3) The% infected cells should be included in each of the figure legends. See reviewer #3.</p><p>4) The statistical analysis of the experiments. See reviewer #2.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic> </p><p>It would be informative to express US18 and US20 individually or together by transfection and determine their effects on B7-H6 expression. This will help to confirm that the data with the individual ko viruses are not due to some other effect on the viral genome, such as an inadvertent deletion of an unrecognized ORF in the ko viruses.</p><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11">Figure 11</xref> shows upregulation of B7-H6 expression by control adenovirus infection, helping to make the case that viral infection induces B7-H6 expression. I don't believe this has been shown before, though there are some data indicating that B7-H6 is inducible (Blood 2013, 122:394). However, neither of these points was mentioned in the text which instead focused on the markedly higher levels of B7-H6 expression when the adenoviral vector contained B7-H6. It would be informative if the adenoviral vector contained US18, US20, or both to determine if B7-H6 expression is down-regulated only when both ORFs are ectopically expressed.</p><p>Finally, it would be of interest to determine if cells constitutively expressing high levels of B7-H6 are affected by US18/US20. If not, the ORFs may be affecting the mechanisms leading to viral induction of B7-H6, rather than B7-H6 itself.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic> </p><p>Strengths of the study include its innovative approach, in depth analysis of US12 related genes and their broad effect on host immune responses/proteomes, and follow up analyses of specific protein effects (e.g. B7H6). The work is technically excellent, with results effectively presented. The color scheme used to present data for comparison of various HCMV strains, and their effect on many different host molecules has transformed what would appear to be very complex data sets, into ones that are both manageable and elegant. Having implicated specific US12-targeted effects on host proteins, and that these molecules have evolved tag-team strategies to thwart NK cells, is highly interesting. Overall, the findings and conclusions are openly presented, and very compelling. They should generate considerable interest. Although effective strategies and cutoffs were implemented to focus on findings of high significance, there is some question and lingering concern about the use of statistical tests applied, or not, in some experiments.</p><p>Main concern:</p><p>Multiple comparisons performed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref> using a student's t test may be inappropriate. Also, it appears that statistical analyses were not performed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figures 4</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">7C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">8</xref>. Why?</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic> </p><p>Interestingly, and somewhat of concern, deletion of US21 impacted the expression of many other viral genes, including US20 whereas this was not observed when the entire region US12-21 was deleted. The authors argue that this is likely due to the fact that the impact on US20 by US21 no longer occurs when both are deleted, but this is not explicitly shown. I suggest these data are included upon revision.</p><p>Interestingly, they find that deletion of US12, US13 and US20 upregulates UL16 as well deletion of US12-21. Since UL16 prevents the intracellular transport of multiple NKG2D-ligands this result could imply that some of the observed changes in NK cell molecules could be an indirect consequence of US12 family members promoting the expression or stabilization of UL16 which in turn could decrease the lysosomal turnover of target proteins by retaining them in the ER. The possibility that the effects seen are indirect consequences of US12 proteins regulating other viral proteins should be acknowledged more explicitly in the text and it should be clearly stated that this is one of the caveats of the current study.</p><p>The authors next focus on one protein in particular, B7-H6, a ligand for the NK cell activating receptor NKp30 that is also found on γδT cells. Using adenoviral expression they demonstrate that B7-H6 activates NK cells. Furthermore, a B7-H6 dependent reporter cell line is activated by US18 and US20, as well as US12-21 deletions and this activation can be blocked by B7-H6 antibodies or siRNA. However, given the concerns above, it is quite possible that neither US18 or US20 directly impact B7-H6. This would be easy to test using the rAd-US18 and rAd-US20 previously described by the same group (Fielding 2014). Therefore, I suggest that an experiment is included that examines whether US18 and US20 affect B7-H6 expression directly upon ectopic expression.</p><p>For each experiment, the MHC-I downregulation results should be provided as supplemental data to demonstrate that a similar percentage of cells are infected when different mutants are compared.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.22206.023</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>Essential revisions:</italic> </p><p><italic>While the comments of the reviewers are attached and should be addressed, the reviewers request that the authors specifically address the following major points in a revision.</italic> </p><p><italic>1) The regulation of B7-H6 by ectopic expression of US18 and/or US20.

Reviewer #3 did not directly mention subsequent effects of US20 upregulation on MICA, but any effect cannot be directly analysed in HCMV-infected cells, as infection with the HCMV control virus leads to complete down- regulation of MICA (The MICA signal is effectively zero in HCMV-infected cells).</p><p><italic>3) The% infected cells should be included in each of the figure legends.

This was stated in the text as follows: ‘Viruses were generated by DNA transfection and the complete genomic sequence of the virus stocks was validated by deep sequencing (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>).’ There were no changes found in the genome of the US18 and US20 deletion mutants, except for the targeted gene deletions.</p><p>The viral transcriptome of the HCMV Merlin strain has been analyzed by a number of groups (Gatherer et al., PNAS 108:19755 2011; Stern-Ginossar et al., Science338:1088 2013).</p><p>Ribosomal profiling identified a number of novel ORFs (Stern-Ginossar et al., 2013). Deletion of the US20 ORF is not predicted to affect any other identified ORFs and deletion of the US18 ORF would be predicted to delete only one single novel ORF (ORFS346CiORF1). This utilises an alternative ATG in the same reading frame as US18 encoding a protein corresponding to the C-terminal 37 amino acids of US18. We know of no evidence for other novel ORFs encoding proteins that might be affected by deletion of US20 or US18.</p><p>We have also performed experiments expressing US18 and US20 individually and together using adenovirus expression vectors, which indicate these proteins are capable of down- regulating B7-H6 levels when expressed on their own outside of the context of HCMV (see response to reviewer #1 point 3 and reviewer #3 point 3).</p><p><italic><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11">Figure 11</xref> shows upregulation of B7-H6 expression by control adenovirus infection, helping to make the case that viral infection induces B7-H6 expression.

We have altered a line in the Results section to ‘B7-H6 is therefore induced as a ‘stress ligand’ (subsection “B7-H6 is an NK cell activating ligand targeted by US18 and US20”, first paragraph) and added a comment regarding the induction of B7-H6 to the Discussion, ‘…Previously, its expression was shown to be induced by inflammatory stimuli, for example pro-inflammatory cytokines and bacterial-derived toll-like receptor (TLR) ligands (Matta et al., 2013).

The new analysis did alter the statistical significance of some of the changes in NK degranulation observed. We have incorporated results of the statistical analysis into the figure legend of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> and the text as follows. ‘Significantly increased levels of NK activation were detected in assays using deletion mutants of 5 different US12 family members: US12 (3 of 4 donors), US14 (1 of 4 donors, with a trend towards increased NK activation in the other 3 donors), US18 (3 of 4 donors), US20 (4 of 4 donors), US21 (4 of 4 donors) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>), while three US12 family deletion mutants (US15, US16, US19) reduced the level of NK cell activation in some donors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>).’</p><p>Estimated p values based on Benjamini-Hochberg corrected Significance B values (Cox &amp; Mann, 2008) have been added to current <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>, current <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>, newly added <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>, current <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8C</xref> (previous <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref>) and current <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref> (previous <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>).

We do not agree that the US12 family members promote expression/stabilize UL16, since the levels of UL16 actually increase (rather than decrease) during infection with the specific US12 deletion mutants (current <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>). These data support a role for the US12 family in promoting lysosomal degradation of UL16. We recently reported a similar co-operation between US2 and UL141 (Hsu et al., 2015 PLoS Pathogens11(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">4</xref>):e1004811) where UL141 retains CD155 in the ER and selectively feeds CD112 to US2 for proteasomal degradation.</p><p>The alterations in levels of UL16 imply that several members of the US12 family are targeting UL16 for lysosomal degradation, together with any UL16-bound ligands. These data also support the idea that the US12 family works through co-operation not only with each other, but potentially with other HCMV proteins. We have inserted the following text into the Discussion, ‘They also imply that some of the effects of the US12 family could be the result of co-operation with other HCMV genes. There is some precedent for this situation as co-operation between US2 and UL141 was observed in the proteasomal degradation of some protein targets e.g. CD112 (Hsu et al., 2015).’</p><p><italic>The authors next focus on one protein in particular, B7-H6, a ligand for the NK cell activating receptor NKp30 that is also found on γδT cells.
