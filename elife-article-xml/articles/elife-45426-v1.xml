xlink:href="https://osf.io/e81xl/wiki/home/">Reproducibility Project: Cancer Biology</ext-link> we published a Registered Report (Evans et al., 2015), that described how we intended to replicate selected experiments from the paper ‘Wnt activity defines colon cancer stem cells and is regulated by the microenvironment’ (Vermeulen et al., 2010). Here, we report the results. Using three independent primary spheroidal colon cancer cultures that expressed a Wnt reporter construct we observed high Wnt activity was associated with the cell surface markers CD133, CD166, and CD29, but not CD24 and CD44, while the original study found all five markers were correlated with high Wnt activity (Figure 2F; Vermeulen et al., 2010). Clonogenicity was highest in cells with high Wnt activity and clonogenic potential of cells with low Wnt activity were increased by myofibroblast-secreted factors, including HGF. While the effects were in the same direction as the original study (Figure 6D; Vermeulen et al., 2010) whether statistical significance was reached among the different conditions varied. When tested <italic>in vivo</italic>, we did not find a difference in tumorigenicity between high and low Wnt activity, while the original study found cells with high Wnt activity were more effective in inducing tumors (Figure 7E; Vermeulen et al., 2010). Tumorigenicity, however, was increased with myofibroblast-secreted factors, which was in the same direction as the original study (Figure 7E; Vermeulen et al., 2010), but not statistically significant. Finally, we report meta-analyses for each results where possible.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>Reproducibility Project: Cancer Biology</kwd><kwd>reproducibility</kwd><kwd>replication</kwd><kwd>metascience</kwd><kwd>cancer stem cell</kwd><kwd>Wnt signaling pathway</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><funding-statement>The Reproducibility Project: Cancer Biology is funded by the Laura and John Arnold Foundation, provided to the Center for Open Science in collaboration with Science Exchange.

For each of these papers, a Registered Report detailing the proposed experimental designs and protocols for the replications was peer reviewed and published prior to data collection. The present paper is a Replication Study that reports the results of the replication experiments detailed in the Registered Report (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Evans et al., 2015</xref>) for a paper by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Vermeulen et al. (2010)</xref> and uses a number of approaches to compare the outcomes of the original experiments and the replications.</p><p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Vermeulen et al. (2010)</xref> reported that colon cancer cell subpopulations with high Wnt activity correlated with markers of cancer stems cells (CSC) and displayed enhanced tumor initiating potential. Moreover, factors secreted from cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs), which are an important component of the stroma, such as HGF, were reported to play a role in the formation of the CSC niche and tumorigenicity by activating the Wnt signaling pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Vermeulen et al., 2010</xref>). This was demonstrated using <italic>in vitro</italic> clonogenicity and <italic>in vivo</italic> tumorigenicity assays, suggesting Wnt activity defines CSCs and is regulated by the microenvironment.</p><p>The Registered Report for the paper by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Vermeulen et al. (2010)</xref> described the experiments to be replicated (Figures 2F, 6D and 7E), and summarized the current evidence for these findings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Evans et al., 2015</xref>). Since that publication additional studies have reported a relationship between Wnt activity, using a Wnt reporter like <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Vermeulen et al. (2010)</xref>, and CSC properties in various malignancies, including colorectal, lung, gastric, and breast cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Jun et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Su et al., 2015</xref>). Moreover, recent studies have also reported CSC properties from cells with high expression of Wnt target genes, such as <italic>LGR5</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Dame et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Junttila et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Shimokawa et al., 2017</xref>). Furthermore, recent studies have continued to examine the role of the microenvironment and cancer stemness. Niche factor requirements in colorectal tumors were found to decrease during tumorigenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Fujii et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Kashfi et al., 2018</xref>). While a new modeling approach suggested stem cell functionality during colorectal tumor expansion was defined by secreted factors from CAFs rather than cell-intrinsic properties (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Flanagan et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Lenos et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Vermeulen et al. (2010)</xref> also reported CD133, the combination of CD29/CD24, and the combination of CD44/CD166 were correlated with high Wnt activity. CD133 has been suggested to mark CSCs in various tumor types, although the accuracy as a CSC biomarker has been highly controversial (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Glumac and LeBeau, 2018</xref>). In colorectal cancer, variation in clonogenic potential with specific cell populations have been reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">LaBarge and Bissell, 2008</xref>), with CD133<sup>+</sup> cells reported to be associated with the CSC population in two separate studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">O'Brien et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Ricci-Vitiani et al., 2007</xref>), while <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Shmelkov et al. (2008)</xref> reported both CD133<sup>+</sup> and CD133<sup>-</sup> populations were capable of forming colonospheres <italic>in vitro</italic> and were serially tumorigenic in mice. Variation has also been reported in independent studies that examined CD133 expression to define a clonogenic subfraction when examining the same cell line, HCT116 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Chen et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Dittfeld et al., 2009</xref>). As such, other studies have reported other markers, such as CD44 and CD166, to be more robust in identifying colorectal CSCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Dalerba et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Ozawa et al., 2014</xref>). There is also variation of the significance of CD24 expression in colorectal cancer, while the significance of CD29 needs further investigation, although the presence of these molecules have been associated with CSC characteristics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Hatano et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Izumi et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Muraro et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>The outcome measures reported in this Replication Study will be aggregated with those from the other Replication Studies to create a dataset that will be examined to provide evidence about reproducibility of cancer biology research, and to identify factors that influence reproducibility more generally.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results|discussion"><title>Results and discussion</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Generation and characterization of primary spheroidal cultures of colon cancer cells</title><p>To assess Wnt signaling activity in colon cancer stem cells (CSC), we transduced primary spheroidal cultures of colon cancer cells with the same Wnt reporter construct as the original study, which used a TCF/LEF-1 responsive promoter to drive expression of green fluorescent protein (GFP) (TOP-GFP; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Reya et al., 2003</xref>). The experimental approach to generate TOP-GFP expressing CSC cultures was described in Protocol 1 of the Registered Report (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Evans et al., 2015</xref>). We used three independent spheroidal cultures, one used in the original study (Co100) and two derived from primary human colorectal cancer tissues (CSC1 and E450). The three cultures were transduced with TOP-GFP and single-cell TOP-GFP cultures were isolated. This approach, similar to the original study, was done to exclude variation in lentiviral integration and copy number between cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Vermeulen et al., 2008</xref>).

This experiment is similar to what was reported in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref> of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Vermeulen et al. (2010)</xref> and described in Protocol 2 in the Registered Report (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Evans et al., 2015</xref>). We found the TOP-GFP<sup>high</sup> populations were more enriched for CD133<sup>+</sup> or CD166<sup>+</sup> cells compared to the TOP-GFP<sup>low</sup> populations for each of the three cultures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C,D</xref>). There were also more CD29<sup>+</sup> cells in the TOP-GFP<sup>high</sup> populations for each of the three cultures, while the two TOP-GFP populations were mostly similar for CD24 expression. We also found the TOP-GFP<sup>low</sup> populations from E450 and CSC1 cultures were more enriched for CD44<sup>+</sup> cells, while both the populations displayed similar expression for Co100. The original study stated that CD133, the combination of CD29/CD24, and the combination of CD44/CD166 were correlated with the TOP-GFP<sup>high</sup> population (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Vermeulen et al., 2010</xref>). However, since the degree that each of the markers correlated with the TOP-GFP<sup>high</sup> and TOP-GFP<sup>low</sup> populations were not completely reported in the original study, it is difficult to directly compare to the results reported in this replication attempt. To summarize, for this experiment we found results that varied in direction relative to the original study.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Clonogenicity of TOP-GFP CSC cultures</title><p>The three TOP-GFP cultures were then used to assess the clonogenic potential of the cells using a limiting-dilution assay. Different TOP-GFP expressing fractions were examined to test if variation in TOP-GFP levels resulted in differential clonogenicity. Additionally, TOP-GFP<sup>low</sup> fractions were treated with conditioned medium derived from myofibroblasts (MFCM) or hepatocyte growth factor (HGF), with and without a specific c-Met inhibitor (PHA665752), to test if myofibroblast-secreted factors increased the clonogenic potential. This experiment is similar to what was reported in Figure 6D of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Vermeulen et al. (2010)</xref> and described in Protocol 3 in the Registered Report (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Evans et al., 2015</xref>). We first performed a pilot assay of the dilution curve in untreated conditions and observed the clonogenic potential in the TOP-GFP<sup>high</sup> fractions were greater than the TOP-GFP<sup>low</sup> fractions for each of the cultures tested (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). We then proceeded with the experiment to test all of the conditions specified in the Registered Report and reported in the original study. Similar to the pilot assay, we found the clonogenic potential of TOP-GFP<sup>high</sup> cells were greater than TOP-GFP<sup>low</sup> cells for each of the three cultures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). We also observed that the clonogenicity of TOP-GFP<sup>low</sup> cells were increased in the presence of MCFM or HGF, which was reduced when PHA665752 was included, although to varying degrees across the different cultures. Interestingly, PHA665752 treatment on the whole population of TOP-GFP cells (TOP-GFP<sup>whole</sup>) had varying effects on the clonogenicity among the different cultures tested. Both the Co100 and E450 cultures had decreased clonogenicity in the presence of PHA665752, while CSC1 cultures were increased. The original study reported the clonogenic potential of the TOP-GFP<sup>high</sup> fraction was greater compared to TOP-GFP<sup>low</sup> cells, with the clonogenic potential of TOP-GFP<sup>low</sup> cells enhanced with MFCM, or HGF, treatment, almost to the level of TOP-GFP<sup>high</sup> cells, which was blocked with PHA665752 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Vermeulen et al., 2010</xref>). PHA665752 was also reported to have no effect on the clonogenicity of TOP-GFP<sup>whole</sup> cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Vermeulen et al., 2010</xref>). The HGF and PHA665752 concentrations were the same between the original study and this replication attempt (25 ng/ml and 500 nM, respectively) as was the MFCM treatment that used a 1:2 dilution of MFCM diluted in CSC medium. As suggested during peer review of the Registered Report (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Gilbertson, 2015</xref>), we also determined the concentration of HGF in MFCM, which was determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) to be 0.61 ng/ml. The original study reported HGF production in MFCM was ~120 ng/ml (Figure 5E; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Vermeulen et al., 2010</xref>) or approximately 200 times higher than what we observed. Other studies that measured the amount of HGF in MFCM using the same cell line (18Co) and timeline (24 hr) reported concentrations of ~0.4 ng/ml (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Shao et al., 2006</xref>) and ~6 ng/ml (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Woo et al., 2015</xref>). The variation of HGF production might be explained by differences in assay reagents, such as the generation of the standard curve (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Jones et al., 1995</xref>) and variability in microplate surface properties (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Lilyanna et al., 2018</xref>). Further, HGF production has been shown to be influenced by other soluble factors, such as transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) and basic fibroblast growth factor (FGF2) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Neuss et al., 2004</xref>). The variation in HGF production in MFCM between the original study and this replication attempt might account for any observed differences in outcomes and should be taken into account when interpreting these results. Importantly, though, observing and reporting all outcomes are informative to establish the range of conditions under which a given phenotype can be observed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Bailoo et al., 2014</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.45426.004</object-id><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Clonogenicity assay of TOP-GFP cultures.</title><p>A limiting-dilution assay was performed on the TOP-GFP<sup>low</sup>, TOP-GFP<sup>high</sup>, or TOP-GFP<sup>whole</sup> populations of the three indicated TOP-GFP cultures.

The comparison of HGF treatment, with or without PHA665752, in TOP-GFP<sup>low</sup> cells was statistically significant for the CSC1 culture, but not the Co100 or E450 cultures, while the comparison of MFCM treatment, with or without PHA665752, in TOP-GFP<sup>low</sup> cells was statistically significant for all three cultures. Furthermore, the differences observed in TOP-GFP<sup>whole</sup> cells with or without PHA665752 were statistically significant for all three cultures.

While the original study included TOP-GFP<sup>low</sup> cells co-injected with myofibroblasts and TOP-GFP<sup>whole</sup> cells, this replication attempt was restricted to TOP-GFP<sup>high</sup>, TOP-GFP<sup>low</sup>, and TOP-GFP<sup>low</sup> cells co-injected with MFCM. The original study also reported results from two clones, while this replication attempt utilized a single clone. As stated in the Registered Report, we identified the clone to use as the one with the largest observed difference in clonogenicity between untreated TOP-GFP<sup>high</sup> and TOP-GFP<sup>low</sup> cells, which, as described above, was the E450 culture. Different cell numbers were injected into female nude mice and blindly analyzed for tumor formation after nine weeks. We found the frequency of tumorigenicity was similar when TOP-GFP<sup>high</sup> cells (1 in every 3332, 95% CI [9174, 1210]) or TOP-GFP<sup>low</sup> cells (1 in every 2744, 95% CI [7377, 1020]) were injected (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>), which was not a statistically significant difference (<italic>χ</italic><sup>2</sup> = 0.084, uncorrected <italic>p</italic>=0.772, corrected <italic>p</italic>&gt;0.99).

Any known differences, including reagents and protocol differences, were identified prior to conducting the experimental work and described in the Registered Report (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Evans et al., 2015</xref>). However, this is limited to what was obtainable from the original paper and through communication with the original authors, which means there might be particular features of the original experimental protocol that could be critical, but unidentified. So while some aspects, such as the TOP-GFP reporter plasmid, cell surface markers, treatment conditions of cultures, Co100 culture, and mouse strain were maintained, others were unknown or not easily controlled for. These include variables such as cell line genetic drift (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Hughes et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kleensang et al., 2016</xref>), genetic heterogeneity of mouse inbred strains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Casellas, 2011</xref>), the microbiome of recipient mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Macpherson and McCoy, 2015</xref>), housing temperature in mouse facilities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kokolus et al., 2013</xref>), lot variability of key reagents such as HGF and PHA-665752 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Leek et al., 2010</xref>), and similarities and differences in patient characteristics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Klevorn and Teague, 2016</xref>). Environmental differences such as husbandry staff, bedding type and source, light levels, and other intangibles, all of which, by necessity, differed between the studies also affect experimental outcomes with mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Howard, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Jensen and Ritskes-Hoitinga, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Nevalainen, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Sorge et al., 2014</xref>). The difference in HGF production in conditioned medium between the original study and this replication attempt, as described above, is another factor to consider. Also, differences in CSC features between the cultures used in this replication attempt, as well as the original study, is another important factor to consider. This includes the expression of the cell surface markers between the TOP-GFP<sup>low</sup> and TOP-GFP<sup>high</sup> populations, particularly CD24 and CD44, which have been reported as Wnt target genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Shulewitz et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Wielenga et al., 1999</xref>). This could be due to differences in lentiviral integration and copy number of the TOP-GFP reporter, clonal artifacts, and genetic differences between the cancer cells the cultures were derived from as well as genetic drift during passaging of the cultures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Ben-David et al., 2018</xref>). Whether these or other factors influence the outcomes of this study is open to hypothesizing and further investigation, which is facilitated by direct replications and transparent reporting.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th valign="top">Reagent type <break/>(species) or resource</th><th valign="top">Designation</th><th valign="top">Source or reference</th><th valign="top">Identifiers</th><th valign="top">Additional <break/>information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Cell line (<italic>Homo sapiens</italic>)</td><td>Co100</td><td>doi:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1038/ncb2048">10.1038/</ext-link><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1038/ncb2048">ncb2048</ext-link></td><td valign="bottom"/><td>shared by <break/>Medema lab, University of <break/>Amsterdam</td></tr><tr><td>Cell line (<italic>H. sapiens</italic>, female)</td><td>CSC1</td><td>ProMab Biotechnologies</td><td>cat# CC100103</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Cell line (<italic>H. sapiens</italic>, female)</td><td>E450</td><td>this paper</td><td/><td/></tr><tr><td>Cell line (<italic>H. sapiens</italic>, female)</td><td>18Co</td><td>ATCC</td><td>cat# CRL-1459;

interests of transparency, eLife includes the editorial decision letter and accompanying author responses. A lightly edited version of the letter sent to the authors after peer review is shown, indicating the most substantive concerns; minor comments are not usually included.</p></boxed-text><p>Thank you for submitting your work entitled &quot;Replication Study: Wnt activity defines colon cancer stem cells and is regulated by the microenvironment&quot; for consideration at <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been evaluated by Sean Morrison as the Senior Editor, a Reviewing Editor, and three reviewers.</p><p>There are a few issues identified by the reviewers that need to be addressed before acceptance, as outlined below:</p><p>1) Address the concerns raised by reviewer 1 regarding the limiting dilution data as well as provide the primary data for these experiments. In addition, specify the type of Matrigel used in the in vivo experiments given the divergence in results between the two studies.</p><p>2) As indicated by reviewer 2, comment on any possible discrepancy between HGF production in conditioned medium from the original study to this replication study that may account for variation in results. Also, comment on subsequent work that has linked WNT signatures to clonogenicity/stemness and if any have validated these particular markers in CRC cells.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic> </p><p>The current Replication Study indicates that the original observations can be reproduced to a large extent. Several key features show clear differences from the original study. These include clonogenic efficacy, expression of specific markers and in vivo tumorigenicity. Below a point by point assessment of this differences is given as well as several other details.</p><p>1) In the Registered Report it was noted that multiple subclones would be tested. It is unclear why the authors decided to divert from this original plan and only test one clone. This should be explained, but maybe more important, be revised.</p><p>2) The in vivo tumorigenicity is the main feature that is different from the Original study. In the report it is not noted what Matrigel was used to inject the tumor cells. If this is not growth factor reduced the data can be explained quite easily. This information should be given.</p><p>3) CD24 and in particular CD44, are well-established Wnt target genes and reporters (e.g. Wielenga et al., 1999). The current authors report that Wnt-low cells display lower CD44 and CD24 levels in some lines. This warrants further discussion.</p><p>4) Widespread variation in clonogenic potential with specific cell populations has been reported beyond Wnt activity levels.

(Vermeulen et al., 2010). The replication study focused on cell surface markers of presumptive Wnt pathway-high cancer stem cells, the clonogenicity in vitro of presumptive Wnt pathway-high cancer stem cells vs. Wnt pathway-low cells and how cancer-associated myofibroblast-associated secreted factors might influence clonogenicity; and the tumorigenic growth potential of Wnt pathway-high cells and how tumor-associated myofibroblast-secreted factors might impact on tumorigenic potential.</p><p>The replication study was able to show that only three of the five cell surface markers previously linked to Wnt pathway-high transcriptional activity status in three spheroid cancer cell line models could be confirmed. The authors confirmed that in vitro clonogenicity was highest in cells with Wnt pathway-high status and that clonogenic potential of cells low Wnt pathway activity was increased by myofibroblast-secreted factors, such as HGF. Some of the findings on clonogenicity were of less certain statistical significance. The authors did not find a difference in tumorigenicity between the cells with Wnt pathway-high vs. Wnt pathway-low transcriptional status, though tumorigenicity was increased with myofibroblast-secreted factors, but not in a statistically significant manner.</p><p>The replication work is solidly performed and presented and interpreted in a reasonable manner.</p><p>No major comments are offered.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.45426.017</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1) Address the concerns raised by reviewer 1 regarding the limiting dilution data as well as provide the primary data for these experiments.
