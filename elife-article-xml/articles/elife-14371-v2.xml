RNA-binding proteins NOVA1 and NOVA2 are highly homologous alternative splicing regulators. NOVA proteins regulate at least 700 alternative splicing events in vivo, yet relatively little is known about the biologic consequences of NOVA action and in particular about functional differences between NOVA1 and NOVA2. Transcriptome-wide searches for isoform-specific functions, using NOVA1 and NOVA2 specific HITS-CLIP and RNA-seq data from mouse cortex lacking either NOVA isoform, reveals that NOVA2 uniquely regulates alternative splicing events of a series of axon guidance related genes during cortical development. Corresponding axonal pathfinding defects were specific to NOVA2 deficiency: <italic>Nova2-/-</italic> but not <italic>Nova1-/-</italic> mice had agenesis of the corpus callosum, and axonal outgrowth defects specific to ventral motoneuron axons and efferent innervation of the cochlea. Thus we have discovered that NOVA2 uniquely regulates alternative splicing of a coordinate set of transcripts encoding key components in cortical, brainstem and spinal axon guidance/outgrowth pathways during neural differentiation, with severe functional consequences in vivo.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.14371.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.14371.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.14371.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>The first step of producing a protein involves the DNA of a gene being copied to form a molecule of RNA. This RNA molecule can often be processed to create several different “messenger” RNAs (mRNAs), each of which are used to produce a different protein by a process known as alternative splicing. A class of proteins that bind to RNA molecules controls alternative splicing. These “splicing factors” ensure that the right protein variant is produced at the right time and in the right place to carry out the appropriate activity.</p><p>Many genes that play important roles in the nervous system have been reported to undergo alternative splicing to generate different protein variants. However, it is unclear whether alternative splicing is important for controlling how the nervous system develops, during which time the neurons connect to the cells that they will communicate with. Forming these connections involves part of the neuron, called the axon, growing along a precise path through the nervous system to reach its destination.</p><p>Two RNA-binding proteins called NOVA1 and NOVA2 are produced exclusively in the central nervous system, where they regulate a number of actions including alternative splicing. So far, no differences in the roles of NOVA1 and NOVA2 have been identified, and relatively little is known about their actions in the brain.</p><p>Saito et al. have addressed these missing puzzle pieces by combining RNA analysis methods with an analysis of the structure of the nervous system of mice that lack either NOVA1 or NOVA2. This approach identified where NOVA1 and NOVA2 bind on mRNAs, and showed that the mRNAs are processed in different ways in the developing mouse brain depending on which form of the NOVA protein is bound to it.</p><p>Further analysis of the data revealed that NOVA2, and not NOVA1, regulates splicing in a series of RNA molecules that help to guide axons to the correct locations in the developing mouse brain. A related study by Leggere et al. also reported on the role that NOVA proteins play in the alternative splicing of one of these genes, called <italic>Dcc</italic>.</p><p>Saito et al. also found defects in the nervous systems of the mice that lacked NOVA2 that only occurred in these mice and resulted from certain axons being unable to follow the correct path to their target cells. These led to major defects, such as agenesis of the corpus callosum (a complete lack of connection between the right and left sides of the brain). Further defects affected how specific subsets of motor neurons connect to muscles and how cochlear neurons in the brainstem connect to the inner ear. The next steps are to explore how the processing of RNA molecules by NOVA2 causes these defects, and to assess whether these actions relate to developmental brain disorders in humans.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.14371.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.14371.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group

central nervous system (CNS) development, a neuron extends its axon through a complex yet precise path to reach its final destination by sensing extracellular signals called guidance cues. These cues are sensed by the growth cone, a motile structure at the extending axon edge, and they control growth cone motility through directed cytoskeletal remodeling. Netrins, slits, semaphorins, and ephrins are the major classic guidance cues and elicit attractive or repulsive responses in growth cones via specific receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Brose et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Cheng et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Drescher et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Fan and Raper, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Kapfhammer and Raper, 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Kennedy et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Kidd et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Serafini et al., 1994</xref>). An important aspect of axon guidance is the spatial and temporal control of response to the guidance cues. For example, the spinal cord commissural axon reaching the midline senses netrin-1, secreted from the floorplate as a chemoattractive cue; however, once it has crossed the floorplate, this cue becomes repulsive (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Kennedy et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Kidd et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Tessier-Lavigne et al., 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Zou et al., 2000</xref>). Furthermore, the spatiotemporally restricted expression of Robo3 alternative splicing isoforms in spinal cord commissure axons are essential for the switching of the growth cone response to the axon guidance cues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chen et al., 2008</xref>), indicating that spatiotemporally regulated protein isoform expression and diversity is crucial to establish proper neuronal networks.</p><p>Alternative splicing and alternative polyadenylation can produce multiple messenger RNAs (mRNAs) possessing distinct coding and regulatory sequences from a single gene. The regulated processes that generate such mRNA diversity are orchestrated by RNA-binding proteins (RBPs). In the nervous system, alternative splicing has many important roles, including controlling the spatial and temporal expression of protein isoforms that are necessary for neurodevelopment and the modification of synaptic plasticity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Li et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Licatalosi et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Ule and Darnell, 2006</xref>). Significantly, human genetic studies have indicated that RNA misregulation resulting from defects in RBP expression and function are linked to numerous diseases, including Fragile X syndrome, spinal muscular atrophy, spinocerebellar ataxias, motoneuron disease and others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Cooper et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Darnell, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Lukong et al., 2008</xref>).</p><p>NOVA1 and NOVA2, RBPs initially identified as targets in autoimmune motor neuron disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Buckanovich et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Darnell and Posner, 2003</xref>), are RNA-binding splicing regulators specifically expressed in neurons in the CNS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Buckanovich et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Yang et al., 1998</xref>). NOVA1 and NOVA2 harbor three KH-type RNA binding domains, and in vitro RNA selection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Buckanovich and Darnell, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Jensen et al., 2000b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Yang et al., 1998</xref>) and X-ray crystallography (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Lewis et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Teplova et al., 2011</xref>) demonstrate that NOVA1 and NOVA2 bind directly to RNA sequences harboring YCAY motifs. The development of RNA:RBP crosslinking and immunoprecipitation (CLIP) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Ule et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">2005a</xref>) followed by high-throughput sequencing (HITS-CLIP) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Licatalosi et al., 2008</xref>) methods has enabled identification of genome-wide RBP:RNA interaction maps in vivo. The bioinformatic integration of HITS-CLIP binding data and functional outcome revealed by exon junction microarray and RNA-seq data sets led to the conclusion that NOVA regulates alternative splicing following the rule that the position of NOVA binding to pre-mRNA predicts its action to enhance or inhibit alternate exon inclusion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Licatalosi et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Ule et al., 2005b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Wu et al., 2013</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Zhang et al., 2010</xref>). These analyses revealed ~700 NOVA1/NOVA2 target alternate exons and allowed to predict the biological process regulated by NOVA1/NOVA2. However, these studies have found no biochemical actions that were unique to NOVA1 versus NOVA2 paralogues, reflecting their nearly identical KH-type RNA binding domains.</p><p>In the present work, we find that NOVA2 uniquely regulates a series of alternative splicing events of axon guidance related genes, including deleted in colorectal carcinoma (<italic>Dcc</italic>), Roundabout, Axon Guidance Receptor, Homolog 2 (<italic>Robo2</italic>), Slit homolog 2 (<italic>Slit2</italic>), and EPH Receptor A5 (<italic>Epha5</italic>). These findings derived from combining transcriptome-wide NOVA1 and NOVA2 specific HITS-CLIP with RNA-seq analysis in the cortex of mice lacking either <italic>Nova1</italic> or <italic>Nova2. Nova2</italic> deficiency results in some common phenotypes, such as severe growth retardation, as previously reported in <italic>Nova1-/-</italic> mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Jensen et al., 2000a</xref>), as well as unique phenotypes, including agenesis of the corpus callosum (ACC) in <italic>Nova2-/-</italic> mice. Unexpectedly, given that motoneurons express both NOVA1 and NOVA2, a subset of motoneuron axons directed to the ventral diaphragm show outgrowth defects in <italic>Nova2-/-</italic> but not <italic>Nova1-/-</italic> mice.

NOVA1 and NOVA2 CLIP reads were filtered and aligned to the mouse genome (mm9). A total of 2,318,553 unique NOVA2 CLIP tags were obtained from three biological replicates (483,446, 836,678, and 998,429 unique tags, respectively), with a total of 139,007 clusters from at least two or three biologic replicates (defined as biological complexity of two (BC2)). A total of 910,342 unique NOVA1 CLIP tags were obtained from three biological replicates (319,904, 292,709, and 297,729 unique tags, respectively), with a total of 54,546 clusters (BC2). To identify sequence features most commonly associated with either NOVA1-RNA or NOVA2-RNA interactions, 4 nucleotide (nt) long motifs were counted in BC2 NOVA1 and NOVA2 clusters and in a set of shuffled control sequences as a control. Each of the top five ranking tetramers in NOVA1 and NOVA2 clusters were the same (UCAU, CAUC, CAUU, UCAC, and UUCA) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>) and coincided with the previously identified YCAY NOVA binding motif. Enrichment of the YCAY motif around NOVA1 and NOVA2 clusters was comparable between NOVA1 and NOVA2 and greatly enriched within NOVA1 and NOVA2 CLIP clusters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>), suggesting that NOVA1 and NOVA2 recognized the same YCAY RNA sequence.

Given identical binding characteristics in shared transcripts (e.g. <italic>Agrin</italic>, others in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>), we infer the following: 1) specificity is determined primarily by biochemical interactions: kD of NOVA KH domains binding to accessible YCAY motifs; this might include differential levels of NOVA1/NOVA2 expression within a cell; 2) differential binding is a function of differences in cell expression and/or differences in cell biology (e.g. subcellular distribution of NOVA1 and NOVA2). Evidence for differences in cell expression is clear in the cortex. Differences in actions within cells such as motoneurons that express both NOVA1 and NOVA2 isoforms could arise from different levels of NOVA1 and NOVA2 within the neurons, or due to differential localization of NOVA1 and NOVA2 within the motoneuron, as suggested by the differences in CLIP binding (intron versus 3’ UTR) of the two proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>). The development of single cell-type CLIP would be able to address this issue. Prior genomic and biochemical studies have found no actions that were unique to either NOVA1 or NOVA2 paralogues. The present study identifies NOVA2 as playing a unique role in axonal pathfinding in embryonic development by combining histological analysis with genome wide NOVA1 and NOVA2 specific HITS-CLIP and RNA-seq analysis in <italic>Nova1-/-</italic> and <italic>Nova2-/-</italic> mice. These data build upon previously identified roles for NOVA1 and NOVA2 in early development as modifiers of neuronal migration in late-generated cortical neurons and Purkinje neurons through control of splicing of <italic>Dab1</italic> exon 7b/7c (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Yano et al., 2010</xref>), for <italic>Nova1/Nova2</italic> as essential factors for AChR clustering at the NMJ through the regulation of <italic>Agrin</italic> Z exons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Ruggiu et al., 2009</xref>), and for <italic>Nova2</italic> in the induction of long term potentiation of slow inhibitory, but not excitatory, post synaptic potential currents after coincidence detection in CA1 hippocampal neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Huang et al., 2005</xref>).

The expression of DCC-long (long isoform of exon 17) isoform in cingulate cortex at E14.5 was not sufficient to form the commissure corpus callosum, indicating that the DCC-long isoform was not sufficient to rescue the ACC phenotype, and suggesting the possibility that the ACC phenotype in <italic>Nova2</italic>-/- mice either does not involve the DCC-long isoform or is caused by the dysregulation of multiple transcriptomes.</p><p>We found that in the cortex, NOVA2 regulates alternative splicing events of two netrin receptors: <italic>Dcc</italic> exon 17 and <italic>Neo1</italic> exon 27 in developmentally regulated manner (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). In the spinal cord, <italic>Dcc</italic> exon 17 is regulated by NOVA1/2 and required for the spinal commissural neuron development (see accompanying paper by Leggere et al.). Recent structure analysis of netrin-1/NEO1 and netrin-1/DCC-short (short isoform of exon 17) revealed that netrin-1/NEO1 form a 2:2 heterotetrameric netrin-1/NEO1 complex and netrin-1/DCC-short have a continuous netrin-1/DCC assembly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Xu et al., 2014</xref>). Netrin-1 recognizes the fourth and fifth fibronectin type III domains (termed FN4 and FN5, respectively) of both NEO1 and DCC. Interestingly, the NOVA2-regulated <italic>Dcc</italic> exon 17 is located in the linker region between the FN4 and FN5 domains, and this splicing switch from DCC-short to DCC-long isoform is enough to support the architectural switch of netrin-1/DCC complex from the continuous assembly to the 2:2 assembly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Xu et al., 2014</xref>). This suggests that NOVA2-dependent splicing regulation results in architecturally distinct netrin-1/DCC complexes that elicit distinct downstream signaling. Changes in NOVA2-dependent regulation of <italic>Dcc</italic> exon 17 splicing during development (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>) further indicate that NOVA2-regulated splicing controls the ability of cortical and spinal neurons to utilize distinct netrin-1/DCC assemblies to respond to a variety of cellular demands.</p><p>NEO1, another member of the <italic>Dcc</italic> family, shares ~50% amino acid identity with DCC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Vielmetter et al., 1994</xref>) and has four known alternative splicing sites. The NEO1 extracellular region is a receptor for repulsive guidance molecule (RGM) family molecules in addition to netrins. Upon ligand binding to the extracellular domain of NEO1 and DCC, their intracellular domains can activate multiple downstream signal transduction pathways, that modulate chemotropic axon guidance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Bradford et al., 2009</xref>). The inclusion of <italic>Neo1</italic> exon 27 inserts a 53 amino acid sequence into the intracellular region. Inclusion is increased in E18.5 <italic>Nova2-/-</italic> cortex, suggesting that NOVA2-dependent alternative splicing of <italic>Neo1</italic> exon 27 regulates downstream signal transduction. It is well-established that DCC receptors mediate chemo-attraction upon netrin-1 binding, while the UNC5 receptor alone or heterodimerized with DCC elicits chemo-repulsive activity in neuronal tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Hong et al., 1999</xref>). Interestingly, UNC5B interacts with NEO1 as a co-receptor for RGMa and associates with leukemia-associated guanine nucleotide exchange factor (LARG, also termed as ARHGEF12) to mediate the signal transduction leading to growth cone collapse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Hata et al., 2009</xref>).

This specificity is similar to the observation that dorsal motoneuron innervation of the diaphragm is normal while ventral innervation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>) is affected in the <italic>Nova2-/-</italic> mouse, suggesting a more general ventral specialization of axonal guidance regulation by NOVA2.

Nevertheless the reduction in efferent innervation is comparatively more severe in the base of the cochlea (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">10A–H</xref>) suggesting that OHCs sensitive to low frequency sounds are more dependent on <italic>Nova2</italic> controlled efferent innervation.

Preliminary testing in <italic>Nova2-/-</italic> mice showed that this inhibitory function was not affected (Stéphane S Maison, personal communication), suggesting that the residual efferent innervation was able to sustain the function of further reducing the DPOAEs.</p><p>Only an indirect mouse model of efferent innervation defect has been available to date: a mutation in the α9α10 hair cell nicotinic receptor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Taranda et al., 2009</xref>) in which the DPOAEs threshold levels are reduced by approximately 7–14 dB SPL (a reduction in 10 dB SPL is perceived approximately as half the intensity). In addition, the reduction in DPOAEs found in the <italic>Nova2-/-</italic> mice could explain the ABR threshold elevation at the same frequency range (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10M</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Sun and Kim 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Taranda et al., 2009</xref>). The opposite possibility, that the defect evidenced by ABRs is responsible for the reduction in DPOAEs is unlikely since it has been reported that even with 80% loss of IHC (with intact OHC) the DPOAEs are only reduced by 10–20 dB SPL (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Trautwein et al., 1996</xref>). It has also been recently shown that afferent innervation to the OHC has no effect on DPOAEs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Froud et al., 2015</xref>). Despite the reduction in ABRs which measure afferent pathway function, we found an increase in afferent innervation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10A–L</xref>) quantified by synaptic ribbon count in <italic>Nova2-/-</italic> mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10s1">Figure 10—figure supplement 1E–J</xref>) although further study will be necessary to determine if this synapses are functional.

High-throughput sequencing was performed on Hi-seq 2500 (illumina) to obtain 125 nucleotide paired-end reads at New York Genome Center. Reads were aligned to the mouse genome (mm10) using OLego (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Wu et al., 2013</xref>). The downstream splicing analysis was performed as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Yan et al., 2015</xref>) and then liftovered to mm9.

responses. A lightly edited version of the letter sent to the authors after peer review is shown, indicating the most substantive concerns; minor comments are not usually included.</p></boxed-text><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;NOVA2-mediated RNA regulatory networks are required for axonal pathfinding during development&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your paper has been reviewed by three reviewers, one of whom is a member of the Board of Reviewing Editors, and it was also evaluated by a Senior Editor.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>All three of the reviewers agree that the strength of the paper lies in finding that Nova2 uniquely regulates alternative splicing of axon guidance-related genes in cortical development, that the Nova2 null mice have interesting axonal defects in cortex, spinal cord, and brain stem. All also agree that the quality of the molecular data is excellent.</p><p>The major limitations are: 1) there is no causal link between any of the splicing defects and the phenotypes, including agenesis of the Corpus Callosum; 2) the authors do not even attempt to relate their molecular findings to the over 60 genes already known to play a role in development of the Corpus Callosum; they do not credit some important relevant papers and do not look at other potential candidates that emerged from their GO analysis; and lastly there are no data as to how the alternatively spliced variants differ in activity.</p><p>While the reviewers see these limitations, they have decided that together with the Chen et al. paper, the two manuscripts report on related and biological observations.</p><p>That said there are several things outlined below that we do hope you can address in a revision. The full reviews are also included at the end of this summary.</p><p>The issues that must be addressed:</p><p>1) The loss of the corpus callosum is a severe and convincing phenotype in <italic>Nova2</italic> mutants. The authors focus their discussion of this phenotype almost entirely on the netrin-1/DCC signaling pathway for the good reason that Nova2 regulates the alternative splicing of two netrin receptors, DCC and Neo1. However, they do not test this directly. The link between the splicing target and the phenotype would be significantly strengthened by the addition of data testing whether DCC or Neo1 can rescue the ACC phenotype. These would be challenging but valuable experiments.</p><p>Without the DCC or Neo1 rescue experiments, the authors should widen the discussion about the possible targets affected in the Nova2A mutant that could give rise to the agenesis phenotype. There are around 60 mouse genes known to be required for the formation of the corpus callosum (e.g. Paul et al. 2007; Donahoo and Richards, 2012) so it would valuable to try to establish how many of these identified genes are targets of Nova2. How many of these 60 genes are present in the Nova2A target data? Loss of Neuropilin1, for example, gives rise to ACC (Lim et al. 2015) and the EphB1 and EphB2 intracellular signalling domains are required for the formation of the CC (Robichaux et al. 2015). These two studies also report the loss of the anterior commissure in addition to the CC. Does the <italic>Nova2</italic> mutant show a defect in axons crossing the AC?</p><p>2) Overall, the authors do not fully credit highly relevant studies in the literature. In addition to examples above, Blencowe's group published a particularly relevant study with remarkably similar findings to the present work last year that is not cited here (Quesnel-Vallieres et al., G &amp; D 2015). They report that the loss of nSR100, an alternative splicing factor in neurons, gives rise to CC agenesis and to phrenic nerve defects. In addition, a mutation in nSR100 has been reported to cause hearing defects and should probably be cited along with the other two the authors cite in the statement &quot;to date only two alternative splicing factors have been implicated in hearing: <italic>Srrm4</italic> (Nakano et al. 2012) and <italic>Sfswap</italic> (Moayedi et al. 2014)&quot;.</p><p>3) Given the limitations of the Study, perhaps a more accurate title would be &quot;NOVA-2 mediated alternative splicing is required for axon pathfinding during development.&quot; Indeed, the data certainly demonstrate that this is the case. While &quot;regulatory networks&quot; allude to profound insights, to what extend this is true remains unclear, while it is clear that &quot;alternative splicing&quot; is important.</p><p>4) The authors should provide schematic representations for the developmental systems to make the data more broadly accessible to readers. It would also be helpful to make it clear to the reader that the specific phenotypes are complex and as NOVA-2 is broadly expressed how specific developmental defects arise may be a consequence not only of changes in transcripts in a specific cell type, but also changes in transcripts in different ways in different neurons. That is, the phenotypic analysis assumes cell autonomy and no data addresses this issue in the paper.</p><p>5) Furthermore, whether these axon guidance defects arise solely from alteration of transcripts involved in axon guidance or indirectly by disrupting the regulation of other genes involved in neuronal differentiation is unclear. That said, at least some guidance receptors are targets for NOVA-2 regulation and this observation as well as observations in the companion paper provide support for a direct role in this process. It is important to note, however, that the GO analysis presented in the supplementary material <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Figure 3—source data 1</xref> indicates that other categories of genes are also significantly altered in NOVA-2 mutants, including genes involved protein modification, phosphorlyation, metabolism and chromatin modification. Thus, to what extent the observed phenotypes reflect alterations in axon guidance receptors per se, as opposed to proteins acting to regulate neuronal differentiation more generally and axon guidance only indirectly remains unclear. All this needs to be addressed in the Discussion.</p><p>6) The significance of the changes in axon guidance receptors is discussed in the context of the long and short forms of DCC, the netrin receptor. This discussion really belongs in the other manuscript by Chen et al., and that focuses specifically on the NOVA-2 regulation of this pathway.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic> </p><p>The manuscript investigates the functional differences between the two Nova isoforms, Nova1 and Nova2. The authors compare transcriptome-wide HITS-CLIP and RNA-seq data from <italic>Nova1</italic> and <italic>Nova2</italic> mutants and report evidence showing that Nova2 uniquely regulates the alternative splicing of axon guidance-related genes in cortical development. They also report that loss of Nova2, but not Nova1, gives rise to axonal defects in the cortex, spinal cord and brainstem, particularly in ventral motoneuron axons. Overall, the results indicate that Nova2 controls alternative splicing of some key components involved in axon guidance.</p><p>This is an interesting study that compares Nova1 and Nova2 target transcripts and function. The study follows up on previous work from Darnell and colleagues and provides novel evidence for distinct isoform-specific targets and function. The transcriptome-wide analyses are robust and compelling. The functional axonal defects seen with loss of Nova2A are very clear and well described. However, the study does not identify the Nova2A targets that underlie the axon guidance defects. This weakness could potentially be addressed by further experiments.</p><p>1) The loss of the corpus callosum is a severe and convincing phenotype in <italic>Nova2</italic> mutants.

Using a combination of HITS-CLIP and RNA-sequencing, transcripts encoding proteins regulating axon guidance were identified as targets preferentially regulated by the NOVA-2 splicing factor (selectively when compared to NOVA-1). Additional data are presented in support of specific alternative splicing events selectively regulating axon guidance receptors via a NOVA-2 dependent mechanism. In the second part of the paper, genetic studies are presented demonstrating defects in axon guidance in different developmental contexts. The authors argue that these data support the conclusion as stated in their title &quot;NOVA-1 mediated RNA regulatory networks are required for axonal pathfinding during development&quot;. Perhaps a more accurate title would be &quot;NOVA-2 mediated alternative splicing is required for axon pathfinding during development.&quot; Indeed, the data certainly demonstrate that this is the case. While &quot;regulatory networks&quot; allude to profound insights, to what extend this is true remains unclear, while it is clear that &quot;alternative splicing&quot; is important.</p><p>The RNA-sequencing and HITS clip data are impressive and comprehensive and reveal an impressive array of transcripts selectively regulated by NOVA-2. Together this makes a compelling argument that NOVA-2 broadly sculpts the neuronal proteome. The genetic data establish marked axon guidance defects in several different developmental contexts and thus broadly supports the notion of a critical role for NOVA-2 in regulating axon guidance. These data are compelling. My only suggestion here is that the authors provide schematic representations for the developmental systems to make the data more broadly accessible to readers. It would also be helpful to make it clear to the reader that the specific phenotypes are complex and as NOVA-2 is broadly expressed how specific developmental defects arise may be a consequence not only of changes in transcripts in a specific cell type, but also changes in transcripts in different ways in different neurons. That is, the phenotypic analysis assumes cell autonomy and no data addresses this issue in the paper.</p><p>Furthermore, whether these axon guidance defects arise solely from alteration of transcripts involved in axon guidance or indirectly by disrupting the regulating of other genes involved in neuronal differentiation is unclear. That said, at least some guidance receptors are targets for NOVA-2 regulation and this observation as well as observations in the companion paper provide support for a direct role in this process. It is important to note, however, that the GO analysis presented in the supplementary material <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Figure 3—source data 1</xref> indicates that other categories of genes are also significantly altered in NOVA-2 mutants, including genes involved protein modification, phosphorlyation, metabolism and chromatin modification. Thus, to what extent the observed phenotypes reflect alterations in axon guidance receptors per se, as opposed to proteins acting to regulate neuronal differentiation more generally and axon guidance only indirectly remains unclear.</p><p>The significance of the changes in axon guidance receptors is discussed in the context of the long and short forms of DCC, the netrin receptor. This discussion really belongs in the other manuscript that focuses specifically on the NOVA-2 regulation of this pathway.</p><p>In general, I feel that the two papers together certainly are greater than the sum of the two. I suggest that authors play down the notion of a network here as it says very little and implies a level of understanding that is by no means achieved here. Perhaps, the authors could move the discussion of DCC from this manuscript to the other one, and use the space to address the question of how NOVA-2 regulates neural development, and perhaps expand this to explore the relationship to other global splicing regulators of neuronal differentiation such RbFox.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic> </p><p>This work provides an extensive analysis of loss-of-function phenotypes for NOVA1 and NOVA2 mutant mice. Using a combination of genome-wide approaches the authors identify an alternative splicing program regulated by the NOVA RNA-binding proteins. This analysis extends previously reported data sets on such targets.</p><p>Amongst many other targets, there is a significant de-regulation of several axon guidance regulators, in particular components that have been shown to contribute to growth and guidance at the midline. In parallel, the authors report a series of axon extension and guidance phenotypes in the mutant mice.</p><p>The datasets are extensive and rigorous. What is a weakness of the work is the lack of data demonstrating a causal link between any of the splicing targets and the anatomical phenotypes.</p><p>There is also no insight into how the alternative splice isoforms of the guidance receptors may differ in activity.</p><p>The main contributions of the work are the description of novel anatomical phenotypes and splicing targets, as well as the identification of distinct phenotypes in NOVA2 versus NOVA1 mutant mice. However, the mechanism underlying this apparent specificity remains unclear (cell type-specificity of NOVA isoform expression or unique interactions with co-factors or RNA elements?).</p><p>The data is clear, analysis rigorous, and the interpretation of the results is appropriate. Adding more mechanism would mean a substantial amount of experimental work. In the present form this appears to me like a borderline case for publication in <italic>eLife</italic>.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.14371.035</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>The issues that must be addressed:</italic></p><p><italic>1) The loss of the corpus callosum is a severe and convincing phenotype in Nova2 mutants.

Since it has not been reported that <italic>Neo1</italic> KO mice have ACC phenotype, we tried to rescue the ACC phenotype with the DCC-‐long isoform that is decreased in the cortex of <italic>Nova2</italic>-‐KO mice. We undertook in uteroelectroporation of plasmids expressing the DCC-‐long isoform. Plasmid expressing both the <italic>DCC</italic> long isoform and DsRed as a positive control were electroporated into the cingulate cortex at E14.5, the mice were sacrificed at E17.5, and subjected to immunostaining with L1 and DsRed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig12">Author response image 1</xref>). The expression of DCC-‐long isoform in cingulate cortex at E14.5 was not sufficient to form the commissure corpus callosum, indicating that the DCC-‐long isoform was not sufficient to rescue the ACC phenotype, and suggesting the possibility that the ACC phenotype in <italic>Nova2-</italic>KO mice either does not involve the DCC-‐long isoform or is caused by the dysregulation of multiple transcriptomes. We mention this negative result in the revised Discussion part.<fig id="fig12" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.14371.031</object-id><label>Author Response Image 1.</label><caption><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.14371.031">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.14371.031</ext-link></p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="x-tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-14371-resp-fig1-v2"/></fig></p><p><italic>Without the DCC or Neo1 rescue experiments, the authors should widen the discussion about the possible targets affected in the Nova2A mutant that could give rise to the agenesis phenotype.

This point and data has now been added to the text (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2</xref>).</p><p><italic>2) Overall, the authors do not fully credit highly relevant studies in the literature. In addition to examples above, Blencowe's group published a particularly relevant study with remarkably similar findings to the present work last year that is not cited here (Quesnel-Vallieres et al., G &amp; D 2015). They report that the loss of nSR100, an alternative splicing factor in neurons, gives rise to CC agenesis and to phrenic nerve defects. In addition, a mutation in nSR100 has been reported to cause hearing defects and should probably be cited along with the other two the authors cite in the statement &quot;to date only two alternative splicing factors have been implicated in hearing: Srrm4 (Nakano et al. 2012) and Sfswap (Moayedi et al. 2014)&quot;.</italic></p><p>We now use <italic>Srrm4/nSR100</italic> to avoid confusion since <italic>Srrm4</italic> and <italic>nSR100</italic> are same gene. The article of <italic>Srrm4/nSR100</italic> exon 7-‐8 deletion mice (Quesnel-‐Vallieres M., et al., (2015) Genes Dev., 29(7):746-‐759) was cited as a relevant study with similar findings in CC and phrenic nerve to our present work; this is now clarified in the revised text. The statement about alternative splicing and hearing was likewise modified to “to date only two alternative splicing factors have been implicated in hearing: <italic>Srrm4/nSR100</italic> (Nakano et al. 2012) and <italic>Sfswap</italic> (Moayedi et al. 2014)”.</p><p><italic>3) Given the limitations of the Study, perhaps a more accurate title would be &quot;NOVA-2 mediated alternative splicing is required for axon pathfinding during development.&quot; Indeed, the data certainly demonstrate that this is the case. While &quot;regulatory networks&quot; allude to profound insights, to what extend this is true remains unclear, while it is clear that &quot;alternative splicing&quot; is important.</italic></p><p>We agree, and have changed the title to “NOVA2-‐mediated RNA regulation is required for axonal pathfinding during development” since although we focused on alternative splicing but NOVA2 also has other actions, including regulation of alternative poly(A) usage (Licataloci et al., (2008) Nature 456:464–69).</p><p><italic>4) The authors should provide schematic representations for the developmental systems to make the data more broadly accessible to readers. It would also be helpful to make it clear to the reader that the specific phenotypes are complex and as NOVA-2 is broadly expressed how specific developmental defects arise may be a consequence not only of changes in transcripts in a specific cell type, but also changes in transcripts in different ways in different neurons. That is, the phenotypic analysis assumes cell autonomy and no data addresses this issue in the paper.</italic></p><p>We modified the schematic <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11">Figure 11</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11">Figure 11</xref> legend. Also, we widened the discussion about alternative mechanisms (e.g. GO enriched pathway (protein modification, phosphorylation, metabolism and chromatin modification) and differentiation).</p><p>Although we could not distinguish the possibility that <italic>Nova2</italic> deficits cause abnormally differentiated neurons as a primary defect and thereby result in axonal pathfinding defects, we do note that our RNAseq data showed that the transcriptome abundance of the neuronal differentiation markers were comparative between wild-‐type and <italic>Nova2</italic>-‐KO mice (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2-data">Figure 3—source data 2</xref>). Our previous work (Yano M et al., (2010) Neuron66:848-‐858) has showed that the proliferation of neural progenitor cell (NPC) is not disrupted in <italic>Nova2</italic>-KO, suggesting that the differentiation from NPC to neuron is comparative between wild-‐type and <italic>Nova2</italic>-KO mice at least in the cortex. This point and data has now been added to the text (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2-data">Figure 3—source data 2</xref>).</p><p><italic>5) Furthermore, whether these axon guidance defects arise solely from alteration of transcripts involved in axon guidance or indirectly by disrupting the regulation of other genes involved in neuronal differentiation is unclear. That said, at least some guidance receptors are targets for NOVA-2 regulation and this observation as well as observations in the companion paper provide support for a direct role in this process. It is important to note, however, that the GO analysis presented in the supplementary material <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Figure 3—source data 1</xref> indicates that other categories of genes are also significantly altered in NOVA-2 mutants, including genes involved protein modification, phosphorlyation, metabolism and chromatin modification. Thus, to what extent the observed phenotypes reflect alterations in axon guidance receptors per se, as opposed to proteins acting to regulate neuronal differentiation more generally and axon guidance only indirectly remains unclear. All this needs to be addressed in the Discussion.</italic></p><p>As written in point 4, we widened the Discussion part about these concerns.</p><p><italic>6) The significance of the changes in axon guidance receptors is discussed in the context of the long and short forms of DCC, the netrin receptor. This discussion really belongs in the other manuscript by Chen et al., and that focuses specifically on the NOVA-2 regulation of this pathway.</italic></p><p>We cross-‐cited our manuscripts with an accompanying paper by Leggere et al. and partially transfer our Discussion part to an accompanying paper by Leggere et al.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic></p><p><italic>The manuscript investigates the functional differences between the two Nova isoforms, Nova1 and Nova2. The authors compare transcriptome-wide HITS-CLIP and RNA-seq data from Nova1 and Nova2 mutants and report evidence showing that Nova2 uniquely regulates the alternative splicing of axon guidance-related genes in cortical development. They also report that loss of Nova2, but not Nova1, gives rise to axonal defects in the cortex, spinal cord and brainstem, particularly in ventral motoneuron axons. Overall, the results indicate that Nova2 controls alternative splicing of some key components involved in axon guidance.</italic></p><p><italic>This is an interesting study that compares Nova1 and Nova2 target transcripts and function. The study follows up on previous work from Darnell and colleagues and provides novel evidence for distinct isoform-specific targets and function. The transcriptome-wide analyses are robust and compelling. The functional axonal defects seen with loss of Nova2A are very clear and well described. However, the study does not identify the Nova2A targets that underlie the axon guidance defects. This weakness could potentially be addressed by further experiments.</italic></p><p><italic>1) The loss of the corpus callosum is a severe and convincing phenotype in Nova2 mutants. The authors focus their discussion of this phenotype almost entirely on the netrin-1/DCC signaling pathway for the good reason that Nova2 regulates the alternative splicing of two netrin receptors, DCC and Neo1. However, they do not test this directly. The link between the splicing target and the phenotype would be significantly strengthened by the addition of data testing whether DCC or Neo1 can rescue the ACC phenotype. These would be challenging but valuable experiments.</italic></p><p><italic>Without the DCC or Neo1 rescue experiments, the authors should widen the discussion about the possible targets affected in the Nova2A mutant that could give rise to the agenesis phenotype. There are around 60 mouse genes known to be required for the formation of the corpus callosum (e.g. Paul et al. 2007; Donahoo and Richards, 2012) so it would valuable to try to establish how many of these identified genes are targets of Nova2. How many of these 60 genes are present in the Nova2A target data? Loss of Neuropilin1, for example, gives rise to ACC (Lim et al. 2015) and the EphB1 and EphB2 intracellular signalling domains are required for the formation of the CC (Robichaux et al. 2015). These two studies also report the loss of the anterior commissure in addition to the CC. Does the Nova2 mutant show a defect in axons crossing the AC?</italic></p><p>See answers to point 1 above.</p><p><italic>2) Overall, the authors do not fully credit highly relevant studies in the literature.

Using a combination of HITS-CLIP and RNA-sequencing, transcripts encoding proteins regulating axon guidance were identified as targets preferentially regulated by the NOVA-2 splicing factor (selectively when compared to NOVA-1). Additional data are presented in support of specific alternative splicing events selectively regulating axon guidance receptors via a NOVA-2 dependent mechanism. In the second part of the paper, genetic studies are presented demonstrating defects in axon guidance in different developmental contexts. The authors argue that these data support the conclusion as stated in their title &quot;NOVA-1 mediated RNA regulatory networks are required for axonal pathfinding during development&quot;. Perhaps a more accurate title would be &quot;NOVA-2 mediated alternative splicing is required for axon pathfinding during development.&quot; Indeed, the data certainly demonstrate that this is the case.

Together this makes a compelling argument that NOVA-2 broadly sculpts the neuronal proteome. The genetic data establish marked axon guidance defects in several different developmental contexts and thus broadly supports the notion of a critical role for NOVA-2 in regulating axon guidance. These data are compelling. My only suggestion here is that the authors provide schematic representations for the developmental systems to make the data more broadly accessible to readers. It would also be helpful to make it clear to the reader that the specific phenotypes are complex and as NOVA-2 is broadly expressed how specific developmental defects arise may be a consequence not only of changes in transcripts in a specific cell type, but also changes in transcripts in different ways in different neurons.

I suggest that authors play down the notion of a network here as it says very little and implies a level of understanding that is by no means achieved here. Perhaps, the authors could move the discussion of DCC from this manuscript to the other one, and use the space to address the question of how NOVA-2 regulates neural development, and perhaps expand this to explore the relationship to other global splicing regulators of neuronal differentiation such RbFox.</italic></p><p>We cross-‐cited our manuscripts with an accompanying paper by Leggere et al. and expanded our Discussion to clarify the contributions of Leggere et al.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic></p><p><italic>This work provides an extensive analysis of loss-of-function phenotypes for NOVA1 and NOVA2 mutant mice.
