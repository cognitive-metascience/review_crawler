During translocation, proteins, threaded through the channel in the inner membrane, are handed over to the import motor at the matrix face. Tim17 is an essential, membrane-embedded subunit of the translocase; however, its function is only poorly understood. Here, we functionally dissected its four predicted transmembrane (TM) segments. Mutations in TM1 and TM2 impaired the interaction of Tim17 with Tim23, component of the translocation channel, whereas mutations in TM3 compromised binding of the import motor. We identified residues in the matrix-facing region of Tim17 involved in binding of the import motor. Our results reveal functionally distinct roles of different regions of Tim17 and suggest how they may be involved in handing over the proteins, during their translocation into mitochondria, from the channel to the import motor of the presequence translocase.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.22696.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.22696.001</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>TIM23 complex</kwd><kwd>protein import</kwd><kwd>mitochondria</kwd><kwd>GxxxG motif</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd><italic>S. cerevisiae</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001736</institution-id><institution>German-Israeli Foundation for Scientific Research and Development</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>GIF- 1012/08</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Neupert</surname><given-names>Walter</given-names></name><name><surname>Azem</surname><given-names>Abdussalam</given-names></name><name><surname>Mokranjac</surname><given-names>Dejana</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100003977</institution-id><institution>Israel Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>ISF-1507/13</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Azem</surname><given-names>Abdussalam</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001659</institution-id><institution>Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>MO1944/1-1</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Mokranjac</surname><given-names>Dejana</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001655</institution-id><institution>Deutscher Akademischer Austauschdienst</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Banerjee</surname><given-names>Rupa</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>First two transmembrane segments of Tim17 are involved in interaction with the channel and the second two with the motor of the presequence translocase suggesting how proteins are handed over during their translocation into mitochondria.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Biogenesis of mitochondria requires import of over 1000 different proteins synthesized as precursor proteins in the cytosol.

Intermembrane space (IMS)-exposed domains of Tim50 and Tim23 serve as receptors of the TIM23 complex that recognize proteins as soon as they appear at the outlet of the TOM complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Marom et al., 2011b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Mokranjac et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Schulz et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Tamura et al., 2009</xref>). In a membrane potential-dependent step, proteins are then transferred to the translocation channel in the inner membrane formed by membrane-embedded segments of Tim23 and possibly also Tim17 and/or Mgr2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Alder et al., 2008a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Dekker et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Ieva et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Martinez-Caballero et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Truscott et al., 2001</xref>). Complete translocation into the matrix is mediated by the import motor of the TIM23 complex, also referred to as PAM (presequence translocase-associated motor). mtHsp70 is the central component of the import motor. Its ATP-dependent action, regulated by the J and J-like proteins Tim14/Pam18 and Tim16/Pam16 and the nucleotide exchange factor Mge1, drives translocation of proteins across the inner membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">D'Silva et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Frazier et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Kang et al., 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Liu et a., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Mokranjac et al., 2003</xref>).

Both proteins are predicted to span the inner membrane with four transmembrane (TM) helices. The TMs of Tim17 and Tim23 share limited sequence similarity; however, the two proteins cannot substitute for each other (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Ryan et al., 1994</xref>). The first two TMs of Tim23 constitute at least part of the translocation channel of the TIM23 complex, and they actively respond to changes in the membrane potential across inner membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Alder et al., 2008a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Alder et al., 2008b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Malhotra et al., 2013</xref>).

When protein import into mitochondria is impaired, the precursor form of matrix-localized Hsp60 accumulates in the cytosol (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Gambill et al., 1993</xref>). The cells were first grown at 30°C and then shifted to 37°C. Analysis of total cell extracts showed accumulation of Hsp60 precursor in all <italic>ts</italic> mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). The amount of accumulated precursor correlated with the severity of the growth phenotype. In G99L mutant, the mature form of Hsp60 was hardly detected. Impaired import via the TIM23 pathway was also observed when radiolabeled precursor proteins were imported into isolated mitochondria (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). The reduction of import efficiency correlated with the severity of the growth phenotype also in these experiments. The defects were observed irrespective of whether matrix translocation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A–C</xref>) or lateral insertion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1D–I</xref>) via the TIM23 pathway was analyzed, although reduction of matrix translocation was typically more pronounced. Importantly, import of a TIM23-independent protein, ATP/ADP carrier (AAC), occurred with essentially the same efficiency in all types of mitochondria (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1J–L</xref>), demonstrating that the mutations specifically affected import via the TIM23 pathway.</p><p>To obtain molecular insight into the <italic>ts</italic> phenotypes of Tim17 mutants, we analyzed the effects of the introduced mutations on the formation of the Tim17-Tim23 core complex. To this end, wild-type cells and cells carrying <italic>ts</italic> forms of Tim17 were grown under permissive conditions, mitochondria were isolated, solubilized in digitonin-containing buffer and analyzed by Blue Native (BN)-PAGE. In wt mitochondria, as expected, a dominant ca. 90 kDa complex, consisting of Tim17 and Tim23, was observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Chacinska et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Dekker et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Popov-Celeketić et al., 2008</xref>). In contrast, the levels of the 90 kDa complex and of the higher molecular weight species were drastically reduced in all <italic>ts</italic> mutants of TMs 1 and 2. SDS-PAGE analysis of the same samples (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>, lower panel) shows that the levels of Tim17 and several other essential TIM23 subunits are indistinguishable among different mitochondria, demonstrating that the absence of Tim17-containing complexes is not due to instability of the protein but rather due to the involvement of TMs 1 and 2 of Tim17, directly or indirectly, in the interaction with Tim23. This resembles the previous finding that TMs 1 and 2 of Tim23 are important for the interaction with Tim17 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Alder et al., 2008b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Demishtein-Zohary et al., 2015</xref>).

To address this question, we isolated mitochondria from yeast cells expressing His-tagged versions of the TM3 <italic>ts</italic> mutants and performed pull down assay using Ni-agarose beads. His-tagged but otherwise wt Tim17 efficiently bound to the Ni-agarose beads, bringing down Tim23, Tim50 and Tim44 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). Similar amounts of Tim23 were bound to the Ni-agarose beads when the two TM3 mutant mitochondria were analyzed, confirming the results obtained by BN-PAGE described above. Binding of Tim50 was also indistinguishable among the three types of mitochondria, in agreement with the notion that Tim50 is recruited to the complex mainly through its interaction with the IMS-exposed domain of Tim23 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Geissler et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Gevorkyan-Airapetov et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Yamamoto et al., 2002</xref>). In contrast, binding of Tim44 to the beads was impaired in both mutants. In the G99L mutant, essentially no Tim44 was found in the bound fraction.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Region of Tim17 involved in binding of Tim44</title><p>We sought to map the region of Tim17 involved in binding of Tim44 more precisely. Although it is likely that during translocation of proteins into mitochondria Tim44 may reach deep into the membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Kanamori et al., 1997</xref>), it is generally accepted that the major part of Tim44 is exposed to the matrix, suggesting that its binding site should be found in more matrix-facing regions of Tim17. A binding site of Tim44 has not been found in the matrix-exposed loop between TMs 1 and 2 of Tim17 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Ting et al., 2014</xref>). Since our mutant analysis suggests an involvement of TM3 in the interaction with Tim44, we examined the predicted loop between TMs 3 and 4 for a potential Tim44 binding site. To this end, we first screened positions 104 to 113 by mutating the first and the second five residues in a row to alanines. The mutant of the first half of the loop resulted in a lethal phenotype, whereas the second mutant was viable (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). This result suggests that the residues potentially involved in Tim44 binding are found in the region 104–108. Close inspection of this region revealed a highly conserved arginine residue at position 105 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>). We replaced this arginine with an alanine residue. The R105A mutant was viable but displayed a severely reduced and temperature-sensitive growth even on fermentable carbon source and was barely viable on non-fermentable carbon source (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). Submitochondrial localization of the Tim17R105A mutant was indistinguishable from wt (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1A</xref>), suggesting that impaired biogenesis and an altered topology of Tim17 were not the reasons behind the severe growth phenotype. Impaired growth was likely due to the impaired protein import via the TIM23 pathway (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1B</xref>). Precursor proteins translocated into the matrix or laterally inserted into the inner membrane by the TIM23 complex were imported with reduced efficiencies into mitochondria isolated from <italic>tim17R105A</italic> cells. Import of a TIM23-independent substrate occurred with an efficiency indistinguishable from wt. A mutant in which arginine was exchanged to lysine, thus keeping a positive charge at this position, showed a very similar growth phenotype (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1C</xref>), suggesting that, intriguingly, the charge itself is not sufficient for function.<fig-group><fig id="fig3" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.22696.006</object-id><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>Identification of a region of Tim17 involved in binding of Tim44.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Alanine-scanning mutagenesis of Tim17 region encompassing residues 104 to 113.

In wt, Tim44 was immunoprecipitated with antibodies to Tim17, Tim23 and Tim16, as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Kozany et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Popov-Celeketić et al., 2008</xref>). In contrast, in the R105A mutant, the interaction of Tim44 with the TIM23 complex was severely compromised (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). However, the interaction between Tim17 and Tim23 in the R105A mutant was indistinguishable from that in wt, in agreement with the results of the analysis of GxxxG motifs described above. Lack of Tim44 recruitment also led to an almost complete dissociation of Tim14-Tim16 pair from the Tim17-Tim23 core, supporting the previous finding that Tim44 is the major component that connects the Tim17-Tim23 with the Tim14-Tim16 subcomplex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Kozany et al., 2004</xref>). Lack of coprecipitation of Tim44 with Tim23 antibodies from lysates of the R105A mutant mitochondria further supports the notion that Tim17 is the major component for recruitment of Tim44 to the Tim17-Tim23 core (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Banerjee et al., 2015</xref>). Essentially the same observations were made when Tim17R105K mutant mitochondria were analyzed by coimmunoprecipitation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1D</xref>), again suggesting that it is not the positive charge per se that is functionally and/or structurally important.</p><p>To further exclude potential secondary effects of the R105A mutation on the TIM23 complex, we attempted to obtain positive evidence for the involvement of this region of Tim17 in the interaction with Tim44. To this end, we introduced an unnatural amino acid p-benzoylphenylalanine (BPA) in vivo in several positions along this region using an orthogonal suppressor tRNA and a cognate amino acyl tRNA synthetase pair (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Kim et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Shiota et al., 2015</xref>). Upon activation with UV light, BPA crosslinks to any C-H bond in the vicinity and the obtained size shift can be detected by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting. When BPA was introduced at position 106 of Tim17, an additional band was observed upon immunoblotting with Tim44 antibodies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>). This band was present only in UV-treated cells demonstrating the specificity of the crosslink. To unambiguously confirm that this band represents a crosslink between Tim17 and Tim44, cells containing a His-tagged version of Tim17(106BPA) were UV irradiated, solubilized in SDS-containing buffer to break all noncovalent interactions and incubated with Ni-agarose beads (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1E</xref>). The crosslinked species was efficiently recovered in the bound fraction, in contrast to the non-crosslinked Tim44. Since this band was recognized by Tim44 antibodies and it bound to Ni-agarose beads, we conclude that it represents a crosslink between Tim17 and Tim44. In the end, we made a version of Tim17 containing both the R105A mutation and BPA introduced at position 106. In this mutant, no crosslink between Tim17 and Tim44 was observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>), providing further support for the involvement of R105 in Tim44 binding.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>Conclusions</title><p>Here, we have functionally dissected the TM segments of Tim17. Our data show that the TMs of Tim17 have functionally distinct roles. This notion is further supported by the observation that in Tim17, unlike in Tim23 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Pareek et al., 2013</xref>), TMs 1 and 2 are not sufficient to support the function of the full length protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). Our data support a model in which TMs 1 and 2 are involved, directly or indirectly, in the interaction with Tim23 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>). Previously, TMs 1 and 2 of Tim23 were similarly implicated in the interaction with Tim17 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Demishtein-Zohary et al., 2015</xref>). Although the exact arrangement of the TMs remains currently unknown, the available data suggest that the first two TMs in the members of this protein family are involved in formation of higher order structures. A recently identified disulfide bond in Tim17 appears to play a role in this process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Mokranjac, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Ramesh et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Wrobel et al., 2016</xref>). Whether the first two TMs of Tim17 are directly involved in channel formation, as shown for Tim23, awaits future experiments. In addition, we found that the second half of Tim17, and in particular a strictly conserved arginine residue at the matrix-facing side of IM, play an essential role in recruitment of Tim44 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). Thus, Tim17 may bridge the translocation channel and the import motor of the TIM23 complex suggesting how the translocating proteins are guided between the two.<fig-group><fig id="fig4" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.22696.008</object-id><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><title>Transmembrane segments of Tim17 have functionally distinct roles.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) The ability of the indicated mutants to complement <italic>TIM17</italic> deletion was analyzed on a medium containing 5-FOA.

Your article has been favorably evaluated by Vivek Malhotra (Senior Editor) and three reviewers, one of whom, Klaus Pfanner, is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>The presequence translocase of the inner mitochondrial membrane (TIM23) is a remarkable complex and versatile molecular machine that transports several hundred different nuclear-encoded precursor proteins to their final destination in the inner membrane or matrix of mitochondria. How the different functional modules of TIM23 – receptor, channel, and motor – cooperate with each other is still under debate. Since high-resolution structural information on the organization of the TIM23 core complex is missing, thorough biochemical analysis is urgently required to better understand this central player in mitochondrial protein biogenesis.</p><p>Tim17 and Tim23 are the core subunits of the TIM23 complex. Tim23 and Tim17 have 4 transmembrane (TM) segments and are homologous to each other, yet in contrast to Tim23, the functions of Tim17 are only poorly characterized. In the present study, the authors performed mutagenesis of the conserved GxxxG motifs in TM1-4 in Tim17, and found that TM1 and TM2 are important for interactions with Tim23, and R105 in the matrix-facing loop between TM3 and TM4 plays a role in recruiting Tim44 to the TIM23 complex. The experiments were carefully and logically performed, and the obtained results are important for further understanding of the structure-function relationship of the TIM23 complex. The manuscript is concisely written, and the data are presented in a reader-friendly manner.</p><p>The findings provide the first functional dissection of the essential protein Tim17 and thus considerably improve our mechanistic understanding of protein import into mitochondria via the presequence pathway.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Do the distinct mutants of TIM17 generated by the authors differentially affect the import of precursor proteins into the mitochondrial matrix and inner membrane?

We agree with the reviewers that in vitro import experiments into isolated mitochondria may provide important functional insight into differential sorting of proteins and we followed the suggestion to perform these experiments. We did in vitro imports of one matrix targeted preprotein and two laterally sorted preproteins, one that is motor-dependent and one that is motor-independent. In addition, we imported a TIM23-independent preprotein as a control to exclude general defects of mitochondria. To obtain a complete picture, we used isolated mitochondria of all six identified <italic>ts</italic> mutants in TM1-3 as well as <italic>tim17R105A</italic> and performed in vitro imports into mitochondria that were preincubated for 30 min at 37°C prior to import reaction or were left untreated. Overall, the in vitro import experiments recapitulated the import defects observed in vivo – the reduction of the in vitro import efficiency correlated with the severity of the growth phenotype. Matrix translocation was generally more affected than motor-independent insertion but we observed no obvious difference among the mutants in respect to differential sorting. Importantly, a TIM23-independent precursor protein was imported in all mitochondria with essentially the same efficiency. Import defects via the TIM23 pathway were visible, irrespective of whether mitochondria were exposed to heat shock or not but the exposure to heat shock made them more obvious. We therefore felt that presenting only the data obtained upon pretreatment would be sufficient, however, we can include the other results as well, depending on your decision. in vitro imports into isolated mitochondria from <italic>ts</italic> mutants in TM1-3 are presented in the newly added <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref> and the imports into <italic>tim17R105A</italic> are added to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>. The text was also modified accordingly.</p><p><italic>2) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref> – decrease in the amount of the 90 K Tim23-Tim17 complex by mutations in TM1 and TM2 of Tim17 may not be sufficient to claim that TM1 and TM2 of Tim17 are directly involved in interactions with Tim23. The authors should either provide direct experimental results like crosslinking of BPA in TM1 and TM2 to Tim23 or they should re-write the Discussion to indicate that the current results do not fully rule out the possibility of TM1 or TM2 not directly interacting with Tim23</italic></p><p>We completely agree with the reviewers that the data presented in the manuscript do not exclude the possibility of TM1 or TM2 not directly interacting with Tim23. However, we neither had any intention to claim this nor, we believe, we did so. We stated that TM1 and TM2 of Tim17 <italic>are involved in the interaction</italic> with Tim23 which, in our opinion, leaves both possibilities open. To make this point clearer we changed the text to now read “… demonstrating that the absence of Tim17-containing complexes is not due to instability of the protein but rather due to the involvement<italic>, direct or indirect,</italic> of TMs 1 and 2 of Tim17 in the interaction with Tim23.” In the Conclusions, the corresponding sentence now reads “Our data support a model in which TMs 1 and 2 are involved, <italic>directly or indirectly</italic>, in the interaction with Tim23”.</p><p><italic>3) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref> – the authors should use WT mitochondria prepared from cells grown in YPD as done for R105A mitochondria.</italic></p><p>There is a misunderstanding and we apologize for it. In all experiments, wild type and mutant cells were always grown in parallel – in the same medium, at the same temperature and even in the same shaker. Mitochondria were then subsequently also isolated in parallel. This is our common laboratory policy introduced to be able to make direct comparisons between wild type and mutant cells and to minimize, as much as possible, any potential effects of minor variations in media composition, growth conditions and isolations of mitochondria. We modified the Materials and methods section to clarify this point.</p></body></sub-article></article>
