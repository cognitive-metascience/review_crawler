using limited enumeration employing simple image analysis algorithms based on image segmentation. Host protein recruitment to pathogens is often refractory to accurate automated assessment due to its heterogeneous nature. An intuitive intelligent image analysis program to assess host protein recruitment within general cellular pathogen defense is lacking. We present HRMAn (Host Response to Microbe Analysis), an open-source image analysis platform based on machine learning algorithms and deep learning. We show that HRMAn has the capacity to learn phenotypes from the data, without relying on researcher-based assumptions. Using <italic>Toxoplasma gondii</italic> and <italic>Salmonella enterica</italic> Typhimurium we demonstrate HRMAn’s capacity to recognize, classify and quantify pathogen killing, replication and cellular defense responses. HRMAn thus presents the only intelligent solution operating at human capacity suitable for both single image and high content image analysis.</p><p><bold>Editorial note:</bold> This article has been through an editorial process in which the authors decide how to respond to the issues raised during peer review.

revolutionized the field of host–pathogen interaction by allowing researchers to perform image-based large-scale compound and host genome-wide depletion screens in a high-throughput fashion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Brodin and Christophe, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Mattiazzi Usaj et al., 2016</xref>). The majority of these screens assess host–pathogen interactions using bulk colorimetric or automated enumeration of pathogen growth at the population level (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Ang and Pethe, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Radke et al., 2018</xref>). Additionally, quantification of host–pathogen interaction (e.g. analysis of host protein recruitment to the pathogen) in general is often performed manually. However, to meaningfully dissect cell-mediated pathogen control, it is imperative to quantify the host response and pathogen fate at the single-cell level. Many open-source, e.g. CellProfiler (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Carpenter et al., 2006</xref>), and proprietary, e.g. Perkin Elmer Harmony, analysis software packages have been developed and successfully employed for this purpose (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Eliceiri et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Stöter et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Smith et al., 2018</xref>). To advance the state of the art in image analysis of host–pathogen interaction, incorporation of cutting-edge machine intelligence algorithms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Simonyan and Zisserman, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">LeCun et al., 2015</xref>) to stratify the image content without the requirement to program complex integrations is needed. HRMAn relies on the same well-established image segmentation strategies as many other programs but offers an intuitive integration of deep learning for more complex image analysis. Solutions existing to date can be split into two major categories: user-friendly turn-key GUI (TK-GUI)-based solutions and scripts ensembles (SE) solutions. Due to the large support burden of the TK-GUI, these programs lack the implementations of the latest engineering advances. At the same time SE solutions are easier to update but are far from user-friendly and are difficult to migrate between installations.</p><p>Deep neural network-based machine intelligence methods have brought about a revolutionary advance in the field of computer vision, by allowing for learning of complex morphologies in a highly generalized fashion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Krizhevsky et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">LeCun et al., 2015</xref>). To date, these methods have not been adapted for the field of host–pathogen interaction. Typically, HCI based fluorescent imaging data from a host–pathogen interaction experiment is analyzed by classical image segmentation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Osaka et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Schmutz et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Kühbacher et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Ovalle-Bracho et al., 2015</xref>). Occasionally segmentation combined with machine learning based on calculated features has been employed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Kreibich et al., 2015</xref>). Most of these analysis pipelines make use of open-source programs tailored with additional coding by the user to suit their specific needs and are not published in their final form as a universal open-source solution. A major short-coming of these classical image segmentation and machine learning analysis methods is that they fail at the level of quantifying host protein recruitment to the pathogen. This is largely due to the fact that traditional algorithms quantify phenotypes in a rule-based manner, using bulk statistical properties of microscopy images or their segments. Conversely, deep neural networks make use of complex patterns (e.g. shapes) within the dataset to learn phenotypes and their diversity. The neural network derives these patterns in an automatic fashion from expert-labelled data. Thus, using pattern complexity to refine classification (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Krizhevsky et al., 2012</xref>), deep neural networks improve the biological relevance of the phenotypic readouts.</p><p>While some proprietary solutions have been employed to extract host protein recruitment data, these are impractical and insufficient for most researchers as they are tied to single and expensive microscopes and do not operate at human capacity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Polajnar et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Touquet et al., 2018</xref>). To date, for the analysis of host protein recruitment to pathogens, artificial intelligence-driven automated analysis is neither available as an open-source nor as a commercial package. Thus, there remains a need for an open-source, intuitive, flexible, and trainable host–pathogen interaction analysis software that performs at the level of human analytic capacity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Russakovsky et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">He et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Haberl et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>Here we present a high-throughput, high-content, single-cell image analysis pipeline that incorporates machine learning and a deep convolutional neural network (CNN) ensemble for Host Response to Microbe Analysis (HRMAn; <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://hrman.org/">https://hrman.org/</ext-link>). To assure its broad applicability to infection biology, HRMAn is based on the data integration environment KNIME Analytics Platform (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Berthold et al., 2008</xref>). The analysis relies on training of machine learning algorithms and deep neural networks that can be tailored to individual researchers’ needs.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Architecture of the high-content image analysis pipeline for analyzing host–pathogen interaction</title><p>The HRMAn pipeline (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>), is designed to work with all file types acquired on any HCI platform or fluorescence microscope. Plate maps including experimental layouts, sample groups and replicates can be loaded, enabling HRMAn to automatically cluster results and perform error analysis. Once fed into the HRMAn pipeline, images are automatically pre-processed and clustered based on user-defined parameters (i.e. imaging specifications) and corrected for illumination. The subsequent image analysis proceeds in two stages: in stage 1, HRMAn segments images into pathogen and host cell features for single cell analysis. It then classifies these features using a decision tree learning algorithm previously trained on an annotated dataset. In stage 2, HRMAn analyzes host cell features associated with the pathogens using a CNN HRMAlexNet (derived from AlexNet architecture) trained to distinguish complex phenotypic patterns of host-protein recruitment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Krizhevsky et al., 2012</xref>). Robust classification is achieved by passing segmented regions of interest through multiple non-linear convolutional filters to identify characteristic phenotypic details.</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.40560.002</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Overview of the HRMAn pipeline.</title><p>Following image acquisition, on a high-content imaging platform or any other fluorescence microscope, the images can be loaded into the HRMAn software. First, the data is pre-processed and clustered based on user-defined parameters and provided plate maps. Images then undergo illumination correction and automated segmentation using Huang algorithm. Segmented images are used by a deep convolution neural network (CNN) and other machine learning based algorithms to analyze infection of cells with intracellular pathogens. Depicted is the CNN diagram representing two-dimensional convolutional filters with respective width, height and depth designated on filters facets. Respective change of stride in the groups of hidden layers is depicted above the diagram, while respective activation functions below the diagram. Finally, the data is written as a single file and will provide the researcher with more than 15 different readouts that describe the interaction between pathogen and host cell during infection. HRMAn is based on the open-source data integration environment KNIME Analytics Platform making it modular and adaptable to a researcher’s needs. The analysis is based on training of the machine learning algorithms generating high flexibility, which can be tailored to the needs of the user.</p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-40560-fig1-v1.tif"/></fig><p>Finally, data are output as a single spreadsheet file providing the researcher with ≥15 quantitative descriptions of a pathogen and its interaction with host factors at population and single cell levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>; Readouts).

HeLa cells infected with eGFP <italic>Tg</italic> ±IFNγ were fixed 6 hr post-infection (hpi) and stained with Hoechst (nuclei) and antibodies directed against ubiquitin and p62. A total of 1,350 4-colour images were acquired on an automated microscope and loaded into HRMAn for analysis.</p><p>HRMAn automatically detected and analyzed more than 15,000 HeLa cells resulting in 15 quantitative outputs of host–pathogen interaction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). Population level readouts from stage one indicated that IFNγ treatment did not impact the percentage of infected cells but decreased the number of vacuoles within host cells as well as the number of parasites per cell (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). As eGFP fluorescence is lost when parasites are killed, a reduction in the ratio between vacuoles and host cells serves as an indirect measurement for parasite killing. At the single cell level, HRMAn found that IFNγ treatment resulted in a significant reduction of vacuoles per cell and a minor reduction in mean vacuole size, without impacting vacuole position (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). Concomitant with this reduction in vacuole size, both the percentage of replicating parasites, and the number of parasites per vacuole were significantly reduced by IFNγ treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). Thus, IFNγ−mediated control of <italic>Tg</italic> in HeLa cells involves both parasite-killing and restriction of <italic>Tg</italic> replication. Importantly, HRMAn offers a wide range of readouts in stage 1 analysis allowing for more detailed information on the dynamics of infection and clearance than typically seen with manual counting. To allow the user to decide which readouts are best suited to answer their specific research question some redundancy has been purposely built in (e.g. mean vacuole size vs. % Replicating). For example, here we focused on parasites per vacuole and the proportion of infected cells, as opposed to the number of individual vacuoles per host cell.</p><p>In stage 2, analysis of the &gt;25,000 vacuoles identified in stage 1, showed that the number of host cells with ubiquitin/p62-positive vacuoles and the percentage of ubiquitin/p62-positive vacuoles per host cell increased with IFNγ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>). Distribution analysis indicated that in untreated cells, only 5.92% of vacuoles were decorated with ubiquitin, p62, or both. This number rose to 27.61% in IFNγ-treated cells, the majority of which (20.92%) were double-positive for ubiquitin/p62 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>). By quantifying the radial fluorescence intensity distribution of these host factors, HRMAn revealed that ubiquitin was more closely associated with <italic>Tg</italic> vacuoles than p62 and that recruitment of both was increased by IFNγ treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>). This is in agreement with the notion that p62 binds a ubiquitinated vacuole substrate through its UBA domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Seibenhener et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Clough et al., 2016</xref>). Finally, by analyzing vacuoles that recruit ubiquitin/p62, HRMAn indicated that restriction of <italic>Tg</italic> replication occurs in vacuoles decorated with these host defense proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref>). Collectively, this data indicates that in HeLa cells, IFNγ drives both parasite killing as well as recruitment of ubiquitin/p62 to <italic>Tg</italic> vacuoles, which acts to restrict parasite replication (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). The results demonstrate the capacity of HRMAn to provide a quantitative, multi-parametric readout of host–pathogen interaction at population and single-cell levels.</p><p>As a high-throughput, high-content analysis program, HRMAn removes experimental size constraints imposed by manual quantification. To illustrate this, HRMAn was used to systematically analyze the impact of IFNγ treatment on type I and type II <italic>Toxoplasma</italic> strains in five human cell lines: HeLa (cervical carcinoma epithelial), PMA-differentiated THP-1 (macrophage-like), A549 (lung carcinoma epithelia), HFF (primary fibroblasts), and HUVEC (primary endothelial cells) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplements 1</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s7">7</xref>).</p><p>First, stage 1 HRMAn was used to ascertain the impact of varying concentrations of IFNγ (50–500 IU/ml) on <italic>Tg</italic> infection, killing, and replication. (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>). For each host cell line (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1A</xref>), a dose-dependent reduction in <italic>Tg</italic> infection was seen (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1B</xref>). Assessment of the vacuole:cell ratio and mean vacuole size indicated that THP-1s, HFFs, and HUVECs limit infection by IFNγ-dependent <italic>Tg</italic> killing, while HeLas and A549s do so by restricting replication (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1C–D</xref>). Quantification of the number of parasites per vacuole indicated that HeLas and A549s acutely restrict type I and type II <italic>Tg</italic> replication at all concentrations of IFNγ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2B–C</xref>), while THP-1s, HFFs, and HUVECs are far more limited in this capacity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2A,D–E</xref>).</p><p>Next, HRMAn was employed on all 5 cell lines infected with either type I and type II <italic>Tg</italic> ±100 IU/ml IFNγ and immuno-stained for ubiquitin and p62. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s7">7</xref> display the 15 quantitative readouts compiled by HRMAn of 9000 fields of view (~90 GB) and &gt;175,000 vacuoles identified in stage 1. Taking advantage of the large-scale capabilities of HRMAn, we found that all host cell types can mediate IFNγ-dependent type I and II <italic>Tg</italic> killing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3B–C</xref>), and growth restriction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s4">Figure 3—figure supplement 4A–B</xref>) to similar levels. <italic>Tg</italic> vacuoles show strain-dependent (A549, HUVEC), and strain-independent (HFFs) IFNγ-stimulated movement towards the nucleus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s4">Figure 3—figure supplement 4C</xref>). HRMAn revealed that type II <italic>Tg</italic> grew slower than type I <italic>Tg</italic> in each host cell line and that their growth decreased more upon treatment with IFNγ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s5">Figure 3—figure supplement 5A–B</xref>). Consistent with this, stage 2 HRMAn showed that all cell types could recruit ubiquitin and/or p62 equally well (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s6">Figure 3—figure supplement 6A</xref>), while a greater percentage of type II vacuoles per cell were decorated in response to IFNγ-priming (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s6">Figure 3—figure supplement 6B</xref>). The exception to this were THP-1 cells, which did not mount a strain-specific response (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s6">Figure 3—figure supplement 6B</xref>). Distribution analysis further indicated that THP-1s display a higher intrinsic capacity to decorate <italic>Tg</italic> vacuoles than other cell lines, even in the absence of IFNγ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s6">Figure 3—figure supplement 6C</xref>). While no cell-type dependent differences in ubiquitin or p62 coat distance were observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s7">Figure 3—figure supplement 7A</xref>), THP-1s not only decorate vacuoles with more ubiquitin upon IFNγ stimulation, they also appear to recruit p62 in an IFNγ-independent fashion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s7">Figure 3—figure supplement 7B</xref>). Decorated vacuoles in all host cell types displayed a greater ability to restrict the growth of type II versus type I <italic>Tg</italic> upon IFNγ treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s7">Figure 3—figure supplement 7C–D</xref>).

This allowed us to achieve 69.9% classification accuracy, confirmed by expert-based cross-validation, in just 40 epochs using 10-fold less non-augmented image data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>). It’s known that HeLa cells restrict STm growth by maintaining vacuole integrity; the small percentage of bacteria that escape vacuoles are decorated with ubiquitin and subsequently cleared by autophagy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Noad et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">van Wijk et al., 2017</xref>). Interestingly, stage 2 HRMAn showed that the percent of host cells which recruit ubiquitin to STm doubles upon IFNγ treatment, while the percent of decorated vacuoles/cell increases only slightly (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>). As seen with <italic>Tg</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s7">Figure 3—figure supplement 7A</xref>), IFNγ does not impact the distance of the ubiquitin coat to STm but increases its thickness (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref>). This indicates that more ubiquitin is recruited to cytosolic STm in the presence of IFNγ and growth of decorated bacteria was restricted (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4G</xref>). Consequently, although IFNγ treatment increases the number of host cells that recruit ubiquitin to STm and the intensity of that recruitment, at the single-cell level HeLa cells appear to have reached their capacity for detection and autophagy-mediated clearance of cytosolic/ubiquitinated STm independent of IFNγ treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E–G</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>HRMANs versatility allows for rapid adaption to study pathogen biology</title><p>To illustrate the versatility of HRMAn and the advantage of the modular architecture combined with the accessible user interface that comes with the KNIME Analytics platform, we performed experiments to stress HRMAn’s applicability and adaptability to study pathogen-driven parameters of infection.

This analysis shows that HRMAn can be used to study effects of pathogen effector proteins on an established host phenotype.</p><fig id="fig5" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.40560.014</object-id><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><title>HRMAn can be adapted to study pathogen biology.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) HRMAn-based quantification of Gbp recruitment to <italic>Tg</italic> vacuoles.

HRMAn, further indicated that the levels of nuclear accumulation correlated to the number of parasites contained within the infected cell (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>). Thus, HRMAn can be employed to analyze both host and parasite parameters during infection in an unbiased, accurate and high content manner.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Recent advances have made deep CNNs a powerful image analysis method (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Simonyan and Zisserman, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">He et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Ioffe and Szegedy, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">LeCun et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Russakovsky et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Haberl et al., 2018</xref>). Inspired by abstraction of animal visual cortex architecture, CNNs are able to generalize patterns independent of minor phenotypic differences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Hubel and Wiesel, 1968</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Matsugu et al., 2003</xref>). Combining automated image segmentation, machine learning and a deep CNN in an ensemble, HRMAn is a powerful open-source, user-friendly software for the analysis of host–pathogen interaction at the single-cell level. We based HRMAn on the KNIME Analytics Platform (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Berthold et al., 2008</xref>). Being highly modular, GUI-based and user-friendly, HRMAn can rapidly be updated with latest technological advances, yet remains transparent for the average user. Furthermore, the ready-to-use DL4J library modules we employed allow for incorporation of the latest advances in the field of artificial intelligence in a click-through manner with zero coding. To date, HRMAn represents the only open-source CNN-driven host-pathogen analysis solution for fluorescent images. While HRMAlexNet is a rather simple architecture, more complex architectures can be easily implemented through recently introduced KNIME-Keras integration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chollet, 2015</xref>), which may facilitate improvement in the classification accuracy. This is important, as it moves the phenotype of host defense protein recognition of pathogens into the realm of HCI at the level of artificial intelligence and thus human accuracy and capacity. Many automated image analysis programs, some of which incorporate machine learning elements, have been developed and are successfully used for classical image segmentation (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary File 1</xref>). However, when presented with the problem of classifying host protein recruitment to a pathogen, inaccurate classical image segmentation could lead to erroneous results. Employing an artificial intelligence algorithm, HRMAn circumvents these problems and delivers user-defined automated and unbiased enumeration of this subset of the host-pathogen interplay.</p><p>Using <italic>Tg</italic> and STm infection models, we demonstrate that HRMAn is capable of detecting and quantifying multiple pathogen and host parameters. Importantly, we show that HRMAn can be adapted easily to two entirely different pathogens, that not only differ in size by a magnitude, but also display distinct growth rates and infection dynamics. The easy adaption of HRMAn for different pathogens and research questions will prove useful for any lab working in image-based infection biology. Designed for biologists, HRMAn requires no coding or specialized computer science knowledge. Its modular architecture and the use of KNIME, which provides a graphical representation of the analysis pipeline, allows users to tailor experimental outputs to their own datasets and questions. As the models we have generated can be used as primers to lower the training dataset size, computation power and training time requirements, HRMAn can be rapidly applied to similar large-scale, image-based experimental setups. As such, HRMAn will allow a broad range of researchers to extend into the realm of high-throughput, unbiased, quantitative single-cell analysis of host–pathogen interaction.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Code and image availability</title><p>All open-source KNIME workflows used in this publication can be found at: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/HRMAn-Org/HRMAn">https://github.com/HRMAn-Org/HRMAn</ext-link> and on the homepage <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://hrman.org/">https://hrman.org/</ext-link> under GPLv3 open-source software license to allow for rapid and open dissemination and free availability for the research community.

Furthermore, HRMAn can work with images acquired on any type of fluorescence microscope and is truly platform independent.</p></sec><sec id="s4-3"><title>Image analysis using HRMAn</title><p>Following image acquisition, the images were loaded into the HRMAn pipeline. Images can be in any common file format, preferably as single-channel tiff files. The used image reader loads images from all file formats supported by SCIFIO (more information can be found here: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://scif.io">http://scif.io</ext-link>). If the images were not acquired on a high-content imaging platform, they can be renamed with HRMAn to mimic the file names and the plate format. This is needed to cluster the output data and perform error calculation. Furthermore, the OME-XML-metadata is loaded and information on the image is extracted (e.g. image size, type and origin). While the images are loaded into KNIME, the user is asked to provide some basic information on the image acquisition and the type of analysis to be performed. This includes the used magnification, type of analysis, channel number and order and providing a plate map to cluster the data.</p><p>HRMAn then pre-processes the images, metadata and provided information and lets the user inspect the input images arranged into a grid and sorted by the field of view. Next the input images undergo illumination correction by dividing the background as a mean image of all acquired images in a channel-wise fashion.

All cell labels touching the border of an image are excluded from the analysis.</p></list-item></list><p>Furthermore, the created labels are filtered based on their size and the user-defined parameters such as magnification and detector size. The filter values for STm and <italic>Tg</italic> were empirically determined using thousands of images from different experiments. Based on which pathogen type is chosen by the user, HRMAn will adjust the filters automatically. Using labelling arithmetic, pathogen labels that are not contained within a cell label are removed from the dataset, as they represent extracellular pathogens. The created labels can then be inspected by the user through an interactive label viewer displaying the original image next to the labels.</p><p>Using the created labels, the infection readouts for stage 1 are created: First, cell numbers N<sub>Cells</sub> and vacuole numbers N<sub>Vacuoles</sub> are determined by counting the numbers of respective labels in all acquired fields per well (=replicate).

concludes stage 1 infection analysis performed by HRMAn. In the end of the analysis, the values calculated for each well or replicate is combined with the values for the other wells belonging to the same sample group based on the user-provided plate map and error calculation is performed. If the user decides to perform only stage 1 infection analysis the HRMAn image analysis pipeline will stop here, if host protein recruitment analysis is to be performed the data will be fed into the second stage for which the implemented deep Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) has to be created and trained first.</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>Deep learning setup and neural network architecture</title><p>To classify pathogen recruitment, we employed a deep Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) HRMAlexNet (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>) inspired by published AlexNet (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Krizhevsky et al., 2012</xref>). Our architecture consisted of a total of 5 convolutional layers, where the first two were immediately followed by local response normalization layers and max pooling layers. The last three convolutional layers were followed by one max pooling layer connected to a fully connected layer. All these layers used rectified linear unit (ReLU) as activation function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Nair and Hinton, 2010</xref>). To ensure our neural network can be implemented by other researchers with no coding, it was based on the open source DeepLearning4J library implementation in KNIME Analytics Platform. Changes to the original AlexNet architecture were partially introduced by the KNIME AG team and partially by us in the process of optimizing the architecture to the fluorescence microscopy data. Here further improvements in architectures may be made through recently introduced KNIME-Keras integration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chollet, 2015</xref>).</p><p>While having the same number of convolutional layers as AlexNet, as introduced by the KNIME team, their dimensions are different. HRMAlexNet has two fully connected layers instead of three, which pushes the fitting burden more to the convolutional layers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>).</p><p>We have changed the input layer dimensions to fit the multichannel fluorescence microscopy data, since our input two channels, rather than the standard RGB dimension of three. Hence, unlike the original AlexNet, HRMAlexNet was suited to take 100 by 100 by two pixels images as input and designed to run on a single graphic processing unit (GPU).</p><p>Furthermore, we have modified the SoftMax (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bishop, 2006</xref>) output layer of the architecture to fit our dataset and classification problem. While optimizing the network’s hyperparameters, we found that learning rate updating algorithm proposed by default in the KNIME architecture, as well as in Krizhevsky et al. - Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) with Nesterov momentum - was failing to converge on our fluorescence microscopy data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Krizhevsky et al., 2012</xref>). Therefore, we have substituted this algorithm for the more advanced learning rate update algorithm ADAM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Kingma and Ba, 2014</xref>) with both mean and Variance decay parameters, which proved to converge well on various data and initial learning rate ranges.</p><p>The choice of DeepLearning4J as a deep learning library allowed us to use 16-bit microscopy images directly, preventing information loss upon conversion of scientific imaging data. Our deep learning hardware was based on a single Nvidia 1080 Ti GPU set up in Intel Core i7 4790K system equipped with 32 Gb of RAM and a SSD.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Neural network training and hyperparameters optimization</title><p>Our neural networks were trained using SGD based backpropagation (using ADAM updater with ADAM Mean Decay of 0.9 and ADAM Variance Decay of 0.999 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Kingma and Ba, 2014</xref>)) on the augmented original data over at least 80 epochs. To fully utilize the GPU capacity, training was performed in mini-batches of 200. We employed the Xavier algorithm for the weight initialization strategy and negative log likelihood (NLL) as our loss function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Kingma and Ba, 2014</xref>). We used learning rates between 0.001 and 0.01 adjusted accordingly to ensure the optimal loss curve decay during training. Together with the weights initialization strategy and the updater choice these were the main hyperparameters optimized in multiple iterations to ensure good training process.</p><p>To visualize the attention of the trained HRMAlexNet, we have created a class activation map (CAM) based on a test image from ‘recruitment’ class (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). Since HRMAlexNet architecture does not have a Global Average Pooling layer to visualize the CAM we have used the occlusion technique (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Zeiler and Fergus, 2013</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Data preparation, Augmentation and Model Validation</title><p>Vacuole images used for creation of our deep learning model were segmented from large field of view micrographs obtained from high-content imaging. To ensure the dimension of the images are uniform, we padded all vacuole with zero-value padding to a uniform 100 by 100 pixels size. Next, we manually labelled the segmented vacuoles into recruited, non-recruited and artefactual (in case of erroneous segmentation of the vacuole). This labelled dataset was then split into the training and test datasets.</p><p>To ensure our neural network has sufficiently diverse learning data, upon splitting the original labelled dataset into training and test subsets we performed data augmentation using a custom developed macro for ImageJ. During the augmentation processing, the original labelled dataset was concatenated with a modified version of it. The modifications included various rotations, image reflecting, image translation within the field of view. As microscopy data are typically rotation-, translation- or reflection-invariant, such modification allowed us to create a better dataset aiming at a more generalized model.</p><p>Model validation was performed using the non-augmented test fraction of the labelled dataset previously unseen by the model. For this, we used the trained model as first input and passed the labelled test data through the classifier in the second input. The classification accuracy was assessed by accuracy score, numbers of true positive, false positive, true negative and false negative, as well as Cohen’s kappa values. A direct summary of the accuracy was visualized in a confusion matrix illustrating a mismatch between original label (Ground Truth) and the class assigned by the classifier (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Host protein recruitment analysis in HRMAn</title><p>For recruitment analysis, the vacuole labels created in stage 1 of the analysis are dilated over 20 iterations to create non-overlapping regions of interest (ROIs) around them. Simultaneously, the fluorescence images of the pathogen and the respective channel with fluorescence signal of the host protein are merged into a dual channel image. The created ROIs are used to crop the dual channel images, which creates images of the pathogen and its surrounding stained host protein. The images are clipped to 100 by 100 pixel and fed into a feedforward predictor (classification) which uses the provided and trained deep convolution neural network (CNN) to classify the pathogens vacuoles based on their coating.</p><p>Once the vacuoles are separated into two groups, they are analyzed with the above described methods of stage one infection analysis but additionally comparing recruited versus non-recruited vacuoles. Thus, in addition to the overall infection parameters from stage one the user is provided with the same parameters but further layered for the cellular response.</p><p>In the case of co-recruitment analysis, two images of each vacuole are created with both containing the pathogen signal, but each containing a different second channel, representing the different stainings. After classification with the CNN, the vacuoles can be compared for recruitment or co-recruitment and all the above described parameters are calculated for them individually. Using the previously determined label dependencies of vacuoles V<sub>i</sub> and cells C<sub>i</sub> and the classification of the vacuoles V<sub>i</sub> by the CNN, HRMAn can furthermore calculate the proportion of cells that do respond to infection by decorating at least one vacuole and the proportion of vacuoles decorated per cell, if a single cell contains more than one pathogen vacuole.</p><p>Furthermore, working only on the decorated vacuoles, we used a custom-made Fiji code to create a pixel-wise radial intensity profile starting from the pathogen centroid. The distance of the maximum fluorescence intensity is then used to define the distance of the coat from the pathogen centre. Moreover, the mean fluorescence intensity of the coat is determined and can be used as a readout for the amount of protein recruited to each pathogen vacuole.</p><p>Finally, all mean values and errors for the replicate conditions, as defined by the user’s plate map, are calculated and written into a single spreadsheet file. Before this, the user can also define a scaling factor between pixel and actual metric values which will adjust the output values from pixel (px) to μm or to μm<sup>2</sup> respectively.</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>Cell culture and cell lines</title><p>THP-1 (TIB202, ATCC; RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/CVCL_0006">CVCL_0006</ext-link>) were maintained in RPMI with GlutaMAX (Gibco) supplemented with 10% FBS (Sigma), at 37 ˚C in 5% CO<sub>2</sub>.

Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, including Markus Meissner as the guest Reviewing Editor and Reviewer #1, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Detlef Weigel as the Senior Editor.</p><p>The Reviewing Editor has highlighted the concerns that require revision and/or responses, and we have included the separate reviews below for your consideration. If you have any questions, please do not hesitate to contact us.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>In their report Fisch et al., develop an open-source imaging platform (HRMAn) that integrates machine learning and deep learning, in order to analyse of multiple phenotypes related to host-pathogen interactions. The platform is openly available via KNIME Workflows, which will allow others to benefit the presented pipeline. The analysis follows basic principles, established by similar HCI platforms, involving illumination correction, followed by segmentation and infection detection (Stage 1). This is followed by an analysis of host protein recruitment, by detection of p62 at the parasitophorous vacuole. The authors also demonstrate that the analysis pipeline can be easily adjusted to other intracellular pathogens, such as <italic>Salmonella</italic> typhimurium.</p><p>Major concerns:</p><p>The reviewers raised some concerns regarding the technical novelty of this analysis pipeline. In particular analysis performed in Stage 1 is quite standard and follows similar methods as described before (see for example Touquet et al., 2018). The analysis in Stage 2, although well performed, does not represent a major methodogical advance in the field of machine learning.</p><p>Although the authors present some applications of this analysis pipeline, it would be advisable to provide additional data, demonstrating that HRMAn can detect additional, previously established phenotypes, such as those for ROP18 or ROP5.</p><p>Another application could be to probe for protein export from the parasite to the host cell, since this would broaden the analysis to detect additional host-pathogen interactions.</p><p>Given that HRMAn only provides a modest improvement over existing software, primarily in the user interphase, it would be appropriate to more extensively test its function in more authentic experimental settings (see also comments of reviewer 3).</p><p>The authors should also provide examples, why their analysis platform is superior. The authors acknowledge the existence of many other tools for high throughput analysis, but little to no discussion of similarities or difference to these tools is given.</p><p>While all reviewers agree that the experiments have been carefully performed, there is some scepticism regarding the novelty as a method (Reviewer 2) and the breadth of applications this tool will be used for in the field (Reviewer 1 and 3). As it stands, this tool appears to be optimised for the primary research interest of the authors, where it will certainly be very useful. However, it is unclear if other researchers in the field will recognise the advantage of HRMAn over existing HCI platforms (Reviewer 1 and 3).</p><p>Separate reviews (please respond to each point):</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic> </p><p>Summary:</p><p>In their report Fisch et al., describe the establishment of a novel, open source programme for High Content Imaging (HCI). The major advantage of this system is the integration of machine learning, making it probably more adaptable to the analysis of different phenotypes related to host-pathogen interactions. The data and analysis appear to be of the highest quality and there is little doubt that HRMAn is a robust new tool to automatically detect phenotypes, which will be a valuable source for HCI. Especially since it is now possible to perform genome wide screens in <italic>Toxoplasma gondii</italic>, this pipeline comes in very handy for some researchers in order to perform phenotypic, image based screens on this parasite. The authors also demonstrate that the pipeline can be easily adapted to other pathogens, using <italic>Salmonella</italic> as a proof of principle.</p><p>Own opinion:</p><p>The described technology will be very useful for researchers planning to perform image based screens on host-pathogen interactions or on intracellular pathogens in general. Therefore, this study will be certainly of interest for a broad readership.</p><p>On the downside, it is a technological advance without novel biological insight. As the authors mention, there are many open source platforms available (not to mention commercial software) that allow HCI analysis of parasite growth, invasion, etc. (CellProfiler, CellClassifier, Fijii, etc.). A recent publication used a relatively simple HCI analysis to perform chemical screens in Toxoplsma gondii (see Touquet et al., 2018), which is certainly inferior to the platform presented in this study.</p><p>I am a bit unsure, how and why the provided pipeline is superior to other pipelines. At least the basic principles of HCI analysis appear similar:</p><p>– Pre-processing for illumination correction</p><p>– Segmentation (in this case host cell vs parasites)</p><p>– Analysis of pre-defined features (i.e. size of parasitophorous vacuoles, host cell nuclei, etc.)</p><p>As such I am not fully convinced if the platform is indeed superior to other imaging analysis software. For example in our lab we used Cell Profiler, which allows us to determine invasion rate, parasite growth rate, host cell number, etc. The authors should provide some examples or an in depth discussion regarding the advantages of their pipeline, when compared to other</p><p>Saying that, the described image analysis pipeline is very well designed and if widely used in the field will allow to analyse quantitative phenotypic data that are comparable in between different laboratories.</p><p>The manuscript is well written and the techniques used are of the highest quality. The presented data are very solid, demonstrating that this analysis pipeline is very accurate. Unfortunately I cannot comment on machine learning, since this is outside my area of expertise.</p><p>At this point the analysis pipeline is well suited for the analysis of host-pathogen interactions, in particular the characterisation of host-protein recruitment to the PV, a key interest of the Frickel lab and this aspect is of somewhat narrow interest.</p><p>It would be good to summarise in an additional figure, which phenotypes this imaging platform can differentiate.</p><p>For example, instead of host protein recruitment, it would be of great interest to also analyse parasite protein export into the host cell. Parasite lines expressing for example dense granule proteins are well described in the literature and it should be straight forward to add this parameter to the analysis pipeline.</p><p>In summary, it is a well described analysis pipeline for HCI that might find broad applications, especially now, that genome wide screens can be performed using CRISPR/cas9.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic> </p><p>The proposed analysis will be made openly available via KNIME Workflows. This is certainly a plus since it will allow others to benefit from the presented analysis pipeline. Additionally, KNIME is easy to install, with a bit of practice very intuitive, and could on demand also be used to change/extend the workflow.</p><p>The overall analysis pipeline can be divided in 3 steps. An illumination correction step followed by a segmentation and infection detection step (named 'Stage 1'), followed up by an analysis of host protein recruitment ('Stage 2').</p><p>The analysis in 'Stage 1' is not bearing surprises or any methodic novelty. The proposed pipeline, a combination of default analysis components, solves the task at hand as long as the provided images (after illumination correction) can be segmented via a simple threshold. The merit of 'Stage 1', as mentioned above, is clearly not any methodological advance or interesting combination of existing methods. It is, never the less, sensible engineering work and might very well help others that desire to perform the same analysis.</p><p>In case a host protein recruitment analysis is desired, a 'Stage 2' workflow is proposed. Besides a decision tree that is used in Stage 1, this is the only place where any machine learning technique is applied. More specifically, a variant of the well known AlexNet is used to learn to classify protein recruitment. The relatively shallow network architecture and all parameter and training decisions are sensible set to values used in many neural network applications. While, as before, nothing here is even close to being a methodological advance in the field of machine learning, all decisions seem well thought trough and I have no problems believing that final classification results are good.</p><p>It might be desirable to compare the proposed analyses system (or its components) to other existing systems or modules. (The authors acknowledges the existence of many other tools for high throughput analysis, see Supplementary file 1, but little to no discussion of similarities or difference to these tools is given.)</p><p>The impact of this work will depend on the presented data and the utility of the proposed analysis pipeline (which is/will be openly available). I am, unfortunately, not the right person to judge how many research project are currently just waiting to use an analysis pipeline as the one presented in this manuscript.</p><p>I would like to end my review by stating my biggest concern. After reading the title and Abstract of this manuscript, I expected the presented work to be significantly more involved. It turns out that the presented workflow uses one decision tree in Stage 1 and an 'off the shelve' AlexNet in the optional Stage 2. I would advice the authors to tone down the paper pitch in this regard.</p><p>In summary, I do not believe that the presented manuscript contains enough methodological advances to justify publication of the method alone. If the presented data and performed analyses justifies publication will have to be judged by a person in the field of image-based infection biology.</p><p>Minor Comments:</p><p>The last sentence in the Abstract makes a bold statement about 'operating at human capability'. This was in my point of view not shown in the manuscript and therefore ends up being a bold claim lacking justification.</p><p>While I could follow all explanations about network training, some formulations could benefit from feedback by a person with publishing experience in the field of machine learning.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic> </p><p>The authors develop an open-source image analysis platform named HRMAn that relies on machine learning algorithms and deep learning. Given input images, the platform characterizes phenotypes such as parasites/vacuole, vacuole size, and host-protein recruitment. The platform is also high-throughput, allowing for the bulk submission of many images simultaneously. To validate the platform, the authors trained the algorithm with an annotated dataset of host cells infected by eGFP-expressing <italic>Toxoplasma gondii</italic> parasites. Using this training dataset, the authors quantified differences in parasite killing/growth restriction strategies across host cell lines and between Type I and Type II Toxoplasma lines. The authors also validated the algorithm's ability to quantify levels of ubiquitin and p62 recruitment to the PVM. Finally, the authors retrained the algorithm using an annotated dataset of <italic>Salmonella</italic> typhimurium, demonstrating the ability of HRMAn to recognize and quantify a diversity of pathogens.</p><p>HRMAn provides a high-throughput and effective strategy for analyzing phenotypes by microscopy. The platform removes the human component of analysis and bulk-input allows for the rapid analysis of thousands of cells. The interface is remarkably easy to set-up and navigate, particularly alongside the available tutorials. The demonstration of success with two pathogens of drastically different size, <italic>Toxoplasma gondii</italic> and <italic>Salmonella</italic> typhimurium, suggests that this could be a valuable tool for a wide array of microbes. While the recruitment of host-proteins to the PVM is a potentially powerful tool, it is currently limited to binary processes (presence or absence of ubiquitin/p62). As shown, it is unclear if HRMAn can detect more subtle, non-binary phenotypes, such as recruitment of mitochondria. The authors demonstrate the ability of HRMAn to quantify differences in ubiquitin and p62 recruitment between both different host cell and different parasite lines upon IFNγ-priming. It would be desirable to demonstrate HRMAn's ability to detect previously established phenotypes, such as those of ROP18 or ROP5. This will more strongly validate HRMAn's potential ability to detect novel phenotypes. Given that HRMAn only provides a modest improvement over existing software, primarily in the user interphase, it would be appropriate to more extensively test its function in more authentic experimental settings.</p><p>Major concerns:</p><p>a) Since there are many differences between Type I and Type II parasites (including growth rate and viability, which could affect the recruitment measurements), it would be appropriate for the authors to look at isogenic lines that differ only in a particular effector. The authors could test HRMAn's ability to detect previously known phenotypes, such as the increase in GBP recruitment in a ROP18 knockout.</p><p>b) It is unclear why the authors, when classifying parasites/vacuole, bin the vacuoles by 1, 2, 4, and greater than 4. The authors should provide rationale, technical or otherwise, for binning all vacuoles &gt;4 together, since some phenotypes might emerge only later during intracellular growth.</p><p>c) In Figure 2C, the example picture for &gt;4/vac appears to be a picture of a vacuole containing 4 parasites. This should be corrected.</p><p>d) It is important that the training dataset used for the manuscript be released in its entirety to ensure that readers can replicate the results of the paper and account for any differences between lab-specific assignments and HRMAn.</p><p>Minor concerns:</p><p>a) The authors often use the phrase &quot;cell&quot; ambiguously and it is unclear if they are referring to host cells or parasite cells. The authors should take care to reduce ambiguity by more clearly stating which cells they are referring to.</p><p>b) In Figure 2E, the heat map of the confusion matrix is difficult to accurately assess due to the similarity between many values. Number values should be provided as well, or in place of the matrix.</p><p>c) In Figure 2—figure supplement 1A, images displaying separation of the channels should be provided. As such, it is difficult to evaluate the presence of GRA2. The current image does not seem to accurately represent the 98% prevalence of GRA2+ vacuoles. By separating the image channels this should be more apparent.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.40560.021</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Major concerns:</p><p>The reviewers raised some concerns regarding the technical novelty of this analysis pipeline. In particular analysis performed in Stage 1 is quite standard and follows similar methods as described before (see for example Touquet et al., 2018).</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you very much for your comments and your in-depth review of our manuscript. We agree that stage 1 of the analysis uses well-established image analysis methods. Stage 1 of the image analysis is a necessity for stage 2, hence, it is presented in the manuscript. It is an easy-to-use image analysis pipeline useful for host-pathogen researchers wanting to screen larger imaging datasets, e.g. siRNA or CRISPR screens. We therefore offer the option of just running this part of the analysis for the users’ convenience.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The analysis in Stage 2, although well performed, does not represent a major methodogical advance in the field of machine learning.</p></disp-quote><p>Yes, that is correct, stage 2 of HRMAn does not offer a stand-alone major methodological advance in the field of machine learning. The goal of stage 2 HRMAn is to make accessible and tailor a neural network-driven analysis to the researcher to define host-pathogen interaction in an unbiased, highly reproducible, sound and robust fashion. A neural network-driven pipeline is the only way to do this in an automated fashion and this approach has not been employed for the large field of host-pathogen interaction before.</p><p>Having said that, the deep neural network used in this work is based on a published AlexNet architecture, yet we have changed and adopted it for the problem setting (see Figure 1). More precisely, we have added a detailed description of the derivation of HRMAlexNet in the Materials and methods section under “Deep Learning Setup and Neural Network Architecture”. Instead of optimising our architecture using off-theshelf open datasets we worked with real world data. Hence both problem and solution presented are novel. The adaptation of the network and integration into a user-friendly program makes it suitable for non-specialists and the wider research community. This was the main objective from the outset of this work – rather than advance AI, we wanted to tailor it to host-pathogen questions and make it available to biologists.</p><p>We understand however, how semantics could potentially lead to confusion within the field of machine learning. To denote that we indeed have tailored a neural network approach to a problem rather than newly developed from scratch a neural network-driven solution, we have changed the title to: “Defining Host-Pathogen Interactions Employing an Artificial Intelligence Workflow”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Although the authors present some applications of this analysis pipeline, it would be advisable to provide additional data, demonstrating that HRMAn can detect additional, previously established phenotypes, such as those for ROP18 or ROP5.</p></disp-quote><p>We have added additional data to illustrate that HRMAn can indeed detect previously established phenotypes. As suggested by the reviewer, we specifically addressed the role of <italic>Tg</italic> virulence proteins within murine host defence. We repeated an experiment from Virreira Winter et al., 2011 demonstrating the influence of polymorphic, secreted <italic>Tg</italic> effector proteins ROP16, ROP18 and GRA15 on the recruitment of mGbps to the <italic>Tg</italic> vacuole. We obtained comparable results as previously published and extended the previously published results to two additional mGbps using unbiased HRMAn analysis. This data is now presented in Figure 5A.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Another application could be to probe for protein export from the parasite to the host cell, since this would broaden the analysis to detect additional host-pathogen interactions.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewers for this point and agree this would nicely expand our analysis pipeline to include parasite-derived factors. In the previously submitted version our work exclusively looked at the host cell response. We therefore performed an analysis of <italic>Tg</italic> effector protein secretion and translocation to the nucleus. To do so, we infected HFF cells using type I <italic>Tg</italic> (RH) that express HA-tagged GRA16, GRA24 and type II <italic>Tg</italic> (Pru) that express HA-tagged <italic>Tg</italic>IST. Using HRMAn, we readily determined the intracellular distribution of the effector proteins and studied the relationship between uninfected and infected cells. Furthermore, HRMAn correlated the amount of effector protein fluorescence signal to the number of parasites in the cell. This data is now presented in Figure 5B.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Given that HRMAn only provides a modest improvement over existing software, primarily in the user interphase, it would be appropriate to more extensively test its function in more authentic experimental settings (see also comments of reviewer 3).</p></disp-quote><p>Here we beg to differ with the reviewers. Yes, HRMAn does not develop novel machine learning algorithms. However, it presents a beyond state-of-the-art image analysis pipeline for host-pathogen interaction. HRMAn, for the first time, brings AI to image analysis of host-pathogen interaction and does so in a user-friendly interface making it accessible to researchers without the ability to code. This is a major advance and advantage over currently available programs.</p><p>However, we do agree with the reviewers that to further test HRMAn’s function in what reviewer 3 calls more authentic experimental settings is of benefit for the manuscript and the use of the program. We therefore added additional sets of analysis as described above (Figure 5A and 5B) specifically comparing isogenic <italic>Toxoplasma</italic> strains and we have added a murine cell line to the analysis. Collectively the analysis presented now encompasses a total of nine <italic>Tg</italic> strains, <italic>Salmonella enterica</italic> Typhimurium and 6 different cell lines from two species.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The authors should also provide examples, why their analysis platform is superior. The authors acknowledge the existence of many other tools for high throughput analysis, but little to no discussion of similarities or difference to these tools is given.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewers. To complement Supplementary file 1, we have added further descriptions of these programs in the Introduction. We have also added a comparison of our analysis platform versus what is currently available in the Introduction: “Solutions existing to date can largely be split into two major categories: user-friendly turn-key GUI (TK-GUI)-based solutions and scripts ensembles (SE) solutions. Due to the large support burden of the TK-GUI, these programs generally lack the implementations of the latest engineering advances.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>While all reviewers agree that the experiments have been carefully performed, there is some scepticism regarding the novelty as a method (Reviewer 2) and the breadth of applications this tool will be used for in the field (Reviewer 1 and 3). As it stands, this tool appears to be optimised for the primary research interest of the authors, where it will certainly be very useful. However, it is unclear if other researchers in the field will recognise the advantage of HRMAn over existing HCI platforms (Reviewer 1 and 3).</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewers for their careful assessments. We think we have addressed the comments on the novelty of the method, as well as expanded its breadth of applications (see all points above). Given that HRMAn is the only program that provides the capability of analysing protein targeting by neural networks it is more sophisticated than existing image analysis solutions. In support of its more than 1,200 views and 360 full pdf downloads on BioRxiv in 8 weeks (22.11.2018), suggests that HRMAn is already being employed by the field. In addition, besides <italic>Toxoplasma</italic> and <italic>Salmonella</italic>, we are already expanding HRMAn for analysis of other pathogens, including <italic>Chlamydia</italic> and <italic>Cryptococcus</italic> in collaboration with other labs interested in using HRMAn for their experiments.</p><p>We would like to take the opportunity here to underscore that host protein recruitment to pathogens is an expanding field. While the reviewers did not comment on the fact that HRMAn can be employed for analysis of <italic>Salmonella</italic>, the anti-<italic>Salmonella</italic> immunity field is largely focused on vacuole recruitment and marking of cytosolic bacteria. Being able to recognise two pathogens with a magnitude of difference in size points to the fact that HRMAn can be adapted to an ever expanding range of pathogens, making it an attractive and important advance for the host-pathogen community at large.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Separate reviews (please respond to each point):</p></disp-quote><p>Reviewer #1:</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>[…] Own opinion:</p><p>The described technology will be very useful for researchers planning to perform image based screens on host-pathogen interactions or on intracellular pathogens in general. Therefore, this study will be certainly of interest for a broad readership.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for their assessment and concur that HRMAn is useful for both <italic>Toxoplasma</italic> and <italic>Salmonella</italic> researchers.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>On the downside, it is a technological advance without novel biological insight.</p></disp-quote><p>The focus of our manuscript was placed on the development and optimization of HRMAn as an image analysis pipeline. Having said that, there is in fact novel biological insight in this study. This is the first time 5 different human cell lines have been tested side-by-side for their response to <italic>Toxoplasma</italic>, and titrated for the IFNgdependent anti-<italic>Toxoplasma</italic> response. This data alone is of great use to the <italic>Toxoplasma</italic> immunity field as we demonstrate that various cell lines require different levels of IFNγ to mount an efficient anti-<italic>Toxoplasma</italic> response.</p><p>Further, by carefully assessing a larger dataset of ubiquitin recruitment to cytosolic <italic>Salmonella</italic> in HeLa cells than has ever been analysed before, we find that HeLa cells seem to have reached their capacity of clearing <italic>Salmonella</italic> by ubiquitination and subsequent autophagy, independent of IFNγ treatment. This is a finding that has been missed by other publications before, due to insufficient numbers of bacteria manually counted.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>As the authors mention, there are many open source platforms available (not to mention commercial software) that allow HCI analysis of parasite growth, invasion, etc. (CellProfiler, CellClassifier, Fijii, etc.). A recent publication used a relatively simple HCI analysis to perform chemical screens in Toxoplsma gondii (see Touquet et al., 2018), which is certainly inferior to the platform presented in this study.</p><p>I am a bit unsure, how and why the provided pipeline is superior to other pipelines. At least the basic principles of HCI analysis appear similar:</p><p>– Pre-processing for illumination correction</p><p>– Segmentation (in this case host cell vs parasites)</p><p>– Analysis of pre-defined features (i.e. size of parasitophorous vacuoles, host cell nuclei, etc.)</p><p>As such I am not fully convinced if the platform is indeed superior to other imaging analysis software. For example in our lab we used Cell Profiler, which allows us to determine invasion rate, parasite growth rate, host cell number, etc. The authors should provide some examples or an in depth discussion regarding the advantages of their pipeline, when compared to other</p></disp-quote><p>As detailed above, stage 1 uses well-established image analysis methods. As it is a necessity for stage 2, it is presented in the manuscript. For simpler experiments it is an easy-to-use tool useful for host-pathogen researchers screening larger imaging datasets, e.g. siRNA or CRISPR screens. We therefore offer the option of running this part of the analysis for the users’ convenience.</p><p>Stage 2 of the analysis pipeline – the stage that assesses the host-parasite interaction dimension – is the innovation of HRMAn. Rather than simple pixel enumeration, stage 2 employs a deep learning neural network to assess host protein recruitment to the pathogen. This is currently not achievable by any image analysis program available, neither commercial nor open-source.</p><p>As said above, we agree with the reviewer and to complement Supplementary file 1, we have added further descriptions of these programs in the Introduction. We have also added a comparison of our analysis platform versus what is currently available in the Introduction: “Solutions existing to date can largely be split into two major categories: user-friendly turn-key GUI (TK-GUI)-based solutions and scripts ensembles (SE) solutions. Due to the large support burden of the TK-GUI, these programs generally lack the implementations of the latest engineering advances.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Saying that, the described image analysis pipeline is very well designed and if widely used in the field will allow to analyse quantitative phenotypic data that are comparable in between different laboratories.</p><p>The manuscript is well written and the techniques used are of the highest quality. The presented data are very solid, demonstrating that this analysis pipeline is very accurate. Unfortunately I cannot comment on machine learning, since this is outside my area of expertise.</p><p>At this point the analysis pipeline is well suited for the analysis of host-pathogen interactions, in particular the characterisation of host-protein recruitment to the PV, a key interest of the Frickel lab and this aspect is of somewhat narrow interest.</p><p>It would be good to summarise in an additional figure, which phenotypes this imaging platform can differentiate.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for your comment and thought. In fact, all readouts that HRMAn produces during the image analysis are already summarised in Figure 1.</p><p>We have added another figure of additional data showing how HRMAn can easily be used to study pathogen biology as well (Figure 5). The new experiments for this figure are described above. Many of the readouts that HRMAn calculates can be used for both parameters of an infection, e.g. the readout of recruitment of host proteins to the vacuole can equally be used to study display or absence of pathogen proteins at the vacuole. This only requires different staining of the microscopy samples. The same can be said about the replication and growth characterisation of pathogens. The measurements performed by HRMAn could be used to study the effect of pathogen gene knockouts or protein depletion that result in growth phenotypes.</p><p>We want to bring to the reviewer’s attention, as detailed above, that HRMAn not only works for analysis of <italic>Toxoplasma</italic> infection, but also <italic>Salmonella</italic>. Cumulatively, these two fields account for a large community of researchers that share an interest in host defence to pathogens. As we demonstrate the versatility of HRMAn in this manuscript by choosing two pathogens of very different size, it is easy to envision that HRMAn will be adaptable to other pathogens in the future.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>For example, instead of host protein recruitment, it would be of great interest to also analyse parasite protein export into the host cell. Parasite lines expressing for example dense granule proteins are well described in the literature and it should be straight forward to add this parameter to the analysis pipeline.</p></disp-quote><p>As detailed above, we now demonstrate that HRMAn can analyse the localisation of <italic>Toxoplasma</italic> proteins in host cells including GRA16, GRA24 and <italic>Tg</italic>IST. This is now included as Figure 5A.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In summary, it is a well described analysis pipeline for HCI that might find broad applications, especially now, that genome wide screens can be performed using CRISPR/cas9.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for his assessment.</p><p>Reviewer #2:</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The proposed analysis will be made openly available via KNIME Workflows. This is certainly a plus since it will allow others to benefit from the presented analysis pipeline. Additionally, KNIME is easy to install, with a bit of practice very intuitive, and could on demand also be used to change/extend the workflow.</p><p>The overall analysis pipeline can be divided in 3 steps. An illumination correction step followed by a segmentation and infection detection step (named 'Stage 1'), followed up by an analysis of host protein recruitment ('Stage 2').</p><p>The analysis in 'Stage 1' is not bearing surprises or any methodic novelty. The proposed pipeline, a combination of default analysis components, solves the task at hand as long as the provided images (after illumination correction) can be segmented via a simple threshold. The merit of 'Stage 1', as mentioned above, is clearly not any methodological advance or interesting combination of existing methods. It is, never the less, sensible engineering work and might very well help others that desire to perform the same analysis.</p></disp-quote><p>As mentioned above, stage 1 of the analysis uses well-established image analysis methods and was not touted as novel methodology. Stage 1 is essential for stage 2, with the advantage that it provides an easy-to-use, robust tool for screening large imaging datasets.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In case a host protein recruitment analysis is desired, a 'Stage 2' workflow is proposed. Besides a decision tree that is used in Stage 1, this is the only place where any machine learning technique is applied. More specifically, a variant of the well known AlexNet is used to learn to classify protein recruitment. The relatively shallow network architecture and all parameter and training decisions are sensible set to values used in many neural network applications. While, as before, nothing here is even close to being a methodological advance in the field of machine learning, all decisions seem well thought trough and I have no problems believing that final classification results are good.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for your comment. We would like to emphasise that HRMAn has been designed for biologist. As such, we decided to keep the machine learning algorithms as simple as possible, to save on computing resources and to prevent overcomplicating the analysis and its set-up. As shown for the decision tree classifier, we tested different commonly used algorithms and settings and chose the simplest and most robust option.</p><p>It is worth mentioning, that the neural network architecture presented in the current manuscript is different from the original AlexNet and adopted for the problem setting (see Figure 1). While having the same number of convolutional layers, their dimensions are different. Furthermore, unlike the network presented by Krizhevsky et al., it is not parallelised in two streams aimed for two GPUs. Instead the optimisation of our network runs on a single GPU making it more accessible for the end user (setups with dual GPUs are quite rare and difficult to operate in biological labs). It mimics the AlexNet in an effort to minimize the number of hyperparameters to optimize. Given the number of hyperparameter changes it is a new architecture. Provided the fact that the network has been optimized on the real-world data, rather than publicly available datasets, proved to be solvable, alighting as close as possible to a known solution is dictated by the good engineering practice. Nonetheless beyond architectural novelty, HRMAn is a framework allowing for swappable architectural solutions. It supports state-of-the-art libraries like DL4J. Keras is upcoming, which will allow rapid adoption of most advance algorithms on the realworld data.</p><p>We have now detailed the exact modifications we performed to create HRMAlexNet – the neural network architecture of HRMAn in the Materials and methods section under the points “Deep Learning Setup and Neural Network Architecture” and “Neural Network Training and Hyperparameters Optimization”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>It might be desirable to compare the proposed analyses system (or its components) to other existing systems or modules.

HRMAn is currently being used and further developed in 7 labs, that we know of, prior to official publication (22.11.18).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>I would like to end my review by stating my biggest concern. After reading the title and Abstract of this manuscript, I expected the presented work to be significantly more involved. It turns out that the presented workflow uses one decision tree in Stage 1 and an 'off the shelve' AlexNet in the optional Stage 2. I would advice the authors to tone down the paper pitch in this regard.</p></disp-quote><p>As pointed out above, to not mislead the reader, we have re-titled our manuscript “Defining Host-Pathogen Interactions Employing an Artificial Intelligence Workflow”.</p><p>We would like to point out that beyond designing HRMAlexNet, as mentioned above we have presented a novel methodology of visualization of the phenotypic attention of the trained neural network. Through class-activation map generation (occlusion map method) we show the fraction of the pathogen micrograph important for evaluation of the host-pathogen interaction (Figure 2). In our opinion, this pushes the boundary of the conventional machine learning toward artificial intelligence-based analysis. Unbiased attention visualization allows us to leverage on the unsupervised component of the HRMAlexNet responsible for learning from the presented data to promote data-driven discovery. We have now amended the text to point out these advances/differences.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In summary, I do not believe that the presented manuscript contains enough methodological advances to justify publication of the method alone.
