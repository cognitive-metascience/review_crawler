to establishing their systematic position, ecological role and evolutionary trends. The lack of internal characters and soft-tissue preservation in many arthropod fossils, however, impedes comprehensive phylogenetic analyses and species descriptions according to taxonomic standards for Recent organisms. We found well-preserved three-dimensional anatomy in mineralized arthropods from Paleogene fissure fillings and demonstrate the value of these fossils by utilizing digitally reconstructed anatomical structure of a hister beetle. The new anatomical data facilitate a refinement of the species diagnosis and allowed us to reject a previous hypothesis of close phylogenetic relationship to an extant congeneric species. Our findings suggest that mineralized fossils, even those of macroscopically poor preservation, constitute a rich but yet largely unexploited source of anatomical data for fossil arthropods.</p> <p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.12129.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.12129.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.12129.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Fossils are the preserved remains of animals, plants or other organisms. The most highly prized fossils are those that retain their original three-dimensional shape and provide details needed to identify what species it represents, and what its closest living relatives might be. However, even fossils with the most beautifully preserved external anatomy can lack the internal structures that also help to identify its evolutionary history. “Mineralized” fossils are particularly useful for researchers as they form in a process that helps to preserve the internal anatomy of the organism. This type of fossil forms when mineral-laden water surrounds an organism’s body so that the minerals are deposited in its cells and turn soft tissues to stone.</p> <p>In the 1940s, Swiss scientist Eduard Handschin used eight mineralized fossil specimens to describe a 25-40 million-year-old beetle species called <italic>Onthophilus intermedius</italic>. On the basis of the external anatomy of the two best-preserved specimens, Handschin claimed this species was distinct from, but closely related to a beetle species called <italic>O. striatus</italic> that is found in Europe today.</p> <p>Since then, fossil examination methods have greatly advanced and include three-dimensional X-ray based imaging techniques that reveal the internal structures of a fossil while leaving it intact. One such technique is called X-ray computed tomography, in which numerous X-ray images of a solid object are taken from different angles. These images are then reassembled using computer software to create a virtual three-dimensional model of the object.</p> <p>Here, Schwermann et al. used this X-ray technique to re-examine the beetle fossils originally reported by Handschin. This analysis revealed many new details of these specimens’ external and internal anatomies, including their gut, genitals and airways. These new insights place <italic>Onthophilus intermedius</italic> into a different evolutionary lineage to <italic>O. striatus</italic>. They also suggest that mineralized fossils could provide a rich source of data for studies on fossil insects and other arthropods, even if they appear to be poorly preserved on the outside.</p> <p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.12129.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.12129.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>fissure fillings</kwd><kwd>Paleogene</kwd><kwd>Histeridae</kwd><kwd>X-ray imaging</kwd><kwd>internal characters</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd>Onthophilus spp. (Coleopera: Histeridae)</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100002347</institution-id><institution>Bundesministerium für Bildung und Forschung</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>05K10CKB</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>dos Santos Rolo</surname><given-names>Tomy</given-names></name><name><surname>van de Kamp</surname><given-names>Thomas</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100002347</institution-id><institution>Bundesministerium für Bildung und Forschung</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>05K12CK2</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>dos Santos Rolo</surname><given-names>Tomy</given-names></name><name><surname>van de Kamp</surname><given-names>Thomas</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>X-ray imaging reveals well-preserved internal characters in mineralized arthropods from the Paleogene, urging the reexamination of previously neglected fossil collections.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>An organism’s morphology represents a complex solution to myriad ecological and environmental challenges it and its ancestors have confronted over evolutionary time. Inferring a comprehensive evolutionary history of a lineage requires consideration of a wide range of morphological features, and how they may have been shaped by selection, drift, and developmental constraints. While external characters predominate in ecomorphological and systematic studies, internal characters also play critical roles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Perreau and Tafforeau, 2011</xref>). In fossil specimens, however, these characters are usually not preserved or difficult to access (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Siveter et al., 2007</xref>). While combined phylogenetic analyses of extant species frequently utilize internal anatomy, analyses including fossil taxa are generally limited to external characters. Moreover, it is often difficult to distinguish whether unobserved morphological characters were originally absent or lost due to taphonomic processes, potentially leading to misinterpretations of character evolution and erroneous phylogenetic placements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Sansom, 2015</xref>).</p><p>Several types of preservation or certain combinations of them are known for arthropod fossils. These are adpressions (compressions or impressions) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Wedmann et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">2011</xref>), casts, voids, embeddings, mineral replications, charcoalified remains, or inclusions in amber (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Grimaldi et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Martı́nez-Delclòs et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Grimaldi and Engel, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Dunlop and Garwood 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Penney and Jepson, 2014</xref>). Amber inclusions are famous for exquisitely preserving three-dimensional external shape and sometimes internal characters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Perreau and Tafforeau, 2011</xref>). Three-dimensional arthropods may also be preserved within concretions (e.g. in siderite nodules [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Nitecki, 1979</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Garwood et al., 2009</xref>]), calcareous incrustations (e.g. in travertine [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Rosendahl et al., 2013</xref>]), encapsulations in minerals (e.g. in onyx-marble [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Pierce, 1951</xref>], chert [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Anderson and Trewin, 2003</xref>], or gypsum crystals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Schlüter et al., 2003</xref>]), and mineral replications (e.g. as calcite [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">McCobb et al., 1998</xref>], silica [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Miller and Lubkin, 2001</xref>], goethite [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Grimaldi, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Barling et al., 2014</xref>], pyrite [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Grimaldi and Engel, 2005</xref>], or phosphate [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Duncan and Briggs, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Hellmund and Hellmund, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Waloszek, 2003</xref>]). Some of these preservation types have revealed surprisingly detailed insights into the internal and soft tissue anatomy of several arthropods, for instance from several Paleozoic marine deposits (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Siveter et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Ma et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Cong et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Edgecombe et al., 2015</xref>). For insects, e.g. eyes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Duncan and Briggs, 1996</xref>) and muscle fibers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Grimaldi, 2009</xref>) have been reported.</p><p>Abundant arthropod fossils preserved by mineralization of calcium phosphate are known from the Oligocene fissure fillings of Ronheim (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Hellmund and Hellmund, 1996</xref>), the Late Oligocene/Early Miocene limestones of Riversleigh (QLD, Australia) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Duncan and Briggs, 1996</xref>) and from Paleogene deposits at Quercy (south-central France) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Filhol, 1877</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Gervais, 1877</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Flach, 1890</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Thévenin, 1903</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Handschin, 1944</xref>). These localities have long been famous for their rich vertebrate fossils as well (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Legendre et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Laloy et al., 2013</xref>). The arthropod fossils of Quercy were documented by Swiss entomologist <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Eduard Handschin (1944)</xref>. He described the hister beetle <italic>Onthophilus intermedius</italic> (Coleoptera: Histeridae) from eight specimens, and considered it distinct but closely related to the extant European species <italic>O. striatus</italic> (Forster, 1771). The description, however, was vague and based mainly on the external morphology of the two best-preserved specimens (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Handschin, 1944</xref>).</p><p>X-ray microtomography has become established for the detailed examination of both extant (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Betz et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bosselaers et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">van de Kamp et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Brehm et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Sombke et al., 2015</xref>) and extinct (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Sutton, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Sutton et al., 2014</xref>) arthropods, including fossils preserved in amber (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Lak et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Pohl et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Soriano et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Perreau and Tafforeau, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Riedel et al., 2012</xref>). We explored the application of this technique to mineralized fossils by re-examination of Handschin's specimens of <italic>Onthophilus intermedius</italic>. To ensure a direct morphological comparison, we performed tomographic scans (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>) of ethanol-fixed and air-dried <italic>O. striatus</italic> using the same experimental setup. Furthermore we tested the hypothesis that the two are closely related with a global phylogenetic analysis of <italic>Onthophilus</italic> Leach, 1817.<fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.12129.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Comparison between the fossil <italic>Onthophilus intermedius</italic> (<bold>A</bold>, <bold>D</bold>, <bold>G</bold>) and EtOH-fixed (<bold>B</bold>, <bold>E</bold>, <bold>H</bold>) and air-dried (<bold>C</bold>, <bold>F</bold> , <bold>I</bold>) specimens of <italic>O. striatus</italic>.</title><p>Slices of tomographic volumes showing head region (<bold><bold>A</bold>–<bold>C</bold></bold>), thorax (<bold><bold>D–F</bold></bold>) and abdomen (<bold><bold>G–I</bold></bold>). ae = aedeagus; ag = accessory gland; bpae = basal part of aedeagus; hg = hindgut; m = musculature; ml = median lobe; mr = muscles remnants; mscx = mesocoxa; msf = mesofemur; mst = mesotibia; mt = muscle tissue; mtcx = metacoxa; mtf = metafemur; mtt = metatibia; pcx = procoxa; sph = spherical particle; sm = stony matrix; t8 = 8<sup>th</sup> abdominal tergite; t9 = 9<sup>th</sup> abdominal tergite; t10 = 10<sup>th</sup> abdominal tergite; te = tentorium; tr = trachea.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.12129.003">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.12129.003</ext-link></p></caption><graphic xlink:href="elife-12129-fig1-v1.tif"/></fig></p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results|discussion"><title>Results and discussion</title><p>We found internal characters in all fossils (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>).

The right mid and hind legs are eroded at the edge of the matrix, but their encrusted left counterparts appear complete except for the most distal part of the metafemur of the hind leg that would protrude from the matrix. Moreover, many anatomical characters can be recognized inside the fossil (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>). Apart from internal invaginations of the exoskeleton (e.g. tentorium, furcal arms and metendosternite), large parts of the alimentary canal and tracheal system are visible. The oesophagus appears to be shrunken and is connected to the crop, which is truncated posteriorly. The anterior part of the hindgut is hollow, while the middle part is apparently filled with mineral matrix but well-defined. Conspicuous spherical particles may constitute remnants of gut content (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>). The hindmost part of the gut can be roughly retraced by aggregations of tiny holes inside the mineral matrix. Like in the alimentary canal, some large tracheae appear to be filled with matrix, while others are hollow. Except for the musculature connecting the right pro- and mesofurcal arms (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>), most muscles can only be recognized by remnants at the insertion areas (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>). The genitals are extraordinary well-preserved (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref>). While testes and Ductus ejaculatorius could not be recognized, other soft tissues such as the spiral accessory glands and parts of the gland ducts are conspicuous. The genital sclerites, including aedeagus, median lobe, gonopore, tergites 8-10 and sternites 8 &amp; 9 are almost perfectly preserved as imprints.<fig id="fig4" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.12129.007</object-id><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><title>Coxa-trochanteral joints.</title><p>Comparison of the joints (cut) of the left mid- (<bold><bold>A</bold></bold>, <bold><bold>B</bold></bold>) and hind leg (<bold><bold>C</bold></bold>, <bold><bold>D</bold></bold>) of <italic>Onthophilus striatus</italic> (<bold><bold>A</bold></bold>, <bold><bold>C</bold></bold>) and <italic>O. intermedius</italic> (<bold><bold>B</bold></bold>, <bold><bold>D</bold></bold>), showing coxae (green) and trochanters (yellow).</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.12129.007">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.12129.007</ext-link></p></caption><graphic xlink:href="elife-12129-fig4-v1.tif"/></fig><fig id="fig5" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.12129.008</object-id><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><title>Digital endocast of <italic>Onthophilus intermedius</italic> (specimen F1994).</title><p>A digital endocast (<bold><bold>A</bold></bold>, <bold><bold>B</bold></bold>) artificially created from tomography data resembles the shape of the other fossils (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>) much closer than the original surface of the beetle (<bold><bold>C</bold></bold>, <bold><bold>D</bold></bold>) hidden by the stony matrix.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.12129.008">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.12129.008</ext-link></p></caption><graphic xlink:href="elife-12129-fig5-v1.tif"/></fig></p><p>The remarkable preservation state of the fossil is emphasized when its morphological characters are compared to those of an extant ethanol-fixed specimen of the same genus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">3E,F</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">4</xref>).

Of the characters scored for both <italic>O. intermedius</italic> and <italic>O. striatus</italic>, there are seven by which their states differ, three external and four internal. Of these, two external (chars. 29 &amp; 30) and one internal (char. 36) are reconstructed as autapomorphies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). Only one external synapomorphy (char. 22) separates them, while three of the four genitalic differences (chars. 35, 40, and 41) represent synapomorphies of their respective lineages. Exclusion of internal characters for <italic>O. intermedius</italic> did not affect the topology, but did prevent genitalic characters from supporting its larger containing clade. Critical diagnostic differences in external morphology, such as mesoventral proportions and pygidial sculpturing, were also revealed by visualization of features previously obscured by matrix.</p><p>Based on our examinations we can reconstruct the probable fossilization process of the Quercy <italic>Onthophilus</italic> specimens, which culminates in a partial mineralization of inner organs in combination with the cuticle preserved as voids. An accurate three-dimensional conservation of soft tissues does not occur if the specimens are dried in air (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C,F,I</xref>). Therefore, the fixation process must have occurred fast, possibly due to the animal being immediately penetrated and enclosed by phosphate rich water. In arthropods, this type of fossilization is only known from a handful of localities, which are better known for a rich vertebrate fauna (Riversleigh: <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Duncan and Briggs, 1996</xref>; Ronheim: <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Hellmund and Hellmund, 1996</xref>; Quercy: <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Handschin, 1944</xref>). Replication of soft tissues by phosphatization may be accomplished over a period of weeks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Martı́nez-Delclòs et al., 2004</xref>). Possible sources for high phosphorous concentrations in water circulating through the fissure fill are rocks or abundant phosphate-rich vertebrate bones, which may have been deposited along with them (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Handschin, 1944;</xref> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Hellmund and Hellmund, 1996</xref>). After encrustation and internal mineralization, the cuticle largely decayed, leaving air-filled spaces. Erosion processes probably removed the outer stony matrix of most specimens, including fragile appendages and the imprint of the outer surface of the exoskeleton, leaving a mineralized endocast. Thus, the exterior of the fossils merely represents the inner surface of the exoskeleton – the deep grooves (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>) actually being inner folds or apophyses. While the smooth dorsal part of F1994 resembles the other fossils in appearance, its ventral surface covered by the mineral matrix shows a distinct surface sculpturing as present in extant species of the genus. In contrast, an artificial ‘digital endocast’ created from the tomographic data of F1994 (Material and methods) bears a striking resemblance to the other fossils (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>), on which Handschin based his original description. Summing up, the Quercy hister beetles represent three-dimensional ‘hybrid’ fossils, comprising cuticle imprints and mineralized soft tissue, combining to preserve both exoskeletal fine structure and internal anatomical characters.</p><p>Fissure filling fossils preserving three-dimensional internal anatomy will help to overcome taphonomic biases in available fossil data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Allison and Bottjer, 2011</xref>). To date, fossilized insect internal character information has mainly been obtained from well-preserved amber inclusions (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Pohl, et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Perreau and Tafforeau, 2011</xref>). However, the origination of amber as tree resin causes a representational bias toward generally arboreal taxa (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Martı́nez-Delclòs et al., 2004</xref>). The fossil arthropods of Quercy represent an assemblage of taxa more typically associated with forest floor communities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Handschin, 1944</xref>), as exemplified by <italic>Onthophilus</italic>, typically a predator in various decaying organic materials (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Kovarik and Caterino, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bajerlein et al., 2011</xref>). Such communities are less commonly preserved than those of many other environments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kidwell and Flessa, 1996</xref>). Beyond anatomical data on these species, clearer interpretations of evolutionary relationships of these fossils will improve inferences about the evolution of these ecological communities. Thus, reexamination of the Quercy fossils, and likely also of similar mineralized fossils from other localities (which may represent different ecosystems and/or time periods), may provide a highly complementary source of information on the evolutionary history of arthropods.</p><p>With regard to the methods employed here, we can offer some guidance on improving future imaging attempts on similar materials. Based on our experience, a fast tomography setup combining filtered polychromatic radiation and an optimized detector system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">dos Santos Rolo et al., 2014</xref>) is well-suited to achieve sufficient image quality in most fossil specimens. Thus, scan duration per tomogram may be reduced to a couple of seconds (Material and methods), facilitating high-throughput screening of large sample numbers in short time.</p><p>Our results demonstrate that mineralized arthropod fossils from a sedimentary context may three-dimensionally preserve soft tissue and other internal anatomical characters in remarkable detail, which allows determinations and phylogenetic analyses according to the standards for Recent organisms. Reevaluation of relationships with modern taxa in this extended morphological context will substantially improve estimates of rates and modes of arthropod evolution. This exceptionally detailed preservation may be aided by the presence of a surrounding stony matrix, hinting that encrusted specimens, which therefore were originally considered to be of poor quality, could contain particularly well-preserved external and internal characters. Our findings may trigger the reinvestigation of numerous similar fossils from various localities.</p></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s3-1"><title>Synchrotron X-ray microtomography</title><p>3D X-ray micro-computed tomography scans with synchrotron radiation (µCT) were performed at the TOPO-TOMO beamline (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Rack et al., 2009</xref>) of the ANKA Synchrotron Radiation Facility at Karlsruhe Institute of Technology (KIT). The measurements consisted of the acquisition of 2500 equiangularly spaced radiographic projections of the sample in a range of 180°. The frame rate was set to 150 images per second, resulting in an overall scan duration of 16.67 seconds per sample. The parallel polychromatic X-ray beam produced by a 1.5 T bending magnet was spectrally filtered by 0.2 mm aluminum to obtain a peak at about 15 keV. The sample was placed 20 cm upstream of the detector, which in turn was located about 33 m from the source. The detector consists of a thin, plan-parallel lutetium aluminum garnet single crystal scintillator doped with cerium (LuAG:Ce), optically coupled via a Nikon Nikkor 85/1.4 photo-lens to a pco.dimax camera with a pixel matrix of 2008x2008 pixels. The lens was stopped down to F/4 to remove optical aberrations and to increase its depth of focus, permitting the use of a thicker scintillator to collect a higher fraction of the incident X-ray photons.

Your article has been reviewed by two peer reviewers, one of whom, Russel Garwood, has agreed to reveal his identity. The evaluation has been overseen by Diethard Tautz as the Senior Editor.</p> <p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p> <p>Summary:</p> <p>The authors show that the internal preservation of the Quercy fossils is unexpectedly excellent, and the authors reveal this with technical skill. The level of preservation is incredible for a non-amber fossil. The preservation of soft anatomy such as an insect's tracheal system makes the study just the kind of thing that should have a large impact in palaeontology. Further, there is actually more behind this manuscript than a technical/techniques paper, and in fact the phylogenetic finding that the Quercy fossil histerid species is most closely related to a North American species is interesting (should mention this in the Abstract). Surely, this biogeographic finding would not have been possible without such remarkable preservation. Regarding the mode of preservation, it is also quite likely that internal decomposition of the original insect was quickly halted because of the relatively antiseptic nature of the phosphate-saturated water that infiltrated the body.</p> <p>Essential revisions:</p> <p>One of the reviewers (Russel Garwood) provides direct comments on text passages that should be responded to (appended below). Several of them refer to providing more citations for the general technical background of the study.</p> <p>Please clarify the following sentences in light of the accompanying comments:</p> <p>Abstract:</p> <p>1) “Internal characters in fossil arthropods are crucial to establishing systematic position, ecological role and evolutionary trends.”</p> <p>I believe this is an oversimplification of a complex issue – see comments below.</p> <p>Introduction:</p> <p>2) “Internal characters are crucial for assessing the systematic placement and ecological role of organisms and provide essential information for reliable evolutionary inference. In many arthropods, they include critical systematic characters (Perreau and Tafforeau, 2011).”</p> <p>This statement is a simplification of what is in fact a complex and under-researched area. Internal characters in fossils are just a form of missing data, and are no more – or less – important, than external data. I suggest the authors check out the following paper: Sansom, R. S. (2014). Bias and sensitivity in the placement of fossil taxa resulting from interpretations of missing data. Systematic biology, syu093.</p> <p>It’s relatively safe to say that more data is useful in a cladistic phylogenetic context, but (as Sansom 2015 demonstrates) – what is more important when dealing with missing data is to correctly code data as such, rather than introducing false absences (which is the biggest risk when dealing with fossils). Nobody has, to my knowledge, published any work on whether the loss of internal characters leads to biases in phylogenies. This is where it would be a significant issue. I strongly recommend that the authors reword this statement to reflect our current understanding of the impact missing data can have on phylogenetic inference – and indeed put a relevant reference at the end. The current authors correctly cite Perreau and Tafforeau’s (2011) findings, but Perreau and Tafforeau didn’t broach the “reliable evolutionary inference” angle (which is why the current work is novel). For more papers on missing data, I recommend reading these reviews:</p> <p>Wiens, J. J. (2003). Missing data, incomplete taxa, and phylogenetic accuracy.Systematic Biology, 52(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">4</xref>), 528538.</p> <p>Wiens, J. J. (2006). Missing data and the design of phylogenetic analyses.Journal of biomedical informatics, 39(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">1</xref>), 3442.</p> <p>Kearney, M., &amp; Clark, J. M. (2003). Problems due to missing data in phylogenetic analyses including fossils: a critical review. Journal of Vertebrate Paleontology, 23(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">2</xref>), 263274.</p> <p>3) “Arthropod fossils generally occur as adpressions…” or, indeed, mixtures of these (see e.g. Crato Formation).</p> <p>4) “(E.g. pyritized in siderite nodules (Nitecki, 1979)).” While there often is a pyrite halo around siderite fossils, the fossils themselves are usually voids, and thus not pyritised see, e.g., any of my (Russell Garwood) Carboniferous arachnid/insect papers. I suggest you correct this (they are also pretty good to CT scan as a result). Some arthropod fossils are indeed pyritised though, I guess Beecher’s trilobite bed (which is also fairly 3D) or the Hunsruck Slate would both be good examples if you want some.</p> <p>5) “However, in these fossil types, while internal and soft-tissue characters, such as eyes (Duncan and Briggs, 1996) and muscle fibres (Grimaldi, 2009) have been reported (Sutton, 2008), they have been rare and fragmentary.”</p> <p>Again, this is something of a simplification – a range of soft-tissue, and indeed, internal characters, are known for whole animals (so they are not that fragmentary). They’re also not as rare as the authors suggest. To name some deposits which preserve internal characters (off the top of my head, so biased towards the Palaeozoic as that’s what I know better – but presumably this gets more, rather than less, frequent with younger rocks):</p> <p>The Rhynie Cherts</p> <p>Torridonian Cherts</p> <p>Doushantuo Formation</p> <p>Orsten</p> <p>Gogo Formation</p> <p>La Voulte-sur-Rhône</p> <p>And all macerates from the Silurian/Devonian (e.g. Gilboa, Wenlock)</p> <p>If you include just soft tissues, you can add many more, e.g.:</p> <p>Chengjiang</p> <p>All Burgess Shale-type deposits</p> <p>All Ediacaran fossil-bearing deposits</p> <p>The Silurian Lagerstatten</p> <p>All Mazon-creek-type Lagerstatten</p> <p>The Soom Shale</p> <p>The Hunsrück Slates</p> <p>Solnhofen Limestone</p> <p>Crato Formation</p> <p>I suggest the authors reword to highlight that soft tissue preservation, at least, is surprisingly common, and indeed, that this makes their work more important, as it will apply to a larger number of fossils.</p> <p>6) Synchrotron X-ray microtomography has become established for detailed examination of fossils (Sutton, 2008). Microtomography has become well established enough in palaeontology that there is a book on it:</p> <p>Sutton, M., Rahman, I., &amp; Garwood, R. (2013). Techniques for virtual palaeontology. John Wiley &amp; Sons.</p> <p>The authors shouldn’t feel compelled to cite it, but there are a large number of appropriate references in it that may be of utility. I’d also encourage the authors to just say Microtomography, as palaeontologists have a tendency to run to a synchrotron for any scan they can do, where for the majority a decent lab-based scanner would do the job very well. This is something which doesn’t need to be further entrenched in the mindset.</p> <p>7) “Recently especially for amber inclusions”</p> <p>Not especially, as there are a comparable number of applications to fossil plants and seeds in a variety of preservational settings, Doushantuo fossils, macerated microfossils, and many more besides. I recommend the authors say “including fossils preserved in amber” or similar.</p> <p>8) “Using the same experimental setup”</p> <p>Why? Surely the beam energy and scanning conditions could (and should) be modified for each specimen?</p> <p>Results and Discussion:</p> <p>9) “It is mostly represented by air-filled spaces in the fossil”</p> <p>What, the cuticle? So you have a void in the form of the organism? This isn’t 100% clear – I suggest you clarify. Furthermore, it’s quite hard to tell preserved cuticle from void in scans, as both will be significantly less dense than the surrounding rock. How can you be sure that features such as, for example, the accessory gland, are not still preserved cuticle.</p> <p>10) “Large parts of alimentary canal and tracheal system are visible”</p> <p>This is fantastic.</p> <p>11) “While the middle part is apparently filled with mineral matrix but well-defined”</p> <p>This is a bit hard to discern in the image – is this raw, unmodified data? If so, I suggest that adjusting the contrast to better display these features would be absolutely fine, and would make them clearer.</p> <p>12) “Facilitated an extended description of the species according to modern taxonomic standards (Material and methods)”</p> <p>Would this description not belong better in the Results, i.e. before this section? This would seem more logical to me.</p> <p>13) “However, phylogenetic analysis of the more diverse character set now accessible separates these species widely”</p> <p>This is clear. However, it is worth noting that a cladistic analysis could never show “a direct lineal relationship”. Rather this would be revealed as a sister group relationship between the two taxa, or – more likely – have intermedius as the earliest split in a clade including <italic>striatus</italic> – intermedius is only actually one node away from this, instead being in a polytomy that is sister to the <italic>striatus</italic> clade. Maybe you could clarify the above statement to reflect this.</p> <p>14) “In all most parsimonious solutions <italic>O. striatus</italic> is nested within a group of mainly Nearctic species related to <italic>O. flohri</italic> Lewis, 1888.”</p> <p>Based on what characters? And what characters is <italic>O. intermedius</italic> placed on the basis of? If these are not both internal then you could have got this without the CT work.</p> <p>15) “Inclusion of internal characters of male genitalia for <italic>O. intermedius</italic> yields a better resolved consensus topology and a fuller view of the biogeographic and morphological history of the group.”</p> <p>What does “better resolved” actually mean? Can you add an SI figure showing the trees of analysis with, and without, genitailic characters? Or with, but with those for <italic>O. intermedius</italic> coded is unknown in one and correctly coded in the other?</p> <p>16) “Critical diagnostic differences in external morphology were also revealed by visualization of features previously obscured by matrix.”</p> <p>What in particular?</p> <p>This discussion of the phylogeny results could be strengthened by using including the above points.

The authors may like to include this in their Discussion, as it tells a slightly different story, and is fairly widely used in fossil arthropod phylogenies. I quote from one of my papers (Garwood and Dunlop, 2014) for more info: “Goloboff (1993) and Goloboff et al. (2008) provide an overview of this weighting scheme, whilst Legg, Sutton &amp; Edgecombe (2013), Legg &amp; Caron (2014) and Ortega-Hernández, Legg &amp; Braddy (2013) provide justification of its use in a palaeontological context.”</p> <p>Also, just to note, that we have found that viewing external morphology of fossils alone through CT: Garwood, R.

PeerJ, 2, e641.</p> <p>I would make the case that some of the changes you are seeing are down to just more data, or the inclusion of fossils themselves – as we found in the above exercise. To tie what you are seeing down to the inclusion of internal characters I would like to see a little more interrogation of the data as suggested above – obviously this paper is neither the time nor place to try and quantify this, or even say much in general, but there are relatively simple tests you can do through removal of characters and taxa to try and assess what is driving tree topology.</p> <p>17) “Based on our examinations we can reconstruct the probable fossilization process of the Quercy <italic>Onthophilus</italic> specimens.”</p> <p>I suggest you state here outright that some internals are replaced through mineralisation, and that some cuticle is preserved as void – as it is currently structured it takes quite a long time to get to this fact, which is useful for following the hypothesis for how this was preserved.</p> <p>18) “By a liquid phosphoric solution”</p> <p>What kind of solution – phosphate rich water?</p> <p>19) “From a handful of localities”</p> <p>If there are relatively few, I suggest you name them so the reader does not have to look them up.</p> <p>20) “Including fragile appendices”</p> <p>Do you mean appendages?</p> <p>21) “Are circulating water”</p> <p>Virtually any sediment will have circulating water in it.

The present authors need to rephrase this sentence to reflect the fact they are building on a significant body of work, with a deep history [see Pocock, R. I.

The level of preservation is incredible for a non-amber fossil. The preservation of soft anatomy such as an insect's tracheal system makes the study just the kind of thing that should have a large impact in palaeontology. Further, there is actually more behind this manuscript than a technical/techniques paper, and in fact the phylogenetic finding that the Quercy fossil histerid species is most closely related to a North American species is interesting (should mention this in the Abstract). Surely, this biogeographic finding would not have been possible without such remarkable preservation. Regarding the mode of preservation, it is also quite likely that internal decomposition of the original insect was quickly halted because of the relatively antiseptic nature of the phosphate-saturated water that infiltrated the body.</italic> </p> <p><italic>O. intermedius</italic> was not placed within a group of North American species, but maybe sister to the Far-Eastern <italic>O. silvae</italic>. The text accurately describes the placement (and uncertainty), especially with the revisions that discuss slightly better resolution based on reweighted characters.</p> <p>As this is a rather complex discussion, we decided not to mention the detailed results of the phylogenetic analysis in the Abstract.</p> <p><italic>Essential revisions:</italic> </p> <p><italic>One of the reviewers (Russel Garwood) provides direct comments on text passages that should be responded to (appended below). Several of them refer to providing more citations for the general technical background of the study.</italic></p> <p><italic>Please clarify the following sentences in light of the accompanying comments:</italic></p> <p><italic>Abstract:</italic></p> <p><italic>1) “Internal characters in fossil arthropods are crucial to establishing systematic position, ecological role and evolutionary trends.”</italic></p> <p><italic>I believe this is an oversimplification of a complex issue – see comments below.</italic></p> <p>We now mention both external and internal characters and extended the Introduction (see comments below).</p> <p><italic>Introduction:</italic></p> <p><italic>2) “Internal characters are crucial for assessing the systematic placement and ecological role of organisms and provide essential information for reliable evolutionary inference. In many arthropods, they include critical systematic characters (Perreau and Tafforeau, 2011).”</italic></p> <p><italic>This statement is a simplification of what is in fact a complex and under-researched area. Internal characters in fossils are just a form of missing data, and are no more – or less – important, than external data. I suggest the authors check out the following paper: Sansom, R. S. (2014). Bias and sensitivity in the placement of fossil taxa resulting from interpretations of missing data. Systematic biology, syu093.</italic></p> <p><italic>It’s relatively safe to say that more data is useful in a cladistic phylogenetic context, but (as Sansom 2015 demonstrates) – what is more important when dealing with missing data is to correctly code data as such, rather than introducing false absences (which is the biggest risk when dealing with fossils). Nobody has, to my knowledge, published any work on whether the loss of internal characters leads to biases in phylogenies. This is where it would be a significant issue. I strongly recommend that the authors reword this statement to reflect our current understanding of the impact missing data can have on phylogenetic inference – and indeed put a relevant reference at the end. The current authors correctly cite Perreau and Tafforeau’s (2011) findings, but Perreau and Tafforeau didn’t broach the “reliable evolutionary inference” angle (which is why the current work is novel). For more papers on missing data, I recommend reading these reviews:</italic></p> <p><italic>Wiens, J. J. (2003).

(2003). Problems due to missing data in phylogenetic analyses including fossils: a critical review. Journal of Vertebrate Paleontology, 23(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">2</xref>), 263274.</italic></p> <p>We followed the suggestion and reworded the respective section to address the problem of missing data.</p> <p><italic>3) “Arthropod fossils generally occur as adpressions…” or, indeed, mixtures of these (see e.g. Crato Formation).</italic></p> <p>We now mention the occurrence of mixtures.</p> <p><italic>4) “(E.g. pyritized in siderite nodules (Nitecki, 1979)).” While there often is a pyrite halo around siderite fossils, the fossils themselves are usually voids, and thus not pyritised see, e.g., any of my (Russell Garwood) Carboniferous arachnid/insect papers. I suggest you correct this (they are also pretty good to CT scan as a result). Some arthropod fossils are indeed pyritised though, I guess Beecher’s trilobite bed (which is also fairly 3D) or the Hunsruck Slate would both be good examples if you want some.</italic></p> <p>Thank you for the suggestion. We changed the sentence and added a new reference (Garwood et al. 2009). To avoid confusion, we also exchanged “hollow casts” by “calcareous incrustations” in the following sentence.</p> <p><italic>5) “However, in these fossil types, while internal and soft-tissue characters, such as eyes (Duncan and Briggs, 1996) and muscle fibres (Grimaldi, 2009) have been reported (Sutton, 2008), they have been rare and fragmentary.”</italic></p> <p><italic>Again, this is something of a simplification – a range of soft-tissue, and indeed, internal characters, are known for whole animals (so they are not that fragmentary). They’re also not as rare as the authors suggest. To name some deposits which preserve internal characters (off the top of my head, so biased towards the Palaeozoic as that’s what I know better – but presumably this gets more, rather than less, frequent with younger rocks):</italic></p> <p><italic>The Rhynie Cherts</italic></p> <p><italic>Torridonian Cherts</italic></p> <p><italic>Doushantuo Formation</italic></p> <p><italic>Orsten</italic></p> <p><italic>Gogo Formation</italic></p> <p><italic>La Voulte-sur-Rhône</italic></p> <p><italic>And all macerates from the Silurian/Devonian (e.g. Gilboa, Wenlock)</italic></p> <p><italic>If you include just soft tissues, you can add many more, e.g.:</italic></p> <p><italic>Chengjiang</italic></p> <p><italic>All Burgess Shale-type deposits</italic></p> <p><italic>All Ediacaran fossil-bearing deposits</italic></p> <p><italic>The Silurian Lagerstatten</italic></p> <p><italic>All Mazon-creek-type Lagerstatten</italic></p> <p><italic>The Soom Shale</italic></p> <p><italic>The Hunsrück Slates</italic></p> <p><italic>Solnhofen Limestone</italic></p> <p><italic>Crato Formation</italic></p> <p><italic>I suggest the authors reword to highlight that soft tissue preservation, at least, is surprisingly common, and indeed, that this makes their work more important, as it will apply to a larger number of fossils.</italic></p> <p>Indeed we underestimated the fossil record of internal preservation in non-amber arthropods. We rephrased the section accordingly and added several new references about soft tissue preservation from Chenjiang-Formation, Burges-Shale, Katian Stage Lorraine Group, and Herefordshire.</p> <p><italic>6) Synchrotron X-ray microtomography has become established for detailed examination of fossils (Sutton, 2008). Microtomography has become well established enough in palaeontology that there is a book on it:</italic></p> <p><italic>Sutton, M., Rahman, I., &amp; Garwood, R. (2013). Techniques for virtual palaeontology. John Wiley &amp; Sons.</italic></p> <p><italic>The authors shouldn’t feel compelled to cite it, but there are a large number of appropriate references in it that may be of utility. I’d also encourage the authors to just say Microtomography, as palaeontologists have a tendency to run to a synchrotron for any scan they can do, where for the majority a decent lab-based scanner would do the job very well. This is something which doesn’t need to be further entrenched in the mindset.</italic></p> <p>This is right, of course. We followed the advice, changed the term accordingly and added several references.</p> <p><italic>7) “Recently especially for amber inclusions”</italic></p> <p><italic>Not especially, as there are a comparable number of applications to fossil plants and seeds in a variety of preservational settings, Doushantuo fossils, macerated microfossils, and many more besides. I recommend the authors say “including fossils preserved in amber” or similar.</italic></p> <p>We followed the suggestion.</p> <p><italic>8) “Using the same experimental setup”</italic></p> <p><italic>Why? Surely the beam energy and scanning conditions could (and should) be modified for each specimen?</italic></p> <p>It depends on the scientific question. If the aim is to achieve best possible feature contrast for a single specimen, then experiment conditions like the energy spectrum should be optimized for each scan. In our case, however, the aim was to have the same scan conditions to facilitate a direct comparison between the extant and fossil specimen. We therefore made a joint optimization of the experimental conditions with both specimens, such that the feature contrast was satisfactory for both samples.</p> <p><italic>Results and Discussion:</italic></p> <p><italic>9) “It is mostly represented by air-filled spaces in the fossil”</italic></p> <p><italic>What, the cuticle? So you have a void in the form of the organism? This isn’t 100% clear – I suggest you clarify. Furthermore, it’s quite hard to tell preserved cuticle from void in scans, as both will be significantly less dense than the surrounding rock. How can you be sure that features such as, for example, the accessory gland, are not still preserved cuticle.</italic></p> <p>The gray value outside the sample serves as an in-dataset reference for air, and we see the same gray value range in the parts of the animal were cuticle should be.</p> <p><italic>10) “Large parts of alimentary canal and tracheal system are visible”</italic> </p> <p><italic>This is fantastic.</italic></p> <p>Yes, it is. Thank you.</p> <p><italic>11) “While the middle part is apparently filled with mineral matrix but well-defined”</italic></p> <p><italic>This is a bit hard to discern in the image – is this raw, unmodified data? If so, I suggest that adjusting the contrast to better display these features would be absolutely fine, and would make them clearer.</italic></p> <p>Yes, the figure shows sliced of unmodified reconstructed data. We followed the suggestion and adjusted the contrast of the figure.</p> <p><italic>12) “Facilitated an extended description of the species according to modern taxonomic standards (Material and methods)”</italic></p> <p><italic>Would this description not belong better in the Results, i.e. before this section? This would seem more logical to me.</italic></p> <p>In our opinion the species description stands on rather its own and aims particularly at taxonomists. The formal language would clash with the style of the Results and Discussion section and impede the reading flow for the non-specialist. Since the appendices are included in the PDF (see e.g. <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://elifesciences.org/content/4/e05856">http://elifesciences.org/content/4/e05856/</ext-link>), taxonomists would find this important information prominently emphasized at the end of the main text.</p> <p><italic>13) “However, phylogenetic analysis of the more diverse character set now accessible separates these species widely”</italic></p> <p><italic>This is clear. However, it is worth noting that a cladistic analysis could never show “a direct lineal relationship”. Rather this would be revealed as a sister group relationship between the two taxa, or – more likely – have intermedius as the earliest split in a clade including striatus – intermedius is only actually one node away from this, instead being in a polytomy that is sister to the striatus clade. Maybe you could clarify the above statement to reflect this.</italic></p> <p>We have revised the text to more clearly relate Handschin’s wording and how we translate it into a testable hypothesis.</p> <p><italic>14) “In all most parsimonious solutions O. striatus is nested within a group of mainly Nearctic species related to O. flohri Lewis, 1888.”</italic></p> <p><italic>Based on what characters? And what characters is O. intermedius placed on the basis of? If these are not both internal then you could have got this without the CT work.</italic></p> <p>Mapping of specific character changes on a new Tree Figure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>) now better illustrates what classes of characters support the critical branches. Indeed internal characters provide critical synapomorphies.</p> <p><italic>15) “Inclusion of internal characters of male genitalia for O. intermedius yields a better resolved consensus topology and a fuller view of the biogeographic and morphological history of the group.”</italic></p> <p><italic>What does “better resolved” actually mean? Can you add an SI figure showing the trees of analysis with, and without, genitailic characters? Or with, but with those for O. intermedius coded is unknown in one and correctly coded in the other?</italic></p> <p>We reworded this section to reflect the fact that while internal characters did provide important synapomorphies, the accurate assessment of external characters (which were hidden by matrix) provided by microtomography was also essential to the resolution we found. We did some analyses with genitalic characters of <italic>O. intermedius</italic> missing to test their effects. In fact the same topology was obtained, but the character reconstructions were different, and the larger clade was defined by external characters with lower CIs. Inclusion of genitalic characters doesn’t affect the clades discovered, just how they are defined. The new text clarifies this subtler point.</p> <p><italic>16) “Critical diagnostic differences in external morphology were also revealed by visualization of features previously obscured by matrix.”</italic></p> <p><italic>What in particular?</italic></p> <p>Examples of important external characters are now given.</p> <p><italic>This discussion of the phylogeny results could be strengthened by using including the above points.

(2008) provide an overview of this weighting scheme, whilst Legg, Sutton &amp; Edgecombe (2013), Legg &amp; Caron (2014) and Ortega-Hernández, Legg &amp; Braddy (2013) provide justification of its use in a palaeontological context.”</italic></p> <p><italic>Also, just to note, that we have found that viewing external morphology of fossils alone through CT: Garwood, R. J., &amp; Dunlop, J. (2014). Three-dimensional reconstruction and the phylogeny of extinct chelicerate orders. PeerJ, 2, e641.</italic></p> <p><italic>I would make the case that some of the changes you are seeing are down to just more data, or the inclusion of fossils themselves – as we found in the above exercise. To tie what you are seeing down to the inclusion of internal characters I would like to see a little more interrogation of the data as suggested above – obviously this paper is neither the time nor place to try and quantify this, or even say much in general, but there are relatively simple tests you can do through removal of characters and taxa to try and assess what is driving tree topology.</italic></p> <p>We now discuss reweighted trees in the text. See also our comments above.</p> <p><italic>17) “Based on our examinations we can reconstruct the probable fossilization process of the Quercy Onthophilus specimens.”</italic></p> <p><italic>I suggest you state here outright that some internals are replaced through mineralisation, and that some cuticle is preserved as void – as it is currently structured it takes quite a long time to get to this fact, which is useful for following the hypothesis for how this was preserved.</italic></p> <p>We followed the suggestion and extended the statement.</p> <p><italic>18) “By a liquid phosphoric solution”</italic></p> <p><italic>What kind of solution – phosphate rich water?</italic></p> <p>Yes, we changed the term.</p> <p><italic>19) “From a handful of localities”</italic></p> <p><italic>If there are relatively few, I suggest you name them so the reader does not have to look them up.</italic></p> <p>We followed the suggestion.</p> <p><italic>20) “Including fragile appendices”</italic></p> <p><italic>Do you mean appendages?</italic></p> <p>Yes, corrected.</p> <p><italic>21) “Are circulating water”</italic></p> <p><italic>Virtually any sediment will have circulating water in it. I’d reword to reflect this e.g. “Possible sources for high phosphorous concentrations in water circulating through the fissure fill are…”</italic></p> <p><italic>22) “In contrast, an artificial ‘digital endocast’”</italic></p> <p><italic>What you mean by this isn’t 100% clear to me.</italic></p> <p>We added a more detailed description to the Material and methods.</p> <p><italic>23) “So far, the study of the anatomy of fossil arthropods has been largely confined to amber inclusions”</italic></p> <p><italic>This is not an accurate statement. To choose outline just a limited number of examples of fossil arthropod anatomy in recent years, the Herefordshire group has published &gt;15 papers using serial grinding to elucidate fossil anatomy.

The present authors need to rephrase this sentence to reflect the fact they are building on a significant body of work, with a deep history [see Pocock, R. I. (1911). monograph of the terrestrial Carboniferous Arachnida of Great Britain. for some truly excellent work on fossil arthropods anatomy]. There is still a representational bias, but it will be more complex than just arboreal, as it will be defined by taphonomic windows.</italic></p> <p>We followed the suggestions and rephrased this paragraph to better reflect the fossil biases. This should better point out the position and value of the Quercy arthropods. Several new references focusing on non-amber arthropod fossils were added to the Introduction (see also comment regarding internal preservation in non-amber arthropods).</p> <p><italic>24) “May provide a highly complementary source of information on the evolutionary history of arthropods”</italic></p> <p><italic>Yes, we’ve been saying this for a few years now – here’s a quote from a 2009 paper (Garwood et al 2009 Biology Letters):</italic></p> <p><italic>“These results demonstrate the ability of XMT to differentiate the void left by the original organism’s decay within sideritic host material and the power of computer-based three-dimensional visualizations of the resultant datasets as a tool for morphological analysis.”</italic></p> <p><italic>The current work shows the breadth of the technique, and further demonstrates its potential for widespread application. I feel the current authors’ point could be strengthened by citing some of the other 3D work on arthropods, and framed in the light of my comment above. The references don’t have to be my paper – see, for example:</italic></p> <p><italic>Selden, P. A., Shear, W. A., &amp; Sutton, M. D. (2008).

What was the original triangle count, and how much was it reduced by? This will give a useful indicator of just how much smoothing the process will have introduced, and is thus worth mentioning.</italic></p> <p>We agree that this information is worth mentioning, but don’t find it necessary to list the polygon count of all reconstructions done for this study. Therefore we now exemplarily mention the polygon numbers for the most important specimen F1994. The raw mesh of the data contained ca. 30 million polygons, the reduced version 3 million and the PDF version ca. 800,000. CINEMA 4D was used for polygon reduction. Unfortunately, the algorithm is not revealed by the software.</p></body> </sub-article> </article>
