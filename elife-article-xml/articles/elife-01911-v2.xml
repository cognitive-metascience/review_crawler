In this study, we adapt lentiviral vectors as carriers of designer nuclease proteins, providing efficient targeted gene disruption in vector-treated cell lines and primary cells. By co-packaging pairs of ZFN proteins with donor RNA in ‘all-in-one’ lentiviral particles, we co-deliver ZFN proteins and the donor template for homology-directed repair leading to targeted DNA insertion and gene correction. Comparative studies of ZFN activity in a predetermined target locus and a known nearby off-target locus demonstrate reduced off-target activity after ZFN protein transduction relative to conventional delivery approaches. Additionally, TALEN proteins are added to the repertoire of custom-designed nucleases that can be delivered by protein transduction.

The field builds on a long history of human attempts to alter genetics, from selective breeding of crops and livestock to genetically modified organisms and gene therapies.

ZFNs and TALENs are chimeric nucleases composed of a custom-designed DNA binding domain fused to the DNA-cleavage domain from the FokI endonuclease that upon dimer formation cleaves the DNA. ZFN- and TALEN-induced DSBs trigger genome editing through cellular repair mechanisms involving either error-prone non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) or homologous recombination (HR) with an available DNA donor template. Designer nucleases have broad applications in biological experimentation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Urnov et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bogdanove and Voytas, 2011</xref>) and have been successfully utilized for the production of gene knockout model animals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Doyon et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Geurts et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Tesson et al., 2011</xref>) and in emerging gene therapies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Perez et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Li et al., 2011</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Sun et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>The safety of designer nucleases is of major concern in relation to their use in treatment of human diseases. Thus far, ZFNs and TALENs have been administered to cells by transfection or electroporation of nucleic acids, DNA or RNA, encoding a pair of nuclease proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Urnov et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Miller et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Carlson et al., 2012</xref>) or by exploiting viral gene vehicles such as integrase-deficient lentiviral vectors (IDLVs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Lombardo et al., 2007</xref>), adeno-associated virus-derived vectors (AAV vectors) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Ellis et al., 2013</xref>), or adenoviral vectors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Holkers et al., 2013</xref>). Successful administration of ZFN- or TALEN-encoding genes leads to high intracellular levels of nucleases and furthermore imposes a risk of random insertion in the genome, resulting potentially in prolonged nuclease expression and accumulating events of off-target cleavage. Ideally, ZFNs and TALENs are provided in a ‘hit-and-run’ fashion allowing short-term and dose-controllable nuclease activity without losing the effectiveness of creating locus-directed DSBs. Towards this goal, ZFNs have been fused to destabilizing domains regulated by small molecules to attenuate ZFN toxicity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Pruett-Miller et al., 2009</xref>). Moreover, by exploiting the cell-penetrating capability of ZFNs, targeted gene disruption has recently been achieved by direct cellular delivery of purified ZFN proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Gaj et al., 2012</xref>). Although such approach may require multiple treatments due to the reduced cellular uptake of proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Mellert et al., 2012</xref>), recent findings suggest that ZFN uptake may be further improved by ligand-mediated endocytosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Chen et al., 2013</xref>). However, for gene correction by homology-directed repair such strategies would need to be combined with other means of delivering the donor template.</p><p>It has been known for decades that retroviruses can tolerate the incorporation of heterologous proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Jones et al., 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Weldon et al., 1990</xref>). Lentiviral particles (LPs) have been engineered to carry foreign proteins for the purpose of visualizing the intracellular behavior of the virus during infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">McDonald et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Jouvenet et al., 2008</xref>) and altering the viral integration profile (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bushman, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Goulaouic and Chow, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bushman and Miller, 1997</xref>), as well as for ferrying antiviral (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Okui et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Ao et al., 2008</xref>) and antitumor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Link et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Miyauchi et al., 2012</xref>) protein therapeutics. As the delicate structural composition of HIV-1-derived lentiviral particles is easily disturbed by an inappropriate load of nonviral proteins, leading to suboptimal vector yields and/or reduced transduction capability, various strategies for transducing heterologous protein cargo have been scrutinized. In early strategies, the accessory HIV-1 protein Vpr was adapted as a carrier of fused proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Wu et al., 1995</xref>). Recently, Vpr fusions have been shown also to ferry Cre recombinase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Michel et al., 2010</xref>) and I-SceI meganuclease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Izmiryan et al., 2011</xref>) into transduced cells. However, HIV-1 virions incorporate relatively few copies of Vpr (estimated 700 copies Vpr per virion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Swanson and Malim, 2008</xref>]), and the therapeutic potential of such approach may be hampered further by the known toxicity of the Vpr protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Tachiwana et al., 2006</xref>). Alternatively, nonviral proteins may be packaged in LPs as part of the Gag polypeptide, as was previously shown for reporter proteins like GFP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Aoki et al., 2011</xref>) and the apoptosis-inducing caspase 3 protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Miyauchi et al., 2012</xref>). During virion maturation, Gag is processed by the viral proteins into shorter proteins constituting the structural—and most abundant—proteins of the virus particle. It is estimated that each virion contains 5000 copies of Gag and 250 copies of GagPol (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Swanson and Malim, 2008</xref>). We recently adapted LPs for the delivery of the <italic>piggybac</italic> DNA transposase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cai et al., 2014</xref>). The transposase was released from Gag in the virus particles in a protease-dependent manner and found to be able to facilitate efficient DNA transposition in transduced cells. In yet another strategy, heterologous proteins fused to the integrase in the Pol region of the GagPol polypeptide were successfully delivered by protein transduction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Schenkwein et al., 2010</xref>).</p><p>In this study, we describe the use of lentivirus-derived particles as carriers of designer nucleases for safe administration of ZFN and TALEN proteins fused to lentiviral Gag precursors. We produce ZFN-loaded lentiviral particles that induce high-efficiency gene disruption with a favorable on-target/off-target ratio in safe genomic harbors like the <italic>CCR5</italic> locus. Also, gene disruption and repair is evident in cells treated with particles carrying TALEN proteins. Successful incorporation of nuclease proteins within lentiviral particles allows co-delivery of nucleases and the donor template for homology-directed repair. Our findings demonstrate targeted and programmable gene repair in the human genome by delivery of both ‘scissors’ and ‘patch’ in a single combined protein and gene vehicle.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Incorporation, processing, and transduction of ZFNs in LPs</title><p>To incorporate ZFN proteins in LPs, we fused ZFNs to the N-terminus of Gag containing also an intervening heterologous phospholipase C-δ1 pleckstrin homology (PH) domain thought to promote the recruitment of Gag and GagPol to the membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Urano et al., 2008</xref>).

An HIV-1 protease cleavage site (SQNY/PIVQ) was included between the ZFN and the PH domain to allow the release of functional ZFN proteins during particle maturation. LPs harboring HA-tagged left and right <italic>egfp</italic>-targeting ZFNs, respectively, were produced separately and analyzed for their particle content by Western blot analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B,C</xref>). For both ZFN-loaded LPs, we detected HA-tagged ZFNs of the predicted, full-length size (∼37.5 kDa), demonstrating that the majority of the virion-associated ZFNs was correctly released from the Gag and GagPol polypeptides during particle maturation. The identity of this band was confirmed by control analyses including plasmid-encoded HA-tagged ZFN protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). Nevertheless, both longer and shorter forms of the ZFNs were evident (indicated by ZFN* in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B,C</xref>), suggesting that processing was not complete and that proteolytic cleavage had also occurred outside the inserted cleavage site, despite the fact that neither the ZFNs nor the PH domain contained naive HIV-1 cleavage sites. Release of ZFN and p24 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B,C</xref>, left and right panels, respectively) from ZFN-PH-GagPol polypeptides was inhibited by treatment of the virus-producing cells with the HIV-1 protease inhibitor Saquinavir (SQV), confirming that polypeptide cleavage, and the resulting release of ZFN proteins, was dependent on the HIV-1 protease.<fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.01911.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Targeted <italic>egfp</italic> gene disruption by lentiviral delivery of ZFN proteins.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Schematic representation of the composition of Gag and GagPol polypeptides encoded by ZFN-encoding packaging constructs (top) and the production of ZFN-loaded LPs (bottom).

Both IDLVs carried the vector RNA containing the <italic>egfp</italic> donor sequence.

Treatment of the HEK293-eGFPmut cells with this vector resulted in potent induction of eGFP expression in a vector dose-dependent manner, leading to editing at most in more than 8% of the cells treated with ZFN-loaded IDLVs corresponding to 600 ng p24 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>).</p><p>To provide an indication of the number of IDLV particles that was required to obtain such efficient gene correction, we determined the multiplicity of infection (MOI) of donor-containing IDLVs with and without virally incorporated ZFNs (IDLV/donor and IDLV-ZFNLR(gfp)/donor, respectively). Copy numbers of lentiviral DNA and the genomic <italic>albumin</italic> gene in transduced cells were quantified by quantitative PCR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1A,B</xref>) on total DNA prepared from 1 × 10<sup>5</sup> HEK293-eGFPmut reporter cells transduced with IDLVs corresponding to 30 ng p24.

Hence, the most effective repair rate by IDLV-ZFNLR(gfp)/donor (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>) was obtained with an MOI of approximately 34. It is directly deduced from these analyses that IDLV/donor samples contain 3.1 × 10<sup>4</sup> infectious units (IU)/ng p24, whereas preparations of IDLV-ZFNLR(gfp)/donor contain an estimated 5.7 × 10<sup>3</sup> IU/ng p24 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1D</xref>).</p><p>Importantly, editing of the <italic>egfp</italic> gene was absent when the particles were not pseudotyped with VSV-G and therefore incapable of transducing the cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>). Furthermore, pretreatment of the reporter cells with Bafilomycin A1 (Baf A1), an inhibitor of endosomal escape, markedly reduced the level of editing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>). We conclude that ‘all-in-one’ lentiviral vectors containing both ZFN proteins and the donor sequence facilitate high levels of targeted gene repair in a manner that depends on the dose and VSV-G-mediated endocytosis.</p><p>To investigate the versatility of such engineered ‘all-in-one’ lentiviral virions as tools in genomic editing, we generated IDLVs containing pairs of ZFN proteins targeting the <italic>CCR5</italic> and <italic>AAVS1</italic> loci, respectively, and transduced HEK293 cells and NHDFs at an MOI of 34.

Notably, signs of editing were not evident in cells treated with preparations of IDLVs harboring only one of the ZFNs (ZFNL(CCR5) or ZFNL(AAVS1)), indicating that homology-directed insertion of the linker was achieved only after delivery of both left and right ZFN proteins.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>Targeted gene disruption by lentivirally delivered TALEN proteins</title><p>To expand the repertoire of designed nucleases that are compatible with lentiviral protein transduction, we set out next to explore the possibility of delivering TALEN proteins incorporated into lentiviral particles. We designed a shuttle plasmid that is compatible with the Golden Gate assembly method (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Cermak et al., 2011</xref>) and equivalent to pTAL3, allowing us to isolate the DNA segment carrying the assembled TALEN sequence and insert it into GagPol in the correct reading frame (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). HEK293-eGFPmut reporter cells were transduced with increasing amounts of LP-TALENLR(gfp) carrying both the left and right TALEN proteins designed to recognize sequences flanking the mutations in the <italic>egfp</italic> gene. Gene disruption was identified by Surveyor nuclease-directed detection of mismatches in re-annealed PCR products (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>) and confirmed by sequencing of cloned PCR products. Hence, 3 out of 46 sequenced alleles (6.5%) were found to contain indels as a result of the treatment with LP-delivered TALEN proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>). Moreover, by transfecting the cells with plasmid DNA containing the donor sequence prior to treatment of the cells with LP-TALENLR(gfp), we found that 0.2% of the cells were eGFP positive (as measured 15 days after transduction), whereas control treatments without LPs and donor DNA, respectively did not trigger eGFP expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>). These findings demonstrated the capacity of lentivirally delivered TALEN proteins to facilitate targeted gene repair. Notably, Western blot analysis of viral particles harboring an HA-tagged version of one of the two TALEN proteins fused to the GagPol polypeptide unveiled a cleavage pattern indicative of substantial proteolytic cleavage within the TALEN domain of the fusion protein, leading to truncated versions of the protein (indicated by TALEN* in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>). Although a low level of full-length TALEN protein with the same mobility as HA-tagged TALEN protein expressed in cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>, upper band marked by ‘TALEN’) was indeed evident in the particles, these data indicated the presence of cryptic HIV-1 protease cleavage sites internally in the TALEN protein.

Similarly, when we analyzed for mismatches at the <italic>CCR2</italic> locus, an increasing dose of ZFN-loaded LPs was seen to trigger increased off-target activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>, right panel). Importantly, however, a similar level of off-target activity was observed for all doses of transfected plasmid DNA, indicating that LP-delivered ZFNs even at levels that induced markedly higher levels of on-target disruption did not induce increased levels of off-target activity at the <italic>CCR2</italic> locus. These findings showed a reduced relative off-target activity of lentivirus-delivered ZFNs.</p><p>To simplify and strengthen the comparison between LP-delivered and plasmid-encoded ZFNs, we established experimental conditions under which the efficiency of on-target gene disruption by LP transduction and plasmid transfection was similar (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>, left panel). By subsequent analyses of off-target disruption within the <italic>CCR2</italic> locus of the same cells, we detected disruption (3%) induced by plasmid-encoded ZFNs, whereas indels and mismatches were not evident after ZFN protein transduction. In summary, our findings lend strong support to the notion that locus targeting by LP-directed protein transduction is both effective and favored by an improved on-target/off-target cleavage ratio.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Engineered nucleases have become driving forces in genomic engineering (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Gaj et al., 2013</xref>). To improve the safe use of such nucleases, it is crucial to scrutinize novel delivery techniques. Lentiviral virions have previously been engineered to incorporate foreign proteins to study different aspects of HIV-1 biology and antiviral strategies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Wu et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Fletcher et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hermida-Matsumoto and Resh , 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Hubner et al., 2007</xref>), demonstrating the capability of ferrying protein effectors into target cells. Indeed, delivery of Cre recombinase and I-SceI meganuclease has been achieved by fusing the heterologous protein-of-interest to the HIV-1 accessory protein Vpr (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Michel et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Izmiryan et al., 2011</xref>). However, none of these enzymes are programmable and therefore can only edit a single artificial target, which would need to be introduced in the target cells prior to editing. Also, as both Cre and I-SceI function as monomers they may be easily adaptable for alternative delivery strategies. In consideration of the increasing focus on engineered nucleases, it is crucial to investigate alternative nuclease delivery strategies.</p><p>With the goal of effectively co-delivering two different nuclease proteins and the donor for repair, we turned to a strategy based on transferring the heterologous protein as part of the lentiviral Gag polypeptide. Derivatives of Gag polypeptides are the most abundant proteins in HIV-1-derived particles, and each virion has been estimated to contain approximately 5000 copies of Gag-derived proteins like p24 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Swanson and Malim, 2008</xref>). Hence, such strategy for transduction of proteins is superior in terms of cargo load. Though IDLVs have been exploited to deliver ZFN-encoding genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Lombardo et al., 2007</xref>), there are some clear inherent limitations to this approach. Firstly, random integration of the vector can lead to insertional mutagenesis and sustained expression of ZFNs may cause cytotoxicity or chromosomal aberrations. Secondly, two separate IDLVs are necessary to provide the two ZFNs and a third IDLV needs to be included if a donor template is required for homologous recombination. Single IDLVs encoding both ZFNs have recently been described, but these do not perform as well as two separate IDLVs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Joglekar et al., 2013</xref>). Thirdly, due to the highly repetitive sequences in TALENs there are major difficulties in delivering these by IDLVs due to an inherent propensity of lentiviral vectors to undergo recombination during reverse transcription (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Mikkelsen and Pedersen, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Holkers et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>In this study, we have shown the feasibility of exploiting lentivirus-derived particles as vehicles for different sets of designer nuclease proteins that are released from the Gag polypeptide upon virion maturation. This approach facilitates a short boost of protein activity that drives immediate targeted gene disruption (within 12 hr) in up to near one-fourth of the target alleles in a population of cells without the risks of permanently inserting copies of ZFN- or TALEN-encoding genes into the genome. Moreover, as an alternative to protocols based on transfection of in vitro-transcribed RNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Meng et al., 2008</xref>) or the cell-penetrating capability of purified ZFNs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Gaj et al., 2012</xref>), a lentiviral protein delivery approach benefits from effective lentiviral transduction and can easily be further customized by adapting different lentiviral pseudotypes to direct protein transduction to specific cell types of interest.</p><p>The ability to edit predetermined genomic loci, rather than disrupt loci, may be crucial for future therapeutic applications of designer nucleases. We have shown that ZFN proteins (left and right) and HR donor sequences can be incorporated into a single preparation of IDLVs and trigger effective gene repair in transduced cells. At an MOI of approximately 34, such ‘all-in-one’ vectors edited the reporter gene in up to 8% of treated cells. We also provide proof-of-principle that ‘all-in-one’ vectors can target the insertion of additional genetic sequences in the form of a linker sequence, suggesting that HR-mediated insertion facilitated by transduced ZFN proteins has a potential as a tool for targeted lentiviral insertion.</p><p>The level of gene repair obtained with IDLVs carrying both ZFNs and the donor template is higher than previously reported repair rates obtained with the same pair of ZFNs under similar conditions using an analogous reporter system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Urnov et al., 2005</xref>). Although a direct comparison is not possible, we reason that a high rate of repair after protein transduction reflects the combined capacity of LPs to (i) coordinately deliver pairs of nucleases by protein transduction and (ii) provide a donor for homologous recombination which is associated with the pre-integration complex and therefore is actively and efficiently translocated to the nucleus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Coluccio et al., 2013</xref>). We have previously observed that the uptake of LP-delivered heterologous proteins is extremely limited relative to the very high levels of nuclear protein that can be achieved by standard plasmid DNA transfection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cai et al., 2014</xref>). Based on these findings, we currently favor a model by which editing is further supported by the co-localization of ZFN proteins and the donor template within the pre-integration complex. In several aspects, such model mimics the ability of conventional lentiviral vectors to carry the integrase protein along with the reverse-transcribed vector DNA into the nucleus.</p><p>In comparison to ZFNs, TALENs have higher modularity and are becoming more routinely used due to the ease of production. However, TALENs are relatively large proteins (∼100 kDa), and this may challenge their delivery. In addition, lentiviral delivery of TALEN-encoding genes is further complicated by frequent recombination between the highly similar sequence repeats encoding the DNA-binding domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Holkers et al., 2013</xref>), and lentiviral delivery of genes encoding re-coded TALE variants has been reported so far only for transcriptional activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Yang et al., 2013</xref>). In this study, we show that TALENs can be delivered as proteins by LPs, facilitating gene disruption or, in the presence of a donor template, repair in a reporter cell line. However, the majority of virally incorporated TALEN subunits are cleaved internally by the HIV-1 protease, which is suspected to limit the overall efficiency. Further work is necessary to identify and eliminate the cryptic viral protease cleavage site to improve the delivery of virus-incorporated TALEN proteins.</p><p>It is likely that efficient gene targeting can be achieved in a narrow window of ZFN exposure and that activity outside this time window can cause toxicity without improving gene targeting efficiencies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Porteus and Baltimore, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Pruett-Miller et al., 2009</xref>). To analyze this aspect, we compared ZFN-directed disruption in the <italic>CCR5</italic> target locus and the nearby and highly similar <italic>CCR2</italic> locus. Interestingly, LPs loaded with <italic>CCR5</italic>-directed ZFNs caused disruptions in the <italic>CCR5</italic> locus more effectively than ZFNs expressed from transfected plasmid DNA. In the same cells, disruptions in the off-target <italic>CCR2</italic> locus were evident with all concentrations of plasmid but detectable only with the highest and most effective dose of LPs. Importantly, under experimental conditions that allowed similar rates of disruption using LP-directed ZFN delivery and plasmid-encoded ZFN production, off-target activity within the <italic>CCR2</italic> locus was detected only after ZFN-encoding plasmid delivery. These findings support the notion that LP-delivered ZFNs target a safe harbor in the human genome with an improved on-target/off-target cleavage ratio. We reason that such improvement is a combined effect of efficient transduction and the short-term exposure to transduced ZFN proteins.</p><p>With ZFNs and TALENs as early driving forces, designer nucleases stand out as key tools in genomic editing with implications for the development of future gene repair therapies. We anticipate that lentiviral protein transduction of nuclease proteins represents a versatile alternative to current nuclease delivery techniques and will support continued efforts to promote safe genome editing therapies. Uniquely, this approach allows the delivery of the tools for targeted gene editing in a single combined gene and protein vehicle. Likely, genomic engineers will strive to adapt LPs as carriers of Cas9 proteins for RNA-guided genome editing.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Production of lentiviral particles (LPs) and integrase-defective lentiviral vectors (IDLVs)</title><p>Throughout this work, the annotation ‘LP-ZFNLR(target)’ was used to designate lentiviral particles that contain left and right ZFN proteins but do not carry a lentiviral vector genome. Same nomenclature applies to TALEN. A similar type of particle harboring, for example, only the left ZFN was accordingly designated LP-ZFNL(target). When a lentiviral genome was included for example as a carrier of a HR donor sequence, we referred to this vector as an IDLV (due to presence of the IN D64V mutation, rendering the vector integrase-defective). These vectors were named with the specification of the incorporated ZFNs and the donor that were included. IDLV-ZFNLR(gfp)/donor, for example, contains both <italic>egfp</italic>-directed ZFNs (left and right) and RNAs of which reverse transcription products carry a donor sequence with homology to <italic>egfp</italic>. Of note, we have consistently observed that virions harboring Gag fused N-terminally to foreign proteins are strongly reduced in their capability of transferring vector RNA (most likely due to complications during reverse transcription), but that this capacity can be restored by including unfused GagPol (encoded by pMDlg/pRRE-D64V) in the virions. Preparations of LPs and IDLVs were produced as follows. On day 1, 293T cells were plated at a density of 6 × 10<sup>4</sup>/cm<sup>2</sup>. On day 2, cells were transfected with calcium phosphate precipitates of plasmid DNA.

LPs containing TALENs were produced accordingly except using pTALENL(gfp)-PH-gagpol-D64V and pTALENR(gfp)-PH-gagpol-D64V instead of corresponding ZFN constructs. To produce IDLVs that did not incorporate foreign protein, cells in 15-cm dishes were transfected with 9.07 μg pMD.2G, 7.26 μg pRSV-Rev, 31.46 μg pMDlg/pRRE-D64V, and 31.46 μg pLV/egfp-donor-re.

Reporter cells pretreated with 1 μM Bafilomycin A1 (Baf A1) for 30 min before transduction served as an additional negative control. 4 days after transduction, cells were washed with PBS before being harvested and fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde. Data were collected on a FACSCalibur (Becton Dickinson, Franklin Lakes, New Jersey) and analyzed with FlowJo (Tree Star, Ashland, Oregon).</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>Western blot analysis of ZFNs/TALENs incorporated into LPs</title><p>To analyze the protein contents of engineered LPs, LP-containing supernatants were centrifuged through a 20% (wt/vol in PBS) sucrose cushion. LPs were lysed in the presence of a protease inhibitor. The viral proteins were separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and transferred to the PVDF membrane. Membranes were blocked by 5% fat-free milk dissolved in TBS/0.05% Tween-20 for 1 hr and incubated with an HA monoclonal antibody (Covance, Princeton, New Jersey) overnight at 4°C. The membranes were incubated with anti-mouse secondary antibodies (Dako, Glostrup, Denmark) and visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) using a HRP substrate (Thermo Scientific). The HA monoclonal antibody was washed away by stripping buffer (Thermo Scientific), and the PVDF membrane was re-used for incubation with a HIV-1 p24 polyclonal antibody (Thermo Scientific) and later peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit secondary antibody (Dako).</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>Quantitative PCR for determination of MOIs</title><p>Quantitative PCR (qPCR) on lentiviral DNA was performed as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bak et al., 2013</xref>). Briefly, qPCR reactions were run using Maxima Probe qPCR Master Mix (Fisher Scientific, Waltham, Massachusetts) with primers and probe specific for the WPRE sequence present in the lentiviral vector. Primers and probe specific for the <italic>albumin</italic> gene were used to quantify the cell number in each qPCR reaction assuming an <italic>albumin</italic> gene copy number of two per genome. WPRE and <italic>albumin</italic> DNA copy numbers were determined using standard curves with serially diluted plasmid containing the two targets. For WPRE, the pCCL-PGK-Puro-H1-MCS plasmid was used (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bak et al., 2011</xref>) and for <italic>albumin</italic> we used pAlbumin kindly provided by Didier Trono (Addgene plasmid #22037). The multiplicity of infection (MOI) was calculated as: 2 × copy numbers of lentiviral DNA/copy numbers of <italic>albumin</italic>. The infectious units/ng p24 was calculated as: number of cells × MOI/ng p24.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>The authors are grateful to Jun Komano for providing packaging constructs for production of fused lentiviral polypeptides.

Your article has been favorably evaluated by a Senior editor, a Reviewing editor and 3 reviewers.</p><p>The following individuals responsible for the peer review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Todd Golub, Reviewing editor; Perry Hackett, peer reviewer. The other two reviewers have chosen to remain anonymous.</p><p>The Reviewing editor and other reviewers discussed their comments before reaching this decision, and the Reviewing editor has assembled the following comments to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>The manuscript describe proof-of-concept for the use of non-replicative lentiviruses to transiently deliver both DNA-specific nucleases (zinc fingers and TALENs) and donor sequences for homologous recombination-dependent gene editing. The goal of reducing off-target effects of the ZFNs/TALENs is a laudable one, and one that would significantly advance the field. The manuscript was clearly written, and the conclusions in general justified.</p><p>However, there are several important issues that must be addressed before the work is suitable for publication.</p><p>1) The authors claim that higher levels of repair compared to co-transfection of plasmids encoding the two ZFNs. What is the number of nuclease molecules packaged into each LP, and how does this correspond to 300 ng of p24? Also, could the higher indel efficiency induced by LP be due to higher levels of protein present at the time when cells were harvested for analysis? Furthermore, it is generally difficult to compare absolute modification efficiencies across different experiments (especially those previously reported) – cell conditions, transfection efficiencies, and even analysis conditions can vary greatly. If the authors really want to make the argument that there is increased efficiency, they should conduct a side-by-side comparison.</p><p>2) In order to be maximally informative for readers, the authors should specify more of the experimental parameters surrounding the work. For example, what was the time point at which the ZFN-LP exposed cells were analyzed compared with transiently transfected cells? Similarly, since viruses were used, provide MOIs of the vectors (from qPCR of the genomes) because without this information we have no idea of the numbers of cells that even have a chance at gene editing, nor the efficiency of those cells with the right genomes. As a result, it is hard to compare efficiencies of 1%, 4% and 8% in the different panels.</p><p>3) The indel modification rates for the gels shown should be quantified. Similarly, the Surveyor results in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref> should be quantitated since the image is only marginally convincing. How many times was this experiment repeated? It may be important to repeat the experiment and try and quantitate the results in some way to substantiate the argument that this ZFN pair is safer when delivered by LP. This is an important claim in the manuscript.</p><p>4) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref> should be redrawn to make the targeting construct (lentiviral RNA genome) clearer. Where are the homology arms and how are they related to the mutant reporter in the host cell genome? What does the reverse-transcribed DNA look like and what is its architecture relative to the target genomic locus? Clarity of this illustration will help readers design their own experiments, and so it is worth the time to make it as clear and informative as possible.</p><p>5) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>: It would benefit the reader to see a control on the western for plasmid-encoded HA-tagged ZFN or TALEN proteins to compare to what is processed by the virus. As it stands, it is difficult to determine whether the bands not labeled as asterisks are really the expected products and that the ones with asterisks are improperly processed.</p><p>6) The authors should show how plasmid transfection compares to LP delivery of ZFNs/TALENs to understand whether LP-delivery is generally more efficient than plasmid delivery for multiple reagents, like is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>, or if the CCR5 ZFNs are somehow special in this regard.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.01911.016</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>1) The authors claim that higher levels of repair compared to co-transfection of plasmids encoding the two ZFNs.

If the authors really want to make the argument that there is increased efficiency, they should conduct a side-by-side comparison</italic>.</p><p>We acknowledge the fact that it is challenging to directly compare the editing efficiency using methods based on protein transduction and plasmid transfection. Our original intention was to illustrate to the reader that lentiviral delivery of ZFN proteins provides levels of editing that are comparable with levels of editing obtained by transfection of ZFN-encoding plasmids. Based on the fact that plasmid transfection is so efficient in HEK293 and that editing processes thus should not suffer from suboptimal transfection rates, we reasoned that the comparison would be reasonable. Nevertheless, we acknowledge that transfection rates can be further optimized and basically do not intend to conduct a side-by-side comparison with focus on editing efficiency. However, we feel that it is reasonable to retain the transfection data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>. Instead, we have revised the wording in the text and now state that “LP-ZFNLR (gfp) induced a level of repair that was comparable to that obtained by the efficient co-transfection of plasmid DNA encoding the two ZFNs” (paragraph 1 of Results section entitled “Targeted genome editing by “all-in-one” lentiviral vectors”).</p><p>Also, we agree that a comparison of absolute modification efficiencies across different experiments (including those from previous reports) can be problematic. In the Discussion (fifth paragraph) we have rephrased our argumentation and now state: “Although a direct comparison is not possible, we reason that a high rate of repair after protein transduction reflects…”</p><p>We agree with the reviewers that the original manuscript suffered from the lack of details on the number of virus particles that are required to obtain efficient levels of repair. As the combined delivery of ZFNs and donor sequence is central to the studies of repair, we have focused our experimentation and derived calculations on providing the exact numbers of infectious particles (IDLVs) that are required to obtain repair. Please see point 2 for further details. In the revised manuscript, we have added details on the estimated number of Gag protein derivatives in matured lentiviral virions. We cannot at present compare the ‘transducability’ of LPs (without DNA) and IDLVs and therefore will not be able to estimate the exact number of ZFNs in LPs. However, as mentioned in the Discussion, we have previously shown that the uptake of LP-delivered heterologous proteins in transduced cells is very limited relative to cells with plasmid-based expression (Cai et al. PMID:24270790). Hence, although LPs transduce cells with very high efficiency they only deliver small amounts of heterologous proteins to each cell. Thus, we find it unlikely that high efficiency of repair using lentiviral protein transduction reflects unusually high levels of protein at the time when the cells were harvested for analysis of gene disruption or repair. More likely, the editing process may benefit from the high local concentration of ZFNs in virus-derived complexes within transduced cells. We have further strengthened the wording in the Discussion.</p><p><italic>2) In order to be maximally informative for readers, the authors should specify more of the experimental parameters surrounding the work. For example, what was the time point at which the ZFN-LP exposed cells were analyzed compared with transiently transfected cells? Similarly, since viruses were used, provide MOIs of the vectors (from qPCR of the genomes) because without this information we have no idea of the numbers of cells that even have a chance at gene editing, nor the efficiency of those cells with the right genomes. As a result, it is hard to compare efficiencies of 1%, 4% and 8% in the different panels</italic>.</p><p>We certainly agree with the reviewers on the importance of providing more detailed information about the number of infectious units that were used to obtain gene repair in transduced cells. We carried out qPCR on lentiviral DNA intermediates (total DNA) in transduced HEK293 cells and determined the number of lentiviral DNA copies relative to the copies of the endogenous albumin gene in IDLV-treated cells. Using this strategy, we obtained exact MOIs for IDLVs carrying the donor sequence (IDLV/donor) and ZFN-loaded IDLVs carrying the donor (IDLV-ZFNLR(gfp)/donor) and found that the overall transduction capacity of ZFN-containing IDLVs was reduced about 5-fold relative to the control. Based on these experiments, we have added MOIs (or details on number of infectious particles) in all IDLV-based repair experiments. Our data show that MOIs in the range of 17-34 used throughout the paper facilitate efficient repair. A new paragraph describing details of the analysis has been added to the Results section “Targeted genome editing by “all-in-one” lentiviral vectors”, and in the Materials and methods section.</p><p><italic>For example, what was the time point at which the ZFN-LP exposed cells were analyzed compared with transiently</italic> <italic>transfected cells?</italic></p><p>All our gene disruption analyses were performed 24 h after LP transduction or after transfection of plasmid unless specifically pointed out (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>).

This is an important claim in the manuscript</italic>.</p><p>We have quantified the indel modification rates, as suggested by the reviewers, and introduced the specific rates in the appropriate figures. In general, these modification rates mimic and support the rates that were obtained by sequencing of individual clones.</p><p>We agree that the improved specificity of LP-delivered ZFNs is an important claim and that this issue needed further experimentation. Therefore, we repeated the analysis with new LP preps and carried out the initial analysis of <italic>CCR5</italic>-directed disruption under experimental conditions providing almost similar modification rates for LP- and plasmid-directed ZFN delivery (slightly higher efficiency with protein transduction; 8 % vs<italic>.</italic> 7 %). Under such conditions (and in the same cells), we compared the <italic>CCR2</italic> modification rate and found higher off-target activity within this locus after plasmid-directed ZFN production. Hence, under the given circumstances, plasmid transfection caused a <italic>CCR2</italic> modification rate of 3 %, whereas indels within <italic>CCR2</italic> were not detectable after LP transduction. These lend further support to the notion that the use of LPs is supported by a more favorable on-target/off-target ratio. The new data are presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref> and additional text describing this experiment is provided (last paragraph of the Results).</p><p><italic>4)</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3"><italic>Figure 3A</italic></xref> <italic>should be redrawn to make the targeting construct (lentiviral RNA genome) clearer.

We revised the figure according to the reviewers suggestions and made the following changes: i) the homologous sequences in the donor and target are now highlighted in light yellow; ii) the shown DNA intermediates are now presented in the same orientation, so that the reverse-transcribed DNA intermediate shown in the nucleus mimics the bigger version shown in the cytoplasm; iii) hatched lines have been added to specify the event of homologous recombination between the lentiviral DNA and the target in the genome. For simplicity, we did not add ‘recombination lines’ for the DNA circles but have added a related comment in the legend. We hope that the figure now succeeds in demonstrating the aspects of co-delivering ZFNs and donor sequence and at the same illustrating the basic design of the genomic target sequence.</p><p><italic>5)</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1"><italic>Figure 1B</italic></xref> <italic>and</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4"><italic>Figure 4E</italic></xref><italic>: It would benefit the reader to see a control on the western for plasmid-encoded HA-tagged ZFN or TALEN proteins to compare to what is processed by the virus. As it stands, it is difficult to determine whether the bands not labeled as asterisks are really the expected products and that the ones with asterisks are improperly processed</italic>.</p><p>This is certainly a valid point. To address this issue, we cloned plasmid constructs expressing the appropriate HA-tagged ZFN and TALEN variants. We then repeated the Western blot analysis of protein derived from matured LPs and included protein from plasmid-transfected cells as the control. The data are consistent with the ZFN and TALEN lengths that were already provided in the original manuscript. The new Western blots for ZFN and TALEN are provided in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1–figure supplement 1</xref> (short and long exposures) and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>, respectively. Notably, these data also confirm that full-length TALEN protein is present in LPs despite the fact that the truncated variants are created by internal cleavage. This observation is consistent with the demonstration of TALEN activity by delivery of TALEN-loaded LPs.</p><p><italic>6) The authors should show how plasmid transfection compares to LP delivery of ZFNs/TALENs to understand whether LP-delivery is generally more efficient than plasmid delivery for multiple reagents, like is shown in</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5"><italic>Figure 5C</italic></xref><italic>, or if the CCR5 ZFNs are somehow special in this regard</italic>.</p><p>As discussed under 1), further studies addressing different parameters like transfection reagents and cell type would be needed to provide a complete comparison of efficiencies obtained with LP transduction and plasmid transfection. Therefore, in this proof-of-principle study, it was not our intention to directly correlate efficiencies obtained using the two approaches, and we have rephrased sections where the comparison was too direct. Nevertheless, studies of specificity allowed us to directly relate on- and off-targeting obtained with LP delivery and plasmid transfection. We carried out such studies using <italic>CCR5</italic>-directed ZFNs, since the presence of the neighboring <italic>CCR2</italic> locus allowed specific detection of NHEJ-directed deletions and detection of mismatches within the <italic>CCR2</italic> locus.</p></body></sub-article></article>
