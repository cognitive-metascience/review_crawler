signaling (MAVS) protein is required for innate immune responses against RNA viruses. In virus-infected cells MAVS forms prion-like aggregates to activate antiviral signaling cascades, but the underlying structural mechanism is unknown. Here we report cryo-electron microscopic structures of the helical filaments formed by both the N-terminal caspase activation and recruitment domain (CARD) of MAVS and a truncated MAVS lacking part of the proline-rich region and the C-terminal transmembrane domain. Both structures are left-handed three-stranded helical filaments, revealing specific interfaces between individual CARD subunits that are dictated by electrostatic interactions between neighboring strands and hydrophobic interactions within each strand. Point mutations at multiple locations of these two interfaces impaired filament formation and antiviral signaling. Super-resolution imaging of virus-infected cells revealed rod-shaped MAVS clusters on mitochondria. These results elucidate the structural mechanism of MAVS polymerization, and explain how an α-helical domain uses distinct chemical interactions to form self-perpetuating filaments.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.01489.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.01489.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.01489.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>When infected by a virus, the body will generally launch an immune response to eliminate the infectious agent. Activation of the innate immune system–the first line of defense against infection—requires the host cells to recognize the presence of a pathogen and to sound the alarm once the invader is detected.</p><p>Viruses can contain DNA or RNA, and when a virus containing double stranded RNA enters a cell, or starts replicating within the cytoplasm, proteins called RIG-I-like receptors (RLRs) will detect these RNA molecules. This will trigger a signaling cascade that results in the production of type I interferons, the proteins that activate cells of the innate immune system.</p><p>Members of the RLR family of receptors, including RIG-I and MDA5, initiate the signaling cascade by interacting with the mitochondrial antiviral-signaling (MAVS) protein. Recent work revealed that upon activation by RIG-I or MDA5, MAVS proteins aggregate on the surface of mitochondria and form protein filaments. These filaments then activate inactive MAVS proteins, leading to the formation of more filaments. While a region of the MAVS protein called caspase activation and recruitment domain (CARD) is known to be involved in the formation of the filaments, the chemical interactions that govern the formation process have yet to be described.</p><p>Now, using cryo-electron microscopy, Xu et al. have shown that these filaments are comprised of three-stranded helixes. This came as something of a surprise because other similar filaments known as prions are made of tightly packed beta sheets. Xu et al. went on to visualize full-length MAVS filaments in virus-infected cells, and to verify that mutations that impair the assembly of MAVS filaments also prevent RNA viruses from triggering the production of interferon. These results have the potential to inform future studies of the innate immune response, as well as investigations into the assembly of proteins to form prion-like filaments.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold>

triggers innate and adaptive immune responses that are essential for the survival of the host (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Iwasaki and Medzhitov, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Ronald and Beutler, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Takeuchi and Akira, 2010</xref>). Initiation of innate immune response relies on a group of pattern recognition receptors, which recognize specific pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs), including microbial nucleic acids, bacterial cell wall components and certain highly conserved proteins. Two groups of pattern recognition receptors are responsible for detecting viral RNAs. The first group is the membrane-anchored Toll-like receptors (TLRs), located on the cell surface or in endosomal membranes and acting as sensors of viral RNAs encountered in extracellular environment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Kawai and Akira, 2006</xref>). The second group of sensors resides in the cytosol. They belong to a family of cytosolic RNA helicases called RIG-I-like receptors (RLRs), including retinoic acid inducible gene-I (RIG-I), melanoma differentiation-association gene 5 (MDA5) and laboratory of genetics and physiology 2 (LGP2) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Yoneyama and Fujita, 2009</xref>). Recognition of viral RNAs by RLRs leads to the activation of mitochondrial antiviral signaling protein (MAVS; also known as IPS1, VISA and CARDIF). Activated MAVS triggers rapid production of type I interferons and proinflammatory cytokines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Kawai et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Meylan et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Seth et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Xu et al., 2005</xref>).</p><p>RIG-I and MDA5 are two DExD/H-box helicases that belong to the superfamily 2 of RNA helicases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Yoneyama et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Fairman-Williams et al., 2010</xref>). Both proteins contain N-terminal tandem caspase activation and recruitment domains (CARDs), a central RNA helicase, and a C-terminal regulatory domain (CTD). Despite sharing a similar domain structure, RIG-I and MDA5 are activated by complementary sets of viral RNA ligands through distinct mechanisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Kato et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Loo et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Iwasaki, 2012</xref>). RIG-I recognizes short blunt ends of dsRNA with 5′-triphosphate caps (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Hornung et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Schlee et al., 2009</xref>), as well as long dsRNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Kohlway et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Patel et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Peisley et al., 2013</xref>). Ligand binding to the helicase domain and CTD induces a conformational change that liberates RIG-I from an autoinhibited state and exposes its N-terminal tandem CARDs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Hou et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Kowalinski et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Luo et al., 2011</xref>). In contrast, MDA5 detects long dsRNAs made of hundreds to thousands of base pairs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Kato et al., 2008</xref>). The helicase domain and CTD of MDA5 cooperatively assemble into helical filaments along the dsRNA, leaving the tandem CARDs of MDA5 flexibly exposed on the periphery of the filament (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Peisley et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Berke and Modis, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Wu et al., 2013</xref>). The exposed CARDs of RIG-I and MDA5 subsequently bind to unanchored lysine-63 (K63) polyubiquitin chains and form oligomers. The latter gain a high capacity of activating MAVS on mitochondria, presumably through CARD–CARD interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Zeng et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Jiang et al., 2012</xref>). The exact mechanism for the polyubiquitin-dependent interaction between active RIG-I and inactive MAVS is not well defined.</p><p>MAVS is ubiquitously expressed on the outer membrane of mitochondria. It consists of an N-terminal CARD domain, a proline-rich region (PRR) preceding a poorly structured middle segment, and a monotopic transmembrane (TM) domain at the very C-terminus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Recent studies have shown that upon activation, MAVS molecules polymerize themselves into functional aggregates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Hou et al., 2011</xref>). These high molecular weight aggregates behave like prion fibers, because they are detergent-resistant, protease-resistant and self-perpetuating by inducing inactive MAVS to form functional aggregates. The N-terminal CARD domain of MAVS is necessary and sufficient for forming active MAVS aggregates. It shares some homology with the first CARD domains in both MDA5 and RIG-I (25% and 20% sequence identity respectively). A crystal structure of the MAVS CARD, fused to a maltose-binding protein (MBP), exhibits a typical helical bundle of six antiparallel α-helices (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Potter et al., 2008</xref>). However, the isolated MAVS CARD without the MBP self-assembles into filamentous structures, which can promote endogenous, inactive MAVS to form highly active aggregates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Hou et al., 2011</xref>). How the CARD domain triggers MAVS aggregation remains poorly understood.<fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.01489.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>CryoEM reconstruction of MAVS CARD filaments.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Diagrams of the domain organization in MAVS and deletion mutants used in this study.

To understand the structural basis underlying the filament formation, we solved the 3D structure of MAVS CARD filaments at 9.6 Å resolution by cryo-electron microscopy (cryoEM) and iterative helical real space refinement (IHRSR) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Frank, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Egelman, 2007</xref>). Based on the cryoEM map and the crystal structure of the individual MAVS CARD, we built a pseudoatomic model of the filament and identified two new CARD–CARD interfaces that are important for filament formation. Mutations of residues found at the two interfaces disrupted MAVS self-association and abrogated the activation of the signaling pathway in cells. In order to understand the domain arrangement of the native MAVS aggregates, we obtained a 16.4 Å cryoEM map of a nearly full-length MAVS protein without part of the proline-rich region (PRR) and the C-terminal transmembrane domain (MAVSΔProTM). The cryoEM map of the MAVSΔProTM filament has the same CARD filament in the center, which is surrounded by extra fragmented densities in the periphery. This arrangement makes the CARD filament the organization center of the MAVS aggregates, and suggests a novel mechanism to expose the central segments of MAVS for downstream signaling effector recognition and signal amplification. To visualize the full-length MAVS filaments in virus-infected cells, we obtained three-dimensional Structured Illumination Microscopic (3D-SIM) images that achieved a sufficiently high resolution for us to discern the rod-shaped ultrathin MAVS filaments. These native thin filaments are on average ∼400 nm long and usually seen among mitochondrial membranes. In accordance with the cryoEM studies, point mutations that disrupted MAVS filament formation abrogated the redistribution and aggregation of MAVS on mitochondrial membrane and blocked the induction of interferon-β (IFNβ) in response to RNA virus infection. These results elucidate the structural mechanism for the formation of functional MAVS filaments.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>MAVS CARD forms three-stranded helical filaments</title><p>Our previous electron microscopic (EM) images of negatively stained specimens suggested that the MAVS CARD assembles into a filament-like structure in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Hou et al., 2011</xref>). To further uncover the molecular mechanism governing the MAVS CARD self-association, we utilized cryoEM to determine the molecular structure of the CARD filament. Flag-tagged MAVS CARD (residues 1–100) was expressed in HEK293T cells and purified to apparent homogeneity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). The purified protein formed filaments that eluted from gel filtration column in the void volume. CryoEM images of the purified filaments showed helical diffraction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>, left). We selected good EM micrographs and high-quality Falcon Direct Detector images, and built a large dataset for IHRSR analysis.

Different datasets were scaled and merged into a large set by their symmetry parameters (Δz; details in the ‘Materials and methods’). The final dataset contained 48,884 particles. Multivariate statistical analysis of the images revealed obvious helical properties and imperfection in some of the Eigen images (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref>). The IHRSR analysis of the dataset started with a featureless cylinder as the initial reference and converged to a stable solution (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C,D</xref>). After sorting the filaments to consider variations in helical symmetry and accounting for the filaments that may be tilted out of the horizontal plane by up to 15°, we calculated a final map from 15,366 boxed segments of filaments. The resolution of the map was estimated to be 9.6 Å from Fourier Shell Correlation (FSC) between two independently calculated 3D reconstructions (FSC = 0.5; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1E,F</xref>; and <xref ref-type="other" rid="media1">Video 1</xref>).

These features enabled us to determine a unique orientation of the crystal structure of the MAVS CARD (residues 1–93) in the cryoEM map. Recognition of these structural features also allowed for independent confirmation of the chirality to the cryoEM map because only the left-handed map allowed the three helices (H1, H4 and H3) to be positioned well into the density map without modification (<xref ref-type="other" rid="media2">Video 2</xref>). After the docking of these three helices, the 6<sup>th</sup> helix (H6) was naturally fit into a rod-shaped feature next to the H1. Rigid body refinement using SITUS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Wriggers, 2010</xref>) then locally optimized the agreement between the X-ray model and the cryoEM map (insets in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>; <xref ref-type="other" rid="media2">Video 2</xref>). Even though both H2 and H5 are contained in the density map, there is a small discrepancy between their orientations and the density features lining the inner pore of the filament (<xref ref-type="other" rid="media2">Video 2</xref>), suggesting a possible local rearrangement of the CARD domain upon filament formation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). Because the rearrangement of H2 and H5 is not well defined by the density features and there was a small density next to H5 that is not fully accounted for due to probably inexact segmentation of the helical density map into individual units, we did not use flexible fitting to optimize the local positions of these two helices. Helical symmetry operations and threefold symmetry were subsequently applied to generate a pseudo-atomic model for the CARD filament (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>; <xref ref-type="other" rid="media2">Video 2</xref>).</p><p>Overall the MAVS CARD filament adopts a densely packed structure containing three intertwined helical strands. Each turn of one helical strand contains 6.7 (360/53.6) CARD monomers.

This arrangement provides the structural basis for other domains to be connected to the filaments in the center, in keeping with previous observations that a N-terminal small ubiquitin-like modifier (SUMO) tag and other domains added to the C-terminus of CARD did not prevent filament formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Hou et al., 2011</xref>). There is some unoccupied density at the surface of the EM map next to the N- and C-termini of the docked CARD model. This may be attributed to the residual density from the N-terminal Flag tag and the additional seven residues at the C-terminus in the protein used for preparing the cryoEM specimens, but not in the crystal structure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Chemical basis for the assembly of MAVS CARD filaments</title><p>In the structural model of the filament, each MAVS CARD monomer directly interacts with four nearby monomers: two from the same strand and the other two respectively from two adjacent strands (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>).

The exact packing of these three residues and their contribution to the inter-strand interface require better resolution of the cryoEM map.</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>The intra-strand interaction interface</title><p>The cryoEM model predicts that the intra-strand interface is stabilized mainly by hydrophobic interaction or hydrogen bonds among residues F16, W56, Y30, D53 and L48 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). W56 is well conserved (leucine residue in horse). In the crystal structure of MAVS CARD, the side chain of W56 adopts different conformations, with a major conformer (60% occupancy) exposed to solvent and stacked against the ring structure of residue F16 in immediate vicinity (magnified view on the right side of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Potter et al., 2008</xref>). Y30 is a fairly conserved residue (histidine in cattle) that protrudes to the close proximity of W56 in the other CARD molecule at the interface. Even though the atomic details of the side chain packing are not fully resolved, the three ring structures from these three residues appear to be important for the intra-strand stability. Single alanine substitution of F16, W56 or Y30 almost completely abolished MAVS activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>), but mutations of some of the residues next to them (R52 and S49 as examples) had little effect (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). Interestingly, when we introduced different ring-containing residues to these positions, such as F16H, W56F, W56Y, Y30F and Y30H, we were able to largely rescue MAVS activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). These results support that the hydrophobic packing among the three ring-containing residues is important for the intra-strand interface. D53 is one helical turn below W56, and its side chain sits at the boundary between the aqueous phase and the hydrophobic core packing of F16, W56 and Y30.

MAVSΔProTM has ∼300 extra residues C-terminal to its CARD. Some of these extra residues most likely contribute to the peripheral densities in the cryoEM map. These extra densities were clearly visible in the class averages calculated from the aligned filament images (red arrowheads in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1D</xref>). Because of the intrinsic disorder in the segment between the CARD and the TM domain of MAVS, the majority of the extra residues did not produce significant density in the cryoEM map. A key conclusion from this comparison is that the CARD filament is in the center of the MAVS aggregates and the rest of the molecule is connected to the peripheral surface of the filament. Because the C-terminal TM domain is integrated in the mitochondrial membrane, the CARD filament and the membrane anchor the two ends of each MAVS molecule so that the intervening region is exposed to recruit cytosolic signaling effector molecules such as the TRAF (tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated factor) proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Liu et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-8"><title>CARD is crucial for the MAVS filament formation in cells</title><p>To visualize the filament formation of full-length MAVS, we stably reconstituted <italic>Mavs-null</italic> murine embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) with Flag-tagged wild-type MAVS or its mutants.

Like endogenous protein, Flag-tagged MAVS was properly localized to the mitochondrial membranes, as demonstrated by its co-localization with either MitoTracker or TOM20, a 20 kDa subunit of the translocase in the outer mitochondrial membrane (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1 fig5s3">Figure 5—figure supplement 1, 3A</xref>, Mock). Infection by Sendai virus induced the redistribution of MAVS protein and the formation of densely packed, speckled MAVS puncta on the surface of mitochondria, along with the nuclear translocation of NF-κB subunit p65 and induction of interferon-β (IFNβ; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1 fig5s3">Figure 5—figure supplement 1, 3</xref>). In addition, Sendai virus also induced MAVS aggregation, which was detected by semi-denaturing detergent agarose electrophoresis (SDD-AGE; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s3">Figure 5—figure supplement 3D</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Hou et al., 2011</xref>).

The MAVS aggregates in cells are indeed rod-shaped clusters that may contain MAVS molecules from multiple mitochondria. The CARD filaments form the central elements of the MAVS aggregates, and can promote their own growth by attracting new CARDs into the pre-poised interaction interfaces. The filaments are localized on the mitochondrial surface and the MAVS TM domains are embedded inside the outer mitochondrial membranes. These two ends of each MAVS molecule provide important spatial constraints that may force the intervening coiled sequence to be well extended and exposed for recruiting down-stream signaling molecules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Liu et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). Bioinformatic analysis suggests that the middle segment of MAVS forms random coils, which, if present by themselves in aqueous phase, would not likely be fully extended and thus may deter efficient binding of multiple positive or negative regulators of MAVS. The spatial arrangement between the CARD filament and the mitochondrial membrane provides a good solution to this problem of intrinsic disorder. The prion-like filament formation of MAVS thus uses very different chemistry than other prion proteins, and orchestrates the signaling domains of MAVS into a high-affinity platform for rapid and efficient signaling.<fig id="fig6" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.01489.018</object-id><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><title>A working model for MAVS activation by RIG-I/RNA complexes.</title><p>Detection of 5’-pppRNA by RIG-I or dsRNA by MDA5 or RIG-I triggers the formation of RIG-I (or MDA5)/RNA/polyUb complex.

In the resting state, MAVS CARD is sequestered and has a low probability of forming polymers. The RIG-I (or MDA5)/RNA/polyUb complexes stabilize the MAVS CARDs in the exposed state and bring three copies together to initiate the filament formation. Once started, a short MAVS CARD filament promotes its own elongation by attracting more MAVS CARDs into the assembly.

These interfaces maintain the tight and dense packing of individual CARDs in the filaments, which, together with the strong inter-strand electrostatic interactions, probably make the filaments detergent-resistant. During filament formation, there are counter-acting forces, such as decrease in entropy and possible structural adjustment at the pore-lining surface of the CARD filament (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>; <xref ref-type="other" rid="media2">Video 2</xref>), which would increase the energy level of the filaments. The net decrease in free energy supporting the filament formation is due to the four interaction interfaces for every CARD. But the counter-balance of these positive and negative energy terms likely makes the filaments fairly sensitive to mutations. Indeed, the four interfaces appear to be dominated by hot spots because point mutations in multiple positions are capable of destabilizing the filaments. The open ends of the CARD filaments provide three binding sites for each incoming CARD molecule. Because of the net gain in free energy for each CARD, the longer filaments are expected to be more stable than the shorter ones, leading to the filaments that are up to 10 microns long under cryoEM conditions. Inside virus-infected cells, the average length of the rod-shaped MAVS clusters is merely ∼400 nm. The physical length of MAVS filaments in cells may be limited by the number of MAVS molecules in each mitochondrion and by the dynamics of mitochondrial fusion and fission (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Onoguchi et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>).</p><p>The three-stranded helical filaments at the center of the MAVS aggregates and the complete separation of three CARD units in each layer suggest that a successful initiation of filament formation needs at least two independent molecules (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). These independent molecules need to be juxtaposed in order to poise three CARDs to form the first layer of the filament. The tandem CARDs in one RIG-I molecule are restrained by a short α-helix running between them, and are less likely to serve this role. There are two possible scenarios for two RIG-I/RNA complexes to join for initiation: (1) Two individual RIG-I/RNA monomers can come together; or (2) RIG-I molecules may form dimers or oligomers along short duplex RNAs. Crystallographic studies of RIG-I (full-length or truncated) have led to the proposal that the RIG-I/RNA complex might act as monomers in conjunction with polyubiquitin to activate MAVS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Civril et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Hild et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Jiang et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Kowalinski et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Lee et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Luo et al., 2012</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">2013</xref>). Should two or more RIG-I/short RNA monomeric complexes be able to nucleate a MAVS filament, we would expect the short RNAs (10–17 bp) used in the crystallographic studies to activate the pathway. But the published data did not lead to a consensus on the activities of these short RNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Fujita, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Schlee et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Marq et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Kohlway et al., 2013</xref>). Recent biochemical data showed that RIG-I tandem CARDs and K63 polyubiquitin form relatively stable 4:4 oligomers, which may nucleate the helical filamentous structure formed by the MAVS CARDs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Jiang et al., 2012</xref>). In a similar fashion, the RIG-I (or MDA5)/RNA helical complex may present multiple CARD domains on its periphery where multiple MAVS filaments may be initiated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Berke and Modis, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Wu et al., 2013</xref>). Moreover, negative-stain EM studies have suggested either parallel or anti-parallel dimers to be the active form of RLRs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Murali et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Ranjith-Kumar et al., 2009</xref>). Structural studies of active RIG-I-RNA and RIG-I-MAVS complexes are needed to provide a detailed mechanism by which RIG-I initiates MAVS polymerization.</p><p>Protein oligomerization mediated by the death domain (DD) superfamily, which include CARDs, has been studied in multiple signaling proteins. For example, the helical assembly of MyDDosome was proposed to use three different types of DD–DD interfaces (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Lin et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Gay et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kersse et al., 2011</xref>), none of which share any similarity to the intra- or inter-strand interfaces in the MAVS CARD filament (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). The MyDDosome formation is thought to bring multiple kinase domains of the IRAKs together for efficient activation. This affinity-enhancing scheme for recruiting downstream effectors is essentially the same as in the MAVS filaments. The much longer MAVS filaments would thus entail a significant amplification of the signal that nucleates their formation and enhance the RLR sensitivity to viral RNAs. Because TRAF2 and TRAF3 both form trimers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Park et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Ni et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Zheng et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Napetschnig and Wu, 2013</xref>), MAVS filaments may enhance the TRAF-MAVS interaction through increased avidity, and boost the signaling efficacy significantly.</p><p>The redistribution of MAVS molecules on the surface of mitochondria and the possible bridging of multiple mitochondria by the MAVS filaments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5 fig6">Figures 5, 6</xref>) were apparently a result of the filament formation. The filament growth needs to bring randomly distributed MAVS into close vicinity. The limited number of MAVS molecules per mitochondrion suggests that the long MAVS filaments may be contributed by multiple mitochondria. The clustered MAVS molecules become sequestered during the dynamic mitochondrial fission and fusion cycles. The fusion of sequestered clusters leads to the redistribution of MAVS from being ubiquitously present in almost all mitochondria to being segregated on a small number of them. The self-promoting nature of in vivo MAVS filaments may be the driving force that leads to almost all MAVS being incorporated into filaments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). Further analyses of MAVS redistribution and its correlation with mitochondrial fusion/fission dynamics by live-cell imaging and computational analysis may provide more detailed insights into this process.</p><p>In summary, our structural and functional studies of the MAVS polymerization revealed the unique three-stranded filaments and identified the interaction interfaces that drive the formation of self-perpetuating prion-like fibers. The structural organization of the MAVS filaments on mitochondrial membranes is distinct from other oligomeric assemblies such as the MyDDosome and β-amyloid prions. This virtually irreversible polymerization of MAVS provides a highly sensitive and robust mechanism of immune response. Such digital (i.e., all or none) response allows the organisms to defend against noxious agents such as lethal infections.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Reagents and standard methods</title><p>Mouse antibody against Flag-tag (M2) and M2-conjugated agarose were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, MO); rabbit antibodies against TOM20 and the p65 subunit of NF-κB were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Dallas, TX); Alexa Fluor 488 conjugated goat anti-mouse and anti-rabbit antibodies, Alexa Fluor 568 conjugated goat anti-mouse antibody, and Alexa Fluor 633 conjugated goat anti-rabbit antibody were from Invitrogen (Carlsbad, CA).

After the specimens were transferred into and kept frozen inside the JEOL 2200FS FEG electron microscope, images were recorded on SO163 films (Eastman Kodak, Rochester, NY) with a nominal magnification of 60,000 × under low-dose conditions (∼20 e<sup>−</sup>/Å<sup>2</sup>). A Gatan K2 Summit Direct Detector (Gatan, Pleasanton, CA) was used for testing specimens in the later phase of the project. A total of 358 films were developed using full-strength D19 (Kodak) solution. Micrographs were digitized with a PhotoScan film Scanner (Z/I Imaging GmbH, Germany) at a step size of 7.0 μm.

The density of filaments in the cryo specimens was fairly low so that we had to collect a large number of images. After the evaluation of their power spectra, 1,088 Falcon images were selected, and a total of 18,500 short filaments were boxed out for analysis.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>EM image processing</title><p>The analysis of the datasets of both the MAVS CARD filaments and the MAVSΔProTM filaments followed the IHRSR method developed by Dr Edward Egelman’s group at University of Virginia. The method was implemented in SPIDER. Dr Egelman kindly provided the programs in SPIDER, and the HSEARCH_LORENTZ/HIMPOSE programs. All SPIDER programs were rewritten in order to run with SPIDER Version 19.08 in a Linux cluster that runs the Redhat Enterprise 5.0. Besides, new SPIDER programs were written to refine the map for out-of-plane tilting of the filaments and for local optimization in angle assignment. Extensive technical details could be found in reference (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Mukherjee et al., 2014</xref>). Briefly, from all images obtained in one session of data collection, the filaments were boxed out into 200 pixel segments (∼45.2 nm long at the specimen level) with 90% overlapping between neighboring ones from the same long filament. Filaments shorter than 200 pixels were discarded. The filament helical axis was always positioned roughly along the Y-axis. The defocus and astigmatism information for each image were determined by CTFFIND2 in the MRC package (IMAGE2010). The filament particles (boxed segments out of the raw filaments) were phase-flipped and band-pass filtered. We also tested the Wiener-filtering with a constant of 0.2 (1/SNR), and did not find significant difference from the phase-flipped dataset. Afterwards the filaments from different images out of one cryo session were pooled together as a subdataset. To start the analysis, we made sure that the summed power spectrum of each subdataset showed a faint (usually fuzzy) layer line at the position of the first meridional line (layer line 9; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1B</xref>). The diameter of individual filaments was estimated from the raw images. A cylindrical volume that had the estimated diameter was generated in SPIDER and projected along Y-axis to be used as the first reference. The individual filaments were compared with the projection from the cylindrical volume. The shift in X-direction for each boxed segment (particle) was rounded to the nearest integer and applied to center the particle horizontally. The total power spectrum was calculated from all X-centered particles in the dataset. The four layer lines (LL = 1, 4, 5, and 9) were measured to prepare a (LL, Z*) table. The peak positions were indexed to make a table of (n, R). The n was estimated from a numeric table of Bessel functions from 0 to 14<sup>th</sup> orders. The helical indexing led to the initial guess of a 3-start helix (n = 3 or −3), with some uncertainty of a 4-start one (n = 4 or −4). We then tested the refinement for both a 3-start helix and 4-start one separately, and found that the model with a 3-start helical symmetry was able to converge to a 3D map with the right axial rise, but not the one with a 4-start symmetry (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C,D,G</xref>). Full refinement with n = −4 was done to confirm this point. We therefore concluded that n = 3 was probably right (n = −3 is the mirror and equally possible). With this information, we did the initial analysis of all subdatasets from different cryo sessions independently in order to obtain the rotation angle (ΔΦ) and the axial rise (Δz) for each subdataset. The axial rises for individual datasets collected at different magnifications or from different microscopes were brought together and compared to find the right parameters for interpolating the images in the different datasets and scaled them all together into one large dataset that contained 48,884 particles. The refinement of the large dataset against a cylindrical volume of a diameter of 90 Å quickly led to a stable solution (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C,D</xref>) with the symmetry parameters of ΔΦ = 53.6° and Δz = 16.5 Å. To test the robustness of the parameters, we also introduced 1.0 Å deviation to the axial rise in the middle of the refinement, and observed the quick recovery of the refinement to the stable solution (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1D</xref>). This test suggested that the solution was quite stable.</p><p>When we performed multivariate statistical analysis and hierarchical classification of the large dataset in IMAGIC, the Eigen images clearly showed that local bending and symmetry breakdown (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref>) appeared to be the major defects in the dataset, which might have been a limiting factor to a better resolution. We tried to eliminate a small fraction of images (∼20%) that corresponded to those class-averaged images showing clearly weak symmetry or distortions. But after that, we still saw distortions in the Eigen images calculated from the rest of the images. We therefore did not eliminate ∼50% or more of the data to examine the resolution. After an initial refinement, we sorted the data into nine bins by aligning them against models whose symmetry parameters are centered around (ΔΦ = 53.6°, Δz = 16.5 Å) with ΔΔΦ = 2.0° and ΔΔz = 1.5 Å. The distribution of the particles into these 9 bins followed a Gaussian distribution, and the central bin had 20,825 particles and was selected for further refinement where the out-of-plane tilting was refined in 2° steps to a maximum of 15°. After 140 runs the final map was stable and the symmetry well converged to ΔΦ = 53.6° and Δz = 16.8 Å. The final map was calculated from 15,366 boxed segments. The map after IHRSR was corrected by an average CTF envelope calculated from the CTF parameters for all images used in the final map calculation. After the FSC calculation (see next paragraph), a negative B-factor of −1,100 Å<sup>2</sup> was applied to sharpen the final map to 9.6 Å.</p><p>To estimate the resolution by FSC, the sorted dataset (20,825 particles) was separated into top and bottom two halves. Two completely independent volumes were obtained by refining the two half datasets against a cylinder. The two refinements starting with different initial symmetry parameters converged to almost exactly the same symmetry parameters: ΔΦ = 53.61° and Δz = 16.68 Å for the first, and ΔΦ = 53.66° and Δz = 16.66 Å for the second. The two volumes without symmetry imposition were aligned in UCSF Chimera (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Pettersen et al., 2004</xref>). The second volume was shifted by 0.225 pixels and rotated by −28.96° around Y-axis before the FSC calculation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1E</xref>). The estimated resolution at FSC = 0.5 was 9.6 Å. Because of almost exactly the same symmetry in two volumes, we worried about noise correlation and did not use the 0.143 threshold for our resolution estimate. As a control, we calculated the FSC before the two volumes were aligned, and found that the FSC quickly fell down to below 0.1 at around 40 Å. To confirm that the final map recapitulates the characteristic of the original dataset, we calculated the summed power spectrum of projections from the map at 360 different orientations around its helical axis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>, right). The power spectrum showed the same patterns as in the total power of the raw dataset (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>, left), with layer lines extending to higher resolution range.</p><p>Analysis of the MAVSΔProTM dataset followed the same procedure.

A narrow energy slit of 5 eV was used together with a small objective aperture (50 microns) to enhance image contrast. The data were collected at a nominal magnification of 42,000 ×, corresponding to 2.7 Å per pixel on the K2 camera. The tilt range spans from −60 to +60° with a step size of 3°.

Your article has been favorably evaluated by a Senior editor and 3 reviewers, one of whom, Wesley Sundquist, is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors.</p><p>The Reviewing editor and the other reviewers discussed their comments before we reached this decision, and the Reviewing editor has assembled the following comments to help you prepare a revised submission. As you will see below, the editor and reviewers raise some questions as to the reliability of some of the key findings of the paper. As such, please respond to us by email in advance of a resubmission regarding how you propose to respond to these comments. This will allow the editors and reviewers to discuss your response, and provide you with feedback before you revise the manuscript.</p><p>The authors present a moderate-resolution cryo-EM reconstruction of the helical filaments formed by the CARD domain of MAVS and a lower-resolution reconstruction of filaments of the nearly intact cytoplasmic fragment that shows that the CARD domain polymer forms the core of the MAVS polymer. The reconstructions reveal that the CARD domain forms a left handed, three-stranded helix, and the CARD crystal structure has been docked into the 9.6 Å resolution map to produce a pseudoatomic model of the parallel triple helix and models for the different protein-protein interfaces that stabilize the structure. The model indicates that the helix is stabilized by two different types of interfaces, a hydrophilic intrastrand interface and a hydrophobic interstrand interface. A series of experiments support the accuracy and relevance of the structure, including extensive mutational analyses of the two major protein-protein interfaces and SR-SIM imaging of the tube-shaped MAVS polymers formed in cells.</p><p>The structure of the “activated” MAVS polymer is certainly of great general interest across multiple disciplines because this is the complex that responds to cytoplasmic antiviral sensors and initiates antiviral signaling cascades that lead to production of type I interferons and cytokines. The work is generally of high technical quality, and the extent of supporting experimentation is impressive. The work is therefore, in principle, appropriate for publication in <italic>eLife</italic>. Our two major concerns (described below) are: 1) it is difficult to be absolutely certain of the veracity of the reconstruction and pseudoatomic model, and 2) It is important to prove, unambiguously, that mitochondrial clustering and tube formation correlate with antiviral signaling and with the ability of MAVS to polymerize in vitro.</p><p>Critical points that must be addressed:</p><p>1) The CARD and MAVS(deltaTM) reconstructions appear to be carefully done and reasonable, but require additional validation. The correctness of the assigned symmetry and structure should be further demonstrated by providing supplemental figures that show: a) asymmetric maps with <italic>no</italic> symmetry imposed, and 2D class averages for the MAVS(deltaTM) analysis. b) Comparative residuals for the IHRSR experiments from different starting models (2-start, 3-start, and 4-start) and the power spectra for the translationally aligned boxes overlaid or displayed side-by-side with the power spectra calculated from projections of the final reconstructions. c) Experimental definition of the handedness of the polymers either by tilted images or rotary shadowing. d) A more extensive discussion of the resolution of the structure, e.g., does <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1H</xref> – the power spectrum of the final model – reveal layer lines beyond LL=9 at ∼1/17 Angstroms? Do lower contoured maps clearly show tubes of density for the different helices?</p><p>2) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1G</xref> do not adequately illustrate how well (or badly) the docked CARD domains fit into the map, and this is an important issue particularly because the CARD domains are globular, because the authors argue that the internal density requires a rearrangement of helices H2 and H5, and because there is unassigned density on the tube exterior. Ideally, this would be in the form of 3D movies that show the fit of the crystal structures into full and segmented density.</p><p>3) The SR-SIM experiments in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref> lack a negative control, and this should be added (i.e., a reconstruction of a non-functional mutant such as the E26A mutation). Alternatively, the authors could test a more extensive set of mutants in the confocal experiments shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>. The important issue is to prove, unambiguously, that mitochondrial clustering and tube formation correlate with antiviral signaling and with the ability of MAVS to polymerize in vitro.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.01489.021</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>1) The CARD and MAVS(deltaTM) reconstructions appear to be carefully done and reasonable, but require additional validation.

The revised version has the 2D class averages and two views of the 3D map before symmetry imposition in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1D and 1E</xref> respectively. We also calculated the power spectrum from the 360 projections of the final 3D reconstruction and compared it with that of the dataset in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1B</xref>.</p><p>b) In the raw dataset the meridional line (layer line 9) was visible, which provided a reliable estimate of the axial rise, and a decoupling of the two helical parameters in our search for the right ones. We tested 4-start helical symmetry previously and were not able to converge to the right axial rise. We started with different rotational angles from 40 to 51 degrees, and did not find one that works for n=4. One example is now shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1G</xref>. We therefore ruled out the possibility of n=4. Based on the indexing of the layer lines and peaks, we did not find that a 2-start model was a possibility. As the reviewers requested, we tested the 2-start helical symmetry, but the refinement did not converge and the axial rise went continuously from the correct 16.7 Å to the incorrect 19.5 Å after 50 runs. The reviewers asked about the calculations of residuals with “xhelicals”. We looked into it. In the new distribution of the IHRSR, this program was neither recompiled nor tested. When we used it to search for symmetry, it did not produce the right results as the well-tested “hsearch_lorentz”. We therefore did not use it in our analysis. But this does not change our conclusion that n=3 is the right rotational symmetry.</p><p>In the revision, we have compared the power spectra of the raw dataset and the averaged power of the 360 projections from the final 3D map. These are now in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—supplement 1A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1B</xref>.</p><p>c) The reviewers asked for independent verification of the handedness of the filament. We conducted electron cryo-tomography (cryo-ET) and freeze-etch experiments of the frozen filaments. The data by freeze-etch EM are not available due to the delayed scheduling of the experiments to be done out of our campus. The cryo-ET data are presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2B</xref>. It showed fairly conclusively that the filaments are indeed left-handed.</p><p>d) A separate evaluation of the resolution is an excellent idea. As suggested, we now displayed the averaged power spectrum from 360 projections calculated from the 3D cryoEM map rotated in 1-degree step along the helical axis. Our rationale for this test is based on the fact that the helical filament is a 1D crystal, and the layer lines should extend horizontally to the resolution range we estimated from FSC. In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>, the right panel showed the extension of the layer lines horizontally up to ∼8.2 angstroms (red circle). We used the SQUARE root function (modulus of the structural factors) to enhance the contrast of the weak lines here.</p><p>In ‘<xref ref-type="other" rid="media2">Movie 2</xref>’, we made a separate presentation at a higher contour level to show that some rod-shaped densities overlap with specific alpha-helices that were used to guide our structural docking in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2A</xref>.</p><p><italic>2)</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1"><italic>Figures 1C</italic></xref> <italic>and</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1"><italic>Figure 1—figure supplement 1G</italic></xref> <italic>do not adequately illustrate how well (or badly) the docked CARD domains fit into the map, and this is an important issue particularly because the CARD domains are globular, because the authors argue that the internal density requires a rearrangement of helices H2 and H5, and because there is unassigned density on the tube exterior. Ideally, this would be in the form of 3D movies that show the fit of the crystal structures into full and segmented density</italic>.</p><p>Thanks for this excellent suggestion. We generated two 3D movies. The first one shows the cryoEM map at different orientations and the segmentation of one unit. The second illustrates the docking of the CARD X-ray structural model into the density map. It also shows the positioning of specific alpha-helices (H1, H4 and H3 as well as H6) into the density of one unit, the small discrepancies for H2 and H5 at the side facing the inner pore of the MAVS CARD filament, and the rod-shaped densities at slightly higher threshold, which overlap with H1, H4 and H6. The last part of <xref ref-type="other" rid="media2">Movie 2</xref> also presented the assembly of individual CARD domains into a helical filament.</p><p><italic>3) The SR-SIM experiments in</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5"><italic>Figure 5</italic></xref> <italic>lack a negative control, and this should be added (i.e., a reconstruction of a non-functional mutant such as the E26A mutation). Alternatively, the authors could test a more extensive set of mutants in the confocal experiments shown in</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1"><italic>Figure 5—figure supplement 1</italic></xref><italic>. The important issue is to prove, unambiguously, that mitochondrial clustering and tube formation correlate with antiviral signaling and with the ability of MAVS to polymerize in vitro</italic>.</p><p>This is a very important point. We have addressed it from five different aspects.</p><p>First, we prepared <italic>Mavs-null</italic> MEFs stably expressing an extensive set of MAVS mutants. The confocal images of more mutants (E26A, E80A, F16A, F16H and Y30A) are now in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1 fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 1 and 2</xref>. E80A serves as a control for the electrostatic interaction and E26A is a loss-of-function mutation at the inter-strand electrostatic interface. The formation of bright puncta of MAVS correlated well with the interferon production assay in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>. For the intra-strand interface, F16A and Y30A are two loss of function mutants and F16H is functional as we found in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>. The 4-color confocal images also allowed us to evaluate the correlation between the formation of bright MAVS puncta and the nuclear translocation of p65 (the signaling of MAVS). These data support strong correlations among the filament formation through the two identified interfaces, the MAVS puncta formation in cells and the MAVS signaling (through the activation of NF-κB).</p><p>Second, as the reviewers suggested, we statistically analyzed the percentage of cells with p65 nuclear translocation (positive MAVS signaling) that displayed the formation of large bright MAVS puncta using <italic>Mavs-null</italic> MEFs reconstituted with wild-type MAVS. Among cells that were positive in p65 nuclear translocation, more than 70% of them had strong MAVS puncta formation in confocal imaging. The new data are presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s3">Figure 5—figure supplement 3B</xref>. They strike a statistically significant and strong correlation between puncta formation and MAVS signaling.</p><p>Third, the mutants used for the confocal experiments were tested for their capability of rescuing MAVS signaling in the <italic>Mavs-null</italic> MEFs. q-RT-PCR experiments showed that the viral infection induced IFN-beta production in those cells correlated well with their ability (or inability) to form bright puncta in the confocal imaging. These data are in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s3">Figure 5—figure supplement 3C</xref>.</p><p>Fourth, based on the results in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B &amp; C</xref> in the previous version, we have altogether established <italic>Mavs-null</italic> MEFs stably expressing E26A, R64A, R65A, F16A, Y30A as the loss-of-function mutations, and E80A, L48A, F16H, W56Y, Y30F and R77A as negative controls. We utilized SDD-AGE to analyze the formation of MAVS aggregates from mitochondrial extracts in those cells after viral infection. The results agree well with the other assays, and are presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s3">Figure 5—figure supplement 3D</xref>. They argue strongly the tight coupling between the CARD filament formation and the MAVS aggregate formation in virus-infected cells.</p><p>Finally, as the reviewers suggested, in addition to the mutants that we have tested in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B &amp; C</xref> in the previous version, we have tested almost all conserved charged residues for their effects on virus-induced IFN-beta production in cells. Mutations of the surface-exposed residues (R52A, E70A, R77A, E80A, D86A and E87A) that are not involved in the inter-strand interaction did not impair MAVS signaling. On the other hand, R41, R43 and D40, which are close to the positively charged patch of R64 and R65 at the electrostatic interface (inter-strand), inhibited MAVS signaling. Their effects and their positions in the helical filament are added to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>. These data are now rather complete and suggest that the electrostatic interaction between strands have relatively high specificity. It argues strongly that the filament formation through the electrostatic interface is critically correlated with the MAVS signaling (interferon production).</p><p>We believe that these new data together with those in the first submission lever compelling evidence that in virus-infected cells the MAVS puncta formation, MAVS antiviral signaling and MAVS polymerization are tightly coupled.</p></body></sub-article></article>
