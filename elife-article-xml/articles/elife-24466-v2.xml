AGOs use miRNAs as guides to slice target mRNAs to produce truncated 5' and 3' RNA fragments. The 5' cleaved RNA fragments are marked with uridylation for degradation. Here, we identified novel cofactors of Arabidopsis AGOs, named RICE1 and RICE2. RICE proteins specifically degraded single-strand (ss) RNAs in vitro; but neither miRNAs nor miRNA*s in vivo. RICE1 exhibited a DnaQ-like exonuclease fold and formed a homohexamer with the active sites located at the interfaces between RICE1 subunits. Notably, ectopic expression of catalytically-inactive RICE1 not only significantly reduced miRNA levels; but also increased 5' cleavage RISC fragments with extended uridine tails. We conclude that RICEs act to degrade uridylated 5’ products of AGO cleavage to maintain functional RISC. Our study also suggests a possible link between decay of cleaved target mRNAs and miRNA stability in RISC.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.24466.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.24466.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.24466.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>DNA contains all the information needed to build a body, yet molecules of RNA carry these instructions to the sites in the cell where they can be used. Cells must control how much RNA they produce in order to ensure that they develop properly and can respond well to their environment. RNA silencing refers to a collection of mechanisms that use smaller RNA molecules called microRNAs to incapacitate certain RNA molecules and selectively switch off the genes that encode them to stop more from being made.</p><p>One key player in RNA silencing is the multi-protein complex called RISC, which contains microRNA and a group of proteins called AGOs. Once the microRNA has identified its RNA target, the AGOs cut the RNA into two pieces, known as the 5’ cleavage fragment and 3’ cleavage fragment. The two resulting fragments need to be cleared away swiftly, so that the RISC can move on to the next target. While it was known how the 3’ cleavage fragment was removed, it was less clear how the 5’ cleavage fragment was dealt with.</p><p>Previous studies had shown that the 5’ cleavage fragment was marked with a chemical called uridine, which somehow signals to the RISC that this fragment needs to be destroyed. Now, using biochemical techniques, Zhang et al. have identified two new proteins in the model plant Arabidopsis that attach to the AGO proteins and degrade the 5’ cleavage fragments that are marked with uridine. The two proteins are named RICE1 and RICE2.</p><p>Zhang et al. then analyzed the three-dimensional shape of RICE1 and identified the ‘active’ region that is responsible for degrading the RNA fragments. When these active regions were blocked, the microRNA levels were low, but the uridine-marked 5’ cleavage fragments were high. Also, the RISC complex could not work properly, which lead to problems during the development of the plant. These results suggest that RICE proteins degrade 5’ cleavage fragments modified with uridine to activate RISC.</p><p>RICE proteins are conserved between plants and animals, and it is likely that their counterparts in humans will have a similar role to the plant proteins. The next challenge will be to explore how RICE proteins work in more details, which may lead to new ways to manipulate the levels of microRNAs to change the architecture of the plant and to improve their tolerance to various stress conditions.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.24466.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.24466.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>argonaute</kwd><kwd>RICE</kwd><kwd>exoribonuclease</kwd><kwd>miRNAs</kwd><kwd>RISC</kwd><kwd>uridylation</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd><italic>A. thaliana</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000001</institution-id><institution>National Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>CAREER MCB-1253369</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Zhang</surname><given-names>Xiuren</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100004917</institution-id><institution>Cancer Prevention and Research Institute of Texas</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>RP160822</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Zhang</surname><given-names>Xiuren</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The authors declare that there was no funding for this work.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>AGO protein-interacting exoribonucleases clear RNA induced silencing complex (RISC)-resulting 5' cleavage products in time to recycle RISC and miRNAs.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>RNA silencing is a fundamental mechanism for regulating gene expression in diverse biological contexts in eukaryotes. The key silencing effector is a ribonucleoprotein complex (RISC) that is composed of AGOs and small RNAs (sRNAs). sRNAs, including small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) and microRNAs (miRNAs), are produced by Dicers or Dicer-like enzymes as duplexes from longer fully-complementary double-stranded (ds) RNAs, or from ds RNAs with imperfectly-folded hairpin structures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Achkar et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kim et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Sanei and Chen, 2015</xref>). Subsequently, the sRNA duplexes are loaded into AGO proteins; and one strand (siRNA passenger strand or miRNA*) is ejected whereas the other (siRNA guide strand or miRNA) is retained in RISC. By using the retained sRNAs as guides, AGO proteins specify the correct target mRNAs and repress gene expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chandradoss et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Salomon et al., 2015</xref>). For targets with partial complementarity, silencing is initially primed through translational repression and followed by mRNA destabilization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bazzini et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Djuranovic et al., 2012</xref>). Degradation of such an mRNA target is accomplished by a combination of deadenylation, decapping, and subsequently by 5'-to-3' exonucleolytic decay (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Jonas and Izaurralde, 2015</xref>).</p><p>For highly complementary targets, RISC activity generally results in 5’ and 3’ cleavage fragments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bartel, 2009</xref>). Both 5’ and 3 cleavage products undergo various decay processes. In mammals, the 3’ cleavage fragments are canonically degraded in the 5’ to 3’ direction by an exonuclease 1 (XRN1). In Arabidopsis, the 3’ fragment is accumulated at a higher level in loss-of-function mutant of <italic>XRN4</italic> compared with the amount in wild type (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Souret et al., 2004</xref>). Since Arabidopsis <italic>XRN4</italic> is an ortholog of mammalian <italic>XRN1</italic>, the 5’-to-3’ decay of RISC 3’ cleavage fragments appears to be implemented through an evolutionarily conserved mechanism.</p><p>RISC 5’ cleavage fragments turn over rapidly reflected by the relative inability to detect them when compared with 3’ cleavage fragments. However, the RNA decay mechanism for 5’ cleavage fragments has remained unclear. Previous studies showed that 5’ cleavage fragments from miRNA-RISC activity are typically uridylated at their 3’ ends throughout eukaryotes; and that this nontemplated modification is a signature license for immediate decay (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Ren et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Shen and Goodman, 2004</xref>). In human cells, the uridylation of the RISC 5’ cleavage products is fulfilled through the terminal uridylyl transferases (TUTs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Lim et al., 2014</xref>). The uridylation promotes decapping of RISC 5’ products, and subsequently 5’-to-3’ exonucleolytic decay by XRN1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Song and Kiledjian, 2007</xref>). In Arabidopsis, HEN1 suppressor 1 (HESO1) uridylates the 5’ fragments and stimulates their degradation, since a few 5’-cleavage fragments display modest overaccumulation in <italic>heso1</italic> mutants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Ren et al., 2014</xref>). Notably, HESO1 was initially recovered as a miRNA nucleotidyl transferase. HESO1 functions together with UTP:RNA uridylyl transferase one to promote miRNA degradation in absence of canonical miRNA methylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Ren et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Tu et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Wang et al., 2015</xref>). In Arabidopsis, different pathways might account for RNA decay of RISC 5’ cleavage fragments. It has been shown that 5’ cleavage fragments accumulate in <italic>xrn4</italic> mutant in Arabidopsis; and obviously XRN4 catalyzes 5’-to-3’ degradation of the fragments in a way similar to clearing RISC 3’ fragments. The RNA exosome also appears to contribute to degrade the 5’ cleavage fragments because their abundance is increased in the loss-of-function mutant of <italic>SKI2</italic>/<italic>3</italic>/<italic>8</italic>, Arabidopsis orthologs of RNA exosome subunits in yeast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Branscheid et al., 2015</xref>). In contrast, accumulation of RISC 5’ fragments is not enhanced in the mutants of additional subunits and even an <italic>Rrp6</italic> ortholog, a core 3’-to-5’ exonuclease in the RNA exosome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Branscheid et al., 2015</xref>). Therefore, whether these pathways represent the totality of mechanisms for degradation of uridylated 5’ cleavage fragments remains elusive. </p><p> miRNA targets not only serve as substrates for RISC activity, but also influence RISC function and miRNA stability. A pioneering study in plants shows that target mimicry can act as an endogenous decoy for miRNAs, resulting in unproductive RISC and miRNA destabilization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Franco-Zorrilla et al., 2007</xref>). Similar phenomena including miRNA sponges and competing endogenous mRNA (ceRNAs) that contain multiple miRNA-binding sites can modulate RISC activity and effectively inhibit miRNA function in animal systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Ebert and Sharp, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Salmena et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Rubio-Somoza et al., 2011</xref>). In these organisms, miRNAs recognize target mRNAs through seed pairing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bartel, 2009</xref>). Extensive pairing of 3’ miRNAs to target RNAs triggers miRNA trimming and tailing and an accompanying loss of mature miRNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Ameres et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Xie et al., 2012</xref>). In human cells, highly complementary target RNAs destabilize the RISC and accelerate release of the guide RNA from AGO2 whereas partially complementary targets attenuate unloading of sRNAs and increase their stability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">De et al., 2013</xref>). Due to the presence of prevalent mismatches between the 3’ end of a guide RNA and its target in mammals, the majority of identified miRNA targets do not destabilize the interaction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bartel, 2009</xref>). In contrast, plant miRNAs are nearly perfectly complementary to their target RNAs; and miRNA-RISC canonically functions to cleave target RNAs despite coherent presence of translation repression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Li et al., 2013</xref>). However, whether RISC cleavage products regulate RISC function and miRNA abundance is unknown.</p><p>Arabidopsis encodes nine functional AGOs, among which, AGO1 is a principal contributor to RNA silencing as it recruits most miRNAs, and a variety of siRNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Mi et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Wang et al., 2011</xref>). AGO10 is the closest genetic paralog of AGO1, but functions to specifically sequester a group of miRNAs, miR165/166, to antagonize their silencing activity through AGO1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Zhu et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Zhou et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Yu et al., 2017</xref>). Here, we successfully used proteomics analysis to identify a novel AGO10-bound partner, RICE1. We showed that RICE1 and its genetic paralog, RICE2, interacted with both AGO10 and AGO1, suggesting a common role in regulation of miRNA-RISC activity. RICE1 and RICE2 function as 3’-to-5’ exoribonucleases that specifically degraded ss RNAs. We found that overexpression of <italic>RICE</italic>s increased miRNA levels, whereas downregulation of <italic>RICE1</italic> and <italic>RICE2</italic> through artificial miRNA technology decreased miRNA accumulation. We also determined the crystal structure of RICE1 and observed that it formed a homohexameric ring with the active sites uniquely embedded at the interface between monomers. We further pinpointed the critical residues required for RICE1 catalytic activity and oligomerization. Whereas oligomerization-defective RICE1 variants were unstable in vivo, introduction of catalytically-inactive RICE1 significantly reduced miRNA levels in vivo, reminiscent of loss-of-function mutants of <italic>rice1 rice2</italic>. Importantly, catalytically inactive RICE1 also caused the accumulation of longer uridylated 5’ cleavage RNA fragments from RISC activity. We propose that RICE1 and RICE2 act to clear 5’ uridylated fragments from RISC cleavage and to facilitate RISC recycling. Moreover, our study also suggests that the turnover of miRNA targets and miRNA accumulation might be related in vivo.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Identification of RICEs as AGO10-bound cofactors from <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana (A. thaliana)</italic></title><p>To identify AGO10 cofactors, we generated stable <italic>A. thaliana</italic> transgenic suspension cell lines overexpressing <italic>Flag-4Myc-AGO10</italic> to mimic plant stem cells where AGO10 is specifically expressed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A,B</xref>).

In our LCI assays, both AGO10 and AGO1 displayed LUC complementation with RICE1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>), as did AGO1 with the positive control, <italic>Cucumber mosaic virus</italic>-encoded 2b protein (CMV 2b) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Zhang et al., 2006b</xref>), suggesting that RICE1 may be a common factor in various RISCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). Next, using confocal microscopy, we observed that both AGO1 and AGO10 predominantly co-localized with RICE1 in the cytoplasm, suggesting a potential function of RICE1 in processing nucleic acids in the cytoplasm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref>). To further investigate RICE-AGO interactions, we performed co-immunoprecipitation (co-IP) experiments. To this end, we transiently expressed RICE1-3HA with either Flag-AGOs or -Serrate (SE), a control protein involved in the miRNA pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Manavella et al., 2012</xref>), by agroinfiltration in <italic>Nicotiana benthamiana</italic> (<italic>N. bentha</italic>). We conducted an IP with anti-Flag antibody and detected co-immunoprecipitates with anti-HA antibody. RICE1-3HA was indeed co-immunoprecipitated with both AGO1 and AGO10, but not with the control protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>). We next conducted size exclusion chromatography (SEC) assays of Arabidopsis extracts in both wild type and <italic>35S-RICE1</italic> transgenic plants. Western blot with antibodies against endogenous AGO1 and RICE1, respectively, indicated that a fraction of RICE1 protein was co-eluted with AGO1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>). Additional IP experiments with the same extracts demonstrated the consistent coexistence of the two proteins in vivo (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1H</xref>). Similar co-IP results were also obtained in <italic>P<sub>AGO1</sub>-Flag-AGO1</italic> complementation line. Furthermore, RNase A treatment in the co-IP process did not abolish the interaction between RICE1 and AGO1, indicating that their interactions were RNA-independent (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1I</xref>). Finally, in vitro pull-down assays showed that 6His-SUMO-RICE1 and -RICE2, but not 6His-SUMO, specifically and directly interacted with maltose-binding protein (MBP)-AGO1 and -AGO10, but not control protein MBP, (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1D–F</xref>, lanes #1, 9 and 10). Moreover, RICEs interacted with several fragments of AGO10 proteins – AGO10 NC (127-336), AGO10 PAZ (337-474), and AGO10 PIWI (625-988) – with an apparently stronger affinity to the PAZ domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1F</xref>, lanes # 3–8). In contrast, neither of the variable parts of AGO10 or AGO1 N-terminal domains could be pulled down by RICE proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1F</xref>, lanes #2 and 11). Collectively, these experiments demonstrated that RICEs are indeed novel AGO1/10-interacting proteins in plants.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>RICE1 and RICE 2 act as 3’-to-5’ exoribonucleases specifically targeting single-stranded RNAs</title><p>Computational analysis predicted that RICEs might function as RNase H proteins (from TAIR website) or DnaQ-like nucleases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Smith et al., 2013</xref>).

To identify <italic>bona fide</italic> substrates for RICE1, we tested RICE1 enzymatic activity with 5’ <sup>32</sup>P-labelled ss 21-nucleotide (nt) RNA or DNA using various reaction conditions, including the one described for its human structural homolog, Werner Syndrome Helicase exonuclease (WRN-exo) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Perry et al., 2006</xref>).

To investigate whether RICE1 function resembles C3PO or QIP and removes the nicked passenger strand from sRNA duplexes, a 5’ <sup>32</sup>P labeled 12-nt RNA fragment and cold 9-nt RNA fragment fully complementary to miR166 were annealed to cold miR166a (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>) to generate a nicked sRNA duplex. Similarly, an analogous nicked duplex was prepared by annealing 5’ <sup>32</sup>P labeled 9-nt RNA fragment with cold 12-nt fragment and miR166a (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). While RICE1 cleaved the 5’ labeled 9-nt and 12-nt ss sRNAs effectively, the 9-nt and 12-nt RNA fragments in the duplex forms were resistant to RICE1 degradation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). Thus, RICE1, unlike previously characterized C3PO and QIP, did not degrade unreleased nicked ss RNAs.</p><p>To distinguish whether RICE1 is a 5’-to-3’ or 3’-to-5’ ribonuclease, we repeated the RNase assays with the RNA substrates labeled on different ends. When a 5’ labeled substrate was used for the assay, truncated fragments of various sizes were observed; whereas when a 3' labeled ss RNA substrate was used, only a single one-nucleotide cleavage product was observed. This RNA substrate was more stable than the 5' labeled RNA and we infer that the 3' labeled phosphate inhibited the target degradation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>). These results indicate that RICE1 is a 3’-to-5’ ribonuclease that cleaves nucleotides off the RNA substrates progressively from the 3’ terminus. To further determine whether RICE1 is an exo- or endo-ribonuclease, a 5’-labeled 21nt ss RNA was circularized by T4 RNA ligase. While the circularized ss RNA was effectively degraded by RNase A, this RNA was resistant to RICE1 activity, suggesting that RICE1 is an exoribonuclease (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>).</p><p>We next tested the length requirement of RNA substrates for RICE1. ss RNAs, with lengths ranging from 9 to 165-nt, were 5’ <sup>32</sup>P labeled and subjected to RICE1 treatment. We observed that ss RNAs with lengths less than 40-nt were readily degraded by RICE1 while the RNAs that were 50-nt or longer were less vulnerable to the exonucleolytic activity of RICE1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G</xref>). However, considering that double-strand secondary structures are more likely to occur in the long ss RNAs than short ones, we tested RICE1 enzyme activity against RNA homopolymers of different lengths. Consequently, we noticed that RICE1 enzyme activities on these 21-nt to 100-nt substrates were comparable (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2H</xref>), suggesting that RICE1 favored both small ss RNAs and long ss RNAs without secondary structure. We repeated the nuclease activity assay with RICE2 and observed that RICE2 functioned essentially identical to RICE1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2I</xref>; data not shown).

The well-conserved WRN-exo active site is located within a large cavity on one face of the molecule. A comparison of RICE1 with WRN-exo and other members of the DnaQ family revealed that the DEDD motif is not conserved in the active site of RICE1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1B</xref>). Instead, the glutamate and the last aspartate residues in the DEDD motif are replaced by Tyr54 and Glu187 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A,C–E</xref>). In addition, the highly conserved tyrosine residue (Tyr212) near the active site of WRN-exo is replaced by Ala183 in RICE1.

By contrast, the R47E mutant displayed a distinct chromatographic profile compared to wild-type RICE1 with the major peak corresponding to the monomeric RICE1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>). Notably, the D114A mutant eluted as several peaks that correspond to the monomer, dimer and hexamer of RICE1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E</xref>).

An alternative hypothesis is that RICEs might clear the miRNA* strand and facilitate incorporation of miRNA strands into AGO proteins. Because how miRNA/miRNA* is exactly loaded into AGO protein remains unclear in plants, we hypothesized that if RICEs removed miRNA* after the incorporation of miRNA/* into AGO proteins, then a defect in RICE function might lead to enrichment of miRNA* in AGO proteins. To test this, we examined the miRNA accumulation in AGO1 protein in the lines overexpressing the dominant negative mutant <italic>RICE1 D52A</italic>. The accumulation of AGO1 was slightly increased in the mutant, likely due to its feedback regulation by miR168 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1A,B</xref>). However, AGO1 protein retained less miRNA in the dominant negative mutant, indicating that RICEs promote integrity of functional RISC. These results were reproducible and a similar pattern could also be observed in <italic>rice1 rice2</italic> knockdown lines, although more modest relative to the dominant negative transgenic plants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1A–C</xref>).

Whereas we appeared to detect residual full-length miRNA*s, we were unable to observe any nicked miRNA* strands on the blots (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1E</xref>). Next, we adopted the wheat germ system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Tang et al., 2003</xref>) to study in vitro reconstituted miRNA-RISC. Again, we failed to detect 9-nt and 12-nt miRNA* fragments in any of the reactions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1F</xref>). These observations are consistent with the prevailing model of miRNA-RISC assembly in different organisms. During the loading of miRNA/miRNA* into AGO proteins, it is believed that the unwinding of the miRNA/* duplex and the removal of miRNA* are conducted through a slicer-independent mechanism due to the presence of mismatches in miRNA/* duplexes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Kawamata and Tomari, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Yoda et al., 2010</xref>). Under this scenario, the central mismatches facilitate the loading of miRNA/* duplexes into AGOs, while mismatches located elsewhere promote separation of the miRNA/* duplex and the subsequent release and degradation of miRNA* (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Kawamata and Tomari, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Yoda et al., 2010</xref>). Similarly in plants, it is also proposed that unwinding of miRNA/* and subsequent clearance of miRNA* do not entail the cleavage activity of AGO1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Iki et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Carbonell et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Iki et al., 2012</xref>). As such, the production of nicked 9-nt and 12-nt miRNA* would not take place; and thus it would be very unlikely that RICE proteins target the truncated miRNA*.</p><p>All together, these results further validated that RICE proteins positively regulate miRNA accumulation in vivo, while suggesting that RICEs are very unlikely to clear miRNA* to facilitate RISC assembly.</p></sec><sec id="s2-8"><title>Catalytically-inactive RICE1 leads to the accumulation of extended uridylated 5’ RNA fragments generated by RISC cleavage</title><p>RISC harbors target mRNAs besides miRNA and miRNA*; and RICE1 also could cleave long unstructured ss RNA substrates.

We report the crystal structure of RICE1 and pivotal functions of RICEs in clearing RISC cleavage products and their regulatory role in maintaining functional RISC and miRNA abundance.</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>Novel biochemical features of RICEs</title><p>Bioinformatics analysis predicted that RICEs contain an RNase H-like domain in the TAIR database. Structural analyses revealed that RICEs belong to the DnaQ-like 3’ to 5’ exonuclease superfamily (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Perry et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Smith et al., 2013</xref>). RICE1 also exhibits considerable structural similarity to RNase D (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Zuo et al., 2005</xref>). Whereas RNase D is involved in processing of structural RNAs, DnaQ-like protein family, often represented by the proofreading domains of DNA polymerases, acts to check the fidelity of newly synthesized DNA during DNA replication and to excise the mismatched nucleotides in the 3’-to-5’ direction. It was previously proposed that RICE2 functions as its structural homolog, WRN-exo, in DNA metabolism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Perry et al., 2006</xref>). However, its enzymatic activity and DNA binding capability were not previously detected (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Smith et al., 2013</xref>). Here we demonstrate that RICEs are mainly RNases, not DNases, and function in the degradation of 5’ uridylated fragments from RISC. Compared to other DEDD superfamily enzymes, RICEs exhibit some additional unique biochemical properties. First, RICEs harbor non-canonical residues in their active sites instead of the canonical DEDD motif observed in the superfamily. Moreover, RICEs lack other conserved histidine and tyrosine residues that are critical for the catalytic activity of the DEDD superfamily (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Zuo and Deutscher, 2001</xref>). Second, the enzymatic activity of RICEs do not appear to involve metal ions, which are otherwise characteristic of DEDD superfamily proteins such as human WRN-exo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Perry et al., 2006</xref>), bacterial RNaseT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Zuo et al., 2007</xref>), yeast Ngl3p (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Feddersen et al., 2012</xref>), among others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Zuo and Deutscher, 2001</xref>). Third, the active sites of RICEs are located at the interface between RICE1 subunits in the hexameric assembly; therefore, each subunit contributes to the catalytic activity. Together, the lack of a canonical catalytic motif and metal ions in the active site as well as the unique location of its active site suggest a novel catalytic mechanism in RICEs.</p><p>The multimeric assembly of RICE complex with the active sites at the interfaces between monomers in the hexameric ring may indicate physiological significance. First, the hexameric assembly of RICEs would allow them to trap nucleic acids more efficiently for processing. Examination of surface electrostatic potential of RICE1 and RICE2 reveals that the backside of the RICE hexamers is mostly negatively charged, whereas the front surface of the hexamer contains unique positively charged patches around the active site (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>). Thus, these positively charged patches could sequester nucleic acids and facilitate interactions between the enzyme and substrate. On the other hand, the negatively charged surfaces might contribute to determining the orientation or polarity of 3’ tails of 5’ fragments that are dislodged from RISC. Second, the assembly and disassembly of RICE hexameric rings might be a dynamic process, and likely represent a new layer of homeostatic regulation of RISC maturation. A previous study showed the in vitro monomer-to-hexamer transition of RICE2 using recombinant proteins prepared from <italic>E. coli</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Smith et al., 2013</xref>). In our studies, although we barely detected the presence of RICE1 monomers in solution, we did frequently observe both hexameric and dimeric conformations. Consistent with this observation, SEC profiling of plant cell extracts revealed that RICE proteins also displayed an array of monomer/dimer, hexamer, and even higher-order oligomers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>). Given that the RICE monomer is very unstable, oligomerization likely allows for proper folding and protects it from protease degradation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6H</xref>) so the dynamic assembly and disassembly of RICE oligomers may serve as an extra regulatory layer, inferring a plastic capability of substrate processing corresponding to various functional needs.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>RICEs maintain productive RISC through clearing 5’ uridylated fragments from RISC activity</title><p>Based on our biochemical and genetic results, we wished to propose that RICEs act to clear 5’uridylated fragments to maintain productive RISC and facilitate its recycling. Several pieces of evidence supported the notion: (1) RICEs directly reside on AGO proteins in cytoplasm and thus should function coordinately with RISC to regulate post transcriptional silencing events (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>); (2) RICEs are 3’-to-5’ exoribonucleases specifically targeting ss RNAs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>); (3) overexpression of <italic>RICEs</italic> elevated miRNA levels while downregulation of <italic>RICEs</italic> and dominant negative variants of RICE1 decreased abundance of miRNAs and their retaining in AGO proteins, indicating that RICEs are very unlikely to degrade miRNAs in vivo (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>); (4), miRNA* was not enriched in RISC from <italic>rice1 rice2</italic> mutants or transgenic plants ectopically expressing dominant-negative RICEs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A–E</xref>). Thus, RICEs functionally differ from some other ribonucleases that are reported to be engaged in promoting RISC assembly by clearing miRNA* (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Maiti et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Xiao et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Xue et al., 2012</xref>); (5) last but importantly, overexpression of catalytically-inactive forms of RICE1 not only caused extended 5’ uridylated fragments from RISC activity in vivo, but also increased their abundance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7F–K</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s2">Figure 7—figure supplement 2A–D</xref>). All the evidence implicates RICE proteins in degradation of the uridylated fragments from RISC cleavage to maintain proper function of RISC.</p><p>How do RICEs coordinate with RISC to clear the cleavage fragments? Recent single-molecule studies show that AGO proteins themselves can generate a favorable environment that actively promotes the release of the cleavage products in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Jo et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Salomon et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Yao et al., 2015</xref>). In this setting, the released cleavage products might be channeled to AGO-bound RICEs for further degradation. Interestingly, we observed that hexameric assembly of RICE subunits creates a central pore with a diameter approximately 21–22 Å that is rich in positively charged residues (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>). It has been shown that proteins with similar ring-structures such as PCNA interact with ds DNA via their central cavity, while other ring-structured proteins translocate processively and unidirectionally along ssDNA to separate the strands of double-stranded (ds) DNA aiding both in the initiation and fork progression during DNA replication, or translocate ss RNA in transcriptional termination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Patel et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Thomsen and Berger, 2009</xref>). Given that human AGO2 releases its cleaved products by destabilizing their interaction with the guide RNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Salomon et al., 2015</xref>), RICE proteins might be coupled with a yet unidentified helicase or even AGO proteins themselves to separate double-stranded miRNA/5’-cleavage targets. The separation would allow unidirectional translocation of 5’ cleavage products from RISC to RICEs for degradation, whereas retaining miRNAs inside AGO proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>). Further study on the physiological significance of hexameric assembly of RICE proteins will provide new insight into cooperation between RICEs and RISC in RNA silencing events.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Mechanism for RICE promotion of miRNA accumulation</title><p>Besides clearance of uridylated 5’ cleavage products from RISC, RICE proteins also promote miRNA accumulation. How could RICEs enhance miRNA abundance in vivo? First, we have clarified that RICEs, different from QIP, did not impact miRNA biogenesis because the abundance of pri-miRNAs was not affected in overexpression lines of wild-type RICEs nor dominant-negative RICEs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s2">Figure 7—figure supplement 2E</xref>). Second, RICE promotion of miRNA abundance is not through changing the level of the housing protein AGO1 because AGO1 amount remained stable or even slightly increased whereas miRNAs were down-regulated in the RICE-compromised lines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1A–C</xref>). Third, RICE proteins appeared not to target miRNA* and it is not likely that RICE proteins promote miRNA accumulation through degrading miRNA* to facilitate RISC assembly (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A–E</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1D–F</xref>).</p><p>We speculate that the two functions of RICE proteins might be related. RISC performs multiple rounds of target cleavage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Wee et al., 2012</xref>). Prompt removal of the cleaved products promotes RISC recycling and maintains productive AGO-miRNA complexes. On the other hand, 5’ cleavage fragments without prompt processing may be retained in RISC; this would result in a non-productive state that would be coupled to miRNA turnover. In this model, RICE function increases miRNA stability by clearing RISC products and promoting active RISC complexes. In the absence of RICEs, an increase in the proportion of non-productive RISC complexes would lead to miRNA turnover and thereby reduced miRNA levels. This scenario would be reminiscent of target mimicry in Arabidopsis in which, inactive interaction of targets with RISC causes miRNA decoy and repression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Franco-Zorrilla et al., 2007</xref>). In other organisms, complementary targets could often switch their roles from regulated substrates to regulatory RNAs to inhibit the activity of miRNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Ameres et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">De et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Xie et al., 2012</xref>) or additional species of small RNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Figueroa-Bossi et al., 2009</xref>). Although the functions of RICE proteins in the promotion of miRNA accumulation and clearance of uridylated 5’ RISC products could be interconnected, it is also possible that these two roles for RICE proteins might be independent processes. That said, the mechanism of how RICE proteins enhance miRNA expression awaits future clarification.</p><p>In conclusion, we have identified the enzymes that are specifically involved in RNA decay of uridylated 5’ cleavage products from RISC. By clearing the RISC products, RICE proteins can facilitate RISC recycling and maintain an active RISC pool (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7L</xref>). This study also raised several new outstanding questions: First, how could RICEs specifically select 5’ cleavage targets for degradation rather than promiscuously targeting miRNAs and miRNA* in RISC? Second, does RICEs only chop out the single-stranded part of 5’ uridylated fragments, or degrade the entire 5’ cleavage fragments? Considering that RICEs disfavor structured long ss RNAs, RICEs might only clear the linear ss RNA harbored in or near RISC. Until now, several candidates have been implicated in degrading the 5’ cleavage products (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Branscheid et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Ren et al., 2014</xref>). In this scenario, it might be necessary for RICEs to coordinate with additional 3’-to-5’ exosome nucleases or even with 5’-to-3’ exonuclease and accomplish the complete clearance of RISC cleavage products. Furthermore, it has been reported that HESO1, the enzyme that accounts for uridylation of the cleavage targets, and the uridylated products are associated with AGO proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Ren et al., 2014</xref>). Thus, it is tempting to hypothesize that uridylation, release and decay of 5’ cleavage fragments could be coordinated in vivo. Whether HESO1 and RICEs interacts or synergistically promote the functions for each other would be an exciting question to be addressed in the future. Equally interesting is whether there is interplay between RICEs and decapping machinery or deadenylation complexes in RNA decay. Last but not least, there are between one and four orthologs in most other angiosperm genomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s3">Figure 7—figure supplement 3</xref>); and the RICE orthologs are also conserved through animals, implying their functional significance in these organisms. Further characterization of the RICE orthologs would certainly provide new mechanistic insights into RISC functionality in the eukaryotes.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>AGO10 complex isolation</title><p><italic>A. thaliana</italic> suspension MM1 cell lines expressing <italic>Flag-4Myc-AGO10</italic> under the control of Cauliflower Mosaic Virus 35S promoter were generated following the standard transformation procedure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Forreiter et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Menges and Murray, 2002</xref>).

A lightly edited version of the letter sent to the authors after peer review is shown, indicating the most substantive concerns; minor comments are not usually included.</p></boxed-text><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;RICEs degrade uridylated cleavage fragments to maintain functional RISC in Arabidopsis&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been favorably evaluated by Detlef Weigel (Senior Editor) and three reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal his identity: Blake C Meyers (Reviewer #2).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>The paper is a technical tour de force that provides firm evidence for novel 3' to 5' exoribonucleases (RICEs) involved in clearance of 5' fragments produced by Dicer cleavage of miRNA targets. The data include biochemical evidence that the RICEs interact directly with AGO1/10, that they influence the accumulation of the 5' cleavage fragments and that there is an indirect on miRNA/miRNA* accumulation. The clearance of these 5' fragments is mediated by uridylation of the 3' end of the targeted RNA by HESO1. There are also structural data showing that the ribonuclease represents a new variation on the previously characterized DNA-Q-like exonuclease with a normal DNA substrate.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The hypothesis that miRNA* is the RICE target is not fully tested – the assay was for miRNA* and true the data show that its level is affected in line with the effect on miRNA. However, the test should be for the accumulation of the 1-9 and 10-21 miRNA* fragments since that is what should accumulate if the RICEs are involved in clearance of these fragments. We think this point is important because the model in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7L</xref> does not explain the observed effects on miRNA accumulation.</p><p>2) Given the novelty of the RICE genes, and their apparent importance to a process of fundamental importance, it would be helpful to discuss if similar numbers of genes are present in most other angiosperm genomes. In PantherDB, there are between one and three orthologs per plant genome, which may be informative at least to mention (the third one in Arabidopsis is quite distant, with almost no recognizable homology to the RICEs): <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.pantherdb.org/panther/family.do?clsAccession=PTHR13620:SF29">http://www.pantherdb.org/panther/family.do?clsAccession=PTHR13620:SF29</ext-link>.</p><p>3) Subsection “RICE1 and RICE 2 act as 3’ to 5’ exo-ribonucleases specifically targeting single-stranded RNAs”, end of last paragraph: &quot;despite previous predictions&quot; is a bit misleading; almost everywhere we looked online at the functional annotation of the RICE genes, they were marked as &quot; Polynucleotidyl transferase, ribonuclease H-like superfamily protein &quot;. The first line in Araport says &quot;Polynucleotidyl transferase, ribonuclease H-like superfamily protein; FUNCTIONS IN: 3'-5' exonuclease activity, nucleic acid binding&quot;.

However, the test should be for the accumulation of the 1-9 and 10-21 miRNA* fragments since that is what should accumulate if the RICEs are involved in clearance of these fragments. We think this point is important because the model in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7L</xref> does not explain the observed effects on miRNA accumulation.</italic> </p><p>We think that the reviewers were asking us to further clarify whether RICE proteins degrade the 1-9 and 10-21 nt miRNA* fragment –the hypothetic products of miRNA* immediately after the loading of miRNA/miRNA* into RISC. We think that this is very insightful comment as it raises a fundamental issue of how miRNA/miRNA* is loaded into RISC and how miRNA* is cleared.</p><p>First of all, let us summarize the literature about RISC assembly. Our current understanding of RISC assembly, in particular, siRNA-RISC assembly, has been largely shaped by the studies in <italic>Drosophila</italic> (Matranga et al., 2005; Miyoshi et al., 2005; Rand et al., 2005). In this organism, once the siRNA duplex is incorporated into AGO proteins, the passenger strand serves as the first target of RISC and is cleaved by the catalytically active AGO proteins (Matranga et al. 2005; Rand et al. 2005). The nicked passenger strand (1-9 nt and 10-21 nt fragments) of siRNA is subsequently degraded by endoribonuclease or exoribunuclease. Compared tothe assembly of siRNA-RISC, the maturation process of miRNA-RISC is more complicated and also less understood. However, due to the presence of extensive mismatches in miRNA/* duplexes, the unwinding of the miRNA/* duplex and the removal of miRNA* are conducted through a slicer-independent unwinding mechanism. Under this scenario, the central mismatches facilitate the loading of miRNA/* duplexes into AGOs, while mismatches located elsewhere promote separation of the miRNA/* duplex and the subsequent release and degradation of miRNA* by a ribonuclease yet to be identified (Kawamata and Tomari 2010; Yoda et al. 2010).</p><p>Similarly in plants, it is proposed that unwinding of the siRNA duplex occurs via cleavage of the passenger strand by catalytically competent AGO1, while unwinding of miRNA/* and subsequent clearance of miRNA* do not undergo such a process (Iki et al. 2010; Carbonell et al. 2012; Iki et al. 2012).</p><p>Here in our study, our initial hypothesis was indeed that RICE proteins might degrade miRNA* to promote RISC assembly and positively regulate miRNA accumulation and we have ever tested this hypothesis for at least <italic>two</italic> years and also revisited it recently! In fact, our effort also included exhausted searching for 1-9<sup>th</sup> and 10-21<sup>st</sup> nt fragments in the RICE-compromised situations:</p><p>1) We started with in vitro assay with the nicked miRNA*s (either the 1-9<sup>th</sup> or the 10-21<sup>st</sup> fragments) annealed with miRNA. The scenario mimics the miRNA/miRNA* loaded into RISC. We found that unlike previously reported QIP<italic>, Neurospora crassa</italic> AGO-interacting 3’ to 5’ exoribonuclease (Maiti et al. 2007), RICE1 does not degrade the nicked miRNA* in vitro (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref> in the manuscript).</p><p>2) We then extensively searched 21-nt miRNA* and miRNA*-derived fragments (9-nt and 12-nt) in vivo. Since we could not detect the full-length and truncated miRNA* in regular sRNA blot, we have enriched low molecular weight of sRNAs by PEG8000 through several hundred micrograms of total RNAs. We finally loaded at least 10 µg of low molecular weight RNAs for sRNA gel blot. In order to detect miRNA*s and the nicked miRNA* fragments, we pooled numerous 21-nt and truncated oligo probes complementary to miR165 (a-b)*, miR166 (a-g)*, miR159*, miR160c*, miR162b*, miR164b*, miR167b*, miR168a*, miR171a* (right panel) respectively. We appeared to detect residue amount of miRNA* in the enriched samples, but were unable to detect any miRNA*-derived fragments in RICE1 D52A mutant in lower position below 21-nt miRNA*s (new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1E</xref> in the manuscript).</p><p>3) We also searched miRNA* and nicked miRNA* fragments in pooled AGO1 IP in the RICE1 D52A mutant background; and did not find any accumulation of such products, either (as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref> in the manuscript).</p><p>4) In plant RNAi field, an important translation system called BYL has been used to study in vitro RISC loading assays with either siRNAs or miRNAs (Iki et al., 2010, Yoda et al., 2010) We thought to adopt the BYL system described in the references (Iki et al., 2010, Yoda et al., 2010 etc.) in our research to study if RICE1 D52A mutant could promote the accumulation of the miRNA* fragments. We have worked on optimization of the system for quite a long time; but our effort was not fruitful likely due to some technical pitfalls present in our system that we could not solve. However, in the published papers with miRNA-RISC assembly in plants, 9-nt and 12-nt fragments of miRNA* were not observable (Iki et al. 2010; Iki et al. 2012), suggesting that there might not be 9 nt and 12-nt nicked miRNA* fragments at all in plants.</p><p>5) Because we never recovered 9-nt and 12-nt miRNA* fragments in RICE1 D52A mutant background in vivo and in the BYL system, we appealed to in vitro wheat germ system under the supervision of Dr. Guoliang Tang (Tang, et al., 2003) to study the RISC assembly. The experimental protocol for this assay was modified from previous studies (Iki et al. 2010; Iki et al. 2012). Flag-4Myc-AGO1, RICE1 wild type and D52A mutant protein were synthesized at 25 °C for 1hr in wheat germ extract from TNT® T7 Quick Coupled transcription/translation system (Promega, L1170), mixed together (1:1, v:v) with 1 volume fresh wheat germ extract (Promega, L4380) and incubated for 30 min at 25 °C in the presence of additional 0.75 mM ATP, 1.8 mM MgCl2, 20 mM creatine phosphate (CP), and 0.4 mg/ml creatine kinase (CK). Then, the mixture was further mixed with 5 nM miR166/166* duplexes containing either <sup>32</sup>P-labelled miR166 or miR166* (indicated by red). The reaction mixtures were collected after incubation and diluted 10-fold with TR buffer (30 mM HEPES [pH 7.4], 80 mM KOAc, 1.8 mM MgCl2, 2 mM DTT, 1 tablet/50 ml complete protease inhibitor [Roche]) and extracted with equal volumes of TE-saturated phenol. The resulting aqueous phase was recovered, mixed with 0.1 volume of 3M NaAc (pH 5.2), 2 volumes of ethanol and 1μL of glycogen-blue and precipitated at -20 °C overnight. Spin down the pellets at 4 °C in 21,000g and washed the pellets with 80% ethanol. The pellets were dried up for 5 min and dissolved in 10 μL ddH<sub>2</sub>O. The dissolved RNA were mix with an equal volume of native dye solution (1 X TBE (100 mM Tris, 90 mM boric acid, 2 mM EDTA-Na<sub>2</sub>), 0,2 mg/ml bromophenol blue, 0.2 mg/ml xylene cyanol, 10% (v/v) glycerol), and analyzed with native 15-18% PAGE using 0.5 X TBE as running buffer in 4 °C. The <sup>32</sup>P signals were detected after exposure to a phosphorImager plate (Molecular Dynamics). Negative control reactions using mock-translated wheat germ were performed in parallel. We have conducted this experiment for many times and two blots were shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Author response image 1</xref> (one of them also is shown in new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1F</xref>) in the manuscript: the red rectangle open box was supposed to be the position for 9- to 12-nt miRNA* fragments.

Again, we did not recover 9-nt and 12-nt miRNA* fragments.</p><p>In summary, we have extensively and exhaustively tested the hypothesis that RICE proteins might degrade miRNA*, as well as 9- and 12-nt miRNA* fragments, we have obtained substantial amount of negative but consistent results. Given that we have already identified the uridylated RISC-cleavage fragments as the bona fide targets for RICE proteins, we tended to believe that RICE proteins are very unlikely to clear miRNA* as well as their derived fragments. To recapitulate all of our observations, we did not propose the model that RICE proteins degrade nicked miRNA*s to promote miRNA accumulation in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7L</xref>.</p><p><italic>2) Given the novelty of the RICE genes, and their apparent importance to a process of fundamental importance, it would be helpful to discuss if similar numbers of genes are present in most other angiosperm genomes. In PantherDB, there are between one and three orthologs per plant genome, which may be informative at least to mention (the third one in Arabidopsis is quite distant, with almost no recognizable homology to the RICEs): <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.pantherdb.org/panther/family.do?clsAccession=PTHR13620:SF29">http://www.pantherdb.org/panther/family.do?clsAccession=PTHR13620:SF29</ext-link>.</italic> </p><p>Thanks for another insightful comment! Inclusion of the suggested phylogenetic information would further underscore the significance of the work and also extend the broad interest of the RICE genes. To this end, we have now added a new supplemental figure showing a phylogenetic tree for RICE genes in selected angiosperm plants and also in other eukaryotic organisms including human. We have also added related information in the Discussion part (last paragraph and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s3">Figure 7—figure supplement 3</xref>).</p><p><italic>3) Subsection “RICE1 and RICE 2 act as 3’ to 5’ exo-ribonucleases specifically targeting 172 single-stranded RNAs”, end of last paragraph: &quot;despite previous predictions&quot; is a bit misleading; almost everywhere we looked online at the functional annotation of the RICE genes, they were marked as &quot; Polynucleotidyl transferase, ribonuclease H-like superfamily protein &quot;.
