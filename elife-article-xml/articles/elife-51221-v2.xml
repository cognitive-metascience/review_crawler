around the notochord rod which contains a core made of large vacuolated cells. Each vacuolated cell possesses a single ﬂuid-ﬁlled vacuole, and loss or fragmentation of these vacuoles in zebrafish leads to spine kinking. Here, we identified a mutation in the kinase gene <italic>dstyk</italic> that causes fragmentation of notochord vacuoles and a severe congenital scoliosis-like phenotype in zebrafish. Live imaging revealed that Dstyk regulates fusion of membranes with the vacuole. We find that localized disruption of notochord vacuoles causes vertebral malformation and curving of the spine axis at those sites. Accordingly, in <italic>dstyk</italic> mutants the spine curves increasingly over time as vertebral bone formation compresses the notochord asymmetrically, causing vertebral malformations and kinking of the axis. Together, our data show that notochord vacuoles function as a hydrostatic scaffold that guides symmetrical growth of vertebrae and spine formation.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>notochord</kwd><kwd>vacuolated cells</kwd><kwd>vertebra</kwd><kwd>scoliosis</kwd><kwd>dstyk</kwd><kwd>spine</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Zebrafish</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01AR065439</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Bagnat</surname><given-names>Michel</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000011</institution-id><institution>Howard Hughes Medical Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Faculty Scholars</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Bagnat</surname><given-names>Michel</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01HL54737</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Stainier</surname><given-names>Didier YR</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R00GM105874</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>McMenamin</surname><given-names>Sarah K</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R03HD091634</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>McMenamin</surname><given-names>Sarah K</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Live imaging and genetic analyses revealed that notochord vacuoles play a critical role in spine morphogenesis by absorbing vertebral bone growth, thus implicating notochord mechanics in congenital scoliosis.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The notochord is the main structural element of the anteroposterior (AP) body axis in chordates, and in vertebrates it also serves as a scaffold for spine formation. In basal chordates such as ascidians, the notochord is a simple and continuous fluid filled tube that acts as a pressurized rod, providing structural support for the embryo and allowing locomotion during larval stages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Deng et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Munro et al., 2006</xref>). These early developmental functions of the notochord are conserved from basal chordates to all vertebrates. However, in vertebrates the continuous hollow tube is replaced by a core of vacuolated cells that form a rod within a sheath whose characteristics diverge across vertebrate subgroups. For example, in teleosts such as zebrafish the inner vacuolated cells are surrounded by an epithelial sheath which is encased in a thick extracellular matrix (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Ellis et al., 2013a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Ellis et al., 2013b</xref>). On the other hand, in amniotes such as chicken and mice notochord vacuolated cells are surrounded by a seemingly acellular sheath (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Choi et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Ward et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>Epithelial sheath cells play at least two specialized roles in zebrafish: they provide a template for segmented vertebrae during spine formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Lleras Forero et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Pogoda et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Wopat et al., 2018</xref>), and they are also able to regenerate vacuolated cells after mechanical damage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Garcia et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Lim et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Lopez-Baez et al., 2018</xref>). While vertebral patterning in the spine occurs via different mechanisms in amniotes compared to teleosts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Fleming et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Harris and Arratia, 2018</xref>), the notochord plays a conserved role in attracting osteoblasts that originate in the sclerotome portion of the paraxial mesoderm to form the vertebral bone (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Renn et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Ward et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Wopat et al., 2018</xref>). Moreover, vertebral bones develop in a brace-like fashion around the notochord which acts as a central scaffold in all vertebrates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Fleming et al., 2015</xref>), suggesting that the notochord plays a conserved structural role in spine formation.</p><p>In contrast to sheath cells, notochord vacuolated cells show remarkable similarity in size and structure across diverse vertebrate species such as zebrafish, frogs and pigs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Garcia et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Norman et al., 2018</xref>). Each vacuolated cell contains a single fluid-filled vacuole, which is a specialized lysosome-related organelle that occupies most of the cellular volume (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Ellis et al., 2013a</xref>). During zebrafish embryogenesis these vacuoles inflate rapidly and as they expand within the boundaries established by the notochord sheath, they organize in a stereotypical pattern and contribute to the elongation of the embryonic axis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Ellis et al., 2013b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Norman et al., 2018</xref>). Loss or fragmentation of notochord vacuoles causes shortening of the body axis and, later in development, leads to kinking of the spine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Ellis et al., 2013a</xref>). The axis elongation defect that occurs upon vacuole fragmentation seems to result from a more compact packing of vacuolated cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Navis and Bagnat, 2015</xref>); however, it is unclear whether the spine axis defects share the same structural etiology.</p><p>In humans, defects causing kinking of the spine axis are relatively common and can occur during gestation, that is congenital scoliosis (CS), or after birth, most commonly during adolescence, that is adolescent idiopathic scoliosis (AIS) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Boswell and Ciruna, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Giampietro et al., 2009</xref>). While CS is widely thought to arise from vertebral segmentation defects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Giampietro et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Sparrow et al., 2012</xref>), work in zebrafish has shown that kinking of the notochord sheath due to loss of <italic>col81a1</italic> function results in a CS-like phenotype (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Gray et al., 2014</xref>). In contrast, mutations affecting several different tissues can cause AIS; these tissues include the neural tube (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Grimes et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Hayes et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Sternberg et al., 2018</xref>), cartilage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Karner et al., 2015</xref>), and paraxial mesoderm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Haller et al., 2018</xref>), as well as potential effects of systemic inflammation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Liu et al., 2017</xref>). Understanding the cellular mechanisms involved in spine morphogenesis will help elucidate the developmental origin of CS and AIS.</p><p>Here, we investigated the role of notochord vacuoles during spine formation in zebrafish, using live imaging, genetic manipulations and forward genetic analyses. Our data show that during spine formation, notochord vacuoles function as a hydrostatic scaffold and normally resist the compressive force generated by concentric vertebral bone growth into the notochord. We found that loss of vacuole integrity, due to genetic manipulation or resulting from loss of <italic>dstyk</italic> function in vacuole membrane fusion, leads to vertebral malformations due to asymmetrical bone growth, resulting in kinking of the spine axis. Thus, we uncovered a role for notochord vacuoles in vertebral patterning and identify a cellular and developmental mechanism that may explain part of the etiology of CS in humans.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title><italic>spzl</italic> is a recessive mutation that causes notochord vacuole fragmentation, impaired axis elongation and kinking of the spine in zebrafish</title><p>Previous work in zebrafish has shown that fragmentation of notochord vacuoles results in kinking of the spine axis during late larval stages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Ellis et al., 2013a</xref>). However, it is unclear how notochord vacuoles function during spine formation and how this process is affected when vacuoles are fragmented. Mutants that exhibit a robust vacuole fragmentation phenotype in early larvae are affected in essential genes and rarely survive to the spine formation stages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Ellis et al., 2013a</xref>), limiting the ability to extend these studies into later development. In an unrelated ENU based forward genetic screen, we identified an adult viable recessive mutation that causes both shortening of the embryonic axis and kinking of the spine (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). Because of the short and twisted shape of this mutant, we named it <italic>spaetzle</italic> (<italic>spzl</italic>) after the pasta noodle.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title><italic>spzl</italic> is a recessive mutation which causes notochord vacuole fragmentation, impaired axis elongation, and altered vacuolated cell packing.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Whole mount lateral view of 48 hpf <italic>spzl<sup>-/-</sup></italic> (bottom) and WT sibling (top) embryos.

Close examination of the notochord in 48 hr post fertilization (hpf) <italic>spzl</italic> mutants by DIC microscopy revealed a pattern consistent with vacuole fragmentation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). To confirm this observation, we incubated WT and mutant sibling embryos with the vital dye Cell Trace to visualize intracellular membranes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Ellis et al., 2013a</xref>). Using live confocal microscopy, we found that by 72 hpf notochord vacuoles were largely fragmented (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>, arrow). To investigate the effect of vacuole defects on notochord organization, we performed a quantitative analysis using 3D renderings (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E–H</xref>). We found that the notochord length is significantly shorter in mutants compared to WT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1I</xref>). This difference in length was not due to changes in vacuolated cell numbers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1J</xref>), but mainly to a significantly smaller vacuolated cell volume in mutants compared to WT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1K</xref>). We also observed that cells with fragmented vacuoles typically lose their original ovoid morphology and fill the space in between cells that retain intact vacuoles. To quantify this effect, we first calculated the sphericity index of vacuolated cells, which is the ratio of the surface area of a sphere of equal volume to the surface area of each cell, this ratio gets smaller as the cell shape is distorted from a smooth ovoid shape. We found that sphericity is significantly smaller in mutants compared to WT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1L</xref>), indicating a more irregular morphology, also apparent in 3D renderings (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G,H</xref>). Then, we plotted the distribution of vacuolated cell volume along the anterior-posterior (AP) and found that in WT it follows a stereotypical pattern whereas in mutants this distribution was randomized (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1M,N</xref>). These observations are consistent with WT having an ordered arrangement and <italic>spzl</italic> mutants a more compact organization of vacuolated cells. To investigate this possibility we examined the 3D organization of vacuolated cells as reported previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Norman et al., 2018</xref>) and found that in <italic>spzl</italic> the stereotypical staircase arrangement of vacuolated cells is largely lost in favor of a more compact and irregular pattern (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>).</p><p>Notably, both the notochord and the AP axis remain straight during embryonic and early larval stages in <italic>spzl</italic> mutants. However, by three weeks post fertilization (wpf), kinking of the AP axis was apparent in most (19 out of 20 animals) <italic>spzl</italic> mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A,B</xref>). To determine whether the body axis defects were linked to kinking of the spine we stained fixed 6 wpf larvae with alizarin red to visualize mineralized bone. We found that <italic>spzl</italic> mutants present sharp kinks in their spine axis, in both dorsal-ventral (DV) and left-right axes, typically at two major locations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C,D</xref>, see also <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>).

To examine the role of Dstyk in trafficking to the vacuole, we imaged GFP-Rab32a in WT and <italic>spzl<sup>-/-</sup></italic> using light sheet microscopy. We focused our attention to the 48–65 hpf time window because it allows clear identification of mutants and vacuole biogenesis is still prominent in the posterior notochord. In the posterior-most part of the WT notochord we observed numerous relatively small vesicles fusing with larger structures that corresponded with the main vacuole (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref> and <xref ref-type="video" rid="video3">Video 3</xref>). More anteriorly (i.e. in older vacuoles), we could observe large (~5 μm) pre-vacuolar compartments docking with the vacuole during a long (~2 hr) period in which the docking site was brightly labeled by GFP-Rab32a (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>, arrowheads and <xref ref-type="video" rid="video4">Video 4</xref>), with fusion finally taking place after 2 additional hours (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>, asterisks and <xref ref-type="video" rid="video4">Video 4</xref>).

Then, starting around 6.9 mm we observed the initial manifestations of notochord indentations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>, arrowheads) and the re-orientation of vacuoles (arrows) in a direction parallel to the AP axis of the spine. This process became more obvious as bone formation proceeded, with vertebral bone (centra) reaching a characteristic hourglass shape by 8.7 mm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>, right panels). At this point, vacuoles underneath the central portion of each centrum appeared stacked and flat; whereas, vacuoles found underneath the ends of centra were fragmented, tightly packed and bulged into the prospective intervertebral space (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>, bottom panels). These data show that during spine morphogenesis as more osteoblasts are added and mineralization increases, vertebral bones grow concentrically, compressing the notochord. During this process the centra acquire an hourglass shape and the vacuolated cells seem to react locally to the compressive force generated by bone ingrowth by re-organizing into two distinct arrangements (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B,D</xref>). To track changes in vacuolated cell shape quantitatively we calculated the sphericity index of vacuolated cells over the spine formation window using 3D renderings and found that it presents a sigmoidal behavior with a plateau during chordacentra and initial bone formation stages of (9–12 dpf), which then drops again as vacuolated cells underneath centra are flattened and become stacked during bone growth (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E</xref>). These direct observations in live zebrafish are consistent with histological snapshots from spine morphogenesis in mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Choi and Harfe, 2011</xref>) and salmon (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Kryvi et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Wang et al., 2013</xref>), underscoring the conservation of the process.</p><p>Next, we investigated how notochord vacuole fragmentation affects vertebral bone formation. To this end we expressed a dominant-negative form of Rab32a (DN-GFP-Rab32a) in vacuolated cells to fragment vacuoles. We chose this strategy over vacuolated cell ablation because following ablation vacuolated cells are regenerated by trans-differentiation of sheath cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Garcia et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Lopez-Baez et al., 2018</xref>). Upon expression of DN-GFP-Rab32a in one small cluster of vacuolated cells we observed, as shown before (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Ellis et al., 2013a</xref>), that vacuoles fragmented in those cells. This was associated with increased indentation and bending of the notochord in those areas as centra growth proceeded (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6F</xref>, arrows). Interestingly, at those locations we also observed that centra were malformed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6F</xref>, dotted lines) and of irregular size compared to nearby centra that did not overlay fragmented vacuoles.</p><p>Together, these data show that centra growth compresses the notochord and that notochord vacuoles normally absorb locally the compressive force generated by vertebral bone growth.</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>Loss of notochord vacuole integrity reduces notochord rod pressure and leads to spine kinking in <italic>spzl</italic> mutants during vertebral bone growth</title><p>We have shown that in <italic>spzl</italic> mutants notochord vacuoles exhibit membrane fusion defects and fragment. We also showed that vacuole fragmentation leads to kinking during spine formation. To visualize this process over time we imaged spine formation in WT and <italic>spzl</italic> mutants using the same markers for vacuolated cells and osteoblasts as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>. We observed that initially numerous vacuoles were still present, likely due to maternal load of <italic>dstyk,</italic> and the notochord remained straight in <italic>spzl</italic> mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A,B</xref>, top panels). Then, vacuoles became progressively smaller and eventually disappeared, as judged by the labeling of the whole cell with cytoplasmic GFP. However, the notochord and developing spine remained straight until bone deposition progressed further, at which point sharp clefts could be observed in the notochord and spine kinks developed associated with malformed centra (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>, bottom panel, arrow). We were able to observe snapshots of this process in a single mutant animal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C–E</xref>) in which areas of the notochord that retained vacuoles had a straight spine (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7F</xref>); whereas, in other areas where vacuoles had been lost the notochord was highly squeezed or absent and the spine was sharply kinked (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7G–I</xref>).

Because measuring notochord stiffness directly in vivo is currently unfeasible and devices such as pressure gauges would not be useful for the notochord as the core is not a continuous lumen, we looked instead for ways to estimate the relative internal pressure of the notochord. Comparing live and histology images of the notochord we noticed that in WT the nuclei become compressed into bent disks as vacuoles inflate, whereas in <italic>spzl</italic> mutants nuclei remain spheroid in shape (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8A,B</xref>). We reasoned that as the notochord sheath forms a fairly rigid corset, inflation of vacuoles enlarges the cells, eventually displacing the nuclei and compressing them into bent disks. We therefore plotted the distribution of vacuolated cell nuclei within the notochord in histological sections of 14 dpf larvae, just prior to the onset of centra formation, and found that while in WT the nuclei are highly clustered at the periphery, in <italic>spzl</italic> mutants their localization is randomized (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8C</xref>).

Altogether, our findings reveal a crucial mechanical role for notochord vacuoles in proper spine formation during vertebral bone growth.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>In this study we have investigated the role of notochord vacuoles during spine morphogenesis. Using the experimental advantages of the zebrafish model, we showed that the fluid filled vacuoles allow the notochord to function as a hydrostatic scaffold during spine morphogenesis. Our studies revealed that as the vertebral bones grow concentrically into the notochord, vacuoles absorb compressive centra growth symmetrically and locally by rearranging and fragmenting (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figures 6</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11">11</xref>). When notochord vacuoles are fragmented or lost prior to bone formation, the notochord rod appears to lose its internal pressure and deforms asymmetrically during centra growth, leading to vertebral malformations and kinking of the spine axis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figures 6</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">8</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">9</xref>). These results uncover a role for notochord vacuoles in vertebral bone morphogenesis and suggest CS in humans can develop independently of vertebral segmentation defects.</p><p>The stereotypical arrangement of vacuolated cells within the confinement of the tubular notochord sheath (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Norman et al., 2018</xref>), embryonic axis elongation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Ellis et al., 2013a</xref>), and symmetric vertebral bone growth during spine formation (this work) all critically depend on the mechanical properties of the notochord, which are largely imparted by the behavior of its vacuoles. When fusion of membranes to the vacuole is impaired during embryogenesis (e.g. <italic>spzl</italic> mutants), vacuolated cells do not fully expand and vacuoles fragment further, allowing cells to re-arrange more easily within the notochord (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). This results in more tightly packed cells within a rod that seems to have low internal pressure and thus a limited ability to support axis elongation and proper spine formation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">8</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">9</xref>). In our working model of how notochord vacuoles functions during vertebral bone growth (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig12">Figure 12</xref>), we propose that the capacity to fragment during spine formation is key for cushioning vertebral bone ingrowth locally, thereby allowing symmetric centra formation. Conversely, early loss or fragmentation of vacuoles renders the notochord less stiff and more prone to deformation and unable to absorb bone growth locally during spine formation.</p><fig id="fig12" position="float"><label>Figure 12.</label><caption><title>Working model depicting the proposed mechanism of notochord vacuole function.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Schematic depicting vacuole dynamics during spine formation in WT.

This behavior may help explain the change in notochord design from the ancestral continuous hollow tube found in early chordates to the vertebrate structure in which the lumen is compartmentalized into multiple vacuoles. In addition to the local mechanical effects, it is also important to note that the exact location, orientation and magnitude of deformations occurring in the notochord and spine are likely also influenced by organism-wide mechanics. These include locomotion and the spatial constraint of other organs such as the swim bladder that can alter the way forces act on the axis. It will be interesting to pursue these ideas by building physical and theoretical models that may allow more precise definition and understating of the mechanical forces acting on the notochord during spine formation.</p><p>Our results clearly show that vacuole fusion regulated by Dstyk kinase activity is a critical cellular process that impacts whole axial development. One possibility is that Dstyk controls fusion of membrane with the vacuole by regulating a direct effector of fusion such as Vps41, which in yeast regulates fusion with the vacuole membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Balderhaar and Ungermann, 2013</xref>). However, the phosphorylation site in Vps41 crucial for fusion is not conserved in zebrafish and we have yet not been able to identify alternative candidate effectors regulated by Dstyk. Alternatively, it is also possible that Dstyk acts more indirectly as a master regulator via transcriptional control. Nevertheless, our imaging data indicate that the last step of fusion with the vacuole is highly complex, taking up to 4 hr (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>), and likely represents the limiting step in vacuole biogenesis and maintenance. On the other hand, the differential behavior of vacuolated cells beneath growing centra and in the prospective intervertebral space (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figures 6</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11">11</xref>) also suggests that vacuole fragmentation is selectively regulated during spine formation.</p><p>One important conclusion of our study is that vertebral patterning is not solely dependent on vertebral segmentation, which occurs normally in <italic>dstyk</italic> mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1</xref>). Thus, vertebral malformations, and likely also CS in humans, can result from altered paraxial mesoderm segmentation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Sparrow et al., 2012</xref>), defective mechanical regulation (this study), or alterations in the notochord sheath that produce a kinked scaffold without directly altering vertebral segmentation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Gray et al., 2014</xref>). These findings suggest that while the notochord structure and specific processes such as segmentation may differ across different vertebrate groups (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Fleming et al., 2015</xref>), core mechanical roles of the notochord in vertebral and spine axis patterning are conserved. Our results also suggest that the mineralizing activity of osteoblasts is subject to mechanical feedback and that notochord morphology and centra mineralization are crossregulated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figures 10</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11">11</xref>).

However, we did not detect overt kidney defects in zebrafish <italic>dstyk</italic> mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9s1">Figure 9—figure supplement 1</xref>). This discrepancy may be due to the fact that the variants reported in humans do not affect the kinase domain and could thus reflect other developmental roles of this protein.

Moreover, genetic association studies may also be compounded by complex genetic interactions with other genes that may be different or not present in our experimental model.

Using an unbiased forward genetic approach in zebrafish, the authors identify a mutation (<italic>spzl</italic>) that is associated with vacuole fragmentation and discrete spinal kinking. They localize this mutation to the <italic>dstyk</italic> gene and show that the <italic>spz</italic>l mutants exhibit impaired vacuole fusion due to loss of <italic>dstyk</italic> activity. Notochordal vacuoles are proposed to regulate spine morphogenesis by resisting compressive forces during vertebral bone growth. Specifically, the vacuoles are proposed to reorientate to accommodate symmetric formation of the vertebral centra. This work offers important new insights into the critical role of notochordal vacuoles in the mechanical regulation of spinal column formation. Results suggest that clinically, conditions associated with vacuole fragmentation may result in congenital spinal deformity.</p><p><bold>Decision letter after peer review:</bold></p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Notochord vacuoles absorb compressive bone growth during zebrafish spine formation&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by two peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor, Lila Solnica-Krezel, who also read the manuscript. Richard White served as the Senior Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>There were different perspectives on the novelty and significance of the findings. One view is that this work presents important new insights into the critical role of notochordal vacuoles in the mechanical regulation of spinal column formation. Results suggest that clinically, conditions associated with vacuole fragmentation may result in congenital spinal deformity. A different perspective is that after Ellis et al., 2013 paper from these authors, providing the first link between defects in the notochord vacuoles, spine skeleton and scoliosis, the novelty of the findings presented in this manuscript is rather limited. In particular, as no data on the molecular mechanisms underlying the role of Dstyk during vacuole formation or maintenance are provided.</p><p>Overall, the manuscript is very well written, the data are of highest technical quality, the images are beautiful and the conclusions are sound. In addition, the findings are very interesting, but not entirely novel. Moreover, the key thesis of the manuscript that <italic>dstyk</italic> functions in the notochord to regulate vacuole morphogenesis and their ability to resist compressive forces during bone growth, requires further experimental support. Experimentally addressing this question as well as the role of vacuole fragmentation within intervertebral regions and testing function of maternally contributed <italic>dstyk</italic> function, would significantly strengthen the manuscript. The manuscript has a very good chance to improve significantly even within two months of revisions, when analyses on the intrinsic role of the notochord during spine formation are extended.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The authors interpret the spine phenotype of <italic>dstyk</italic> mutants as evidence for an essential role of notochord cells for proper spine formation and to avoid scoliosis, contrasting other scoliosis disease genes that act in the paraxial mesoderm. However, while this interpretation is most likely correct, zebrafish <italic>dstyk</italic> is also expressed in other tissues, while mutations in human have been implicated with kidney agenesis. In this light, it should be more rigorously shown that it is indeed the loss of Dstyk function in the notochord that leads to the spine defects.</p><p>The authors should extend their in situ hybridization analyses to show how long Dstyk is expressed in the notochord and whether or whether not it is also expressed in paraxial mesoderm and osteoblasts.</p><p>Furthermore, the analyses on the notochord-specific requirement of Dstyk should be extended. The rescue experiments via injection of DNA constructs driving expression of labelled wild-type under the control of the rcn3 promoter provide first evidence. However, at least the rescue shown for the representative example in Figure 2L,M is not very convincing (isn't the indicated vacuole far too large?). Also, it is not clear whether the transgene was only expressed in notochordal cells (the endogenous rcn3 gene also shows other expression domains, e.g. in the floorplate and the somites). This needs to be clearly stated. If the transgene was not exclusively expressed in the notochord, it would be helpful to generate mosaics via cell or shield transplantation experiments to investigate whether a wild-type notochord in a mutant host leads to normal spine development and whether a mutant notochord in a wild-type host leads to spine defects as in regular mutants. Here, to more specifically target notochord cells, the authors might want to generate mosaics by transplanting wild-type cells directly into the shield of <italic>dstyk</italic> mutants and vice versa. These studies should definitively not take longer than two months.</p><p>2) Loss of zygotic Dstyp function does not affect the initial formation, but only the later maintenance of notochord vacuoles. In addition, it does not affect anterior, but only posterior regions of the spine. The authors propose that this might be due to a maternal supply of <italic>dstyk</italic> gene products that compensates for the zygotic loss. However, no such maternal expression or function is shown thus far, even though the Zebrafish Expression Atlas online tool https://www.ebi.ac.uk/gxa/experiments/E-ERAD-475/Results shows strong maternal <italic>dstyk</italic> expression. Therefore, the authors should add pre-MBT stages to their in situ hybridizations in Figure 2, complemented by RT-PCR analyses to demonstrate maternal <italic>dstyk</italic> expression. Furthermore, if homozygous females are fertile or can be successfully squeezed for in vitro fertilization, maternal-zygotic mutants should be generated and investigated for earlier defects in notochord vacuole formation.</p><p>3) The conclusion from Figure 7G that bone mineralization is mechanically regulated, based solely on apparent increased mineralization in mutants is too speculative. Have the authors explored whether <italic>dstyk</italic> is expressed in osteoblasts? For example, have the ISH experiments in Figure 2E been performed at later stages of development (after the onset of mineralization)? If so, this could present an additional/alternative explanation for the bone defects observed.</p><p>4) In light of the observed vacuole fragmentation of notochord cells within intervertebral regions (thus not exposed to mechanical pressure from the mineralized bone of the forming centra), it would be interesting to study vacuole shapes in fish with expanded centra mineralization (e.g. after treatment with retinoic acid) and in the absence of bone mineralization (e.g. in the no bone mutant). Unaltered vacuole fragmentation patterns under such conditions would strongly point to a notochord-intrinsic patterning mechanism and be of broad significance. Hence, the authors should extend on their observation that even in wild types, the vacuoles within the intervertebral spaces undergo fragmentation. Thus, it would be important to investigate whether this segmented vacuole fragmentation is an intrinsic feature of the notochord or whether it depends on mechanical forces resulting from the biomineralization of the centra – which in turn could be under the control of external regulators.

One view is that this work presents important new insights into the critical role of notochordal vacuoles in the mechanical regulation of spinal column formation. Results suggest that clinically, conditions associated with vacuole fragmentation may result in congenital spinal deformity. A different perspective is that after Ellis et al., 2013 paper from these authors, providing the first link between defects in the notochord vacuoles, spine skeleton and scoliosis, the novelty of the findings presented in this manuscript is rather limited. In particular, as no data on the molecular mechanisms underlying the role of Dstyk during vacuole formation or maintenance are provided.</p><p>Overall, the manuscript is very well written, the data are of highest technical quality, the images are beautiful and the conclusions are sound. In addition, the findings are very interesting, but not entirely novel. Moreover, the key thesis of the manuscript that dstyk functions in the notochord to regulate vacuole morphogenesis and their ability to resist compressive forces during bone growth, requires further experimental support. Experimentally addressing this question as well as the role of vacuole fragmentation within intervertebral regions and testing function of maternally contributed dstyk function, would significantly strengthen the manuscript. The manuscript has a very good chance to improve significantly even within two months of revisions, when analyses on the intrinsic role of the notochord during spine formation are extended.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewers for their insightful comments and for their kind words praising the quality of our manuscript. We agree it was needed to further explore and substantiate some of the more mechanistic findings to strengthen our conclusions. We feel that the changes and additions we introduced have significantly improved our manuscript.</p><p>We would like to address here the issue of novelty by providing our perspective. We believe this work provides new mechanistic insight into the role of notochord vacuoles in spine formation that go well beyond what we showed previously in Ellis et al., 2013. Specifically, we show that loss of vacuole integrity leads to vertebral malformations during bone growth, and that vacuolated cells respond to compressive bone growth by stacking and fragmenting vacuoles to absorb bone growth. These are in our view novel mechanistic insights. With respect to Dstyk function, we show that the kinase activity regulates membrane fusion and that fusion of pre-vacuolar compartments (i.e. vacuolinos) is a rate limiting step. While we have not identified phosphorylation targets of Dstyk we were able to define its developmental function.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The authors interpret the spine phenotype of dstyk mutants as evidence for an essential role of notochord cells for proper spine formation and to avoid scoliosis, contrasting other scoliosis disease genes that act in the paraxial mesoderm. However, while this interpretation is most likely correct, zebrafish dstyk is also expressed in other tissues, while mutations in human have been implicated with kidney agenesis. In this light, it should be more rigorously shown that it is indeed the loss of Dstyk function in the notochord that leads to the spine defects.</p><p>The authors should extend their in situ hybridization analyses to show how long Dstyk is expressed in the notochord and whether or whether not it is also expressed in paraxial mesoderm and osteoblasts.</p></disp-quote><p>We can detect the <italic>dstyk</italic> transcript in the notochord by ISH until about 72 hpf. However, because vacuolated cells never divide after differentiation gene products therefore persist for a long time. This is why vacuole loss is progressive and it takes several days for the phenotype to fully manifest.</p><p>To investigate whether <italic>dstyk</italic> is expressed in the paraxial mesoderm and osteoblasts we performed ISH in cryosections at relevant stages and were not able to detect any trace of the <italic>dstyk</italic> transcript, while <italic>osterix</italic> expression in osteoblast was prominent. We have added a supplemental figure with these data.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Furthermore, the analyses on the notochord-specific requirement of Dstyk should be extended. The rescue experiments via injection of DNA constructs driving expression of labelled wild-type under the control of the rcn3 promoter provide first evidence. However, at least the rescue shown for the representative example in Figure 2L,M is not very convincing (isn't the indicated vacuole far too large?).</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewers for pointing this out. Indeed, we consistently observe that cells overexpressing Dstyk have larger vacuoles. We also detected that when sheath cells overexpressed Dstyk they appeared to make vacuoles. To investigate this further we injected our construct into a line that carries a sheath cell marker and observed, as shown in the revised Figure 4, that they clearly make vacuoles, thus strengthening our conclusions. This is consistent with previous work showing that vacuolated cells can regenerate lost vacuolated cells and suggests Dstyk may be important for notochord regeneration, we plan to test this idea in future work.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Also, it is not clear whether the transgene was only expressed in notochordal cells (the endogenous rcn3 gene also shows other expression domains, e.g. in the floorplate and the somites). This needs to be clearly stated.</p></disp-quote><p>In our rescue experiments we have consistent expression in notochord cells only, sheath and vacuolated cells, and not in the floor plate. We only scored larvae in which cell autonomous effects are clear, i. e. single expressing cells not surrounding by other expressing cells. We are confident about these results and have added more examples to the figure, along with the sheath cell phenotype mentioned above.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>If the transgene was not exclusively expressed in the notochord, it would be helpful to generate mosaics via cell or shield transplantation experiments to investigate whether a wild-type notochord in a mutant host leads to normal spine development and whether a mutant notochord in a wild-type host leads to spine defects as in regular mutants. Here, to more specifically target notochord cells, the authors might want to generate mosaics by transplanting wild-type cells directly into the shield of dstyk mutants and vice versa. These studies should definitively not take longer than two months.</p></disp-quote><p>We attempted this experiment several times, but we unfortunately were unable to generate viable embryos following transplants. Clearly, this is a traditional experimental skill that we need to learn from experts, nobody at Duke has expertise with cell transplantation. However, we feel this point is adequately addressed by our rescue and loss of function data.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Loss of zygotic Dstyp function does not affect the initial formation, but only the later maintenance of notochord vacuoles. In addition, it does not affect anterior, but only posterior regions of the spine. The authors propose that this might be due to a maternal supply of dstyk gene products that compensates for the zygotic loss. However, no such maternal expression or function is shown thus far, even though the Zebrafish Expression Atlas online tool https://www.ebi.ac.uk/gxa/experiments/E-ERAD-475/Results shows strong maternal dstyk expression. Therefore, the authors should add pre-MBT stages to their in situ hybridizations in Figure 2, complemented by RT-PCR analyses to demonstrate maternal dstyk expression. Furthermore, if homozygous females are fertile or can be successfully squeezed for in vitro fertilization, maternal-zygotic mutants should be generated and investigated for earlier defects in notochord vacuole formation.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewers for the suggestion. To answer this point, we performed ISH at the once-cell stage and detected robust expression of <italic>dstyk</italic> as expected, shown in a panel added to the corresponding figure, and also detect the transcript by RT-PCR (not shown). We also generated mz mutants and found they present very severe early phenotypes, perhaps pointing to a role in oogenesis. In embryos that survive through notochord morphogenesis we found that vacuolated cells differentiate, but do not make vacuoles. This result, our rescue experiments and our imaging data strongly support a role for <italic>dstyk</italic> in vacuole biogenesis. We have added a supplemental figure to illustrate the mz mutant phenotypes.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) The conclusion from Figure 7G that bone mineralization is mechanically regulated, based solely on apparent increased mineralization in mutants is too speculative. Have the authors explored whether dstyk is expressed in osteoblasts? For example, have the ISH experiments in Figure 2E been performed at later stages of development (after the onset of mineralization)? If so, this could present an additional/alternative explanation for the bone defects observed.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree the statement was too speculative at that point of the manuscript and have modified it. To answer the specific question, we performed ISH (please see answer to point 1) and found <italic>dstyk</italic> is not seem to be expressed in osteoblasts.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) In light of the observed vacuole fragmentation of notochord cells within intervertebral regions (thus not exposed to mechanical pressure from the mineralized bone of the forming centra), it would be interesting to study vacuole shapes in fish with expanded centra mineralization (e.g. after treatment with retinoic acid) and in the absence of bone mineralization (e.g. in the no bone mutant). Unaltered vacuole fragmentation patterns under such conditions would strongly point to a notochord-intrinsic patterning mechanism and be of broad significance. Hence, the authors should extend on their observation that even in wild types, the vacuoles within the intervertebral spaces undergo fragmentation. Thus, it would be important to investigate whether this segmented vacuole fragmentation is an intrinsic feature of the notochord or whether it depends on mechanical forces resulting from the biomineralization of the centra – which in turn could be under the control of external regulators. For these studies, no complex genetic scenarios are required. The authors would for instance just need plain no bone / entpd5a mutants (stained with Boedipy TR methylester dye) or wild-type or Tg(SAGFF214A:gal4); Tg(UAS:GFP) fish treated with retinoic acid or DEAB and analyzed at a standard length of 8.7 mm (3-4 weeks of age). Thus, also these studies could be completed within two months.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewers for these insightful suggestions. We carried out the suggested experiments as well as others that complement and extend those and other related observations.</p><p>We have added new data with a thorough quantitative characterization of WT and mutant vacuolated cells including their arrangement and morphological features that help explain the axis elongation defects. We also wanted to somehow determine whether vacuole fragmentation leads to a loss of internal notochord pressure and the results are striking. We figured out that as a consequence of vacuole inflation the vacuolated cell nuclei become displaced to the periphery of the notochord core and are deformed into bent disks. By contrast, in <italic>spzl</italic> mutants the nuclei are uniformly distributed throughout the notochord core and the vacuolated cell nuclei are more spherical. These data have been added to the new Figure 8.</p><p>To analyze the effect of notochord compression on vacuolated cell shape and arrangement we monitored quantitatively how cell shapes change over time using 3D renderings. We found that first with chordacentra formation and then with bone growth there is a significant change in morphology that is characterized by the emergence of highly elliptical cells, i.e. the cells that are stacked underneath centra. We have added these data to Figure 6.</p><p>To determine the effect of mineralization on vacuolated cells we monitored the notochord in <italic>nob</italic> mutants as suggested. We had heterozygous fish in the lab, but without the transgenes in the background, which made the analyses more difficult. We used the Bodipy TR methylester (Cell Trace) dye as far into development as it is possible and then switched to cryosections and WGA stainings. Initially, there is some level of compression from mesenchymal condensations, but these do not progress and as a result the early stages of vacuolated cell stacking are not apparent. Then, once bone mineralization has progressed in WT a clear distinction in vacuolated cell arrangements can be seen, with IVDs clearly bulging and vacuolated cells packing tightly. This reorganization of vacuolated cells does not occur in <italic>nob</italic> mutants, which retain the early arrangement. We would have liked to monitor this process at higher resolution, but to incorporate proper markers we would have needed another 3-4 months as late expression requires two separate transgenes. We would also like to add that the process of differentiation that leads to IVD formation is complex and goes beyond the developmental window we covered here. Cleary, future work will be needed to fully understand this process and will involve the development of new experimental methods and even theoretical approaches as this is a complex soft matter problem for which there is no theoretical framework.</p><p>We also performed the RA acid experiment as suggested. Following previously published protocols we were able to reproduce the increased mineralization effect of exogenous RA. We observed that as mineralization proceeds much further and at a faster rate upon RA treatment vacuoles stack prematurely and then are obliterated as the notochord is compressed further. These data have been included in the new Figure 11.</p><p>In addition to the results summarized above, we were also able to increase our numbers on the microCT analyses, further strengthening our conclusions.</p><p>Together, the results shown in the new Figure 11 add additional support to our initial conclusions. Future work should explore the mechanisms that mediate the effect of compression on vacuolated cell arrangement and vacuole integrity, we think this might be a mechanically driven self-organization process and is thus of great interest for us.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Title: With respect to the title, it would be more appropriate to say the vacuoles &quot;resist&quot; rather than &quot;absorb&quot; compressive one growth.</p></disp-quote><p>We think that both are appropriate and take place at different times, perhaps “resist and absorb” is the most accurate formulation, but would like to keep “absorb” as it reflects an important insight.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were suggested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The manuscript has been improved and the authors largely addressed the questions and concerns of the reviewers.
