These changes lead to poorer spatial coding during exploration and less coordinated activity during sharp-wave ripples, events involved in memory consolidation. Further, the density of CA1 inhibitory neurons expressing neuropeptide Y, a population key for the generation of pyramidal cell bursts, were significantly increased in Dp(16)1Yey mice. Our data refine the ‘over-suppression’ theory of Down syndrome pathophysiology and suggest specific neuronal subtypes involved in hippocampal dysfunction in these model mice.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>hippocampus</kwd><kwd>Down syndrome</kwd><kwd>place cell</kwd><kwd>ripples</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>RIKEN Brain Science Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Yamakawa</surname><given-names>Kazuhiro</given-names></name><name><surname>McHugh</surname><given-names>Thomas J</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>CA1 physiology is altered in the hippocampus of Down syndrome mice during both spatial exploration and rest, paralleled by an increase in populations of interneurons responsible for single cell and network synchronization.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Down syndrome (DS), with an incidence of one in 700 to 1000 live births, is the most common genetic cause of intellectual disability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Parker et al., 2010</xref>). It results from a triplication of chromosome 21 (HSA21) and leads to a wide spectrum of phenotypes, among which craniofacial malformation and intellectual deficits are the most striking for their full penetrance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Antonarakis et al., 2004</xref>). The behavioral phenotypes in DS include learning and memory deficits affecting both verbal and non-verbal cognition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Chapman and Hesketh, 2000</xref>) and poor performance in spatial memory tasks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Lavenex et al., 2015</xref>). Cellular defects have been observed in post-mortem brains of DS fetuses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Contestabile et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Guidi et al., 2008</xref>) but the mechanisms affecting function in the developing and adult DS brain have remained elusive. Accumulating data, however, support the idea that a shift in the balance between inhibitory and excitatory transmission may contribute to DS learning phenotypes, particularly in the hippocampus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Kleschevnikov et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Kleschevnikov et al., 2004</xref>). This has led to the proposal that targeting alterations in GABAergic signaling may be a viable therapeutic target (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Contestabile et al., 2017</xref>), however evidence for this on the circuit level is scarce.</p><p>A large portion of HSA21 possesses a syntenic region on mouse chromosome 16 (MMU16), conserving many of the genes in the same order and relative orientation. Mouse models of DS have thus been developed to circumvent the limited access to brain structures and the genetic variance in the DS population. These models, carrying various lengths of chromosomal duplications, recapitulate most of the DS-like characteristics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Lana-Elola et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Dierssen, 2012</xref>). In particular, models carrying some of the largest duplications, Ts65Dn and Dp(16)1Yey, display learning and memory deficits associated with a loss of hippocampal long-term potentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Reeves et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Kleschevnikov et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Yu et al., 2010a</xref>). Similar phenotypes have been described in the transchromosomic Tc1 model carrying a nearly complete HSA21 chromosome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">O'Doherty et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Morice et al., 2008</xref>). These models thus mimic the human condition in regards to hippocampal dependent spatial and working memory deficits.</p><p>In rodents the hippocampus is crucial for the encoding and consolidation of spatial memory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Jarrard, 1993</xref>). In the CA1 region pyramidal neurons exhibit spatial receptive fields, referred to as ‘place fields’, which manifest as discrete locations in the environment where a given cell’s firing rate increases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">O'Keefe and Dostrovsky, 1971</xref>). Further, during movement the hippocampus exhibits rhythmic population activity in the theta-band (6–12 Hz) which contributes to memory encoding by temporally organizing pyramidal cell spiking (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Buzsáki, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">O'Keefe and Recce, 1993</xref>). Following exploration, when animals are resting or sleeping, the hippocampal local field potential is dominated by short high-frequency oscillations (~100 ms, 80–250 Hz) referred to as sharp wave ripples (SWRs; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Buzsáki, 2015</xref>), events shown to be critical for memory consolidation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Ramadan et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Ego-Stengel and Wilson, 2010</xref>). During SWRs CA1 pyramidal cells display temporally precise spiking that replays activity related to past behavioral episodes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Karlsson and Frank, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Girardeau et al., 2009</xref>). Thus both during encoding and consolidation the precise timing of hippocampal spiking is a crucial feature of creating a functional memory trace (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Buzsáki, 1989</xref>). This precision is under the tight control of a diverse family of inhibitory interneurons which regulate the generation of bursts in pyramidal cells, their spike timing within theta during exploratory behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Royer et al., 2012</xref>) and the synchronization required to generate and maintain ripple events (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Pangalos et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Cutsuridis and Taxidis, 2013</xref>). The tight inhibitory system grafts onto the excitatory input, involving direct input to the CA1 from the entorhinal cortex as well as excitation arriving via the tri-synaptic circuit, in which information flows through the dentate gyrus to the CA3 and/or CA2 and then on to CA1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Jones and McHugh, 2011</xref>), and ensures proper activation and synchronization of the hippocampal network.</p><p><italic>In vitro</italic> approaches have identified synaptic plasticity deficits in the hippocampus of DS mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Belichenko et al., 2015</xref>). Though long-term potentiation deficits in the dentate gyrus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Morice et al., 2008</xref>) and mild instability of CA1 place fields (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Witton et al., 2015</xref>) have been observed <italic>in vivo</italic> in Tc1 mice, no extensive electrophysiological characterization of a DS mouse model in freely moving conditions has been reported. Here we use the Dp(16)1Yey model carrying a large and stable tandem duplication on the MMU16 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>) to circumvent the issue of mosaicism seen in Tc1 mouse brain (~66% chromosome retention in the brain; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">O'Doherty et al., 2005</xref>). Using single-unit activity and LFP recording in the dorsal CA1 of freely moving Dp(16)1Yey and control mice both during exploratory behavior on a linear track and periods of rest we analyzed CA1 physiology at the single cell and population levels. We combined this electrophysiological study with an immunohistochemical approach to help elucidate possible circuit mechanisms affecting CA1 function in DS mice.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Decreased bursting and complex spiking and abnormal spatial encoding during exploration in the CA1 of Dp(16)1Yey mice</title><p>In order to investigate hippocampal spatial coding Dp(16)1Yey (Dp16; N = 6) and wild-type littermate control (WT; N = 5) mice were implanted with recording electrodes in the dorsal CA1 pyramidal cell layer and allowed to explore a linear track (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). We observed no difference between the groups in average velocity (Dp16: 4.17 ± 0.60 cm/s; WT: 4.57 ± 0.19 cm/s; p=0.542) or total distance traveled (Dp16: 4857.92 ± 424.04 cm; WT: 5695.24 ± 318.18 cm; p=0.128). We first compared local field potentials (LFP) recorded in CA1 while the mice were exploring and found no difference between the groups across all frequencies, including the theta (6–12 Hz) and gamma bands (30–100 Hz) prominent during exploratory behavior (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2A</xref>). We then isolated and sorted single-unit activity from CA1 pyramidal cells and examined their spatially modulated firing (WT: n = 256; Dp16: n = 259). Place fields in Dp16 mice were more diffuse than those in their control littermates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). Quantitative analysis confirmed that in the DS mice the place fields were significantly larger (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>) and sparser (Firing rate map sparsity: WT: 0.319 ± 0.010; Dp(16)1Yey: 0.359 ± 0.011; p=0.0189), resulting in a significant decrease in the spatial information encoded by these neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). On a linear track hippocampal place cells exhibit directionality, a bias to fire more in one direction than the other.

On a finer level we observed that Dp16 place cells displayed a significantly lower in-field firing rate but fired normally outside of their place field (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1H,I</xref>). Taken together, these results suggest that place cells in the DS mice may lack the ability to generate the normal burst patterns of firing seen when the animal navigates through the receptive field (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Ranck, 1973</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Quirk and Wilson, 1999</xref>). To investigate if the decrease in peak firing rate we observed reflected a loss of the ability to produce the complex spike bursts typical of pyramidal cells we compared the complex spike index (CSI; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">McHugh et al., 1996</xref>) between the groups and found it to be drastically lower in the Dp16 mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1J</xref>).</p><p>During movement the spiking of pyramidal cells is strongly modulated by the underlying theta oscillation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Siapas et al., 2005</xref>).

The proportion of significantly theta-modulated cells was not significantly different between Dp16 and control mice (WT: 121/256, 47.3%; Dp16: 115/259, 44.4%, Chi-square test p=0.514) and the firing probability of significantly theta-modulated CA1 place cells as a function of theta phase showed a highly similar pattern between the groups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2B</xref>).

Thus, we next investigated the spatial representation at the ensemble level.

Given the directional preference of single place cells, we separated left and right laps on the track and examined their auto and cross-correlations independently (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A and B</xref>). In the resulting matrices quadrants II and III correspond to the correlation of a population vector (quadrant II: left laps, quadrant III: right laps) with itself and hence, points along the diagonal reach maximal values, while points away from the diagonal correspond to the correlation between population activity at different positions, with increasing distance from the diagonal reflecting increasingly distant positions on the track. In both the control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>) and Dp16 mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>) the correlation decreased rapidly as a function of distance from the diagonal.

During this quiescent period the peak and average firing rate of CA1 pyramidal cells were not significantly different between Dp16 and WT mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A,B</xref>). However, similar to what we observed during exploration, the complex spiking index was significantly lower in the DS model mice, suggesting that the deficit in the generation of complex spikes could impact off-line memory consolidation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). Plotting the inter-spike interval (ISI) distribution of all spike trains from WT pyramidal cells revealed a clear narrow peak at short ISIs (~2 to 15 ms) and a second wide peak at longer ISIs (≥100 ms; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>). These populations correspond to ISIs resulting from bursts (including complex spikes) and those representing the time between bursts and/or single spikes respectively. In contrast, the ISI distribution of spike trains recorded from Dp16 pyramidal cells showed a reduction of the short ISI peak and a slight increase at longer ISIs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>). Accordingly, the ISI mode, defined as the most frequent ISI for a given cell, was significantly longer in the Dp16 data compared to controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>). An increase in the ISI mode, which preferentially reflects the frequent short ISIs generate by bursts, without a significant change in the mean firing rate suggested that spikes generated by CA1 pyramidal cells in Dp16 mice were sparser and less likely to be involved in bursts. Overall, these data indicate that in Dp(16)1Yey mice the ability of pyramidal cells to fire bursts of spikes is impaired.</p><fig id="fig3" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.31543.007</object-id><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>Decreased bursting of CA1 pyramidal cells in Dp(16)1Yey mice during post-exploratory rest.</title><p>During post-exploratory quiescent periods the peak firing rate (<bold>A</bold>) and mean firing rate (<bold>B</bold>) were not significantly different between the WT and Dp(16)1Yey groups.

These neurons regulate pyramidal cells’ excitability by directly targeting their dendritic tufts, affecting pyramidal cells bursts and, unlike basket cells, have no effect on the spike timing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Pangalos et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Royer et al., 2012</xref>). While we did not find a significant alteration in the size of the OLM interneuron population, functional changes at the cellular level in these neurons could contribute to the drastic decrease in bursts from pyramidal cells in Dp(16)1Yey mice. Further work is required to investigate whether the intrinsic properties of OLM cells are affected in this model.</p><p>NPY staining reveals different populations of interneurons: OLM cells in the <italic>stratum oriens</italic> (see above), bistratified cells (BS, also PV positive) and Ivy cells (PV negative) in the <italic>stratum pyramidale</italic> and a newly identified class of SLM-SR interneurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Somogyi and Klausberger, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Fuentealba et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Milstein et al., 2015</xref>). Here we found an increase in NPY positive interneurons in the <italic>stratum pyramidale</italic>, putative BS and Ivy cells. These two classes of interneurons possess an overlapping role in the regulation of CA1 pyramidal cells, by targeting processes in the stratum radiatum and oriens (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Cutsuridis and Taxidis, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Fuentealba et al., 2008</xref>). Both BS and Ivy interneurons are able to directly control pyramidal cells’ excitability by affecting the processing of input from the CA3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Lovett-Barron et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Fuentealba et al., 2008</xref>). Though it is not clear if Ivy cells are able to induce a similar effect, BS cells are known to control the bursting of pyramidal cells and to switch their firing between single spikes and bursts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Lovett-Barron et al., 2012</xref>; Cutsuridis and Taxidis, 2012). Dp(16)1Yey mice have an increased density of these NPY positive interneuron and display a strong reduction in their ability to produce bursts of spikes during the two critical phases of spatial learning: exploration and memory consolidation. The shift observed in the biphasic distribution of single versus burst spikes may be caused by an enhanced inhibition from BS and/or Ivy cells. In addition, the increased population of NPY positive interneurons at the SLM-SR border corresponds to a recently identified class of interneurons with unique characteristics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Milstein et al., 2015</xref>). A similar increase has been reported in the Ts65Dn model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Hernández-González et al., 2015</xref>). Unlike PV and SST expressing interneurons, these NPY positive cells are able to integrate inputs from both the CA3 and the entorhinal cortex to trigger complex spikes in pyramidal cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Milstein et al., 2015</xref>). Enhanced inhibition resulting from increased NPY +interneurons density is thus likely to impact pyramidal cells in the Dp(16)1Yey model and contribute to the decrease in complex spiking seen in these mice.</p><p>Deficits in hippocampal plasticity and hippocampal dependent learning and memory are consistent phenotypes observed not only in this model, but also in the other three main mouse models for DS: Ts1Cje, Ts65Dn and Tc1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Reeves et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Sago et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Siarey et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Siarey et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Belichenko et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">O'Doherty et al., 2005</xref>). Over the past decade the extensive study of these DS mice, especially the Ts65Dn model, has led to a main hypothesis that the leading cause for brain phenotypes in DS is over-inhibition by the GABAergic system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Contestabile et al., 2017</xref>). This theory is originally based on histological and electrophysiological observations showing increases in interneurons, changes in the repartition of inhibitory synapses, and increased GABA induced inhibitory currents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Chakrabarti et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Hernández-González et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Belichenko et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Belichenko et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Best et al., 2007</xref>). It is also supported by pharmacological approaches showing a rescue of the learning, memory and LTP deficits using drugs inducing a decrease in inhibitory signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Fernandez et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Braudeau et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Martínez-Cué et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Kleschevnikov et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Deidda et al., 2015</xref>). As no drug is available to date for treating Down syndrome phenotypes, the GABAergic hypothesis is a leading target for recent clinical trials using broad GABA antagonist compounds.</p><p>Thus far, the imbalance between inhibition and excitation and its links to DS-related cognitive deficits has been examined in rodent behavioral and <italic>in vitro</italic> studies, thus more work is required to understand how circuits and microcircuits are affected in the Down syndrome brain. Our work provides the first extensive characterization of the <italic>in vivo</italic> neuronal activity in freely behaving animals and can serve as the basis for the design of novel biomarkers to address the GABAergic theory <italic>in vivo</italic>. Our data indicate that changes occurring in a limited class of interneurons could support abnormal neuronal function at the circuit level, suggesting that drugs targeted to these neurons could prove more successful in treating Down syndrome phenotypes than non-specific GABA antagonists. For technical and practical reasons we did not combine our recordings with drugs in the current study, nonetheless we believe our work could serve as a starting point to screen compounds, together with the behavioral and <italic>in vitro</italic> approaches that have been used successfully thus far. Further studies will be required to investigate potential cause-consequence relationships between changes in interneuron populations and the deficits we observed in pyramidal cell properties.</p><p>Though the studies discussed above concur that deficits in DS mice are driven by an enhanced GABAergic inhibition, the exact origin of this excitation/inhibition imbalance remains unclear. Our data supports previous reports suggesting that the pool of specific inhibitory neurons is increased in the hippocampus of DS animals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Hernández-González et al., 2015</xref>). Very few genes within the trisomic region of Dp(16)1Yey mice are known to have a direct impact on interneuron differentiation. The main candidate mechanisms so far are a decreased response to SHH signaling, most likely though the overexpression of <italic>App</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Roper et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Trazzi et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Xu et al., 2010</xref>) and the direct regulation of embryonic neuronal differentiation by <italic>Olig1</italic> and <italic>Olig2</italic> in the medial ganglionic eminence (MGE; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Chakrabarti et al., 2010</xref>). Interestingly, although the changes observed by these authors in early post-natal hippocampus are not reproduced at adult stages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Hernández-González et al., 2015</xref>), present study), an abnormal MGE neuron differentiation mechanism could be responsible for the NPY positive populations increase in the Dp(16)1Yey mice, as these cells derive from this embryonic structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Tricoire et al., 2010</xref>). The serine-threonine kinase <italic>Dyrk1a</italic> is also among the top candidates for its ability to affect the neuronal precursors cell cycle, directly or through a synergistic effect with the regulator of calcineurin <italic>Rcan1</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Arron et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Hämmerle et al., 2011</xref>). Future work using complex genetic rescue approaches, as developed by Chakrabarti and colleagues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Chakrabarti et al., 2010</xref>), will help understand the genotype-phenotype relationships underlying the cellular and electrophysiological abnormalities reported in the present work.</p><p>In conclusion, we identified a deficit in the ability of pyramidal cells to generate bursts and complex spikes, as well as to synchronize during population events in the Dp(16)1Yey DS model. These changes affect hippocampal function both during exploration and post-exploratory rest periods, i.e. during memory encoding and consolidation phases. The concurrent observation of an increase in NPY expressing interneurons suggests that a subtype specific ‘over-suppression’ in the DS brain is likely contributing to these changes in physiology. These phenotypes could have a direct role in the spatial learning deficiency observed in these mice and suggest that a targeting of specific neuron subtypes may help recover some of their DS-like impairments.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th>Reagent type (species) <break/>or resource</th><th>Designation</th><th>Source or reference</th><th>Identifiers</th><th>Additional information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>strain, strain <break/>background (mouse, males)</td><td>‘Dp(16)1Yey’; ‘Dp16’</td><td>Jackson Laboratory</td><td>‘Stock number: 013530’; <break/>‘RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/MGI:5690055">MGI:5690055</ext-link>’</td><td/></tr><tr><td>antibody</td><td>anti-PCP4 rabbit polyclonal IgG</td><td>Santa-Cruz</td><td>‘sc-74816’; ‘RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/AB_2236566">AB_2236566</ext-link>’</td><td>1:200 dilution; frozen sections</td></tr><tr><td>antibody</td><td>anti-NPY</td><td>Cell Signaling Technology</td><td>‘#11976’; ‘RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/AB_2716286">AB_2716286</ext-link>’</td><td>1:400 dilution; frozen sections</td></tr><tr><td>antibody</td><td>anti-SST-14</td><td>Peninsula Laboratories</td><td>‘T-4103’; ‘RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/AB_518614">AB_518614</ext-link>’</td><td>1:500 dilution; frozen sections</td></tr><tr><td>antibody</td><td>anti-PV</td><td>Calbiochem</td><td>‘PC255L’; ‘RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/AB_2173906">AB_2173906</ext-link>’</td><td>1:1000 dilution; frozen sections</td></tr><tr><td>antibody</td><td>biotinylated goat <break/>anti-rabbit IgG antibody</td><td>Vector Laboratories</td><td>‘BA-1000’; ‘RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/AB_2313606">AB_2313606</ext-link>’</td><td/></tr><tr><td>commercial assay or kit</td><td>RetrievagenA</td><td>BD Biosciences</td><td>#550524</td><td>antigen retireval reagent</td></tr><tr><td>commercial assay or kit</td><td>Avidin/Biotin blocking kit</td><td>Vector Laboratories</td><td>SP-2001</td><td>blocking reagent</td></tr><tr><td>commercial assay or kit</td><td>VECTASTAIN Elite ABC kit</td><td>Vector Laboratories</td><td>PK-6100</td><td>signal amplification kit</td></tr><tr><td>commercial assay or kit</td><td>NovaRed substrate kit</td><td>Vector Laboratories</td><td>SK-4800</td><td>revelation kit</td></tr><tr><td>chemical compound, drug</td><td>‘Avertin ‘; ‘2, 2, <break/>2-tribromoethanol’</td><td>Sigma-Aldrich</td><td>T48402</td><td>anaesthetic</td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap><sec id="s4-1"><title>Subjects</title><p>All procedures were approved by the RIKEN Animal Care and Use Committee (project approval numbers H29-2-218(2) and # H29-2-224(3)).

They were single housed after stereotaxic surgical implantation of microdrives.</p></sec><sec id="s4-2"><title>Surgery, recording and histology</title><p>Animals were anesthetized using Avertin (2, 2, 2-tribromoethanol; Sigma-Aldrich, 476 mg/kg, i.p.) and implanted with a custom microdrives (manufactured with the assistance of the Advanced Manufacturing Support Team, RIKEN Center for Advanced Photonics, Japan) targeting the dorsal hippocampus (1.6 mm posterior and 1.2 mm right-lateral coordinates from bregma). Microdrives consisted of eight independently adjustable nichrome tetrodes (14 μm) arranged in two rows of 4 and gold plated to reach an impedance of 200 to 250 kΩ. Stainless steel screws placed on the cerebellum were used as ground and two extra tetrodes placed in the corpus callosum were used as references. Tetrodes were then slowly lowered over the course of several days to reach CA1 stratum pyramidale, identified by the presence of sharp wave ripples and large amplitude spikes. During this adjustment period, mice were kept in a small circular sleep/rest box (15 cm diameter). Tetrodes were then finely adjusted daily to maximize cell yield before recording. Recordings consisted of 10 laps of exploration on a linear track (170 × 10 cm with 15 cm high plastic walls) bracketed by 30 min pre- and post-exploratory rest/sleep sessions in the familiar circular rest box. Mice were trained for three consecutive days and data recorded on the third day were used for all analyses. Data were acquired using a 32-channel Digital Lynx4S system using Cheetah v5.6.0 acquisition software (Neuralynx). Signals were sampled at 32556 Hz and spike waveforms filtered between 0.6–6 kHz. Position and head direction were concurrently tracked using a pair of red/green light emitting diodes affixed to the microdrive.</p><p>At the end of the third recording session, mice were given a lethal dose of Avertin and tetrodes position was marked by electrolytic lesion (50 μA input for ~8 s to each tetrode individually). After transcardial perfusion with 0.9% NaCL/5 mM EGTA followed by 4% paraformaldehyde, brains were collected, post-fixed for 48 hr and embedded in 15% sucrose – 50% OCT. Frozen coronal sections (30 μm) were prepared and labeled by immunohistochemistry using an antibody targeting PCP4, a marker for CA2, to determine the borders of the CA1 area.

Artifacts in the animal’s positional values caused by the obscuring of diodes were removed using a custom written algorithm and the positional data was smoothed with a Gaussian kernel of 0.05 standard deviation (SD) width. Single units were isolated manually, in SpikeSort3D software (Neuralynx), by drawing cluster boundaries around the 3D projection of the spike features. The boundaries were tracked across same-day recording trials to ensure cluster stability. Clusters that had greater than 0.5% of their spikes violate a minimum 2 ms inter-spike interval (ISI), fire less than 50 spikes or display an isolation distance measure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Schmitzer-Torbert et al., 2005</xref>) &lt;10 were excluded from further analyses.

For a subset of analyses such as ‘directionality index’ and ‘population vectors’ a ‘firing rate curve’ i.e. a directionally-sensitive 1D representation of a ‘firing rate map’ was used. For the ‘firing rate curve’ calculation we first detect ‘laps’ – time periods when mouse was running along the track by using custom detection algorithm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Polygalov, 2017</xref>). The quality of lap detection was controlled visually. The left firing curve was defined then as total number of spikes fired across all left laps within each spatial bin divided by total time mouse spent in that spatial bin. The right firing curve was calculated similarly. Peak firing rate was defined as the rate in the spatial bin containing the maximal firing rate value within each rate map. Mean firing rate was calculated by dividing the number of spikes which occurred within periods when velocity exceed 2 cm/sec by that period’s duration and followed averaging of these values. A place field was defined as a set of contiguous spatial bins surrounding the bin where the maximal firing rate was observed. In-field mean firing rate was the total number of spikes emitted by the cell while the mouse was in the place field with the highest peak firing rate (main place field of that cell) divided by the total time spent by the mouse in this field. Out-field mean firing rate was the number of spikes emitted by the cell in all spatial bins outside of the main field of that cell divided by the total time spent by the mouse outside of the main place field. Place cells were required to have a minimum field size equivalent to six bins (1 cm x 1 cm bin size), a mean firing rate &gt;0.2 Hz, a peak firing rate &gt;1.0 Hz and a positive signal to noise ratio (SNR, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Resnik et al., 2012</xref>). Place field size was defined as the number of spatial bins where place cell field firing exceeded 20% of the peak firing rate. Rate map sparsity was computed as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Resnik et al., 2012</xref>). Firing rate map ‘sparsity’ is a number ranging from 0 to 1, were 0 correspond to a firing rate map which consists of equal firing rate values in every visited spatial bin. Firing rate map with sparsity value one corresponds to the case when all the spikes generated by any given cell were fit in a single spatial bin. The directionality index (DI) was calculated for the subset of place cells with their main field located in the middle 80% of the track. DI was defined as the absolute value of ((FR_lm - FR_rm)/(FR_lm + FR_rm)) where FR_lm is the mean firing rate across all left laps of a given trial and FR_rm is the mean firing rate across all right laps of a given trial.

The absolute value of Hilbert transform was then smoothed with 50 ms Gaussian window and candidate ripple events were detected as periods where magnitude exceeded 3SD above the mean for &gt;30 ms. Of the events, the initiation and termination periods were defined as periods when the magnitude returned to the mean. Summed multi-unit activity (MUA) across all neurons was converted to instantaneous firing rate and smoothed, to allow detection of firing bursts using the same thresholds as described for LFP. Candidate ripple events not coincident with MUA bursts were excluded from subsequent analysis. For cleaner detection of ripple frequency for each ripple, a multitaper method was performed on the product of each filtered ripple waveform and a Hanning window of the same length.</p><p>To control for the impact of the significant decrease in normal ripple amplitude observed in the Dp16 mice on the quantification of ripple-related pyramidal cell spiking ripple we adjusted the threshold and repeated the ripple detection algorithm detection.

The authors recorded from hippocampal CA1 place cells while animals ran on a linear track and while they rested. They found that place cells in the Dp mice have wider place fields with less prospective coding and local field potentials (LFPs) in the Dp mice show less ripple oscillations, both of which are linked to reduced bursty firing of CA1 cells. Together with the finding of more NPY-positive neurons in certain layers of CA1, the authors conclude that memory encoding and consolidation are impaired due to altered bursty firing caused by over inhibition.

The main finding is that reduced bursty firing of hippocampal place cells leads to less precise place fields during running, suggesting a deficit in memory encoding, and less participation of cells in sharp-wave ripples during resting, suggesting a deficit in memory consolidation. The authors further performed immunohistochemistry to suggest that the reduction in bursty firing is related to changes in the number of NPY-positive interneurons, which results in over-inhibition in the mouse model. The revision has improved the writing and data presentation. The authors have also addressed the potential impacts of their finding on the understanding and treatment of Down syndrome. The quality of the manuscript has been improved. Also, I believe the issue of general impact has been strengthened to a degree that I believe the paper should be published.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic> </p><p>My assessment remains that the different observations made in this manuscript of differences between Dp16 and wild-type mice (e.g. spatial firing specificity, bidirectional coding, bursting propensity, spatial distribution of interneuron subclasses), while of interest for a better understanding of mouse models of Down Syndrome, do not aggregate to important mechanistic insights that will be of high general impact. That these changes stem from increased NPY expression in the pyramidal and LM layers is still speculative at this stage.</p><p>One other point regarding the ripple/MUA burst analysis, I think the authors missed my suggestion to perform the analysis on MUA bursts that are <italic>concurrent</italic> with ripples, to avoid the issue they mentioned of contamination from non-ripple periods. I also think the outcomes of this analysis should be presented in the main text, not just for reviewers.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.31543.023</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p>[Editors’ note: the author responses to the first round of peer review follow.]</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1:</p></disp-quote><p><italic>This manuscript addresses the question of what circuit alterations in a mouse model of Down syndrome, the Dp(16)1Yey model, give rise to learning and memory deficits.

While we agree that the characterization of the physiological changes in a disease model mouse can result in a largely descriptive study, we would like to emphasize to both you and the readers why we feel this work is important. One reason it has been difficult to generate simple and targetable hypotheses concerning the underlying mechanisms of cognitive deficits in DS patients is the lack of data on circuit level functional changes. To make this clear, and more explicitly position our data in light of current literature and hypotheses, we have added a paragraph to the Discussion on this issue.

As we stated in our reply to reviewer #2 above, we agree that it can be challenging to identify a precise mechanism underlying phenotypes observed in disease model mice. However, given the high degree of genetic change and the plethora of developmental and adult phenotypes that accompany DS, it has been difficult to generate simple and targetable hypotheses concerning the underlying mechanisms of cognitive deficits in these patients. We feel that our data can be very useful in extending and refining current thinking, particularly the idea that cognitive phenotypes associated with DS stem from a shift in the I/E balance in the hippocampus. We have modified our Discussion to more directly reflect this and are more explicit in stating how we believe our findings can help more the field forward.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>I have some concern regarding the various analyses.</p><p>1) For the ISI distribution analysis, I am concerned that a few outlier neurons may be contributing disproportionately to the distributions.

First, as detailed in response to point #2 of reviewer 1 above, we apologize for the confusion caused by our poor description of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figures 3D and E</xref> in the original manuscript. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref> (now <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref> in the revised version) represents the distribution of all ISI values from all spike trains recorded from CA1 pyramidal cells during the post-run rest (not averaged by neuron).

The main difference we wished to highlight in this figure is the decrease in the short-latency ‘burst’ peak in the Dp16 mice. To address your concern that this result is impact by a few outlier neurons we did calculate the average ISI for each pyramidal cell and compared these values across groups. Both groups demonstrated similar non-normal population distributions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig1">Author response image 1</xref>: Kurtosis: WT: 10.41, Dp16: 7.06; D’Agostino K<sup>2</sup>: WT: 154.4, Dp16: 124.5). Further, there was no significant difference between genotypes, with the group exhibiting similar medians (WT: 2443 ms, Dp16: 2226 ms; Mann Whitney p=0.47) and quartile values (Q1: WT: 1227 ms, Dp16: 982 ms; Q3: WT: 4752 ms, Dp16: 4672 ms).</p><fig id="respfig1"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.31543.020</object-id><label>Author response image 1.</label><caption><title>Population distribution of the mean ISI of pyramidal cells in wild-type (blue) and Dp(16) (red) pyramidal cells.</title></caption><graphic mime-subtype="jpeg" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-31543-resp-fig1-v2"/></fig><p>An important point of note is that for a single neuron the distribution of ISIs is large and non-normal, ranging from the short ISIs generated during bursts or high-frequency spiking to seconds long ISIs frequently observed in pyramidal cells during rest. Thus, we feel that the data presented in the original <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref> (now <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>) which plots the average of the mode of the ISI values of single pyramidal cells is a more informative measure. To generate these data we first identified the most frequent ISI for each individual cell (the mode of the distribution), which typically is a small value due to the regularity and frequency of burst events. Then we averaged these values across the cells of each genotype. A longer average ISI mode without a significant change in the mean firing rate supports our conclusion that spikes generated by CA1 pyramidal cells in Dp16 mice were sparser and less likely to be involved in bursts. We realize this figure was not well described in the previous version of the paper and apologize for the error.</p><p>Finally, to demonstrate to the reviewer that this increase in the mode is independent of the mean ISI, we divided pyramidal cells of each group into bins based on their average ISI and calculated the mean ISI mode across these subpopulations. As see in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig2">Author response image 2</xref>, the increase in the mode is robust across the entire population and most pronounced in the bins below 4000 ms.</p><fig id="respfig2"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.31543.021</object-id><label>Author response image 2.</label><caption><title>The average ISI mode is larger in the Dp(16) pyramidal cells across all average ISI bin.</title><p>(0-2000ms WT n=92, Dp16 n=99; 2000-4000 ms WT n=53, Dp16 n=48; 4000-6000ms WT n=40, Dp16 n=19; 6000-8000 ms WT n=9, Dp16 n=17; 8000-10000ms WT n=7, Dp16 n=9; &gt;10000ms WT n=12, Dp16 n=16)</p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="jpeg" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-31543-resp-fig2-v2"/></fig><p>We have now updated the text in the subsection “Decreased bursting during memory consolidation in Dp(16)1Yey mice” to better explain this analysis and updated the legend of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) In the ripple event/firing rate analysis, I am concerned that the lower amplitude of events in Dp16 mice may make detection of their onsets and offsets less reliable, thus confounding the other measures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4G-I</xref>).

Can you please also provide these measures for the concurrent MUA bursts (i.e. to provide spikes per MUA burst, participation% , etc.) to make sure that these differences are robust?</p></disp-quote><p>As the reviewer notes, the average normalized amplitude of ripple events in Dp16 mutant mice is lower than in WT. Nonetheless, we would like to explain why we think that the properties of our ripple detection algorithm allow our spiking analysis to remain robust.</p><p>First we would like to clarify our standard approach. The onset and offset times of ripple events were detected on each LFP channel individually, based on how many standard deviations instantaneous LFP power in the ripple frequency band (80-250 Hz) deflect from that channel’s mean LFP power value measured in the same band, using a threshold of 3 s.d., which is standard in the field. The candidate ripple events detected based on the normalized LFP power are then checked for co-occurrence with the underlying MUA bursts. The MUA bursts are detected by converting spike trains generated by multiple putative pyramidal cells into single instantaneous firing rate curve, which is also normalized in the same way as the instantaneous LFP power, yielding start and stop timestamps of the MUA bursts. Only these candidate ripple events detected from the LFP signal which co-occurred with supra-threshold MUA bursts were used then for the further analysis.</p><p>Given the normalization and combined LFP/MUA approach we are confident we are reliably detecting true ripple events and not omitting events in the DS mice. Note that we observed no change in the number of events detected with this approach. However we are happy to address the reviewer’s concern as requested. We have now repeated the analysis using three variations of the ripple detection algorithm. First, as asked, we detected candidate “ripple” event using only the significant increase in MUA activity, independent of the LFP recordings, and use the threshold crossing times of the MUA activity to define event onset and offset. While this approach detects significantly more events in both groups of mice, likely due to the inclusion of non-ripple related firing rate changes, the decrease in single unit spiking and the shortening of the ripple duration are still significantly altered in the Dp16 mice. With this method the change in ripple participation, albeit lower in the Dp16 mice, was no longer significant as p=0.08.

Although this dramatically changes the number of events detected, once more we found that ripple related spiking of pyramidal cells in the Dp16 mice was significantly altered. We have included these additional analyses as a new supplemental figure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2</xref>) and now refer to it in the subsection “Sharp wave ripples properties are affected and place cells fire less during ripples in Dp(16)1Yey CA1”.</p><p>[Editors’ note: the author responses to the re-review follow.]</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2:</p><p>My assessment remains that the different observations made in this manuscript of differences between Dp16 and wild-type mice (e.g. spatial firing specificity, bidirectional coding, bursting propensity, spatial distribution of interneuron subclasses), while of interest for a better understanding of mouse models of Down Syndrome, do not aggregate to important mechanistic insights that will be of high general impact. That these changes stem from increased NPY expression in the pyramidal and LM layers is still speculative at this stage.</p></disp-quote><p>As stated in our previous point-by-point response, we fully recognize the challenges in the identification of precise mechanisms underlying the phenotypes observed in disease model mice. This is an issue not just for DS, but extends to other models of disease and cognitive dysfunction as well. Nonetheless, there is clear support and interest in the field for these types of studies, as borne out by the continued publication and citation of work addressing the physiological changes in circuit function in disease model organisms. For several recent examples similar in approach to our current work please see: 22q11.2 model (schizophrenia): Zaremba et al., Nat. Neuro. 2017; MeCP2 -/- (Rett syndrome): Lu et al., Neuron 2016; rTg4510 (AD): Cheng and Ji, <italic>eLife</italic>, 2013; PP2B cKO (schizophrenia): Suh et al., Neuron, 2013; Fmr1-Null (fragile X): Talbot et al., Neuron 2018.</p><p>Further, we agree that our results do not allow us to establish a cause-consequence relationship between our electrophysiological and cell count observations. For exactly that reason, in the previous and current versions of the manuscript we do not state that the increase in NPY interneuron populations is directly responsible for the abnormal properties of CA1 pyramidal cells. We frame our conclusions on this matter as a hypothesis and acknowledge further study is required to fully test it. In order to emphasize this point, we added the following sentence to the Discussion:</p><p>“Further studies will be required to investigate potential cause-consequence relationships between changes in interneuron populations and the deficits we observed in pyramidal cell properties.”</p><p>Finally, regarding the issues of mechanism and impact the reviewer raises, perhaps not surprisingly, we respectfully disagree. We remain confident that our high-quality <italic>in vivo</italic> physiological characterization of a well-established mouse model of DS, along with the anatomical data, lend strong support to the existing hypothesis that cognitive deficits in DS are related to increased inhibition. Most importantly, these novel data can serve to provide a benchmark for circuit function in the brain of DS model mice and prove useful in the design and testing of future therapeutic interventions.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>One other point regarding the ripple/MUA burst analysis, I think the authors missed my suggestion to perform the analysis on MUA bursts that are concurrent with ripples, to avoid the issue they mentioned of contamination from non-ripple periods. I also think the outcomes of this analysis should be presented in the main text, not just for reviewers.</p></disp-quote><p>We apologies if we misunderstood this suggestion in the previous set of revisions. We believe this refers to your previous major comment #3:</p><p><italic>“3) In the ripple event/firing rate analysis, I am concerned that the lower amplitude of events in Dp16 mice may make detection of their onsets and offsets less reliable, thus confounding the other measures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4G-4I</xref>). I noted that the onset and offsets of MUA bursts were also recorded. Can you please also provide these measures for the concurrent MUA bursts (i.e. to provide spikes per MUA burst, participation% , etc.) to make sure that these differences are robust</italic>?”</p><p>As requested, we reanalyzed all the parameters regarding ripple events and pyramidal cell activity using the multiunit activity to detect onsets and offsets of ripple events. The results are highly similar to those obtained when we used the LFP to detect event onset and offset (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). Ripples detected through this method were significantly shorter and of lower amplitude in Dp16 animals, and the firing and ripple participation of individual pyramidal cells were significantly decreased in the Dp16 group. As suggested, we summarized these information in a supplementary figure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4—figure supplement 3</xref>).</p><p>Accordingly, the following sentence was added to the Results section:</p><p>“To further confirm that these changes were not attributable simple to the smaller amplitude of ripples in the Dp16 group we also detected the onset and offset of the events using only multiunit spiking activity and again observed a significant decrease in ripple amplitude, duration, number of spikes and participation in ripple events (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4—figure supplement 3</xref>).”</p></body></sub-article></article>
