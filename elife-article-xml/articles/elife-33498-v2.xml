pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.33498.001</object-id><p>It has long been thought that the mammalian visual system is organized into parallel pathways, with incoming visual signals being parsed in the retina based on feature (e.g. color, contrast and motion) and then transmitted to the brain in unmixed, feature-specific channels. To faithfully convey feature-specific information from retina to cortex, thalamic relay cells must receive inputs from only a small number of functionally similar retinal ganglion cells. However, recent studies challenged this by revealing substantial levels of retinal convergence onto relay cells. Here, we sought to identify mechanisms responsible for the assembly of such convergence. Using an unbiased transcriptomics approach and targeted mutant mice, we discovered a critical role for the synaptic adhesion molecule Leucine Rich Repeat Transmembrane Neuronal 1 (LRRTM1) in the emergence of retinothalamic convergence. Importantly, LRRTM1 mutant mice display impairment in visual behaviors, suggesting a functional role of retinothalamic convergence in vision.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>retinogeniculate</kwd><kwd>thalamus</kwd><kwd>synaptogenesis</kwd><kwd>retinal ganglion cell</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000053</institution-id><institution>National Eye Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>EY021222</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Fox</surname><given-names>Michael A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000874</institution-id><institution>Brain and Behavior Research Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Fox</surname><given-names>Michael A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000053</institution-id><institution>National Eye Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>EY024712</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Fox</surname><given-names>Michael A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Virginia Tech Carilion Research Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Medical Research Scholars Program</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Monavarfeshani</surname><given-names>Aboozar</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The synaptic cell adhesion molecule, leucine-rich repeat transmembrane neuronal 1 (LRRTM1), plays an important role in the establishment of retinal convergence onto relay cells in mouse visual thalamus.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Over thirty classes of functionally and morphologically distinct retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) exist in mammals, each responsible for conveying different features of the visual world and each with unique projections to retinorecipient nuclei within the brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Sanes and Masland, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Martersteck et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Baden et al., 2016</xref>).

Retinal terminals in dLGN are prototypic âdriverâ inputs which are large (compared to adjacent non-retinal inputs) and capable of generating strong excitatory postsynaptic responses in thalamic relay cells. Until recently, it was thought that the level of convergence of retinal inputs onto these relay cells was exceptionally low with only a few (1-5) RGCs innervating each relay cell (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Chen and Regehr, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Jaubert-Miazza et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Sincich et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hamos et al., 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Cleland and Lee, 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Cleland et al., 1971</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Mastronarde, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Usrey et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Yeh et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Weyand, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Rathbun et al., 2016</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">2010</xref>). This low level of retinal convergence allows relay cells to faithfully transfer information from RGCs to visual cortex in an unaltered form, also adding support to the notion that information regarding different features of the visual field flow through the thalamus in parallel channels.</p><p>Recently, however, a series of anatomical studies in mice have challenged the concept of feature-specific, parallel visual channels by revealing a level of retinal convergence onto relay cells that is more than an order of magnitude higher than previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hammer et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Morgan et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Rompani et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Howarth et al., 2014</xref>). Not only isÂ there a high level of retinogeniculate (RG) convergence in mice, butÂ some relay cells receive input from functionally distinct classes of RGCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Rompani et al., 2017</xref>) raising new questions about the role of thalamus in processing visual information before it reaches visual cortex.</p><p>Part of this newly appreciated retinal convergence stems from a set of unique RG synapses (termed complex RG synapses) that contain numerous retinal axons whose terminals aggregate on shared regions of relay cell dendrites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Morgan et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hammer et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Lund and Cunningham, 1972</xref>). Complex RG synapses have been reported in both rodents and higher mammals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Lund and Cunningham, 1972</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Jones and Powell, 1969</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">So et al., 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Campbell and Frost, 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Guillery and Scott, 1971</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Wilson et al., 1984</xref>). Similar to the more classical simple RG synapses (which contain a single retinal terminal on a given portion of a relay cell dendrite), these complex RG synapses are absent from other retinorecipient regions of brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Hammer et al., 2014</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1</xref>). Since branches of dLGN-projecting RGCs also innervate other retinorecipient nuclei (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Dhande et al., 2015</xref>), we interpret this to suggest that target-derived signals must be generated in dLGN to pattern the unique transformation of retinal axons into simple and complex RG synapses.</p><p>In the present study, we sought to identify such target-derived signals. Using next generation sequencing, we discovered that relay cells in dLGN (but not principal neurons in other retinorecipient nuclei) express Leucine Rich Repeat Transmembrane Neuronal 1 (LRRTM1), a known inducer of excitatory synaptogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Linhoff et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">de Wit et al., 2009</xref>). Genetic deletion of LRRTM1 led to a loss of complex RG synapses and thus reduced retinal convergence in visual thalamus. While mutants lacking LRRTM1 and complex RG synapse exhibit normal visual acuity and contrast sensitivity, they display impaired performance in a set of more complex visual tasks that require processing multiple distinct elements of the visual field. Taken together, these results not only identify a novel mechanism underlying the establishment of retinal convergence in visual thalamus, but alsoÂ importantly provide the first insight into the functional significance of complex RG synapses (and, possibly, retinal convergence) in vision.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Unique transformation of retinal terminals in dLGN coincides with eye-opening</title><p>To examine the emergence of the unique morphology of retinal terminals in developing mouse dLGN, two approaches were applied: retinal terminals were either immunolabeled with antibodies against vesicular glutamate transporter 2 (VGluT2, a synaptic vesicular component only present in retinal terminals in visual thalamus) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Hammer et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Land et al., 2004</xref>), or were anterogradely labeled by intraocular injection of fluorescent-conjugated Cholera Toxin B (CTB) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Muscat et al., 2003</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1BâH</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1</xref>). Shortly after their initial formation (P3-P8), VGluT2- or CTB-labeled terminals appeared similar in size and morphology in dLGN and the adjacent retinorecipient ventral lateral geniculate nucleus (vLGN). However, by eye-opening (P12-P14), terminals in dLGN underwent significant enlargement compared to those in vLGN and other (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Hammer et al., 2014</xref>) retinorecipient nuclei (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1BâH</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1</xref>). The unique developmental transformation of retinal terminals in dLGN at eye-opening (rather than at their initial formation), suggested that this was not the result of purely cell intrinsic mechanisms in dLGN-projecting classes of RGCs.</p><p>To test this hypothesis, we assessed retinal terminals generated by a single class of ON-OFF direction-selective RGCs whose axons branch to innervate both dLGN and superior colliculus (SC) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Dhande et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Kim et al., 2010</xref>). This class of RGC is specifically labeled in <italic>Mnx1-GFP</italic> mice (alsoÂ calledÂ <italic>Hb9-GFP</italic>)(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Trenholm et al., 2011</xref>). Despite originating from branches of individual retinal axons, those terminals present in dLGN were dramatically larger than those in SC (0.83Â Â±Â 0.1 Âµm<sup>2</sup> in dLGN vs 0.36Â Â±Â 0.01 Âµm in SC, p&lt;0.01 by t-test, nÂ =Â 3, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1I,J</xref>). These data suggest that target-derived cues are generated in dLGN around the time of eye-opening to pattern the transformation of retinal terminals.</p><p>The approaches described above do not provide the resolution required to differentiate simple and complex RG synapses, therefore, we used serial block-face scanning electron microscopy (SBFSEM) to identify whether both simple and complex RG synapses emerged at eye-opening. While SBFSEM ultrastructural analysis revealed the presence of both simple and complex RG synapses shortly after eye-opening (P14) we were only able to identify simple-like RG synapses prior to eye-opening (at P8) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1K</xref>). Moreover, we delivered brainbow AAVs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1L</xref>) intraocularly in newborn <italic>Calb2-Cre</italic> mice (in which a large proportion of RGCs express Cre recombinase) to generate multi-colored RGCs and assess the development of complex RG synapses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hammer et al., 2015</xref>). Similar to SBFSEM analysis, brainbow AAV-labeling failed to detect clusters of retinal terminals at P8 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1M</xref>), but clearly revealed clusters of retinal terminals originating from distinct RGCs as early as P10 and P14 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1N,O</xref>). Thus, around eye-opening, dLGN-specific molecular mechanisms must emerge to induce the unique transformation of both simple and complex RG synapses.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Identification of target-derived synaptic organizing molecules in dLGN</title><p>To identify target-derived synaptic organizers present at eye-opening in dLGN (but not other retinorecipient regions), we performed next-generation transcriptome analysis of developing mouse visual thalamus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig2sdata1">Figure 2âsource data 1</xref>). We assessed four different developmental time points, two before eye-opening (P3 and P8), and two at (P12) or after (P25) eye-opening (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). Comparing gene expression profiles in both dLGN and vLGN revealed hundreds of differentially and developmentally expressed mRNAs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). We focused our attention on a small subset of genes that were significantly enriched in dLGN (compared to vLGN) and whose highest expression coincided with eye-opening and the emergence of simple and complex RG synapses. Two genes with well-established roles in inducing excitatory synapses fit those criteria: <italic>Lrrtm1</italic> and <italic>neuritin 1</italic> (<italic>Nrn1</italic>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2CâE</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Linhoff et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Javaherian and Cline, 2005</xref>). We confirmed the enrichment of these genes at eye-opening in dLGN (but not vLGN) by qPCR, in situ hybridization and western blot (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2FâI</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">3AâD</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3âfigure supplement 1AâC</xref>).

We combined in situ hybridization analysis using riboprobes against these two genes with molecular and genetic approaches to label different cell types in dLGN. First, we demonstrated that both <italic>Lrrtm1</italic> and <italic>Nrn1</italic> mRNAs are generated by neurons and not glia since they were co-expressed by <italic>Syt1</italic>-expressing neurons (93% of <italic>Syt1<sup>+</sup></italic> neurons co-expressed <italic>Lrrtm1</italic>; 98% of <italic>Syt1<sup>+</sup></italic> neurons co-expressed <italic>Nrn1</italic>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A,B</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3âfigure supplement 1G,H</xref>) but not by IBA1-expressing microglia or GFP-labeled astrocytes in <italic>Aldh1l1-GFP</italic> mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4CâF</xref>).

Although we used vertical gratings as the positive cue in all subsequent experiments, we tested whether controls or mutants could also learn these tasks if horizontal gratings were the positive cue. We found no difference in mutants or controls learning to associate the hidden platform under a screen with horizontal gratings (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7âfigure supplement 1B</xref>). Moreover, in order to demonstrate that control or mutant mice were not capable of detecting the hidden platform itself (instead of associating it to the visual cue), we trained control and mutant mice (for 8 days) to associate the positive visual cue (S+) (with near 100% accuracy) with the platform. We then moved the platform below the negative visual cue (S-) and tested each mouse for 10 trials in day 9. Mutants and controls swam toward the positive visual cue that lacked the rescue platform, confirming they could not visually detect the hidden platform (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7âfigure supplement 1C</xref>).</p><p>By changing the frequency of the vertical bars, we next tested visual acuity in <italic>Lrrtm1<sup>â/â</sup></italic> mutants.

Similarly, <italic>Lrrtm1<sup>â/â</sup></italic> mutants failed to show significant differences compared to wild type mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7E</xref>). Taken together these results suggest <italic>Lrrtm1<sup>â/â</sup></italic> mutants do not exhibit deficits in visual acuity, simple pattern recognition or contrast sensitivity.</p><p>Next, we exposed mice to more complex visual tasks in which multiple features of the visual scene were altered at once.

After 8 days of training with a new cohort of mutant and control mice, pattern discrimination was again tested while also increasing the spatial frequency or decreasing the contrast of both vertical and horizontal gratings. After each day of testing, we checked the ability of mice to perform the initial, standard discrimination task (i.e. to discriminating vertical and horizontal grating with 0.17 cpd and 100% contrast). Throughout the experiments, <italic>Lrrtm1<sup>â/â</sup></italic> mice failed to show any signs of memory deficits in this task.

Is retinal convergence in visual thalamus important for vision? What are the developmental mechanisms that underlie the establishment of retinal convergence in dLGN?</italic> We are only beginning to scratch the surface in answering these questions. For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Litvina and Chen (2017)</xref> only recently applied an optogenetic approach to demonstrate a higher level of functional retinal convergence onto dLGN relay cells. Here, we sought to address the last question mentioned above, what mechanisms underlie the establishment of retinal convergence in visual thalamus. Using an unbiased screen, we identified LRRTM1 as a target-derived cue necessary for the formation of retinal convergence onto dLGN relay cells. Analysis in LRRTM1-deficient mice revealed that the lack of this synaptic adhesion molecule led to impaired visual function. We interpret these results to suggest that complex RG synapses are necessary for visual processing. It is important to point out that we also observed an increase in the retinal never terminal size (and active zone number) in the absence of LRRTM1 and this may also contribute to deficits in visual behaviors.</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>LRRTM1 as a target-derived synaptic organizer in visual thalamus</title><p>LRRTMs are transmembrane proteins that act as transsynaptic signals to trigger excitatory synaptogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Linhoff et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">de Wit et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">de Wit and Ghosh, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Um et al., 2016</xref>). When present in the postsynaptic membrane, LRRTM1 binds to the extracellular domain of neurexins to induce presynaptic differentiation in contacting axons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Linhoff et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Siddiqui et al., 2010</xref>). In visual thalamus, LRRTM1 is specifically expressed by relay cells (and not other cells) and its transsynaptic partners, neurexins, are generated by RGCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2âfigure supplement 1</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Sajgo et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Shigeoka et al., 2016</xref>). Therefore, based on our results, we hypothesized that LRRTM1-neurexin interactions are critical for the formation of complex RG synapses. Although the necessity of neurexins in retinogeniculate connectivity has yet to be thoroughly examined, the loss of CASK, a MAGUK protein necessary for trafficking neurexins to the presynaptic membrane, leads to abnormal retinogeniculate connectivity and optic nerve hypoplasia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">LaConte et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Srivastava et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Moog et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Liang et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>It is important to point out that neurexins have other postsynaptic partners expressed in visual thalamus, including neuroligins and other LRRTMs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2âfigure supplement 1BâG</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">LaurÃ©n et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Varoqueaux et al., 2006</xref>), each capable of inducing excitatory synaptogenesis elsewhere in the brain or <italic>in vitro</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Fox and Umemori, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Craig et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Ko et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Siddiqui et al., 2010</xref>). The presence of LRRTM1, other LRRTMs, and neuroligins in dLGN raises an interesting possibility that simple and complex RG synapses may be assembled through different postsynaptic interactions with neurexins. As such, astrocytes may also contribute to the signals that regulate simple or complex RG synapses. Retinal terminals in simple RG synapse are ensheathed by astrocytic processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Hammer et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bickford et al., 2010</xref>), and these astrocytes are known to produce extracellular factors capable of bridging neurexinâneuroligin interactions to facilitate excitatory synaptogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Kucukdereli et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Singh et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>The presence of multiple postsynaptic neurexins partners in dLGN also raises the possibility that their abundance (or overabundance) may prevent some level of activity-dependent refinement in dLGN. Overexpression of different combinations of neurexin-binding partners in postsynaptic neurons has been shown to impair synapse elimination in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Ko et al., 2011</xref>). The emergence of complex RG synapses at eye-opening may therefore represent synapses with an overabundance of neurexin-binding receptors, in which strong trans-synaptic adhesion prevent complete activity-dependent RG refinement. While certainly possible, we see this as unlikely given the dramatic refinement of retinal arbors around eye-opening in mice, and since this RG refinement itself gives rise to retinal bouton clustering (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Dhande et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Hong et al., 2014</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Retinal convergence: artifact or by design?</title><p>The discovery of an extraordinary level of retinal convergence on mouse relay cells has left the field pondering whether such convergence is an artifact of impaired refinement (as described above) or whether there is functional significance to such âfuzzyâ connectivity (as one group has termed this retinogeniculate convergence) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Morgan et al., 2016</xref>). It is easy to discount the importance of retinal convergence onto relay cells and the role that complex RG synapses may play in vision, since many groups (including our own [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Hammer et al., 2014</xref>]) have demonstrated that relay cells receive a very small number of strong, functional inputs from the retina (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Chen and Regehr, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Jaubert-Miazza et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Hooks and Chen, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Litvina and Chen, 2017</xref>). Many of the techniques used to identify high levels of retinogeniculate convergence in mice have been anatomical in nature (e.g. ultrastructural analysis, anterograde multicolor labeling of RGCs and retrograde trans-synaptic tracing) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hammer et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Morgan et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Rompani et al., 2017</xref>), leading to the possibility that âformâ does not fit âfunctionâ in mouse visual thalamus. Recent optogenetic analysis of the RG circuit in mice has revealed a substantially higher level of functional retinal convergence on relay cells, however the strength of these inputs widely varies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Litvina and Chen, 2017</xref>). Functional roles for weak RG synapses remain unclear.</p><p>In the present study, we took advantage of the loss of complex RG synapses in <italic>Lrrtm1<sup>â/â</sup></italic> mice to begin to shed light on the functional significance of retinal convergence on thalamic relay cells. While the ability of <italic>Lrrtm1<sup>â/â</sup></italic> mice to perform tasks with simple visual cues appeared unaltered compared with controls, they performed poorly on tasks where more than one feature of the visual scenes was altered at once. Although these mice lack LRRTM1 globally, such deficits are likely the direct result of impaired RG circuitry for several reasons. First, LRRTM1 is largely absent from retina and visual cortex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3EâF</xref>), sites whose function are required for the performance of these visual tasks. Second, global deletion of LRRTM1 failed to result in synaptic or cytoarchitectural changes in other brain regions that process visual information (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s2">Figure 7âfigure supplement 2AâF</xref>). For these reasons, we believe that results presented here provide the first clues that complex RG synapses (and retinal convergence) are not functionally insignificant artifacts of impaired or incomplete activity-dependent refinement, but rather are an important component of processing and relaying visual information from the retina to visual cortex.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4"

Detailed instructions for the apparatus were described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Prusky et al., 2000</xref>). A rescue platform (37 cmÂ Ã13 cm Ã 14 cm) was hidden under water below the monitor with the positive visual cue (termed the S+Â side). Visual cues (i.e. different grating pattern) were generated in the Gabor-patch generator (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.cogsci.nl/gabor-generator">https://www.cogsci.nl/gabor-generator</ext-link>). The visual cue and hidden platform were moved to the right or left screens in a pseudorandom manner with the following orders: LRLLRLRRLR, RLRRLRLLRL, RRLRLLRLRL and LLRLRRLRLR. During the behavioral tasks the room was dark, but a 60 W bulb was positioned above the holding cages. During the visual tasks, mice were held in separate cages which were placed on heating pads and lined with paper towels. A day before starting experiments, mice were acclimated to the experimenter and the pool through handling, a 1â2 min period of direct contact with the hidden platform at either arms, and submersion into the water at gradually-increasing distances from the hidden platform. The ability of mice to detect and associate the S+Â monitor displaying vertical gratings with the rescue platform (in contrast to the lack of a platform beneath the S- screen that displayed either a gray or horizontal gratings) was assessed. Behavioral tasks included a training phase (8 days) and a testing phase (10â12 days). For training phases, mice were placed at the release chute and given one minute to find the platform for 8â10 trials per day. A trial was recorded as a correct choice if a mouse passed the choice line on the S+Â side, while passing the choice line on the S- side was recorded as an incorrect choice. After arriving at the rescue platform, mice were placed back into their individual cages only if they made the correct choice. When a mouse made an incorrect choice, it was placed back at the release chute to perform another trial immediately before going back to its home cage. After 8 days of training, mice learned to find the positive visual cue (i.e. vertical gratings for most tasks, however horizontal gratings in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7âfigure supplement 1B</xref>) with aÂ &gt;80% accuracy. To test visual acuity and contrast sensitivity, we increased the spatial frequency and decreased the contrast of vertical gratings (i.e. the S+Â cue), respectively. In the testing phase of the detection tasks, 10 trials of a given task (e.g. detection of vertical gratings with spatial frequency of 0.32 cpd versus a gray screen) were performed in 10 consecutive days (one per day). For the testing phase of the discrimination tasks two different approaches were used with different cohort of <italic>Lrrtm1<sup>â/â</sup></italic>, <italic>Nrn1<sup>â/â</sup></italic> and control mice. First, a similar approach as the one mentioned above for the detection task (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7âfigure supplement 1J</xref>). Second, 10 trials of a task (e.g. discrimination of vertical gratings with spatial frequency of 0.32 cpd versus horizontal gratings with spatial frequency of 0.32 cpd) were tested in a single day (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7F,G</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7âfigure supplement 1I,J</xref>).

Two-way ANOVA analysis was used to determine any significant change in the distribution of retinal terminal sizes between groups. Intensity and density of the signals in immunostained images of dLGN, vLGN and vCTX were measured in ImageJ. 3â7 animals (three sections per animals) were analyzed per genotype and age and the mean values were compared between groups. T-test or ANOVA were used to determine any significant difference of the mean values between groups.</p><p>For SBFSEM, retinal terminals were identified by their unique ultrastructural features including the presence of round synaptic vesicles and pale mitochondria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Hammer et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bickford et al., 2010</xref>). Retinal terminals clustering onto the same portion of a dendritic branch were classified as complex RG synapses if the membranes of terminals touched each other and were not isolated from each other by glial processes. On the other hand, a retinal terminal isolated from other retinal terminals was classified as a simple RG synapse. In each mouse, retinal terminals were identified regardless of their simple or complex designation and were then assigned to one of these two classes. The proportion of retinal terminals participating in each class was averaged from data sets obtained from the dLGN of three mice per genotype (2â3 data sets were obtained per mouse). T-test or ANOVA analysis were used to determine any significant difference of the mean values between groups.</p><p>The performance of a mouse in the training sessions was reported as the percentage of correct choices the mouse made out of 8 or 10 trials per day (e.g. day 1), and then an average of daily performances was calculated for each group of mice. The performance of a mouse in the test phase of both detection and discrimination tasks were reported as the percentage of correct choices the mouse made out of 10 trials per given task (e.g. for 10% contrast) and these values were used to calculate the mean for a group of mice (e.g. control group). T-test or ANOVA analysis were used to determine any significant difference of the mean values between groups.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>This work was supported in part by the National Institutes of Health â National Eye Institute grants EY021222 and EY024712 (MAF), an Independent Investigator grant from the Brain and Behavior Foundation (MAF), and a fellowship from the VTCRI Medical Research Scholars Program (AM).

Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor, Jeremy Nathans, and a Senior Editor, Gary Westbrook. As you will see, all of the reviewers were impressed with the importance and novelty of your work.</p><p>I am including the three reviews at the end of this letter, as there are a variety of specific and useful suggestions in them. We appreciate that the reviewers' comments cover a range of suggestions for improving the manuscript. Please use your best judgment in deciding which of these can be accommodated in a reasonable period of time. In particular, the first suggestion from reviewer #1 (&quot;It would be interesting to perform eye suturing experimentsâ¦&quot;) is an excellent idea but, is in our collective opinion beyond the scope of the present work. Most of the other reviewer comments represent relatively minor points that we believe can be accommodated.</p><p>Reviewer #1:</p><p>In this study, Monavarfeshani et al. have uncovered a molecular mechanism by which retinothalamic convergence occurs during development. It has recently been shown that a high degree of retinal convergence onto thalamic relay cells occurs in the dLGN of both rodents and higher mammals. Here, the authors describe a role for Leucine Rich Repeat Transmembrane Neuronal 1 (LRRTM1) expressed by dLGN relay cells in mediating this process. The expression is quite selective for dLGN relay cells, and this is a major strength of this study. The authors used multiple methods, including serial block-face scanning EM, to support their conclusions and also showed complex visual behavior deficits in lrrtm1 mutant mice. The authors demonstrate a role for lrrtm1 in retinothalamic convergence, thus providing an interesting addition to our understanding of the molecular underpinnings of this developmental phenomenon. Pending response to the issues raised below, this study appears suitable for publication in this journal.</p><p>1) What is the role of visual input on the development of retinothalamic convergence? It would be interesting to perform eye suturing experiments to determine if this phenomena still occurs at P14 even without visual input, strengthening the claim that lrrtm1 is required for convergence, especially since some clustering still occurs in lrrtm1 knockouts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). This would not entail Serial Blockface EM, but one of the simpler approaches presented in this study and would really strengthen this present communication.</p><p>2) Do the authors have any later timepoints for the vGLUT2 staining and CTB experiments to demonstrate that the clustering is not simply delayed in the lrrtm1 mutants? (Related to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5âfigure supplement 1</xref>)</p><p>3) At what timepoint are the brainbow AAVs being delivered for the tissue harvested at P8 and P10? I would expect that these need to be in utero injections, but it isn't clear in the Materials and methods section.</p><p>4) What developmental age are the retina ISH data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref>?</p><p>5) Is there any explanation for the difference in GAD67 staining between <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4G and H</xref>? Is the red arrow in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4H</xref> pointing to a GAD67 positive cell? Please make this clear in the figure legend.</p><p>6) Can the authors provide quantification for the percent colocalization of lrrtm1 and nrn1 in relay cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figures 4I and J</xref>)?</p><p>7) In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6âfigure supplement 1A and B</xref>, it is not clear what conclusion one is supposed to draw about the connection between SBFSEM and CTB/vGLuT2 labeling. It is hard to make out a clear difference between controls and lrrtm1 mutants, as there is no quantification. Also, the word &quot;Age&quot; is written in the bottom left figure of Panel A, but it is not clear that this is supposed to appear there.</p><p>8) In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5âfigure supplement 1</xref>, what age is the retinal tissue that was used for staining?</p><p>9) Subsection âIdentification of target-derived synaptic organizing molecules in dLGNâ: molecules should be molecule.</p><p>10) Subsection âImpaired visual behaviors in mice lacking LRRTM1: performing task performance sounds awkward.</p><p>11) Subsection âImpaired visual behaviors in mice lacking LRRTM1â: behaviors task should be behavioral tasks.</p><p>12) Discussion section, clusters should be cluster.</p><p>13) Discussion section, cell should be cells.</p><p>14) Discussion section, ontogenetic should be optogenetic.</p><p>15) Subsection âLRRTM1 as a target-derived synaptic organizer in visual thalamusâ: synapse should be synapses.</p><p>16) Subsection âRetinal convergence: artifact or by design?â: rely should be relay.</p><p>17) The first portion of the Discussion section is redundant with Introduction section of this paper - this can be edited extensively.</p><p>Reviewer #2:</p><p>In their submission entitled &quot;LRRTM1 underlies synaptic convergence in visual thalamus&quot;, Monavarfeshani and colleagues first demonstrate that the formation of complex RG synapses in the dLGN begins between days P8 and P14 using a thorough battery of independent techniques. To investigate what signaling may underlie development of these synapses, they performed RNAseq experiments comparing the dLGN to the vLGN (where complex synapses do not form) over the course of development and identify lrrtm1 and nrn1 as differentially expressed candidate genes that have previously been implicated in excitatory synapse formation. Using multiple methods, they demonstrate that lrrtm1 mRNA and protein levels are increased at the appropriate developmental timepoints specifically in the dLGN and that this expression is specific to CRH positive relay neurons. To demonstrate a role of lrrtm1 in complex synapse formation, they use a knockout mouse to demonstrate that the formation of complex synapses is decreased when lrrtm1 is lost. Finally, to examine what visual functions may be mediated by complex synapses in the dLGN, visual function in lrrtm1 knockout mice is investigated using a forced swim task where mice discriminate between a visual stimulus of vertical bars and a gray screen, or horizontal bars. Knockout mice perform similarly to controls in regards to frequency and contrast detection thresholds when compared to a gray screen, but are significantly different from controls when tested against horizontal bars.</p><p>Overall this work is well done and is of appropriate interest to the community. Especially the use of multiple techniques to examine the formation and disruption of complex synapses in the dLGN. The recent understanding that there is significant retinal convergence in the LGN opens many questions as to the purpose of such circuit architecture. These experiments begin to elucidate the mechanisms of their formation in addition to what role they might play in visual processing.</p><p>I do believe that the behavioral aspects of this submission still require further clarification and experiments. To start, from my reading of the Materials and methods section, it is not very clear to me how the testing schedule in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D and E</xref> differ from <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7F</xref> and G. It appears as though mice in all experiments are trained using stimuli as in B and/or C for 8 days. Then in panels D and E they are tested on 1 of the 8 different conditions, once per day for 10 to 12 days. In panels F and G they are tested on the same stimulus 10-12 times for the indicated days. I think it would be best to further clarify the exact nature of these experiments since the effects on the &quot;complex&quot; visual task mediated by complex synapse loss is a crux of this papers findings. In addition, I am curious why the discrimination task (F and G) is tested on a divergent schedule from the detection task (D and E). This discrepancy makes it difficult to directly compare the two systems. While I appreciate the schedule in F and G to rule out known learning deficits in the lrrtm1 knockout, it would make a stronger case if the behaviors were tested similarly. Finally, the other difference between the detection and discrimination tasks is the availability of horizontal bars. It is plausible that the lrrtm1 knockout doesn't lead to an inability to discriminate, but instead effects detection of vertical bars differentially relative to horizontal bars. Thus, if experiments in panels 7D and E could be repeated putting horizontal bars against a gray background, or conversely testing panels F and G against a gray background, this would indicate a more clear role for discrimination itself as the trait lacking in lrrtm1 knockout mice. Conversely, if a difference is still seen moving panels F and G to a detection task, this might indicate the difference is due to the schedule of behavioral testing.</p><p>On the Cumulative Function graphs the y axis appears to pass beyond 100%. This makes it difficult to determine at what point on the x-axis the maximum has been reached. Perhaps rescale the y-axis appropriately or add a landmark on the graph to indicate 100%.</p><p>Would it be possible/helpful to expand the brainbow images into a Supplemental figure? It is quite hard to discern the discrete axons presented in some of the figures.</p><p>Viral titers used for the brainbow experiments should be indicated in the Materials and methods section.</p><p>Reviewer #3:</p><p>This is an interesting study that demonstrates a role for LRRTM1 in the maturation of retinal synapses in the dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus (dLGN). The interest arises from two sets of recent studies. One showed that retinal terminals differ in a target dependent manner, even when they likely arise from the same retinal cell types. Thus, LRRTM1 could be a factor that regulates branch-specific synaptogenesis. The second (reported in papers from Fox's group and two others) showed a greater degree of retinal convergence on dLGN neurons than had been supposed. LRRTM1 seems to selectively effect the complex synapses that mediate this convergence. Thus, although mechanistic analysis is lacking here, the result is quite important.</p><p>The results are for the most part fairly straightforward, and they are uniformly convincing and well documented. One confound is that the behavioral phenotype may not result exclusively from the LGN defect, but the authors have done all the controls they can, and are quite candid about the limitation. The only better approach would be a conditional mutant, but this would not straightforward because it would require an LGN-specific Cre line (the LRRTM seems to act postsynaptically) which may not be available.</p><p>The obviously valuable addition would be physiological tests of decreased convergence in the mutant. My own view is that there are few labs capable of this sort of recording and it is likely beyond the capabilities of the Fox lab, so there is no point in asking for it. I think the paper stands on its own, and likely others will take up the physiological challenge. I look forward to reading the other reviewers' opinion on this point.</p><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>. Puncta size is nicely quantified from VGlut2 staining (panels C-H) but the authors also go on to document interareal differences using transgenic (I), EM (J) and viral (K-M) methods. It would be nice to see rudimentary quantification of at least one of these â perhaps Hb9-GFP would be most straightforward â to test whether the effects detected by the various methods are of similar magnitude.</p><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1H</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1G</xref> look remarkable similar. Please check to be sure there was not an inadvertent duplication.</p><p>Subsection âLRRTM1 is required for the development of complex RG synapsesâ. Having found that 10 and 63% of terminals are big in the two genotypes it is unnecessary to report that 90 and 37% are not big.</p><p>Subsection âLRRTM1 is required for the development of complex RG synapsesâ. Lrrtm1 loss includes both a decrease in the number of complex synapses as well as a decrease in the complexity of the remaining complex synapses. Is it possible to provide a single metric that includes both effects? (This percentage decrease could be included in the text; an additional figure is not necessary.)</p><p>Subsection âLRRTM1 is required for the development of complex RG synapsesâ. Although the focus is on synapse complexity, there is also an effect on synapse size (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>). This is potentially important. Is there more to say about it? And shouldn't it be noted as a possible confound in the interpretation of the behavioral results?</p><p>Subsection âImpaired visual behaviors in mice lacking LRRTM1â. The description of the complex task in which the major effect was observed is somewhat cursory. More is needed.

To start, from my reading of the Materials and methods section, it is not very clear to me how the testing schedule in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7 D and E</xref> differ from <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7F</xref> and G. It appears as though mice in all experiments are trained using stimuli as in B and/or C for 8 days. Then in panels D and E they are tested on 1 of the 8 different conditions, once per day for 10 to 12 days. In panels F and G they are tested on the same stimulus 10-12 times for the indicated days. I think it would be best to further clarify the exact nature of these experiments since the effects on the &quot;complex&quot; visual task mediated by complex synapse loss is a crux of this papers findings.</p></disp-quote><p>Yes, this is correct. We have amended the Materials and methods section and Results section to better describe this approach and the results.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In addition, I am curious why the discrimination task (F and G) is tested on a divergent schedule from the detection task (D and E). This discrepancy makes it difficult to directly compare the two systems. While I appreciate the schedule in F and G to rule out known learning deficits in the lrrtm1 knockout, it would make a stronger case if the behaviors were tested similarly.</p></disp-quote><p>In fact, we started by using a similar schedule for the discrimination tasks but when we observed difficulty of performing these tasks (particularly in the mutants) we worried about whether learning deficits were confounding our results. We understand the confusion in using different paradigms. We have now included new data where we tested the discrimination task without also assessing task memory. We have added this data into <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7âfigure supplement 1</xref>. We have added it to the supplement and not the main figure, because of the lower number of mutants and controls (n=6 per genotype) we had available at the time we received these reviews. While this analysis was performed on a limited number of animals, it did show a significant decrease in mutant performance in these tasks, supporting that data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Finally, the other difference between the detection and discrimination tasks is the availability of horizontal bars. It is plausible that the lrrtm1 knockout doesn't lead to an inability to discriminate, but instead effects detection of vertical bars differentially relative to horizontal bars. Thus, if experiments in panels 7D and E could be repeated putting horizontal bars against a gray background, or conversely testing panels F and G against a gray background, this would indicate a more clear role for discrimination itself as the trait lacking in lrrtm1 knockout mice. Conversely, if a difference is still seen moving panels F and G to a detection task, this might indicate the difference is due to the schedule of behavioral testing.</p></disp-quote><p>We initially tried to address this concern (that the orientation of the gratings could impact performance) by showing that mutants, and controls for that matter, could learn to differentiate vertical bars from either gray screens or horizontal gratings with similar ability (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B,C</xref>). We now realize that what was missing from those analyses was the absence of vertical gratings, which could have biased our interpretation of those learning curves. To address this, we have now repeated those learning trials with a different cohort of mice (n=6 controls and 7 mutants), testing their ability to differentiate horizontal gratings (which were the positive cue) from a gray screen. Mutants and controls learned this task similar to how they learned to differentiate vertical gratings from gray screens or horizontal gratings. This new data is included in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7âfigure supplement 1</xref> and is described in the text. Taken together, all of these results lead us to believe that LRRTM1 loss does not result in an altered ability to detect vertical versus horizontal bars.</p><p>The second part of this questions appears to suggest that we perform a contrast-sensitivity function for mutants and controls by challenging mice to a positive cue that changes both the spatial frequency and contrast of the gratings (while presenting a gray screen as a negative cue). We agree this is a good idea, but due to the number of animals required (especially to test both vertical and horizontal bars which would have to be done in 2 different cohorts of mice) and the time required, we believe these experiments are beyond the scope of the current manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>On the Cumulative Function graphs the y axis appears to pass beyond 100%. This makes it difficult to determine at what point on the x-axis the maximum has been reached. Perhaps rescale the y-axis appropriately or add a landmark on the graph to indicate 100%.</p></disp-quote><p>These graphs have been rescaled as suggested.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Would it be possible/helpful to expand the brainbow images into a Supplemental figure? It is quite hard to discern the discrete axons presented in some of the figures.</p></disp-quote><p>We feel that these are critical for the manuscript and should remain in the main figures.

Puncta size is nicely quantified from VGlut2 staining (panels C-H) but the authors also go on to document interareal differences using transgenic (I), EM (J) and viral (K-M) methods. It would be nice to see rudimentary quantification of at least one of these â perhaps Hb9-GFP would be most straightforward â to test whether the effects detected by the various methods are of similar magnitude.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree. We previously documented ultrastructural differences between retinal terminals in dLGN and vLGN using SBFSEM (Hammer et al., 2014). Here, we went back, as suggested, and analyzed terminal sizes in the dLGN and SC of HB9-GFP transgenic mice. A cumulative frequency distribution of GFP<sup>+</sup> puncta size in dLGN and SC has now been added to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>.

Lrrtm1 loss includes both a decrease in the number of complex synapses as well as a decrease in the complexity of the remaining complex synapses. Is it possible to provide a single metric that includes both effects? (This percentage decrease could be included in the text; an additional figure is not necessary.)</p></disp-quote><p>While we agree conceptually with this (to simplify the phenotypes) we have had trouble doing this without omitting important data. For example, one possibility is that we could report a single metric like we did for the brainbow analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6I</xref>). However, this would not accurately demonstrate the decrease in complex RG synapse number in the mutants.</p><p>(Perhaps, it is important to note that for our AAV-brainbow analysis in mutants and controls did use only a single metric (by only looking at complex retinal terminals and classifying them into RG synapse with less or more than 4 terminals). The rationale for this was that we do not feel that it is scientifically valid to quantify a decrease in the number of complex RG synapses with a method (i.e. viral delivery of genes encoding fluorescent proteins) that does not label all retinal axons.)</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Subsection âLRRTM1 is required for the development of complex RG synapsesâ.

And shouldn't it be noted as a possible confound in the interpretation of the behavioral results?</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that this is a really remarkable phenotype and could be very important. We have now added additional data on this point, showing that active zones are increased in both simple and complex RG boutons in LRRTM1-deficient mutants.
