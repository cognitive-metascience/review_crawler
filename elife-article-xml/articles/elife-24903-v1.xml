pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.24903.001</object-id><p>Molecular recognition reagents are key tools for understanding biological processes and are used universally by scientists to study protein expression, localisation and interactions. Antibodies remain the most widely used of such reagents and many show excellent performance, although some are poorly characterised or have stability or batch variability issues, supporting the use of alternative binding proteins as complementary reagents for many applications. Here we report on the use of Affimer proteins as research reagents. We selected 12 diverse molecular targets for Affimer selection to exemplify their use in common molecular and cellular applications including the (a) selection against various target molecules; (b) modulation of protein function in vitro and in vivo; (c) labelling of tumour antigens in mouse models; and (d) use in affinity fluorescence and super-resolution microscopy. This work shows that Affimer proteins, as is the case for other alternative binding scaffolds, represent complementary affinity reagents to antibodies for various molecular and cell biology applications.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.24903.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.24903.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.24903.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Many of the molecules that are essential for life are too small to be visible inside cells. So, scientists use large complex proteins called antibodies that bind to these molecules to detect whether they are present and show where they are in a cell. As well as being useful tools in experiments, these antibodies can be used to help identify and treat diseases.</p><p>The body produces antibodies in response to an infection. The antibodies used in experiments are purified from animal blood, but this method of producing antibodies has flaws. For example, it can be difficult to make identical batches of antibody that always behave in the same way. So scientists have developed “alternative binding proteins” that can be made in the laboratory. These proteins are much less complicated and can be developed more quickly than antibodies, and can easily be adapted for a variety of uses.</p><p>An alternative binding protein called an Affimer behaves in a similar way to an antibody by binding tightly to its target molecule, but is much more stable to acidity and high temperature. Tiede et al. have now tested how well the Affimer works in a wide range of different experiments that normally use antibodies to analyse the amount of a particular molecule inside a cell.</p><p>The results of the tests show that the Affimer behaves in the same way as antibodies, and sometimes works more effectively. Tiede et al. show that an Affimer can help to reveal how a particular molecule works within a cell, to create detailed pictures of molecules in cells and tissues, and to identify a tumour. It can also be used alongside a new technique called ‘super-resolution microscopy’ that allows researchers to watch the activity of individual molecules.</p><p>Future challenges are to test the Affimer in even more applications and to encourage its wider use by researchers, alongside other alternative binding proteins, as as replacements for some antibodies. This could ultimately lead to the development of faster and more efficient diagnostic, imaging and therapeutic tests.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.24903.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.24903.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>Affimer</kwd><kwd>antibody</kwd><kwd>assay</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd><italic>E. coli</italic></kwd><kwd>Human</kwd><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000265</institution-id><institution>Medical Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Curd</surname><given-names>Alistair</given-names></name><name><surname>Peckham</surname><given-names>Michelle</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100010269</institution-id><institution>Wellcome</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Hughes</surname><given-names>Ruth E</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000274</institution-id><institution>British Heart Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>NH/12/1/29832</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Manfield</surname><given-names>Iain</given-names></name><name><surname>Maqbool</surname><given-names>Azhar</given-names></name><name><surname>Drinkhill</surname><given-names>Mark</given-names></name><name><surname>Bon</surname><given-names>Robin S</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100002653</institution-id><institution>Yorkshire Cancer Research</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>L362</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Knowles</surname><given-names>Margaret</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The Affimer technology represents renewable binding reagents for molecular biology, which provides research scientists and industry with an alternative to the recently criticised use of animal-produced antibodies.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Our understanding of biological processes at the cellular level has been underpinned by the traditional disciplines of genetics, biochemistry, and molecular biology. Over the last decade, focus has shifted towards large-scale studies of genomes and transcriptomes, the latter as surrogates for cellular proteomes. These combined with high-throughput protein interaction studies, have led to the new discipline of Systems Biology, where proteins are considered in the context of networks of biochemical and developmental pathways. In the network view of protein behaviour, each protein or protein isoform may participate in many protein-protein interactions but available tools that allow researchers to test hypotheses in the biological context are lacking. Technologies such as RNAi and CRISPR-Cas9 that lower or ablate protein expression are important tools, but may cloud the interpretation of a proposed relationship between a given gene product or protein domain and the observed cellular phenotype. The next generation of tools should have the ability to block protein-protein interactions systematically without affecting expression levels.</p><p>Commonly used tools for studying protein expression and function include antibodies. Antibodies have proved to be exquisite tools in many applications but there are growing concerns about the difficulty in sourcing validated and renewable antibodies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bordeaux et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bradbury and Plückthun, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Taussig et al., 2007</xref>). While there are over 500,000 different antibodies on the market, it has been reported that up to 75% have either not been validated, show a low level of validation or simply do not perform adequately in certain applications (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Berglund et al., 2008</xref>). In addition, the use of antibodies to block protein function inside living cells is commonly performed, but it is limited owing to the reducing environment of the cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Marschall et al., 2015</xref>). Even though antibody fragments, termed intrabodies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Marschall et al., 2015</xref>) or chromobodies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Rothbauer et al., 2006</xref>) can be expressed in the cytoplasm of mammalian cells, only a fraction of the repertoire of IgGs are correctly folded in the reducing environment of the cytoplasm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Biocca et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Wörn and Plückthun, 2001</xref>), decreasing their efficacy in functional applications (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Marschall et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>Various consortia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Stoevesandt and Taussig, 2012</xref>) have been established to address the generation and validation of antibodies and their derivatives (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Berglund et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Renewable Protein Binder Working Group et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Nilsson et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Uhlén et al., 2005</xref>). These consortia have generated polyclonal and monoclonal antibodies against proteins and protein domains. Whilst proving successful, in providing a large catalogue of validated antibodies, such efforts have required large multidisciplinary groups across Europe and the US (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Uhlén et al., 2015</xref>). However, the ability to rapidly and cost-effectively generate renewable binding reagents for applications such as studying protein function both in vitro and in vivo and for proteomic projects would represent a major advance. Renewable binding reagents in this context refers to reagents that are recombinantly produced from a known sequence.</p><p>The development of alternative binding proteins has provided the opportunity for such advances (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Škrlec et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Vazquez-Lombardi et al., 2015</xref>). These include reagents such as DARPins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Binz et al., 2003</xref>), Monobodies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Koide et al., 1998</xref>), and Affibodies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Nord et al., 1995</xref>) and a number of others (for a recent review see [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Škrlec et al., 2015</xref>]). Over the past two decades these reagents have proved to be useful tools in many antibody-like applications including detection of proteins for diagnostics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Theurillat et al., 2010</xref>), for studying protein function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Kummer et al., 2012</xref>), intracellular targeting of protein function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Spencer-Smith et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Wojcik et al., 2010</xref>) and as crystallisation chaperones (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Sennhauser and Grütter, 2008</xref>). In 2010, the University of Leeds and Leeds NHS Teaching Hospital Trust established the BioScreening Technology Group (BSTG), to allow rapid identification of alternative binding proteins against biological targets, particularly those of clinical interest. We now report on some of the outcomes of the more than 350 successful screens performed by the BSTG to date, and suggest that access to this and similar facilities (eg High Throughput Binder Selection facility at the University of Zurich) should deliver the tools needed to complement antibodies in the dissection of biological functions of individual proteins and protein isoforms. Our work is underpinned by the development of a new, engineered protein scaffold for peptide display (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). The Adhiron scaffold is a synthetic protein originally based on a cystatin consensus sequence and displays remarkable thermal stability (Tm = 101°C) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Tiede et al., 2014</xref>). It is related in structure to a previously reported scaffold engineered from human stefin A (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Stadler et al., 2011</xref>). Binding proteins derived from these two scaffolds are now referred to collectively as Affimer proteins, and we use this term subsequently.<fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.24903.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Ribbon diagrams of three crystal structures for Affimer (Adhiron) reagents.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) X-ray crystal structure of Affimer scaffold (PDB ID no. 4N6T) at 1.75 A resolution.

Here we have screened our established Affimer phage library (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Tiede et al., 2014</xref>) against a broad range of targets, including homologous protein family members, to isolate highly specific and renewable binding reagents that can be used both in vitro and in vivo. For broad applicability, and to remove the bottleneck in target protein production, we also tested our ability to generate reagents against small quantities of target protein from commercial sources. We demonstrate the generation of Affimers against various target molecules, including a small organic molecule, and we report their use in a number of widely used biochemical and cell biology assays.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Dissecting intracellular signalling pathways</title><p>A challenge in cell biology is to develop highly specific tools to detect and modulate the function of one member of a family of structurally and functionally similar proteins. Biological reagents that specifically target a single protein, or a subset of a family of proteins would introduce greater selectivity to in vivo studies.</p><p>To demonstrate this functionality, we isolated Affimer binders to various Src-Homology 2 (SH2) domains. SH2 domains are short (~100 amino acid) protein domains that bind specifically to phosphotyrosine-containing motifs in partner proteins, but not to the de-phosphorylated isoforms. They have also recently been found to bind to signalling lipids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Park et al., 2016</xref>) and are involved in mediating multiple aspects of cellular signal transduction and communication. The human genome encodes some 120 SH2 domains found in 111 proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Liu et al., 2011</xref>). The ability to specifically detect and inactivate each SH2 domain is a rate limiting step in our understanding of these pathways; the use of siRNA, for example, may be used to remove an entire protein, such as the protein kinases Syk or Zap70, from a cell but will not allow determination of which of the two SH2 domains, carried by each of these kinases, mediate which signalling event(s). The ability to dissect these signalling events with highly specific binding reagents has already identified new biological function using monobodies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Wojcik et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Grebien et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Sha et al., 2013</xref>). We have addressed whether alternative binders can target a specific SH2 domain by selecting Affimers against a range of SH2 domains.</p><p>We chose five SH2 domains, some of which had previously been targeted using antibodies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Renewable Protein Binder Working Group et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Pershad et al., 2010</xref>). In these previous reports, highly specific binding reagents were identified against the recombinant protein but only a limited number worked efficiently in the tested applications (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Renewable Protein Binder Working Group et al., 2011</xref>). We have previously demonstrated the ability to isolate reagents against the Grb2 SH2 domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Tiede et al., 2014</xref>). In the present study we adopted a different target capture strategy by producing each SH2 domain with an N-terminal biotin acceptor peptide to facilitate simple direct capture from cell lysate and presentation for phage display screening. Each target was checked for efficient biotinylation by Western blot (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>) and it is noteworthy that this biotinylation was achieved in a BL21(DE3)-derived strain without the need for additional biotin ligase expression. From each screen we randomly selected phagemid clones and by phage ELISA confirmed that Affimers had been selected against each of the nine SH2 domains. The proportion of clones that bound to each target, but not to the control, was between 50% and 100% with an average of 87.6%. Next, we assessed Affimer target specificity by phage ELISA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). Grb proteins are growth factor receptor-bound proteins which contain SH2 domains. Initially, the Grb2, 7, 10 and 14 SH2 domain binding Affimers were tested for cross-reactivity against the other Grb family members, and showed specific binding to the Grb SH2 domain, with the exception of Grb14 Affimers which showed weak cross-reactivity with Grb7 and Grb10 proteins but not Grb2. The level of pairwise sequence homology between Grb7, 10 and 14 is between 65–72% (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Daly, 1998</xref>). It is notable that Affimers were isolated that bind specifically to Grb7 and Grb10 without the need for negative panning to remove cross-reactive binders. We predict that screens that include pre-panning against similar domains would results in isolation of specific Affimers that can bind Grb14 only.<fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.24903.004</object-id><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Isolation and characterisation of SH2 domain binding Affimers.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Phage ELISA from 24 monoclonal Affimer reagents isolated against the respective Grb family member SH2 domains.

Five of the Grb2-binding Affimers were purified and bound to cobalt-based magnetic beads and their ability to pull down endogenous Grb2 from cell lysates of the human U2OS cell line was assessed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>, n = 2). All five reagents successfully pulled-down Grb2 whereas a yeast SUMO-binding control Affimer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Tiede et al., 2014</xref>) was unable to pull down Grb2.</p><p>To further assess the ability to isolate isoform specific Affimers we investigated phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) a heterodimeric protein comprising a p110 catalytic subunit and a p85/p55 regulatory subunit. We examined the specificity of Affimers, raised against the N-terminal SH2 domain of the p85α variant, for cross-reactivity with the p85β and p55γ variant N-terminal SH2 domains and against the C-terminal SH2 domains of all three isoforms (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). Despite a high degree of sequence identity (pairwise between 83–90%) a number of p85α-specific Affimers were isolated (e.g., clones 1 and 2; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). Affimers that recognised the α and γ but not β domain were also isolated (clones 3 and 23). None of these Affimers bound to any of the C-terminal p85/p55 SH2 domains. These results further demonstrate the ability to isolate Affimers that show high binding specificity against related targets, even within a single protein.</p><p>The p85 SH2 domain-specific Affimers were expressed in NIH 3T3 cells and their ability to bind to endogenous p85 protein was assessed by co-immunopreciptation assays, in which p85α was pulled-down. The p85α antibody also pulled down both p110α and the FLAG-tagged Affimers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). The different levels of Affimer recovered may be due to differences in Affimer expression levels, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>, and any differences in binding affinity. It is interesting to note that Affimer 1 appears to bind to endogenous p85 with high affinity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>) but has little effect on signalling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>) suggesting it binds outside the key SH2 interaction region. In addition the Affimers did not disrupt the p85/p110 overall complex in which p85 interacts with p110 via three domains, with the SH2 domain regulating activity via binding p110 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Vivanco and Sawyers, 2002</xref>). These results demonstrate that the Affimer is specifically binding the SH2 domain interaction without affecting the two other p85/p110 binding domains.</p><p>We therefore assessed the ability of the Affimers to block the function of the p85 N-terminal SH2 domain by examining whether the Affimers led to an increase in phosphorylated protein kinase B (AKT), a downstream effector of p110. Five of the six Affimer proteins mediated an increase in AKT phosphorylation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>) demonstrating that they inhibit the interaction between the N-terminal p85 SH2 domain and p110, but importantly do not block p85-p110 complex formation. This supports a report that siRNA inhibition of p85α alone had little effect on cells, but that p85 and p110 both had to be eliminated to produce a phenotype and an effect on AKT phosphorylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Kim et al., 2005</xref>). Thus our data highlights a benefit of Affimers, and potentially other alternative reagents, for studying protein-protein interactions within the cellular context.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Affimers can be used to inhibit extracellular receptor function</title><p>Vascular Endothelial Growth Factors (VEGFs) are a family of secreted proteins that regulate many aspects of vascular and lymphatic biology including vasculogenesis (de novo formation of the vascular system), angiogenesis (formation of new capillaries e.g. in response to hypoxia), lymphangiogenesis (de novo formation of the lymphatic system) and arteriogenesis (formation of new arteries e.g. following ischemia). The biological effects of the VEGF family are mediated through binding to a membrane-bound vascular endothelial growth factor receptor (VEGFR) tyrosine kinase subfamily comprising VEGFR1, 2 and 3. While VEGFR1 is implicated as a negative regulator of angiogenesis, VEGFR2 is a major regulator of vasculogenesis, angiogenesis and arteriogenesis. VEGFR3 activation is implicated in specifying lymphangiogenesis but cross-talk between the different VEGFRs can modulate these different processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Aspelund et al., 2016</xref>). Dissecting the roles of the different VEGFRs is an important goal, particularly given the success of therapeutic agents targeting VEGF-A in diseases ranging from metastatic cancer to macular degeneration. In this context, VEGFR2 is a key molecule that regulates many aspects of vascular physiology and blood vessel formation especially angiogenesis and is associated with tumour neovascularisation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kofler and Simons, 2015</xref>).</p><p>To evaluate whether Affimer proteins that perturb VEGFR2 function could be selected we screened against VEGFR2 and then tested Affimers for their ability to bind recombinant VEGFR2 protein in vitro (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). In this case DNA sequence analysis revealed that the positive clones represented only two distinct sequences. The affinities for VEGFR2 of representative Affimer proteins, A9 and B8, were determined by SPR to be 41 ± 17 nM and 240 ± 124 nM, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>). The Affimer proteins were then labelled at the C-terminal cysteine with a single biotin moiety and used to probe various tissue types for specific staining to compare with the pattern produced by a commercially available polyclonal antibody (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). The efficiency of Affimer labelling with biotin was determined to be 80–90% by mass spectrometry (data not shown). To directly compare antibody and Affimer patterns a biotinylated secondary antibody was used to detect binding of the primary anti-VEGFR2 antibody. Subsequently, both antibody and Affimer binding were detected by streptavidin-coupled horseradish peroxidase activity. The Affimer reagents showed exactly the same staining pattern as the antibodies, with VEGFR2 staining being predominantly localised in the epithelial cells and with more intense staining at the cell membrane (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>; see arrows). In this case, the staining developed more quickly for the Affimer binders than for the antibody indicating a higher sensitivity of staining.<fig-group><fig id="fig3" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.24903.006</object-id><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>Characterisation of VEGFR2 binding Affimers.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Phage ELISA for 32 monoclonal Affimer reagents isolated against VEGFR2.

It demonstrates the value of Affimers as affinity histo-chemistry reagents. The differential sensitivity of staining may be due to the difference in size between antibody and Affimer with the latter better able to penetrate the fixed tissue more efficiently. The Affimer may also have a more exposed binding site compared to the antibody. One or more of these properties may allow a greater number of binding events to the target resulting in higher sensitivity of Affimer staining.</p><p>Alternative scaffolds have been reported to inhibit VEGFR2 including Nanobody (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Behdani et al., 2012</xref>), Adnectin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Tolcher et al., 2011</xref>), Affibody (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Fleetwood et al., 2014</xref>) and DARPin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Hyde et al., 2012</xref>) proteins, so we questioned whether the Affimer proteins could also inhibit VEGFR2 signalling in human vascular endothelial cells (HUVECs). Previous siRNA studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Murga et al., 2005</xref>) have shown that VEGFR2 signalling is required for the formation of vascular tubules by transfected HUVECs, although this siRNA-mediated effect requires 24–48 hr following transfection. By contrast, the inhibitory effect of Affimer B8 could be measured within just 30 min of treatment and also led to a decrease in VEGF-dependent tubule length and branch point formation in a tubulogenesis assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). Consistent with the effects on tubulogenesis, Affimer B8 also inhibited VEGF-dependent phosphorylation of VEGFR2 and downstream signalling, with decreased activation of cell signalling mediators PLCg1, AKT, ERK, p38 and eNOS (n = 3; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>). By contrast control Affimers had no effect on signalling. Overall these observations demonstrate that Affimers represent useful research reagents that are capable of blocking the biological function of specific receptors on biologically-relevant timescales.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Affimer binders for modulating ion channel function</title><p>Ion channels are involved in a number of physiological processes, and are important drug targets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Overington et al., 2006</xref>).

This leads to extended hospital stays or the necessity for multiple patient visits for a single test. By contrast, the smaller size of alternative binding proteins means that the molecules that do not bind to the target, will be more quickly cleared from the circulatory system, more conveniently allowing visualisation shortly after imaging agent administration. To demonstrate this in tumour bearing mice we visualised distribution of TNC Affimer compared to a control GFP-binding Affimer, both C-terminally labelled with Rhodamine Red (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>). To maximise signal detection, we imaged excised tumours and organs post-sacrifice and quantitated the signal as fold-change above background. As expected, both Affimer probes were detected in kidney indicating renal clearance. However, compared to the TNC Affimer this clearance was faster for the GFP Affimer as it showed a significant decrease (p=0.04) in fluorescence from 24 to 48 hr post-injection (fold change 9.23 ± 3.10 at 24 hr to 2.98 ± 0.77 at 48 hr; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>). The TNC Affimer signal at 24 hr post-injection was significantly higher (p=0.02) in tumours (6.26 ± 1.62) compared with the control GFP Affimer group (2.32 ± 0.61) suggesting that the TNC Affimer accumulated in the TNC expressing tumour. The TNC probe was also detected in liver tissues either due to hepatobiliary clearance or due to the fact that TNC shows low level expression in normal liver sinusoids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Van Eyken et al., 1990</xref>). In addition, the ratio of anti-TNC Affimer binders in tumour compared to the spleen, for example, was &gt;6 at 24 hr (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>); in contrast, anti-TNC antibodies took 2 days to reach a tumour/spleen ratio of 5, although this did improve to 20–30 at day 10 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">De Santis et al., 2006</xref>). Thus the more rapid clearance rate of alternative binding proteins, such as Affimers, compared to antibodies has the potential to allow more rapid imaging of tumours.

A major limitation of wide-spread exploitation of this approach is the lack of highly specific reagents that can place the fluorophore in close proximity to the endogenous target protein. Antibodies are large multi-domain proteins that are normally labelled with fluorophores at random sites that limits the achievable resolution. By contrast, the smaller Affimer proteins can be labelled in a site-specific manner providing closer spatial placement of the fluorophore to the target protein, thus facilitating use of current super-resolution techniques. This approach has recently been demonstrated using Nanobodies where super-resolution microscopy was used to image GFP-tagged proteins and nuclear pore complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Pleiner et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Ries et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>Human epidermal growth factor receptor 4 (HER4), also known as c-erbB-4, is an oncogenic transmembrane receptor protein kinase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Lemmon and Schlessinger, 2010</xref>).

To provide this demonstration Affimers have also been raised against polymerised microtubules (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>). The Affimer we selected labels interphase microtubules in a similar way to a widely-used antibody (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8A</xref>). However, in mitotic cells, the Affimer labels the spindle but not astral microtubules (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8A</xref>) likely reflecting the fact that the antibody recognises tyrosinated microtubules unlike the Affimer. Interestingly, the Affimer is able to label the central region of the cytokinetic furrow (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8A</xref>), in which microtubules are very densely packed. Antibodies are usually excluded from this region so analysis of this feature has been problematic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Hu et al., 2012</xref>).

Small molecules do not display innate immunogenicity and thus are typically conjugated to carrier proteins to elicit an effective immune response. Even so it can be a problem raising an immune response to toxic molecules and those that conjugate poorly to carrier proteins. To examine whether we could isolate Affimer reagents against a small organic molecule we used 2,4,6-trinitrotoluene (TNT). Previous studies have shown that presentation of TNT as a hapten for antibody production is known to be vital for the successful isolation of TNT specific antibodies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Ramin and Weller, 2012</xref>).

The number of clones that showed strong binding to TNBS conjugated with both ovalbumin and IgG was relatively high (22/32) with a further 8/32 showing reasonable binding. Of the 32 clones tested 14 distinct sequences were identified, some containing only variable region 1 which indicates selection from a small sub-population of the original phage display library. Within variable loop 1 it was possible to define a short consensus sequence implying a common binding mode. Four Affimer proteins were purified and tested for binding to TNT and various dinitrotoluenes (DNT; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9A</xref>) by competition ELISA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9C</xref>). All four Affimers showed binding to the original TNBS-conjugate and to TNT, but differed in their specificity for the DNTs. Affimer 4, a VR1 only Affimer, showed a higher level of specificity for TNT than any of the DNTs. By contrast, Affimer 3 binds to TNT and also provides discrimination between 2,4-DNT and the other two DNT’s. This high selectivity of recognition of the nitro group on position 4, demonstrates that Affimer reagents can show remarkable specificity for such small molecular differences. It is highly likely that altering the panning strategy to include competition steps with analogues would allow selection of specificity and sensitivity of Affimers for small organic molecule targets.</p><p>The ability of Affimer proteins to bind to small molecules raises the possibility that they may be used in cells to quench the effects of molecules such as Shield or doxorubicin that are currently used to regulate protein behaviour, allowing investigators to assess the effects of switching protein interactions off with the same speed with which they are currently turned on.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>The ability to rapidly isolate highly specific alternative binding protein affinity reagents that perform consistently in a wide range of scientific applications is the ‘holy grail’ for producing renewable binding reagents. For a recently developed artificial binding protein scaffold, known as Affimer, we demonstrate such applicability across a range of molecular and cellular studies. We have isolated Affimer proteins against more than 350 targets, but here we have exemplified their use as molecular and cellular tools against 12 different target molecules. Typically each screening regime, consisting normally of three panning rounds of phage display and phage ELISA, was normally completed in 12 days. Thus Affimer selection, as with other alternative protein or antibody fragment selection approaches that use phage display or other in vitro selection, is much faster than antibody and nanobody production techniques that involve animal inoculation. They also allow the efficient identification of binding reagents against conformational epitopes since target proteins are screening in their folded state.</p><p>Each selected Affimer coding region was sub-cloned into an <italic>E. coli</italic> expression vector and recombinant protein was purified over a further seven days. Without automation the phage display platform allows an individual to screen up to 24 targets simultaneously. The benefit of such manual screening is that greater control can be exercised to moderate individual screening regimes within a set of samples. A further advantage of Affimer proteins is the ability to express recombinant protein at high yield in <italic>E. coli</italic>. Of the 36 Affimers reported on here an average yield of 83.3 mg/L (1.5–188 mg/L) culture was achieved with a purity of greater than 95% following a single immobilised metal affinity step. We have not attempted to optimise the level of protein production but typically only grow 50 mL cultures for protein purification that provides suitable quantities of protein for most applications.</p><p>The key to successful isolation of Affimers for cellular studies is the use of high-quality antigens normally presented via biotin/streptavidin on plates and beads. Recombinant sources of protein are normally of high quality as time and effort is taken to purify the protein. For some recombinant proteins, particularly those being expressed in mammalian cells, this can be more challenging. We expressed the small SH2 domains with an N-terminal biotin acceptor peptide to facilitate site-specific in vivo biotinylation allowing target immobilisation onto streptavidin plates, directly from cell lysate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). This approach should have wide applicability for recombinant protein and domain target presentation for screening protocols. For the commercially sourced protein antigens (tenascin C, VEGFR2, tubulin and HER4) it became apparent that the success of the screen is dependent upon the commercial source. For example, tenascin C was sourced from several commercial suppliers but only one allowed the selection of suitable Affimers (data not shown). Fortunately the potential availability of thousands of high quality proteins from structural genomics consortia together with the ability to express in vivo biotinylated protein domains for capture, without purification, should reduce the risk of screen failure associated with target quality and availability.</p><p>Two papers have described the generation of antibody and antibody fragments against SH2 domains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Renewable Protein Binder Working Group et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Pershad et al., 2010</xref>). The initial paper used phage display to select binding reagents that showed exquisite specificity against recombinant SH2 domains in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Pershad et al., 2010</xref>). However, none of the reagents were used in assays to demonstrate binding to endogenous proteins from cells. Colwill et al assessed the ability to isolate binding reagents against the same family of targets using both phage display of antibodies fragment libraries and monoclonal antibodies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Renewable Protein Binder Working Group et al., 2011</xref>). They also successfully isolated binding reagents, although only a low proportion bound endogenous protein in the assays tested. By contrast, with the same class of SH2 targets, a high proportion of the monoclonal Affimer reagents reported here were successful in pull down assays and could block protein function when expressed in cells. The differences between these outcomes may be a result of library quality rather than an inherent feature of the scaffold. However, we consider it more likely due to differences in presentation of variable loop structures between antibodies and the Affimer scaffold.</p><p>The ability to express Affimers intracellularly in mammalian cells, as shown by the inhibition of the p85 SH2 domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>), represents an exciting opportunity, with the lack of disulfide bonds in the scaffold suited to the reducing environment of the cell. This feature is similar to other artificial binding proteins that can also be expressed in the cytoplasm of mammalian cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Kummer et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Spencer-Smith et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Wojcik et al., 2010</xref>). This raises the intriguing possibility of generating the necessary reagents, based on Affimers and other artificial binding proteins, to target specific protein domains of the human ‘interactome’. These would provide extremely powerful tools for understanding the function of proteins and for identifying novel drug targets in disease. The lack of disulphide bonds in the Affimer and many other artificial proteins, such as DARPins, Monobodies and Affibodies, also allows the directed introduction of cysteine residue(s) for site specific chemical modification, including addition of a single biotin or fluorophore.</p><p>A major advantage of phage display screening is the ability to isolate highly specific reagents by performing counter-screens against very similar target molecules. Interestingly for the SH2 targets, no counter-screening was performed and yet by ELISA analysis, specific Affimers were recovered for the Grb2, 7 and 10 and p85 SH2 domains. Further studies will determine whether this level of specificity is observed at the cellular level. These results, nonetheless, provide promise for the isolation of highly specific cellular binding reagents. This high level of specificity was also demonstrated with Affimers that bind the small organic compound TNT commonly used as a model organic compound. The Affimers revealed remarkable specificity considering the small size of the molecule (mol. mass &lt;300 Da) and the limited number of panning rounds used. It would be interesting to determine molecular structures of Affimer bound to TNT and 2,4-DNT to understand the recognition mechanism and to explain the discrimination between different DNT molecules. The ability to rapidly select Affimers that specifically detect small molecule targets represents a useful additional approach to the generation of reagents for diagnostic and monitoring applications of chemical agents, for example, in health, security or environmental settings. There are many examples of antibodies that bind to small molecules, although the in vivo nature of raising such reagents can present challenges for some compounds, such as toxins and pharmaceuticals, together with the time frame for inoculation and isolation and the need to use animals. Phage display has also been used to isolate antibody fragments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Dörsam et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Vaughan et al., 1996</xref>) and lipocalins that recognise small molecules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Beste et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Schlehuber et al., 2000</xref>).</p><p>The selection of reagents against small molecules also raises the prospect of recognising a range of post-translational modifications, potentially within the context of a specific protein. For example, DARPins that discriminate between phosphorylated and non-phosphorylated proteins have been described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Kummer et al., 2012</xref>). These recognise conformational changes due to the phosphorylation event rather than the phosphorylated amino acid. Only time will tell whether alternative binding reagents are capable of directly reporting on post-translational modification of proteins in a similar manner to antibodies.</p><p>The binding affinities of Affimers selected in this work were typically in the low nanomolar range, although some of the VEGFR2 binders had weaker affinities. Even so, these weaker binders still worked effectively and displayed specificity in affinity-histochemical assays and inhibited receptor function in biological assays. Since our monoclonal reagents have been identified by randomly selecting clones from three panning rounds it is anticipated that inhibitors with greater affinity can be developed, either through more detailed analysis of the pool of phage using next generation sequencing, or by affinity maturation. Whilst our screening strategy identifies monoclonal reagents, these can also be combined to generate polyclonal reagents that may improve sensitivity for certain in vitro applications.</p><p>In conclusion, we have demonstrated the ability to rapidly isolate Affimer reagents, that are effective tools in a range of molecular and cell biology applications (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10</xref>). This highlights the potential for creating a pipeline to isolate consistent renewable binding reagents against a wide variety of target molecules. Affimers are small, thermostable and simple to engineer and provide a system that compliments rather than replaces antibodies and other alternative protein scaffolds. A major aim of our laboratory is to further explore the capabilities of Affimer reagents and to test their potential protein modulating properties for use in dissecting specific cell signalling pathways as well as in studying protein-protein interactions on a proteomic scale. Affimer technology is commercially available through Avacta Life Sciences or for academic collaborations through the University of Leeds. Alternatively, the library can be synthesised as described by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Tiede et al.

A lightly edited version of the letter sent to the authors after peer review is shown, indicating the most substantive concerns; minor comments are not usually included.</p></boxed-text><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Affimer: versatile and renewable affinity reagents&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been favorably evaluated by Anna Akhmanova (Senior Editor) and three reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors. The following individuals involved in review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Peter Kristensen (Reviewer #2); Savvas Savvides (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>In this manuscript, Tiede et al. report on the successful selection of Affimers from a phage display library. Selections were done against various antigens, including a hapten, and the several downstream applications were exemplified like fluorescent labeling, expression in cells, histo-chemistry or in vivo injection. Altogether, the Affimers (also known as Adhiron) represent an attractive option when developing specific binders and this manuscript illustrate the power of this approach. The experiments are convincing and well done.</p><p>However, although the Affimer technology is impressive and would probably interest a large number of <italic>eLife</italic> readers, the way the manuscript is written is strongly biased. Whatever the quality of this novel scaffold is, it is not the only non-Ig scaffold developed to create orthogonal binders. There are also a lot of over-statements concerning the limitations of classical and recombinant antibodies or antibody fragments. In addition, Affimers were published before under the name of Adhiron and while the current manuscript gives an impressive vision of successful selection, the paper would strongly benefit from showing something new that was not achieved in the past by this lab.</p><p>To make the paper acceptable for <italic>eLife</italic>, the authors should extremely thoroughly revise the whole manuscript in order to carefully put Affimers in the proper historical and current context of competing technologies so that readers may get an exact idea of what this sort of approach brings. The authors should also attempt, if possible, to push one of their stories a bit further to reach goals unmatched before by the Affimers.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The manuscript systematically presents the Affimer approach as being the only non-antibody scaffold of any value (DARPins, FN-based or other similar tools are not even mentioned) and the only compact and robust scaffold usable in cells (no mention of single domain or nanobodies). In the current form, the manuscript reads more like an advertisement than a proper scientific paper. It is essential that a well-balanced overview and discussion of different approaches is provided. Please note that cosmetic changes (e.g. references to reviews on the subject) will not suffice.</p><p>2) The development of this scaffold as well as the library used here have been reported before (PEDS, 2014; Tiede et al., 2014) and the current manuscript is simply extending what was published before by this group (and as stated by the authors more than 350 selections were already carried out). Although it is not that clear, it appears that the anti-Grb2 screen is already presented in the 2014 paper. The novelty and the advantages of Affimer approach, compared to, e.g. nanobodies, should be illustrated and discussed more clearly. Ideally, a functional or therapeutic proof-of-concept application of Affimers should be presented.</p><p>Title: It is not clear what &quot;renewable&quot; means in this context. Please either make this more clear in the manuscript, or change the title.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.24903.017</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>Essential revisions:</italic></p><p><italic>1) The manuscript systematically presents the Affimer approach as being the only non-antibody scaffold of any value (DARPins, FN-based or other similar tools are not even mentioned) and the only compact and robust scaffold usable in cells (no mention of single domain or nanobodies).
