Here we report the results. We found the microRNA, miR-34a, was expressed at twice the level in CD44<sup>+</sup> prostate cancer cells purified from xenograft tumors (LAPC4 cells) compared to CD44<sup>-</sup> LAPC4 cells, whereas the original study reported miR-34a was underexpressed in CD44<sup>+</sup> LAPC4 cells (Figure 1B; Liu et al., 2011). When LAPC4 cells engineered to express miR-34a were injected into mice, we did not observe changes in tumor growth or CD44 expression; however, unexpectedly miR-34a expression was lost <italic>in vivo</italic>. In the original study, LAPC4 cells expressing miR-34a had a statistically significant reduction in tumor regeneration and reduced CD44 expression compared to control (Figure 4A and Supplemental Figures 4A,B and 5C; Liu et al., 2011). Furthermore, when we tested if miR-34a regulated CD44 through binding sites in the 3’UTR we did not find a statistically significant difference, whereas the original study reported miR-34a decreased CD44 expression that was partially abrogated by mutation of the binding sites in the <italic>CD44</italic> 3’UTR (Figure 4D; Liu et al., 2011). Finally, where possible, we report meta-analyses for each result.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>miR-34a</kwd><kwd>metastasis</kwd><kwd>Reproducibility Project: Cancer Biology</kwd><kwd>replication</kwd><kwd>metascience</kwd><kwd>LAPC4</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><funding-statement>The Reproducibility Project: Cancer Biology is funded by the Laura and John Arnold Foundation, provided to the Center for Open Science in collaboration with Science Exchange.

For each of these papers a Registered Report detailing the proposed experimental designs and protocols for the replications was peer reviewed and published prior to data collection. The present paper is a Replication Study that reports the results of the replication experiments detailed in the Registered Report (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Li et al., 2015</xref>) for a paper by Liu et al., and uses a number of approaches to compare the outcomes of the original experiments and the replications.</p><p>Many cancers contain a subset of cells, termed cancer stem cells (CSCs), that are less differentiated and contribute to tumor progression and metastasis in various cancers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Kim et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Takayama et al., 2017</xref>). In 2011, Liu et al., reported that the microRNA miR-34a suppressed prostate CSCs via the adhesion molecule CD44 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Liu et al., 2011</xref>). miR-34a was reported to be repressed in CD44<sup>+</sup> prostate CSCs, below levels of let-7b, a previously reported tumor suppressive microRNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Liu et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Liu et al., 2011</xref>). Enforced expression of miR-34a, such as through lentiviral infection of the prostate cancer cell line LAPC4, inhibited tumor regeneration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Liu et al., 2011</xref>). CD44 was also reported to be a direct and functional target of miR-34a, suggesting a key role of miR-34a in regulating prostate CSCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Liu et al., 2011</xref>).</p><p>The Registered Report for the paper by Liu et al. described the experiments to be replicated (Figures 1B, 4A and D and Supplemental Figures 4A,B and 5C), and summarized the current evidence for these findings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Li et al., 2015</xref>). Since that publication additional studies have reported tumor suppressive functions of miR-34a in other types of cancers. This includes inhibition of cellular proliferation and invasion in endometrial cancer by miR-34a through downregulating Notch1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Wang et al., 2017</xref>), inhibition of cellular migration and invasion in hepatocellular carcinoma via sirtuin 1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Zhou et al., 2017</xref>), inhibition of cellular proliferation and clonogenicity of breast CSCs by directly preventing RNA 2’,3’-Cyclic Phosphate and 5’-OH Ligase accumulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Lin et al., 2017</xref>), inhibition of proliferation and migration of gastric cancer cells through CD44 suppression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Jang et al., 2016</xref>), and inhibition of tumor growth in non-small cell lung cancer with a combination of miR-34a and let-7 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Kasinski et al., 2015</xref>). In addition to miR-34a, miR-141 was identified to suppress prostate CSCs by targeting a cohort of pro-metastasis genes including <italic>CD44</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Liu et al., 2017</xref>). Similar to miR-34a, miR-141 was underexpressed in CD44<sup>+</sup> prostate CSCs, inhibited tumor regeneration when expressed in prostate cancer cell lines, and regulated <italic>CD44</italic> through a putative miR-141 binding site in the 3’UTR of <italic>CD44</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Liu et al., 2017</xref>). In addition, miR-34a delivered via a nanoparticle (MRX34) has been tested in a clinical trial to treat patients with unresectable primary hepatocellular carcinoma or individuals with unresectable liver metastasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bouchie, 2013</xref>); however, the trial was terminated after five immune related serious adverse events (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT01829971">NCT01829971</ext-link>).

Interestingly, while the short tandem repeat (STR) profile of these cells was a partial match with the LAPC4 profiles in the DSMZ and Cellosaurus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Bairoch, 2018</xref>) databases, it was not a match for the amelogenin locus, which is used in sex determination (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>). Instead of containing the X and Y alleles as expected, these cells only contained the X allele. This could have been due to random amplification failure (i.e. allelic dropout) or deletion of the Y allele (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Ou et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Xu et al., 2017</xref>).

This experiment is comparable to what was reported in Figure 1B of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Liu et al. (2011)</xref> and described in Protocol 3 in the Registered Report (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Li et al., 2015</xref>). While the original study included other prostate cancer cell lines, this replication attempt was restricted to LAPC4 cells. LAPC4 cells purified from xenograft tumors were sorted into CD44<sup>+</sup> and CD44<sup>-</sup> populations by fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS). However, while the original study, and the described protocol in the Registered Report, described the top 10% most brightly stained cells to be defined as CD44<sup>+</sup> and the bottom 10% most dimly stained cells as CD44<sup>-</sup>, we observed that the CD44 signal was weak without a clear division between positive and negative populations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>). Additionally, the CD44 stained cell population was largely indistinguishable from cells stained with an isotype control antibody. Importantly, the isotype control and CD44 antibodies were matched on heavy chain, subclass, light chain class, fluorochrome type, fluorochrome ratio, manufacturing process, and formulation, which are known factors that impact the usability of the isotype control in flow cytometry (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Hulspas et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Maecker and Trotter, 2006</xref>). We also confirmed the CD44 antibody was able to successfully detect CD44<sup>+</sup> human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref>). Considering the weakly positive sample, CD44<sup>+</sup> cells were defined as the top 1% of the population with the remaining population constituting CD44<sup>-</sup> cells, a deviation from the original study and the Registered Report. We then used quantitative real-time-polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) to assess let-7b and miR-34a expression in CD44<sup>+</sup> and CD44<sup>-</sup> LAPC4 cell populations. We found that let-7b was underexpressed in CD44<sup>+</sup> cells, being expressed at 0.20% of the level in the CD44<sup>-</sup> cells, while miR-34a was elevated in level in CD44<sup>+</sup> cells, being expressed at 202% of the level in the CD44<sup>-</sup> cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). The original study reported both let-7b and miR-34a were underexpressed in CD44<sup>+</sup> LAPC4 cells at 30% and 3.4% of the level in CD44<sup>-</sup> cells, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Liu et al., 2011</xref>). The decision to define the CD44<sup>+</sup> population as a smaller fraction of the total population than the original study (1% vs 10%) was done to minimize any potential masking of reduced microRNA expression by not including what would have been a relatively large population (90%) of cells that were not positive for CD44 based on controls. Importantly, we observed let-7b levels were reduced in CD44<sup>+</sup> cells, relative to CD44<sup>-</sup> cells, as expected and similar to the original study despite the difference in how populations were defined. However, this creates a potential confound, particularly in the CD44<sup>-</sup> population as defined for this replication, that could contain cells that were positive for CD44 complicating the comparison of microRNA levels between these populations. To summarize, for this experiment we found results that were in the same direction as the original study for let-7b expression, but not for miR-34a expression.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Effect of miR-34a expression on tumor growth</title><p>LAPC4 tumor cells were used to replicate an experiment that tested the effect of miR-34a on tumor growth.

Untransduced LAPC4 cells, which were not included in the original study, were added as an additional control. LAPC4 cells purified from xenograft tumors were transduced with the same lentiviral vectors used in the original study to create stable miR-34a producing cells, which expressed higher levels of miR-34a compared to untransduced or negative control transduced LAPC4 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). Following infection, cells were injected into male NOD/SCID mice and monitored for tumor development. Tumor incidence was 100% for all groups, similar to the original study, with the three groups having the same median latency time (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A</xref>).

We measured miR-34a expression by qRT-PCR. This experiment was described in Protocol 6 in the Registered Report (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Li et al., 2015</xref>) and is conceptually similar to what was reported in Supplemental Figure 4A,B of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Liu et al. (2011)</xref>. The original study reported no, or marginal (~3X), increases in miR-34a expression in the residual tumors formed from prostate cancer cells, specifically LAPC4, LAPC9, and DU145, transiently transfected with miR-34a oligo compared to vector control (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Liu et al., 2011</xref>). An increase (~3X over control) in miR-34a expression was also reported for tumors derived from DU145 cells transduced with lentiviral vectors to express miR-34a (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Liu et al., 2011</xref>). In this replication attempt, we detected miR-34a expression in tumors derived from untransduced or negative control transduced LAPC4 cells; however, unexpectedly we were unable to detect miR-34a in the tumors derived from miR-34a transduced LAPC4 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). Although miR-34a was not detectable in the tumors derived from miR-34a transduced LAPC4 cells, we were able to detect the copepod green fluorescent protein (copGFP) marker, which was under control of the elongation factor-1 (EF-1) alpha promoter. This suggests that the pre-miR-34a that successfully expressed mature miR-34a in LAPC4 cells <italic>in vitro</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>) was silenced <italic>in vivo</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). This could have occurred through promoter hypermethylation or chromatin remodeling of the locus where the synthetic construct was expressed. Indeed, tumor suppressor microRNAs have been reported to be downregulated, or completely deleted, in a variety of cancers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Kelly and Russell, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Rusek et al., 2015</xref>). Additionally, the cytomegalovirus (CMV) promoter, which controlled pre-miR-34a expression, has been reported to become silent in many animal studies within a few weeks after gene transfer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Löser et al., 1998</xref>), which could be another mechanism responsible for this phenotype. Importantly, though, this observation does not necessarily imply miR-34a does not suppress tumor growth or progression in this experimental model since miR-34a overexpression was not confirmed <italic>in vivo</italic>. The different source of the LAPC4 cells between the original study and this replication attempt might have contributed to differences in miR-34a expression. It is also possible that silencing of miR-34a could have imparted a benefit at an early initiation step after cells were implanted in the mice and been maintained during tumor growth.</p><p>We also measured CD44 expression by Western blot in the excised tumors. This experiment was described in Protocol 5 in the Registered Report (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Li et al., 2015</xref>) and is conceptually similar to what was reported in Figure 4A of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Liu et al. (2011)</xref>, which used DU145 cells transduced with a retroviral vector encoding miR-34a. The original study reported CD44 expression was inversely correlated with miR-34a expression in the tumors formed from the transduced DU145 cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Liu et al., 2011</xref>). In this replication attempt, we found CD44 expression in tumors derived from miR-34a transduced LAPC4 cells was similar to the expression in tumors derived from untransduced or negative control transduced LAPC4 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1D</xref>). Interpretation of these results need to take into consideration the absence of miR-34a expression that was observed in the tumors from miR-34a transduced LAPC4 cells.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Evaluation of putative miR-34a binding sites in the 3’UTR of CD44</title><p>We independently replicated an experiment to test if miR-34a regulates <italic>CD44</italic> expression through two putative miR-34a binding sites in the 3’UTR of <italic>CD44</italic>. DU145 cells were co-transfected with miR-34a oligos, or control oligos, and the same luciferase reporter plasmid used in the original study that contained a fragment of the 3’UTR of <italic>CD44</italic> with both putative miR-34a binding sites that were either left intact (wild-type) or mutated. This is similar to what was reported in Figure 4D of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Liu et al.

While the original study tested each binding site individually as well as together as a double mutant, this replication attempt focused on the double mutant. We found DU145 cells transfected with the luciferase reporter, with wild-type binding sites, and miR-34a oligos were similar (mean relative expression = 0.99) to cells co-transfected with control oligos (mean relative expression = 1.00), which was not statistically significant (one-sample Wilcoxon signed-rank test: <italic>z</italic> = 0.517, uncorrected <italic>p</italic>=0.632; (Bonferroni corrected <italic>p</italic>&gt;0.99) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). Results were similar when DU145 cells were transfected with the luciferase reporter containing mutations in both binding sites (miR-34a: mean relative expression = 1.19; control: mean relative expression = 1.00). The original study reported cells co-transfected with the wild-type luciferase reporter and miR-34a oligos resulted in a decreased luciferase signal (mean relative expression = 0.67) compared to cells co-transfected with control oligos (mean relative expression = 1.00), which was partially abrogated with the double mutant luciferase reporter (miR-34a: mean relative expression = 0.78; control: mean relative expression = 1.00) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Liu et al., 2011</xref>). In addition to analyzing the data like the original study, where luciferase values from cells transfected with miR-34a oligos were reported normalized to control oligo values for each biological repeat and each luciferase reporter, we also analyzed the data using the raw luciferase values. While we did not observe a difference between miR-34a and control oligos for each luciferase reporter, in agreement with the results of the prior analysis approach, we found the luciferase values from the double mutant luciferase reporter was on average lower than the wild-type luciferase reporter values (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). Importantly, interpretation of results from experiments that overexpress microRNAs should take into account artificial repression that could occur from non-physiological stoichiometry of the overexpressed microRNA as well as relieved repression of natural targets of other microRNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Svoboda, 2015</xref>). To summarize, we found results that were not consistent in direction with the original study and not statistically significant.</p><fig id="fig3" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.43511.007</object-id><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>Luciferase assays to assess putative miR-34a binding sites in the 3’UTR of CD44.</title><p>DU145 cells were transfected with either a luciferase reporter with a fragment of the 3’UTR of <italic>CD44</italic> with both putative miR-34a binding sites left intact (wt) or mutated (M1M2).

The 95% CI for both studies also crossed zero, which indicates the null hypothesis that there is no difference between the two luciferase reporters can not be rejected. This is in agreement with the meta-analysis that was not statistically significant (<italic>p</italic>=0.353). Additionally, the luciferase values from miR-34a oligos normalized to control oligo values were compared to a constant of 1, which represents the control oligo group for each of the luciferase reporters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>).

For both reporters, the 95% CI for both studies also crossed zero. We used the one-sample approach because of the way the original data were handled, where the control oligo for each biological repeat and each luciferase reporter were assigned values of 1 without an associated variance making an unpaired two-sample test inappropriate. This possibly explains why the original study reported a statistically significant effect between control and miR-34a for the wild-type luciferase reporter when using an unpaired test in contrast to the calculated 95% CI of the effect size for the original study presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref> that crosses zero, which indicates the null hypothesis that there is no difference between miR-34a oligo transfected cells and the constant of 1 (i.e. control oligo) can not be rejected.

However, this is limited to what was obtainable from the original paper and through communication with the original authors, which means there might be particular features of the original experimental protocol that could be critical, but unidentified. So while some aspects, such as cell line, mouse strain, antibodies, and plasmids were maintained others were changed in the execution of the replication, such as source of the LAPC4 cells and flow cytometry gating strategy. Furthermore, other aspects were unknown or not easily controlled for. These include variables such as cell line genetic drift (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Ben-David et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Hughes et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Kleensang et al., 2016</xref>), subclonal drift in heterogeneous stable cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Shearer and Saunders, 2015</xref>), genetic heterogeneity of mouse inbred strains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Casellas, 2011</xref>), and the microbiome of recipient mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Macpherson and McCoy, 2015</xref>).

All data, csv files, and analysis scripts are available on the OSF (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://osf.io/gb7sr/">https://osf.io/gb7sr/</ext-link>). Confirmatory statistical analysis was pre-registered (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://osf.io/jhtae/">https://osf.io/jhtae/</ext-link>) before the experimental work began as outlined in the Registered Report (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Li et al., 2015</xref>). Data were checked to ensure assumptions of statistical tests were met and in the case of the tumor volume data were natural log transformed to achieve a normal distribution. The exploratory survival analysis was analyzed with a COX proportional hazard (CPH) model because ties, which were prevalent in the data, were better handled with CPH than a log-rank (Mantel-Cox) test. When described in the results, the Bonferroni correction, to account for multiple testings, was applied to the alpha error or the <italic>p</italic>-value. The Bonferroni corrected value was determined by divided the uncorrected value (0.05) by the number of tests performed. The asymmetric confidence intervals for the Cliff’s <italic>d</italic> estimates were determined using the normal deviate corresponding to the (1 - alpha/2)<sup>th</sup> percentile of the normal distribution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Cliff, 1993</xref>).

We also modified the gating strategy when determining CD44<sup>+</sup> and CD44<sup>-</sup> populations as described above. Importantly, we included a control (PBMC) to confirm specificity of the antibodies and staining procedure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref>). Similarly, instead of obtaining enough purified CD44<sup>+</sup> LAPC4 cells required using multiple tumors, which were pooled, instead of individual tumors as specified in the Registered Report. When we infected purified LAPC4 cells to express miR-34a we changed the source of the lentiviral packaging plasmids and modified the time from infection to injection from 24 hr to 48 hr. The reason is because we were unable to achieve high transduction efficiency (&gt;90% GFP positive) when the protocol was followed as described in the Registered Report. Importantly, the transduced LAPC4 cells successfully expressed miR-34a (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). Additionally, because we were unable to detect miR-34a in the tumors derived from miR-34a transduced LAPC4 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1C</xref>) we analyzed the tumors to see if GFP was detectable, as an indicator of whether the tumors were derived from infected cells. Finally, we used ECL and film for the Western blots, instead of the Odyssey system outlined i the Registered Report. Additional materials and instrumentation not listed in the Registered Report, but needed during experimentation are also listed.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>The Reproducibility Project: Cancer Biology would like to thank Dr. Can Liu and Dr. Dean G Tang (MD Anderson Cancer Center) for sharing critical information, data, and reagents, specifically plasmids and LAPC4 cells used in the original study.

Your article has been reviewed by four peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Sean Morrison as the Senior Editor. Andrea Ventura (Reviewer #1) and Julie Liu (Reviewer #4) have agreed to reveal their names.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>Your manuscript is recommended for publication in <italic>eLife</italic> pending satisfactory revisions of several remaining points. Specifically:</p><p>1) Could the replication authors confirm whether their departure from the original conditions used by Liu et al. was approved as part of the original registered protocol?

Moreover, the authors provided data showing that miR-34a exerts this potent tumor repressive activity at least in part by targeting the cell adhesion molecule CD44.</p><p>In the replication study, the Yan et al. fail to replicate key portions of the original study. In particular, they fail to detect significant down-regulation of miR-34a in CD44-Hi LPCA4 cells, fail to observe tumor growth inhibition when LAPC4 cells transduced with a miR-34a expressing lentivirus were injected in immunocompromised mice, and fail to detect significant repression by ectopic miR-34a in luciferase reporter assays. These results call into question the central message of the original publication.</p><p>The manuscript is well written, the experiments are clearly illustrated and their results are generally consistent with the authors' interpretation. The relevant scientific literature is appropriately cited and the statistical analysis performed to reject the various null hypothesis is, as far as I can tell, sound.</p><p>The authors have also to be commended for carefully listing potential explanations for the discrepancy between their results and those reported in the original manuscript.</p><p>In particular, the fact that the LAPC4 cell line initially obtained by Liu and colleagues failed to generate tumors and had to be replaced by LAPC4 from a different source is worrisome, given the high genetic drift of cancer cell lines.</p><p>Equally perplexing is the observation that expression of the miR-34a transgene appears silenced in tumors isolated from mice injected with LAPC4 cells transduced with the mIR-34a overexpressing. This may suggest that there is a strong selection against miR-34a in vivo, but it doesn't explain why the same effect was not observed by Liu and colleagues. It is important to point out that there is abundant experimental evidence that ectopic expression of miR-34a can result in cell cycle arrest and apoptosis, although the evidence that loss of endogenous miR-34a is sufficient to promote or accelerate tumorigenesis is less conclusive.</p><p>Overall, this is a strong manuscript that, in my opinion deserves publication.</p><p>Minor issues:</p><p>The authors seem to imply that reduced expression of the luciferase reporter carrying the 3'UTR of CD44 with point mutations disrupting the miR-34a sites could be explained by the fact that the WT 3'UTR contains a potential miR-141 binding site overlapping one of the two miR-34a site. Unless there is something I have missed, I find this explanation illogical. If the putative miR-141 site is also disrupted in the mutant 3'UTR one would expect increased luciferase activity, not reduced (loss of repression by miR-141). The authors should either remove or clarify this sentence.</p><p>&quot;To summarize, we found results that were in the same direction as the original study and not statistically significant where predicted&quot;. This sentence is unclear.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic> </p><p>It appears that multiple conclusions drawn from the original manuscript by Liu et al., are not confirmed by this replication study. It is unfortunate that based on the flow analysis, the replication authors were forced to deviate from the original study's experimental protocol when choosing the cut-off for CD44 high or CD44 low. Two deviations were made. The first was to use a 1% cutoff rather than the prior manuscripts' 10% cutoff. The second was to assign the other 99% of the population to a CD44 low status. The authors could argue that 10% of the replication study's CD44 low population (9%/99%) is in fact CD44 high. I understand the replication authors' potential reason for doing this: that there wasn't a clear CD44 high versus CD44 low cutoff. However, it does represent a significant departure from the prior work. Could the replication authors confirm whether this departure was approved as part of the original registered protocol? Could the authors perhaps elaborate and discuss the path to making this decision and the potential confounds?</p><p>The second concern is the observation that in the miR-34 over-expression experiment, miR-34 over-expression is lost. One hand, one may conclude that miR-34 over-expression in this experiment did not reduce tumor growth, given the data in the figure. However, there is a hazard in this, since the replication authors have themselves shown that miR-34 expression is silenced. Such silencing typically occurs when the microRNA is indeed suppressive to cancer progression (the original authors' conclusion). One could imagine that such silencing may have imparted a benefit at an early initiation step (tumor re-initiation) and been maintained. Thus, this experimental observation does not allow one to draw the conclusion that miR-34 <italic>does not</italic> suppress tumor growth or progression in this system, since miR-34 over-expression is not confirmed in vivo.</p><p>The luciferase reporter experiment clearly shows that exogenously transfected miR-34a does not repress the wildtype reporter signal.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic> </p><p>As a part of &quot;Reproducibility Project: Cancer Biology, this manuscript aims to duplicate the results of a previous publication &quot;The microRNA miR-34a inhibits prostate cancer stem cells and metastasis by 41 directly repressing CD44&quot; (Liu et al., 2011). The authors generated different observations from those reported by the Tang group, using the same/similar reagents and protocols whenever possible. The original paper by Liu et al. claimed that miR-34a negatively regulate CD44 in prostate cancer stem cells, as they reported the downregulation of miR-34a in CD44 high LAPC4 prostate cancer cells (the putative stem cell population), the suppression of tumor development and Cd44 downregulation by miR-34a overexpression in xenograft models, and the miR-34a dependent regulation of Cd44 in luciferase assays. However, the replication study made different observations, including a 2-fold increase of miR-34a in CD44 high versus CD44 low LAPC4 prostate cancer cells, no effect on tumor growth or Cd44 expression by miR-34a overexpression in the xenograft model, and no miR-34a-dependent regulation on CD44.</p><p>This manuscript has raised questions about the reproducibility of the original report by Liu et al. This reviewer agrees with the authors that the selected experiments constitute the core discoveries reported by the original paper, and should be the focus of reproducibility effort. Of particular importance is the biological effects of miR-34 in prostate cancer development, and the miR-34a dependent regulation of CD44 in prostate cancer cells. The authors have carefully designed and executed their experiments, they included appropriate controls wherever possible, and obtained solid results based on the reported experimental conditions. It is clear to this reviewer that these authors cannot reproduce some of the most important results from the original report. This paper is suited for publication at <italic>eLife</italic> upon revision.</p><p>Major comments:</p><p>1) The key issue encountered by the reproducibility study is the cell line of choice. The LAPC4 cell line acquired from the Tang group only exhibited a partial match with the standard LAPC4 profiles in the DSMZ and Cellosaurus database, and more importantly, failed to generate xenograft tumors in NOD/SCID mice. Hence the authors had to acquire cytologically and functionally validated LAPC4 cells from a different source to perform this reproducibility study. This reviewer is wondering if the authors have contacted the Tang group to acquire additional information about the LAPC4 cell lines they had problems with, and made a second request for LAPC4 from the Tang group. It is unclear if the failure to reproduce the original observations is largely due to the cell line difference, or if there exist other contributing factors.</p><p>2) To validate the tumor suppressor functions of miR-34a, the authors generated LAPC4 cells that overexpress miR-34a by lentiviral transduction, but observed no effect on tumor development or CD44 expression in xenograft models. However, miR-34a expression is silenced in vivo specifically in LAPC4 cells transduced by mir-34a lentiviral vectors, but not in control transduced or non-transduced LAPC4 cells. This observation implies that miR-34a expression could have a tumor suppressor function, hence its expression is selected against in vivo (this is consistent with the tumor suppressor effects of miR-34a in overexpression studies in other models). Again, the cell line difference could contribute significantly to the different observations between the two studies. It would be nice to have the authors provide a more in-depth discussion about this discrepancy in results.</p><p>3) The original study reported a direct regulation between miR-34a and CD44 3'UTR, but the extent of regulation reflected in luciferase assays was rather modest. Luciferase assays have been widely used to validate a direct regulation of a target mRNA by a miRNA, yet in my opinion, these assays are not very reliable, particularly for miRNA targets that are modestly regulated. Often times, these assays rely on overexpression of both miRNAs and luciferase reporters with wildtype or mutated 3'UTRs to determine the extent of their direct interactions in cell lines. In addition to the binding between miRNAs and the target 3'UTR, the relative expression levels between miRNAs and reporter, which often deviates from physiological conditions, play an important role in the results of the assay. Hence, I suggest that the authors include such discussion in their revised manuscript.</p><p>Minor comments:</p><p>1) It is not appropriate to claim that &quot;miR-34a was overexpressed in CD44+ cells, being expressed at 202% of the level in the CD44- 139 cells 140 (Figure 1)&quot;. miR-34a is elevated in level in CD44+ cells, but not necessarily overexpressed. Please be precise when describing this observation.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #4:</italic> </p><p>I strongly oppose the publication of this 'reproducibility' manuscript, for the following considerations.</p><p>First of all, the conclusion of the original paper that miR-34a inhibits prostate cancer stem cells and metastasis by directly repressing CD44 (Liu et al., 2011) was based on experimental results obtained in multiple prostate cancer cell line and xenograft models as well as human primary prostate cancer cells. Each experiment was scientifically designed and rigorously performed with biological and technical repeats. That paper has been highly cited (more than 1150 times) since the publication. Besides that, tumor suppressive functions of miR-34a have also been intensively studied and corroborated in many tumor systems by independent researchers. Since the publication of the original paper, there have been 32 publications that are directly or indirectly in support of the original findings regarding miR-34a and CD44. However, in this Reproducibility Project, the authors are trying to use shoddy data from poorly designed and executed experiments to discredit the original paper. Two of the three experiments in this manuscript were done in only one xenograft model LAPC4. All of the three experiments were one-time experiments with limited number of sample size, which lacks proper biological and technical repeats, especially when they saw big variations within the experimental groups. These points challenge the credibility of the authors' results, which were obtained via experiments that lacked the basic scientific rigor and could not be used to draw any meaningful conclusions.</p><p>Secondly, the LAPC4 cells from the original paper have been validated by cell line authentication in our institute (MD Anderson Cancer Center), and have been intensively used in our lab for more than 12 years. We trust our cells and we are more than willing to provide our LAPC4 cells to them for the in vivo studies.</p><p>Thirdly, the authors mentioned that they did not see tumor suppressive function of miR-34a in the LAPC4 model; however, they also mentioned that miR-34a over-expression in the LAPC4 tumor cells was already gone at the endpoint of the tumor experiments. That perfectly explains why they didn't see a tumor suppressive function of miR-34a. Using this kind of data to claim that miR-34a lacks tumor suppressive function is merely unacceptable.</p><p>Lastly, in the luciferase reporter experiment, there is huge variation in luciferase activity even within one experimental group. It's highly unscientific and irresponsible to make any conclusion from this kind of data.</p><p>Collectively, publication of this shoddily done 'Reproducibility' manuscript that lacks the basic scientific rigor will only generate confusions in the field and do a big disservice and damage to the entire scientific community.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.43511.018</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p>Thank you for the evaluation of our manuscript.

The departure was not approved as part of the Registered Report and occurred during the course of experimentation. In the revised manuscript we more explicitly state that the deviation was from not only the original paper, but the Registered Report. We also elaborated on the process, specifically the expectation that the cellular population would display CD44 staining along a spectrum that was clearly distinguishable from controls. Instead we found little to no separation of CD44 positive cells from isotype control. Thus, the replication attempt focused on measuring the expression of the target microRNAs in CD44 high (i.e. positive) cells vs CD44 low (i.e. negative) cells. Additionally, considering the hypothesis being tested was reduced miR-34a levels in CD44<sup>+</sup> cells, the deviation from top 10% to 1% was considered a way to prevent the CD44<sup>-</sup> population, which was substantially larger, based on staining controls, from masking the reduced levels of the microRNAs in the few CD44<sup>+</sup> cells observed. That is, if we took the top 10% it would contain 90% CD44<sup>-</sup> cells and 10% CD44<sup>+</sup> cells, essentially masking any attempt to observe if there was reduced expression of miR-34a in CD44<sup>+</sup> cells. While this was a substantial deviation that could mask differences in expression, it is important to note that we observed let-7b levels were reduced in CD44<sup>+</sup> cells, relative to CD44<sup>-</sup> cells, as expected and similar to the original study.
