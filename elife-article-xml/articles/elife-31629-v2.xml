However, many questions related to the mechanisms underlying astrocyte-neuronal communication, as well as to the general importance of this communication, still remain unanswered. Patch clamp electrophysiology, especially the ability to make simultaneous measurements from the astrocyte and the neuron, provides a sensitive means to probe their interactions. Here, we use dual patch clamp recordings to extend our understanding of astrocyte-mediated modulation of synaptic transmission within the cortical network. This approach also provides a unique opportunity to determine the potential consequences of defective astrocyte-neuronal signaling in a neurological disease, using a mouse model for Rett syndrome (RTT).</p><p>Rett syndrome has remained the subject of great interest since the defective gene was first identified as encoding the ubiquitously expressed X - linked transcription factor, Methyl CpG Binding Protein 2, MeCP2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Amir et al., 1999</xref>). Affected males have a severe brain disorder and usually die prior to the age of two. Affected females are mosaic due to dosage compensation by X chromosome inactivation and live on average to ~40 years of age. The disease in females is characterized by regression of early developmental milestones, such as speech and purposeful hand motions, followed by the acquisition of multiple motor abnormalities, anxiety and seizures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Chahrour and Zoghbi, 2007</xref>). Several early studies using RTT mouse models suggested that the symptoms were due exclusively to loss of MeCP2 from neurons. For example, expression of <italic>Mecp2</italic> from the neuronal <italic>tau</italic> locus in mice prevented the appearance of some RTT-like phenotypes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Luikenhuis et al., 2004</xref>). More recently, loss and restoration of MeCP2 just in inhibitory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Ure et al., 2016</xref>) or excitatory neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Meng et al., 2016</xref>) was shown to affect RTT phenotypes differentially. Finally, early immunohistochemical studies indicated that astrocytes did not express MeCP2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Akbarian et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Shahbazian et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Kishi and Macklis, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Jung et al., 2003</xref>). Thus, it was very unexpected when it was first reported that astrocytes express MeCP2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Ballas et al., 2009</xref>) and that restoration of MeCP2 expression specifically in astrocytes, in otherwise null mice, delayed the progression of RTT- like symptoms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Lioy et al., 2011</xref>). These, and other findings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Maezawa et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Turovsky et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Yasui et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Delépine et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Garg et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Williams et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Nguyen et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Okabe et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Lioy et al., 2011</xref>) suggested that astrocyte-neuronal communication had an important physiological role to play in vivo, but left open the question of whether MeCP2- deficient astrocytes contributed directly to abnormal neuronal physiology.</p><p>Applying dual patch clamp recordings to cortical slices from wild-type mice, we find that astrocyte stimulation increases the frequency of both excitatory glutamatergic and excitatory GABAergic neuronal synaptic currents in a calcium-dependent manner. We further determine that in global MeCP2 null mice, this astrocyte-mediated synaptic modulation is absent and calcium signals in astrocytes are severely blunted. Exploiting the mosaic expression of MeCP2 in female RTT mice, which express GFP from the endogenous <italic>Mecp2</italic> locus in wild-type cells, we find that astrocyte-neuronal signaling proceeds normally only when the astrocyte expresses MeCP2. Our results provide the first cellular support for the idea that normal astrocytes can restore at least one aspect of excitatory synaptic activity to mutant neurons in a RTT brain.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Astrocytes mediate increases in cortical neuronal signaling</title><p>Dual patch clamp recordings were performed on layer II/III pyramidal neurons and neighboring astrocytes in brain slices derived from the barrel cortex of postnatal (p10-12) wild-type mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a–b</xref>).

As an additional means to limit TFLLR activation to a single astrocyte, we selected SR101 positive astrocytes that were sufficiently separated from one another to be out of range for simultaneous puffer activation. Like depolarization, the application of 500 μM TFFLR (EC<sub>50</sub> = 1.9 μM) to wild-type astrocytes consistently resulted in an increase in synaptic event frequency in the proximal neuron recording, qualitatively similar to that seen with astrocyte depolarization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4a</xref>). Also like depolarization, the increase in synaptic events increased within five seconds of agonist application, and peaked within 35 s (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4b</xref>).

This ruled out a requirement of GABA<sub>A</sub>R activation for initiation of glutamatergic transmission. By contrast, the application of TFLLR in the presence of the glutamate receptor blockers, AP5/NBQX, failed to invoke statistically significant increases in either inward currents (pre-TFFLR: 89 ± 46 events/m, post-TFFLR: 96 ± 61 events/m, p=0.61, n = 15) or outward currents (pre-TFFLR: 40 ± 25 events/m, post-TFFLR: 52 ± 39 events/m, p=0.124, n = 15) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6g</xref>). This result raises the possibility that astrocyte-mediated modulation of neuronal signaling occurs either through direct release of glutamate or release of a substance that acts directly on a glutamatergic neuron.</p><p>As a further test of direct release of glutamate or another ionotropic modulator from astrocytes, we tested for any synaptic currents in the proximal neuron that were synchronized to astrocyte stimulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). The experimental protocol required that we use astrocyte depolarization because TFLLR application was too slow to test for synchronous release. The astrocyte was depolarized using a single 20 ms pulse to +60 mV at a rate of 1 Hz in order to prevent full activation of the neuronal circuitry that resulted from a stimulus train. This protocol was repeated 100 times for each recording. Pooled pre-stimulus epochs were also obtained using the same protocol without depolarization. To improve the signal detection we used symmetrical transmembrane chloride concentration in order to increase the driving force for inward currents. The analysis was restricted to the first 200 ms post-stimulus, the period during which a direct response from the astrocyte would be expected to occur. The pre-stimulus epochs showed events distributed randomly within the 200 ms epoch whereas the pooled post-stimulus intervals showed a non-random distribution with peaks at 40 ms and 60 ms (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7a</xref>). To determine whether the responses reflected direct release onto the neuron or alternatively indirect signaling through a neuronal circuit, the experiment was repeated in the presence of TTX (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7b</xref>). This treatment prevented the post-stimulus increase in synaptic event frequency indicating that the events reflected the partial activation of the neuronal circuitry rather than direct astrocytic release. While not as definitive as our pharmacological negation of GABA, the findings argue against direct release of glutamate from astrocytes as the initiator of neuronal synaptic responses.</p><fig id="fig7" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.31629.011</object-id><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><title>Distribution of time-locked neuronal events in response to astrocyte depolarization.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) Two 200 ms representative traces are shown, left: pre-depolarization; right: post-depolarization.

The most commonly reported form of astrocyte-mediated modulation of neuronal signaling, also reflected in our study, involves changes in the frequency of neuronal synaptic currents mediated by the neurotransmitters GABA and glutamate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Kang et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Benedetti et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Araque et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Fiacco and McCarthy, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Jourdain et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Liu et al., 2004</xref>). The increase in frequency for both neurotransmitters was not accompanied by increases in the average amplitudes, pointing to specific effects on presynaptic release and not postsynaptic receptors. GABA is of particular interest due to its dual role played in both excitation and inhibition of neuronal circuitry (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Newman, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Yang et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Jo et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Zonta et al., 2003</xref>). In our p10-12 postnatal recordings from layers 2/3 cortical neurons in wild-type mice, GABA is excitatory, consistent with previous studies performed at this age (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Ben-Ari, 2002</xref>). Thus, in our neuronal recordings, GABAergic and glutamatergic transmission are both excitatory.</p><p>We show through wild-type astrocyte-neuron paired recordings, three different modes of astrocyte-specific stimulation that can effectively increase excitatory synaptic transmission. Both direct depolarization of the astrocyte using the patch pipette and calcium uncaging in the astrocyte represent non-physiological means of activation of both GABA and glutamatergic neuronal signaling. A physiological means of activating the astrocyte utilized local application of an astrocyte-specific agonist (TFLLR) of the metabotropic Protease-activated receptor 1 (Par1). Activation of the astrocyte via Par1 works primarily through Gα signaling, leading to IP<sub>3</sub>-mediated release of calcium through the endoplasmic reticulum. The Par1 receptor expresses at high levels in astrocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Hermann et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Park et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Lee et al., 2007</xref>), a finding confirmed by our immunohistochemistry on cortical astrocytes. There is precedent for Par1 receptor expression in certain neurons as well as evidence for their depolarization in response to TFLLR application. In the best studied example, a small fraction of dentate gyrus neurons responded to TFLLR with a depolarizing response, and only under conditions where bath application was very long (&gt;120 s) compared to our study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Han et al., 2011</xref>). Evidence supporting a direct involvement of astrocyte Par1 receptors in neuronal activation comes from two of our findings. First, our immunohistochemistry only detected Par1 in the astrocytes and second the TFLLR-induced response was completely blocked when the astrocyte was dialyzed with the calcium buffer BAPTA. Finally, our findings in cortex, that Par1 in astrocytes stimulates adjacent neurons, are supported by a previous study in the nucleus of the solitary tract (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Vance et al., 2015</xref>). Thus, we are confident that TFLLR was leading to cortical neuron excitability through actions on the astrocytes.</p><p>A central question that surrounds astrocyte effects on neuronal excitability is the identity of the factor/s released causal to the initiation of signaling. The list of published candidates includes glutamate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Parpura et al., 1994</xref>), ATP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Newman, 2003</xref>), D-serine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Yang et al., 2003</xref>), GABA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Jo et al., 2014</xref>), and derivatives of arachidonic acid (prostaglandins, epoxyeicosatrienoic acid, and 20-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Zonta et al., 2003</xref>). For our studies, glutamate and GABA specifically were tested because of their documented roles as gliotransmitters in barrel cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Min and Nevian, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Benedetti et al., 2011</xref>). Through alteration of the trans-membrane chloride concentration gradient we created outwardly (GABA) and inwardly (glutamate) directed synaptic events to test whether either GABA or glutamate receptor blockade would shut down both classes of synaptic currents in response to TFLLR. Application of GABA antagonists resulted in inhibition of outward currents but the activation of inward currents remained, thus eliminating GABA<sub>A</sub>R involvement in the initiation of the circuitry. By contrast, applying glutamate receptor antagonists blocked the TFLLR induced increase in the majority of outward GABA mediated responses and most, but not all of the glutamate mediated inward responses. The persistence of inward responses could reflect an incomplete block of glutamate receptors or involvement of additional unidentified chemical activators. As a further test for involvement of a direct glutamate receptor response we performed time-locked neuronal recordings in response to astrocytic depolarization. Examination of the pooled event timing revealed a significant, but delayed, increase in frequency within 40 to 60 ms of astrocyte depolarization. These responses were further tested for evidence of direct activation through inclusion of TTX which blocks neuronal mediated effects. TTX eliminated the increase in event frequency associated with the depolarization pointing to release from neurons and not astrocytes. Therefore, the putative molecule/s underlying astrocyte modulation of neuronal signaling in our context is still at large.</p><p>Our study was successful in assigning a functional requirement for MeCP2 expression to a specific cell type. Recent studies have drawn into question the exclusive role of neurons in the progression of RTT, a disease resulting from loss of MeCP2 expression in both cell types. For example, the progression of overt RTT-like behaviors in mice is blunted following postnatal restoration of MeCP2 just in astrocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Lioy et al., 2011</xref>), consistent with reversibility of the disease with ubiquitous MeCP2 expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Guy et al., 2007</xref>). Additionally, the astrocytes in a RTT mouse have reduced sensitivity in their detection of carbon dioxide in CNS respiratory centers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Turovsky et al., 2015</xref>) and the astrocytic expression of MeCP2 is critical in maintaining adaptive responses to respiratory CO<sub>2</sub> chemosensitivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Garg et al., 2015</xref>). Our initial recordings from globally MeCP2 null cortex could have been explained by defects in either astrocytes or neurons, or both cell types. However, owing to our ability to unequivocally stimulate individual astrocytes by means of depolarization, we were able to test all combinations of neurons and astrocytes. For this purpose we utilized the female mosaic MeCP2 brain, which reflects the same condition as in human females with RTT. Our findings showed that MeCP2 expression in astrocytes was required to restore a normal neuronal synaptic response to astrocyte stimulation, even when the neurons lacked MeCP2. This indicates that in the female RTT brain, only in the case where there is a wild-type astrocyte coupled to a neuron, will there be normal astrocyte-neuronal physiology. As in neurons,~50% of the astrocytes in the mosaic female will usually be defective. Our results therefore point to a strong contribution by astrocytes to the abnormal brain circuitry underlying RTT.</p><p>What defects imparted by MeCP2 deficiency in astrocytes account for blunted neuronal signaling? Calcium signaling pathways are often involved in gliotransmitter release (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bazargani and Attwell, 2016</xref>) and both our ability to inhibit neuronal signaling through inclusion of a strong calcium buffer in the astrocyte as well as activation through calcium uncaging point to involvement of calcium (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Kang et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Benedetti et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bal-Price et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Lee et al., 2011</xref>). Also, TFFLR acts through the Par1 receptor to release calcium from intracellular stores (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Junge et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Hollenberg et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Ubl and Reiser, 1997</xref>). Less certain however are the links between astrocyte depolarization and potential changes in intracellular calcium. Both T type and L type voltage dependent calcium channels have been identified in acutely dissociated astrocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Latour et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Verkhratsky et al., 1998</xref>). The extent to which such channels are expressed throughout the astrocyte population is not known and several studies have contested their expression in astrocytes. We were not able to identify voltage dependent calcium currents or increases in intracellular calcium using a depolarization protocol, which leaves the door open to mechanistic interpretations.</p><p>Although we couldn’t identify with certainty a depolarization-mediated mechanism, we tested for a potentially unifying role of the calcium response. This test was called for by our findings that dialysis of the astrocyte with BAPTA blocked neuronal signaling and the blunted TFLLR-mediated calcium response in RTT astrocytes. However, our attempts to rescue defective signaling by direct calcium uncaging in RTT astrocytes failed in all but a single recording. From this result we surmise that the mechanisms in calcium handling that are associated with MeCP2 deficiency in astrocytes are not solely responsible for the reduced astrocyte-mediated stimulation of neurons. Given that loss of MeCP2 results in global gene expression changes in the brain, some of which have been linked to astrocytic functions that could impact signal transduction, such as microtubule dynamics and vesicle trafficking (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Delépine et al., 2016</xref>), this result is not completely unexpected and underscores the complexity of alterations with the loss of MeCP2.</p><p>Taken together, our physiology reveals a perturbation in synaptic communication in mouse models of RTT, manifesting as decreased astrocyte neuronal excitatory signaling. The decreased signaling can account, at least in part, for the compromised ability of RTT mouse models to perform normal behavioral tasks, as well as for amelioration of RTT-like phenotypes after restoration of MeCP2 in astrocytes. In addition to reduced overall excitatory neuronal signaling, there are potential implications reflected in an altered excitatory-inhibitory (E/I) synaptic balance reported in RTT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Feldman et al., 2016</xref>). Normally, activation of the GABA<sub>A</sub>R switches from being excitatory to inhibitory during early postnatal mouse development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Araque et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Ben-Ari et al., 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Obata et al., 1978</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Owens et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Dammerman et al., 2000</xref>). This switch results from the expression of the chloride exporter KCC2, which establishes the asymmetrical trans-membrane concentration gradient (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Blaesse et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Ganguly et al., 2001</xref>). In both humans with RTT and mouse models, a delay in the expression of the chloride exporter occurs, thus causing developmental delay in the switch to inhibition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Duarte et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Tang et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Feldman et al., 2016</xref>). Consequently, the absence of astrocytic contributions to neuronal signaling in RTT places regions of the brain, which are critically dependent on E/I balance, at greater risk.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Animals</title><p>All animal procedures were approved by the Oregon Health and Science University Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee under protocol number IP00000284.

After recovery at 35˚C, slices were incubated in extracellular recording solution containing equal volumes of calcium indicator and 20% (w/v) Pluronic acid (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR). These slices were maintained at 23˚C for 25 m during which they were shielded from light and continuously bubbled with Carbogen. Slices were then transferred to the microscope stage and washed for 30 additional minutes with bubbled extracellular recording solution to allow for de-esterification of the calcium indicator. Live calcium signals were acquired using a Yokogawa CSU-X1 confocal spinning disc equipped with a Hamamatsu EM-CCD digital camera (Imagem-x2). A 488 nm laser line was used for calcium signals and 561 nm line was used for SR101 fluorescence (OBIS Coherent, Santa Clara, CA). Laser power was set to &lt;50%, which corresponded to a final output of 2.3 mW for the 488 nm line and 1.2 mW for the 561 nm line.

Micro-manager software (UCSF, San Francisco, CA) was used to acquire images and Image J (NIH, Bethesda, MD) and Microsoft Excel (Redmond, WA) were used for offline analysis. Throughout all of the experiments involving calcium imaging the laser and camera gains were held constant. Thus, it became necessary to exclude those astrocytes, both mutant and wild-type, that had high resting levels of calcium in order to prevent signal saturation. To quantitate calcium signals in astrocytes that qualified for analysis, the entire somatic region was selected as a region of interest (ROI). Then, for each ROI, the time dependent changes in signal intensity were quantitated as ΔF/F<sub>0</sub> as follows. First, the average pixel intensity within each ROI was corrected for background fluorescence. To establish true background levels the average pixel intensity was determined using cells not incubated with the calcium indicator. Second, the background corrected basal fluorescence signal intensity (F<sub>0</sub>) was determined on the basis of the average pixel intensity measured for the ROI during the two seconds prior to drug application. Third, the change in average fluorescence intensity for the ROI (ΔF) was determined by subtracting the average pixel intensity for the ROI by the background-subtracted basal fluorescence (F<sub>0</sub>).</p><p>For calcium uncaging experiments, 4 mM DMNP-EDTA (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) was loaded with 3.6 mM CaCl<sub>2</sub> for 10 m in the dark.

Primary antibodies used were: Par1 (1:5000, Thrombin R, S-19, SC-8204, Goat polyclonal, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Dallas, TX), α-tubulin (1:10000, mouse monoclonal, DSHB #AA4.3, Iowa City, Iowa), MeCP2 (1:5000, rabbit monoclonal, cell signaling D4F3, 3456 s, Danvers, MA). Secondary antibodies were conjugated to IR-fluorophore for imaging on Li-Cor Odyssey machine: goat anti mouse- IR680 (Thermo Fisher 35518, Waltham, MA), goat anti rabit-IR680 (Thermo Fisher #33568, Waltham, MA) donkey anti goat- IR 800 (Li-Cor 925–32214, Lincoln, NE).</p></sec></sec></body><back><sec id="s6" sec-type="additional-information"><title>Additional information</title><fn-group

The authors employ a range of techniques to depolarize astrocytes and measure the frequency and amplitude of events on a neighboring neuron.

Understanding the contribution of astrocytes to neuronal and circuit dysfunction is important. The mosaic model is a powerful way to test cell-type dependence of the phenotype. However, there were also a number of questions and revisions raised by reviewers that should be addressed as outlined below, including the addition of statistics, p values, experimental details to the key figure and results. The authors show that upon non-physiological depolarization of astrocytes, it can impact synaptic activity in surrounding neurons but fail to identify a physiologically-relevant stimuli or potential mechanism. If this is challenging to address experimentally in a timely manner, it is important that the authors include critical and thoughtful discussion of these issues in the revised paper. In addition, some consolidation of Results section and figures is needed to increase clarity and readability for non-experts.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic> </p><p>The manuscript from Rakela and colleagues investigates the impact of MeCP2 and astrocyte gating of neuronal activity in normal and mouse model of Rett syndrome. In this study, the authors employ a range of techniques to depolarize astrocytes and measure the frequency and amplitude of events on a neighboring neuron. First, the authors were able to induce the increase in the frequency, not amplitude, of events on neighboring neurons utilizing three techniques (intracellular depolarization, astrocytic-specific ligand, and calcium uncaging) to activate astrocytes. Second, this effect was not directly related to GABA or glutamate release/signaling. Thirdly and most interestingly, the persistent increase was dependent on astrocytic, not neuronal, expression of MeCP2. I agree with the authors that their work to discriminate the expression of MeCP2 as necessary across the astrocyte/neuronal interaction is important and clever in its execution. While the authors were able to show that GABA/Glutamate signaling was not necessary for persistent changes, the lack of mechanistic insight leaves many questions that should be addressed before publication:</p><p>1) As indicated in the discussion, Lioy et al. (2011) restored many core features (both behaviorally and anatomically) in a MeCP2-deficient mouse with the selective expression of MeCP2 in only astrocytes. In the study, they showed an increase in the number of vGluT1 terminals and restored morphology. Does the persistent effect shown by Rakela et al. depend on the increase in presynaptic release of vGluT1 synapses? If persistently altered for long periods of time, would it be capable to capture either a morphological or histological change in terminals?</p><p>2) On a related note, what characteristics of presynaptic release are altered in the face of astrocytic gating? Does the number of release sites increase? The lack of amplitude changes suggests that quantal size is not changing, but how do these changes impact short-term plasticity measures?</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic> </p><p>This is an interesting study that reports how astrocyte stimulation affects synaptic response onto pyramidal neurons in control mice and in Rett mouse models. Overall, the data are clear and the topic is interesting and important. I have several suggestions that the authors could accommodate with some revisions.</p><p>1) For the Par-1 immuno staining, please present some analyses for the expression within astrocytes. Include some average data. The Par-1 response is an important stimulus that is used in this paper, but the reader needs to be convinced that Par-1 receptors exist in cortical astrocytes.</p><p>2) Please provide a clear reference to a published paper showing that gramicidin pores are not permeable to chloride. Again, changing the Cl<sup>-</sup> reversal potential is a nice approach used in this study, but the reader needs to be convinced that gramicidin perforated patches behave in the way the authors state. This knowledge is critical to interpret the result in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref> that GABA is excitatory at this stage of development in the cortex. If other people have addressed this topic before then additional references should be provided.</p><p>3) The presentation of the results is a bit long-winded and ponderous. Perhaps sharpen the text to make it briefer and more to the point.</p><p>4) The authors make the point clearly that they do not know the identity of the substance released from astrocytes to trigger the altered neuronal signaling. If they are sure it is not glutamate release, then they should state this explicitly. Also, could the substance be a change in ATP, K<sup>+</sup> and or Ca<sup>+</sup> in the extracellular fluid? If so, please discuss.</p><p>5) It is understood that tools to manipulate astrocytes are limited and the authors have had to use strong depolarization, Par-1 agonists and Ca<sup>2+</sup> uncaging. As experimental tools these are fine, but the authors should guide the readership by stating in the Discussion that it is likely that all three of these methods are non-physiological and that the conclusions should be interpreted with these thoughts in mind. Thus it is hard to imagine a scenario when astrocytes depolarize to +60mV.</p><p>6) Add statistics, p values, n numbers and statistical tests to the key figures so the reader can see what is happening just by looking at the figures.</p><p>7) Many of the scatter graphs show mean +/- sd. This is fine, but I wonder if it would be better to show box and whisker plots with mean, sd and sem? I suspect some readers will appreciate such graphs more than mean +/- sd.</p><p>Overall, this study is a valuable addition to the literature and another round of hard work to tighten up the aforementioned aspects will make the study better. I can't comment too much on the mouse model of Rett itself as this is beyond my expertise. However, this aspect will hopefully be addressed by one of the other reviewers.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic> </p><p>This paper examines changes in astrocyte-driven effects on neurotransmission in a mouse model of Rett syndrome. The authors suggest that a mechanism dependent on calcium dependent astrocyte signaling increases the frequency of spontaneous EPSCs and IPSCs. This form of gliotransmission is absent in MeCP2 deficient (male) mice and shows rescue in WT astrocytes in female mosaic mice. The strength of the paper is in the description of the astrocytic locus of the phenotype. The mosaic model is a powerful way to test cell-type dependence of the phenotype. The weaknesses of the paper revolved around the lack of mechanistic insight and the overinterpretation of experiments.</p><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref> and histograms elsewhere. These were apparently built from the data from &gt;1 cell, and according to the Results (subsection “Astrocytes mediate increases in cortical neuron signaling”, second paragraph), event frequency varied greatly among cells. How were histograms built to avoid overburdening the distribution with events from high-frequency cells and to thus keep the amplitude distribution representative?</p><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>. What is the interpretation of the increase in select large events? The statistical treatment of this is unclear.</p><p>Regardless of the pulse amplitude used for depolarizing stimulation, the physiological relevance of the strong depolarization of astrocytes is highly questionable. It is good that the investigators use a second method of local TFLLR application, but the relevance and specificity of this are also questionable (see below). Were other physiologically-based methods of astrocyte stimulation attempted? Were they unsuccessful?</p><p>Par1 activation with TFLLR occurs in isolated neurons and causes them to fire action potentials (PMID 21827709). Thus, the possibility of a direct TFLLR on neurons needs to be treated with respect.</p><p>The Ca<sup>2+</sup> signal initiated by astrocyte depolarization should be documented in the authors' hands, using the brief-pulse protocols used to elicit the PSC frequency increase. A few papers are cited, but voltage-gated Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx in astrocytes is not universally observed.</p><p>The authors seem to want to interpret experiments in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figures 4</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">8</xref> as a test of the astrocyte derived signal (e.g. Discussion, second paragraph). However, the experiments testing the nature of gliotransmitter (glutamate, GABA) are confounded by the same substances serving as neurotransmitters. A likely model to explain the data is that substance X, released from astrocytes, increases spiking selectively in principal neurons surrounding the recorded cell (perhaps because only principal cells express the receptor for X). This accounts for the increase in sEPSCs. Local synaptic interactions between principal neurons and interneurons then explain the increase in sIPSCs. When viewed through the lens of this explanation, the experiments designed to determine the polarity of GABA signaling seem tangential.</p><p>The attempts to measure EPSCs and IPSCs by clamping midway between reversal potentials appear fraught. Membrane noise is high in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>, likely because of the depolarized Vm value. This will increase false positives and perhaps false negatives. The false positive problem is highlighted by incomplete antagonism in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B, C</xref>. Overall, it is difficult to believe the quantifications from this protocol.</p><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>. Sample traces should be shown here. I have trouble reconciling the time course data with <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>. What am I missing? The statistical treatment here (2 peaks/) is not clear. Further, the basis for the time course data informing the likelihood of glutamate as mediator (subsection “Interdependence of GABA and glutamatergic signaling pathways”, last paragraph) are lost on me.</p><p>Figure 12: Raw images that serve as the basis for the Ca<sup>2+</sup> imaging should be shown. How confident can the authors be that images derive from astrocytes? Wouldn't signals from astrocyte processes be most relevant to the studies?

Understanding the contribution of astrocytes to neuronal and circuit dysfunction is important. The mosaic model is a powerful way to test cell-type dependence of the phenotype. However, there were also a number of questions and revisions raised by reviewers that should be addressed as outlined below, including the addition of statistics, p values, experimental details to the key figure and results. The authors show that upon non-physiological depolarization of astrocytes, it can impact synaptic activity in surrounding neurons but fail to identify a physiologically-relevant stimuli or potential mechanism. If this is challenging to address experimentally in a timely manner, it is important that the authors include critical and thoughtful discussion of these issues in the revised paper. In addition, some consolidation of Results section and figures is needed to increase clarity and readability for non-experts.</p></disp-quote><p>We reduced the number of figure supplements from 7 to 5, added the requested immunohistochemistry figure and further consolidated the primary figures from 13 to 11. We color-coded all recordings, in all of the appropriate figures, to provide easy visual links between the histograms showing the number of events and the corresponding fold changes. We now include statistics and gender within the figure legends for all experimental data. We also shortened and sharpened the Results section. We rewrote the paper to better describe the different forms of stimulation, pointing out directly that depolarization is likely non-physiological and, like so many other studied features of astrocytes, obscures mechanistic insights. We also point out, however, that without our use of depolarization, which acts on one specific astrocyte, we would not have been able to perform the novel experiments in the female mosaic brain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>) or the time-locked measurements that allowed us to test direct release of excitatory factors from the astrocyte (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). The female is the gender appropriate model for Rett syndrome, but most molecular and physiology studies have not exploited a clean way to differentiate the normal and mutant cells in the intact mosaic brain, relying instead on the hemizygous males. Regarding the issue of mechanisms underlying the depolarization-induced signaling, we tested for voltage dependent calcium channels as well as monitoring calcium levels during depolarization. We did not add these tests to the Results section because the results were all negative, leaving readers to ponder, and one reviewer had noted that our Results section was already “longwinded and ponderous”. Finally, we spelled out more clearly the actions of the agonist TFLLR. We maintain, based on many previous studies, that TFLLR activates a physiologically relevant pathway, taking issue with the idea that we rely solely on a non-physiological stimulus. Below we address each of the three reviewers’ concerns point by point.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1:</p><p>[…] 1) As indicated in the discussion, Lioy et al. (2011) restored many core features (both behaviorally and anatomically) in a MeCP2-deficient mouse with the selective expression of MeCP2 in only astrocytes. In the study, they showed an increase in the number of vGluT1 terminals and restored morphology. Does the persistent effect shown by Rakela et al. depend on the increase in presynaptic release of vGluT1 synapses? If persistently altered for long periods of time, would it be capable to capture either a morphological or histological change in terminals?</p></disp-quote><p>Lioy’s findings of morphological changes and elevated vGluT1 levels were based on long-term restoration of MeCP2 in astrocytes in vivo. It is difficult to imagine that similar morphological changes would occur with our astrocyte stimulation that is on the order of tens of seconds, and our resolution in slices limits any detection of fine scale structural changes. Further, our data showing an increase in neurons in the frequency of both GABA and glutamatergic synaptic currents, after astrocyte stimulation, reflects increased release probability and not postsynaptic alterations. We have emphasized this point in the first paragraph of the Discussion. As presynaptic, the increase in glutamatergic responses would therefore reflect release from vGluT1 presynaptic terminals.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) On a related note, what characteristics of presynaptic release are altered in the face of astrocytic gating? Does the number of release sites increase? The lack of amplitude changes suggests that quantal size is not changing, but how do these changes impact short-term plasticity measures?</p></disp-quote><p>We conclude that the effect is presynaptic and not postsynaptic based on the increase in frequency and absence of change in amplitude for synaptic events, as noted by the reviewer. We stress that in our Discussion. We have no data that address changes in release site number or the mechanisms involved in the short term plasticity as the neuronal circuitry involved is likely complicated.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2:</p><p>[…] 1) For the Par-1 immuno staining, please present some analyses for the expression within astrocytes. Include some average data. The Par-1 response is an important stimulus that is used in this paper, but the reader needs to be convinced that Par-1 receptors exist in cortical astrocytes.</p></disp-quote><p>To address this important concern we added a new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref> showing immunohistochemical images comparing the Par1 labeling of astrocytes and neurons. These images make clear that we can detect labeling in astrocytes but not cortical neurons. Therefore, quantitative comparisons were not possible. Par-1 expression in astrocytes is well documented and we included references to this effect. In addition, in Results we have added links to transcriptome analyses done by others showing expression of mRNA in astrocytes. This potential concern, along with reviewer 3’s concern of whether Par-1 expression is strictly astrocytic, is now addressed further in a new part of the Discussion with appropriate references.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Please provide a clear reference to a published paper showing that gramicidin pores are not permeable to chloride. Again, changing the Cl<sup>-</sup> reversal potential is a nice approach used in this study, but the reader needs to be convinced that gramicidin perforated patches behave in the way the authors state. This knowledge is critical to interpret the result in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref> that GABA is excitatory at this stage of development in the cortex. If other people have addressed this topic before then additional references should be provided.</p></disp-quote><p>We now cite in the Results section the earliest and best studies showing cation selectivity and the lack of permeation by Cl with gramicidin. The references to an excitatory action played by GABA during early development are in the last paragraph of the Discussion.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) The presentation of the results is a bit long-winded and ponderous. Perhaps sharpen the text to make it briefer and more to the point.</p></disp-quote><p>The overall length changes achieved by consolidation of figures, along with the movement of ponderous pharmacology of basal synaptic currents to supplemental, have resulted in a ‘more to the point’ Results section.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) The authors make the point clearly that they do not know the identity of the substance released from astrocytes to trigger the altered neuronal signaling. If they are sure it is not glutamate release, then they should state this explicitly. Also, could the substance be a change in ATP, K<sup>+</sup> and or Ca<sup>+</sup> in the extracellular fluid? If so, please discuss.</p></disp-quote><p>We embraced this criticism and have added more logic behind the time-locked averaging and the use of inwardly and outwardly directed currents to test glutamate and GABA as substances released. We now make it clear in the Results and Discussion that GABA is ruled out on the basis of bidirectional experiments in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref> and that glutamate action through ionotropic receptors is also ruled out in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>. We note in the Discussion that there are other candidates, such as those noted by the reviewers, and add appropriate references, but we do not dwell on the subject because we have nothing to add to an already confusing topic.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) It is understood that tools to manipulate astrocytes are limited and the authors have had to use strong depolarization, Par-1 agonists and Ca<sup>2+</sup> uncaging. As experimental tools these are fine, but the authors should guide the readership by stating in the Discussion that it is likely that all three of these methods are non-physiological and that the conclusions should be interpreted with these thoughts in mind. Thus it is hard to imagine a scenario when astrocytes depolarize to +60mV.</p></disp-quote><p>As outlined in our response to reviewer 1, we have responded by adding to the Discussion a section related to the use of depolarization and the resulting lack of mechanistic insights. We also make clear that depolarization and calcium uncaging are non-physiological stimuli, but we do take issue with the Par1 activation being non-physiological. It has a known biological ligand, mimicked by TFLLR, and a well characterized signaling pathway. The claim that Par1 is physiological is now better supported by references in the Results and Discussion.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) Add statistics, p values, n numbers and statistical tests to the key figures so the reader can see what is happening just by looking at the figures.</p></disp-quote><p>As requested, statistics, statistical tests used, number of recordings, number of animals and gender have been added to every appropriate figure.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7) Many of the scatter graphs show mean +/- sd. This is fine, but I wonder if it would be better to show box and whisker plots with mean, sd and sem? I suspect some readers will appreciate such graphs more than mean +/- sd.</p></disp-quote><p>In some experiments shown the numbers of recordings are not appropriate for SEM and we want to remain consistent throughout the paper with our representation of the results. For this reason, we hope the reviewer will be satisfied with our showing only the mean +/- SD.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3:</p><p>[…] <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref> and histograms elsewhere. These were apparently built from the data from &gt;1 cell, and according to the Results (subsection “Astrocytes mediate increases in cortical neuron signaling”, second paragraph), event frequency varied greatly among cells. How were histograms built to avoid overburdening the distribution with events from high-frequency cells and to thus keep the amplitude distribution representative?</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewer raises an important point that we addressed as follows. For every recording, we generated a plot of event number vs. amplitude, similar to the cumulative plot shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>. We then normalized each plot, based on peak event number, and summed them. Because each recording is now weighted equally it can be compared statistically to determine whether the pre and post amplitudes are similar, as maintained on the basis of the cumulative plot in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>. We have done this for both <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">4</xref> data and find that the pre and post amplitudes are not statistically different. We added both weighted histograms, along with the statistics, as a new supplemental figure.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>. What is the interpretation of the increase in select large events? The statistical treatment of this is unclear.</p></disp-quote><p>The statement was deleted.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Regardless of the pulse amplitude used for depolarizing stimulation, the physiological relevance of the strong depolarization of astrocytes is highly questionable. It is good that the investigators use a second method of local TFLLR application, but the relevance and specificity of this are also questionable (see below). Were other physiologically-based methods of astrocyte stimulation attempted? Were they unsuccessful?</p></disp-quote><p>TFLLR was the only physiologically relevant stimulation we tried. We chose this agonist because the receptor is highly enriched in astrocytes and the signaling pathway in astrocytes has been characterized. As outlined in our response to the editor and reviewer 2, we have added references to the considerable Discussion supporting a role for TFLLR in a naturally occurring signaling pathway. The specificity of the Par1 receptor for astrocytes is further elaborated in the discussion now on the basis of immunohistochemistry (replicated in our own hands) and specific inhibition of the neuronal response by dialysis of the astrocyte with BAPTA (the TFLLR response is known to engage a calcium response).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Par1 activation with TFLLR occurs in isolated neurons and causes them to fire action potentials (PMID 21827709). Thus, the possibility of a direct TFLLR on neurons needs to be treated with respect.</p></disp-quote><p>Our strongest evidence that TFLLR does not work via neurons is provided by our finding that inclusion of BAPTA in the astrocyte electrode abolishes all activation. Additionally, we detected Par1 by immunohistochemistry in cortical astrocytes but not neurons. We have added a section in the Discussion emphasizing this important issue. We also added to the Discussion a critical evaluation of the paper referenced by the reviewer. That study was restricted to a single class of neurons, shown by the authors to express Par1 on the bases of immunohistochemistry and electrophysiology. However, within that population of neurons, &lt;5% of the cells depolarized in response to TFLLR, and then only after greatly prolonged bath application of &gt;120 sec. The absence of immunohistochemical detection in cortical neurons, the BAPTA block of activation in astrocytes and the differences in time scale for activation between astrocytes and neurons all indicate that Par1 is working through astrocytes in the cortex.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The Ca<sup>2+</sup> signal initiated by astrocyte depolarization should be documented in the authors' hands, using the brief-pulse protocols used to elicit the PSC frequency increase. A few papers are cited, but voltage-gated Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx in astrocytes is not universally observed.</p></disp-quote><p>We tested for calcium currents using whole cell astrocyte patch clamp recordings. However, the low input resistance and space clamp issue greatly compromised detection. We were also unsuccessful in measuring any effects of depolarization on calcium signals in the soma with calcium-indicating dyes. As noted by this reviewer, the presence of voltage-gated calcium channels remains under dispute, but we believe positive findings from published studies outweigh the negative. To this point, we cite published data showing both T and L type calcium channels in acutely dissociated astrocytes.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The authors seem to want to interpret experiments in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figures 4</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">8</xref> as a test of the astrocyte derived signal (e.g. Discussion, second paragraph). However, the experiments testing the nature of gliotransmitter (glutamate, GABA) are confounded by the same substances serving as neurotransmitters. A likely model to explain the data is that substance X, released from astrocytes, increases spiking selectively in principal neurons surrounding the recorded cell (perhaps because only principal cells express the receptor for X). This accounts for the increase in sEPSCs. Local synaptic interactions between principal neurons and interneurons then explain the increase in sIPSCs. When viewed through the lens of this explanation, the experiments designed to determine the polarity of GABA signaling seem tangential.</p></disp-quote><p>We did not make sufficiently clear our rationale or logic underlying the pharmacological block experiment. The logic was that if blocking one of the transmitters did <italic>not</italic> block TFLLR activation, then we could rule it out as a potential activator of the neuronal responses, independent of its role in neuronal circuitry. In this way, our results ruled out GABA but not glutamate. The logic and interpretation is now clarified in the Results and Discussion. To further test glutamate, we performed time locked averaging to see if we could detect early synchronized synaptic responses that might reflect direct actions by glutamate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). This experiment could only be done with depolarization. We detected responses during the first 200 ms that were initially hopeful, but because they were all eliminated in the presence of TTX we conclude that all of these responses reflect downstream circuitry as proposed by the reviewer. All of these interpretations have been added to Results and Discussion.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The attempts to measure EPSCs and IPSCs by clamping midway between reversal potentials appear fraught. Membrane noise is high in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>, likely because of the depolarized Vm value. This will increase false positives and perhaps false negatives. The false positive problem is highlighted by incomplete antagonism in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B, C</xref>. Overall, it is difficult to believe the quantifications from this protocol.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that the S/N is worse than other measurements where the driving force was larger. However, as explained above, we used this approach principally to test whether GABA or glutamate could represent the activator substance released by the astrocyte. This approach required different directionality of currents. Thus, this approach was not designed to provide exacting estimates of glutamate and GABA contributions beyond that shown by pharmacology of inward currents.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>. Sample traces should be shown here. I have trouble reconciling the time course data with <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>. What am I missing? The statistical treatment here (2 peaks/) is not clear. Further, the basis for the time course data informing the likelihood of glutamate as mediator (subsection “Interdependence of GABA and glutamatergic signaling pathways”, last paragraph) are lost on me.</p></disp-quote><p>We understand the confusion. We were unable to show the time course in the same format as previous figures because the pre and post responses were not consecutive for this experiment and the bins were accumulated from 100 trials. However, as a better means of showing time course, we now put pre and post on the same time scales and we have added the requested raw data to clarify (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). The TTX recording is now clearly indicated as such. We have also added more detail about the protocol and the logic in the Results section.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Figure 12: Raw images that serve as the basis for the Ca<sup>2+</sup> imaging should be shown. How confident can the authors be that images derive from astrocytes? Wouldn't signals from astrocyte processes be most relevant to the studies? How were signals from neurons/neuron dendrites excluded?</p></disp-quote><p>We now include raw images for the Ca imaging in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10</xref>. All of the measurements shown were taken from somas of SR101 positive cells to insure they were astrocytes. We agree that measurements from astrocyte processes would be relevant and we spent a great deal of time trying to analyze distal sparks. However, they were not synchronized, making them difficult to quantitate, and further, speaking to the reviewer’s concern, the sparks could not be definitively assigned to astrocytic processes, so we were not able to include the distal signaling in the analyses.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Supplemental <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>.

This result then becomes the premise for separation of currents on the basis of ion selectivity, which is the best way to track differential effects on the GABA and glutamatergic currents. To that point, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref> shows that the inward and outward currents behave largely as expected on the basis of pharmacology, setting the stage for <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref> experiments that would not be possible with currents that are all inwardly-directed.

Therefore, we deemed it logical and necessary to show the pharmacology using this same approach rather than applying pharmacology on all inward currents. In fact, we had performed the pharmacology both ways, but felt the approaches were redundant, so we only presented the pharmacology on the separated currents for the reason stated above. However, we have in hand all of the standard pharmacology characterization proposed by the reviewer and we have added it as <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2</xref>, along with brief presentation of the statistics and data in the Results section.

As stated above, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref> definitively rules out GABA as being directly released, since the TFLLR response is not affected in the presence of the GABA antagonist. The same strategy, using a glutamate antagonist, implicates glutamate as a candidate. Therefore, we designed a protocol that would test specifically whether release of any inwardly directed current, including glutamate, was synchronized to the depolarization (i.e. immediate release). The time base in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref> reflects this specific paradigm that is completely different from that in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">4</xref>, and all the other figures, that use trains of depolarization. In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>, we use a single depolarization and analyze only the first 200 msec where a directly released transmitter action would be expected. This single action potential is not capable of activating fully the neuronal network in the way that a train of depolarization did. However, addition of TTX showed that the currents shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref> did reflect a mild activation of the neuronal network, rather than a directly released glutamate or other ionotropic receptor transmitter. We have modified the Results section once again in an effort in order to provide a clearer rationale for this approach and highlight how this paradigm is different from that in the other figures.</p></body></sub-article></article>
