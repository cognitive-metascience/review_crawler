Mutations in Kelch-like protein 41 (KLHL41) cause nemaline myopathy, a fatal muscle disorder associated with sarcomere disarray. We generated KLHL41 mutant mice, which display lethal disruption of sarcomeres and aberrant expression of muscle structural and contractile proteins, mimicking the hallmarks of the human disease. We show that KLHL41 is poly-ubiquitinated and acts, at least in part, by preventing aggregation and degradation of Nebulin, an essential component of the sarcomere. Furthermore, inhibition of KLHL41 poly-ubiquitination prevents its stabilization of nebulin, suggesting a unique role for ubiquitination in protein stabilization. These findings provide new insights into the molecular etiology of nemaline myopathy and reveal a mechanism whereby KLHL41 stabilizes sarcomeres and maintains muscle function by acting as a molecular chaperone. Similar mechanisms for protein stabilization likely contribute to the actions of other Kelch proteins.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.26439.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Together with the tendon and joints, muscles move our bones by contracting and relaxing. Muscles are formed of bundles of lengthy cells, which are made up of small units called sarcomeres. To contract, the proteins in the sarcomere need to be able to slide past each other. In healthy muscle cells, the proteins in the sarcomeres are evenly distributed in an organized pattern to make sure that the muscle can contract.</p><p>However, when some of the proteins in the sarcomere become faulty, it can lead to diseases that affect the muscles and movement. For example, in a genetic muscle disease called nemaline myopathy, the proteins in the sarcomere are no longer organized, which leads to a build-up of proteins in the muscle fiber. These protein masses form rod-like structures that are lodged in between sarcomeres, which makes it more difficult for the muscles to contract. This can cause muscle weakness, difficulties eating or breathing, and eventually death.</p><p>A common cause of nemaline myopathy is mutations in the gene that encodes the nebulin protein, which serves as a scaffold for the sarcomere assembly. Other proteins, including proteins named KLHL40 and KLHL41, have also been linked to the disease. These two proteins are both ‘Kelch’ proteins, most of which help to degrade specific proteins. However, a recent study has shown that KLHL40 actually stabilizes nebulin. As the two Kelch proteins KLHL40 and 41 are very similar in structure, scientists wanted to find out if KLHL41 plays a similar role to KLHL40.</p><p>Now, Ramirez-Martinez et al. have created genetically modified mice that lacked KLHL41. These mice showed symptoms similar to people with nemaline myopathy, in which the sarcomeres were disorganized and could not form properly. Further experiments with cells grown in the laboratory showed that KLHL41 stabilized nebulin by using a specific chemical process that usually helps to degrade proteins.</p><p>These results suggest that Kelch proteins have additional roles beyond degrading proteins and that some proteins linked to nemaline myopathy may actively prevent others from accumulating. A next step will be to find drugs that can compensate for the lack of KLHL41. A better understanding of the causes of this fatal disease will contribute towards developing better treatments.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>protein aggregation</kwd><kwd>nebulin</kwd><kwd>Kelch protein</kwd><kwd>nemaline myopathy</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>HL130253</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Olson</surname><given-names>Eric N</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>HL077439</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Olson</surname><given-names>Eric N</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>DK099653</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Olson</surname><given-names>Eric N</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>AR067294</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Olson</surname><given-names>Eric N</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000928</institution-id><institution>Welch Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>1-0025</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Olson</surname><given-names>Eric N</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>KLHL41 acts as a poly-ubiquitin dependent chaperone that prevents the formation of pathogenic nebulin aggregates associated with muscle disease.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Nemaline myopathy (NM) is one of the most severe forms of congenital myopathy, affecting ~1 in 50,000 births (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Romero et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Wallgren-Pettersson et al., 2011</xref>). NM encompasses a set of genetically heterogeneous diseases defined by the presence of rod-like structures, called nemaline bodies, in skeletal muscle fibers. Nemaline bodies are formed by the abnormal aggregation of proteins within muscle thin filaments and are associated with myofibril disorganization, reduced contractile force, mitochondrial dysfunction, and a spectrum of abnormalities ranging from mild muscle weakness to complete akinesia. There is no effective treatment for NM and mechanistic insight into the molecular basis of the disorder is lacking.</p><p>To date, mutations in 11 different genes have been linked to NM, most of which encode components of the sarcomeric thin filament, including nebulin (NEB), actin-1, tropomyosins-2 and -3, troponin-1 and leiomodin-3 (LMOD3) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Agrawal et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Cenik et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Donner et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Johnston et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Lehtokari et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Wattanasirichaigoon et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Yuen et al., 2014</xref>). Interestingly, 3 genes associated with NM, <italic>KLHL40</italic>, <italic>KLHL41</italic> and <italic>KBTBD13</italic>, encode Kelch proteins, characterized by the presence of a Kelch-repeat domain, a BTB/POZ domain involved in protein-protein interaction, and a BACK domain that binds E3 ubiquitin ligases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Geyer et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Gupta and Beggs, 2014</xref>). More than 60 different Kelch proteins have been identified (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Dhanoa et al., 2013</xref>), many of which function as substrate-specific adaptors for Cullin-3 (CUL3) E3 ubiquitin ligase, a component of the ubiquitin-proteasome system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Genschik et al., 2013</xref>). Modification of proteins by the covalent attachment of ubiquitin to lysine residues via CUL3 serves as a signal for protein degradation. However, there are also Kelch proteins that function independently of proteolysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Werner et al., 2015</xref>) and much remains to be learned about their functions.</p><p>Recently, we and others showed that loss of function of the muscle-specific Kelch protein KLHL40 in mice causes NM similar to that seen in human patients with KLHL40 mutations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Garg et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Ravenscroft et al., 2013</xref>). Unlike other Kelch proteins that promote protein degradation, KLHL40 is required for stabilization of LMOD3, an actin nucleator, and NEB, a molecular ruler that controls myofibrillogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Cenik et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Garg et al., 2014</xref>). The absence of LMOD3 or NEB causes lethal NM and severe disruption of skeletal muscle sarcomeric structure and function in mice and humans, confirming the essential roles of these proteins in maintenance of sarcomere integrity. KLHL40 shares 52% identity with KLHL41, which is also expressed in a muscle-specific manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Taylor et al., 1998</xref>). Similarly, KLHL41 mutations in humans have been associated with NM, and morpholino knockdown of KLHL41 in zebrafish causes NM-like abnormalities with aberrant myofibril formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Gupta et al., 2013</xref>). However, the molecular functions of KLHL41 and the mechanistic basis of these abnormalities have not been determined.</p><p>Here, we describe a mouse model of severe NM caused by a loss of function mutation in the <italic>Klhl41</italic> gene. Although KLHL40 and 41 share high homology and muscle-specific expression, we show that their mechanisms of action are distinct. KLHL41 preferentially stabilizes NEB rather than LMOD3, and this activity is dependent on poly-ubiquitination sensed through the BTB domain of KLHL41. In the absence of KLHL41, NEB and other sarcomeric components fail to accumulate, resulting in early neonatal lethality. These findings provide new insight into the molecular etiology of NM and also reveal a previously unrecognized role for Kelch proteins in protein stabilization and chaperone activity.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Muscle-specific expression of <italic>Klhl41</italic></title><p><italic>Klhl41</italic> is expressed in a muscle-specific manner with highest levels in adult skeletal muscle relative to the heart (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A–B</xref>).

Analysis of enriched biological pathways using the Database for Annotation, Visualization and Integrated Discovery (DAVID) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Jiao et al., 2012</xref>) revealed that ‘sarcomere organization’ and ‘regulation of muscle contraction’ proteins were aberrantly down-regulated in KO mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1A</xref>). Remarkably, NEB was the second most down-regulated protein in the muscle of the KO mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). Many other down-regulated proteins in the KO mice were essential components of the sarcomere (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>), including slow skeletal muscle troponin T, myosin light chain-3, myozenin-3, and β-tropomyosin (also associated with NM). As revealed by deep sequencing of RNA transcripts (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig4sdata2">Figure 4—source data 2</xref>), the mRNAs encoding these proteins were unchanged in KO muscle. Therefore, the changes in accumulation of these proteins likely reflect post-translational mechanisms. Notably, western blot analysis showed down-regulation of NEB and only a slight decrease in LMOD3 in <italic>Klhl41</italic> KO mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>), while both NEB and LMOD3 were markedly down-regulated in <italic>Klhl40</italic> KO mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Garg et al., 2014</xref>).

We therefore generated a series of NEB<sub>frag</sub> mutants each containing a 25-residue deletion spanning the entire protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1B–C</xref>), and assessed their protein levels by western blot in the presence or absence of KLHL41. Strikingly, we observed that in the absence of KLHL41, and in contrast to the full length NEB<sub>frag</sub>, most deletion mutants could be detected even in the absence of KLHL41, albeit at lower levels than with co-expression of KLHL41 and the full length NEB<sub>frag</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref>, up). Furthermore, in the presence of KLHL41, all NEB<sub>frag</sub> deletion mutants exhibited increased protein levels compared to the full length NEB<sub>frag</sub> and they interacted with KLHL41 by co-immunoprecipitation (d5 and d6 had weaker interactions than others) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref>, bottom). NEB<sub>frag</sub> contains multiple nebulin repeats enriched in basic and aromatic amino acids (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1B–C</xref>). There are no apparent sequence differences among deletion mutants that could explain the different activities of d5 and d6 from other mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1C</xref>). The fact that multiple deletion mutants could interact with KLHL41 suggests that the nebulin repeats present in NEB<sub>frag</sub> may be sufficient for the interaction. These findings indicate that NEB<sub>frag</sub> is unlikely to be regulated by a degron recognized by an unknown E3 ligase but rather general conformational changes promote NEB<sub>frag</sub> stability.</p><p>To assess whether KLHL41 prevented NEB<sub>frag</sub> aggregation, we performed protein extraction of the insoluble fraction of transfected COS-7 cells with high detergent concentration. Surprisingly, we found that when NEB<sub>frag</sub> was expressed alone, it could be detected in the insoluble fraction, whereas co-expression of KLHL41 was sufficient to shift a portion of the NEB<sub>frag</sub> pool to the soluble fraction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D</xref>). We further validated these results by immunofluorescence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7E</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1D</xref>). NEB<sub>frag</sub> alone formed aggregates localized predominantly in the nucleus, and co-expression of KLHL41 or KLHL40 resulted in homogenous cytosolic staining. Thus, these results suggest that KLHL41 and KLHL40 can act as chaperones and prevent NEB<sub>frag</sub> aggregation.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Mutations in KLHL41 have been associated with NM in humans, but molecular understanding of the mechanism of action of KLHL41 has been lacking, despite its clinical significance. Furthermore, the unique stabilizing activity of both KLHL41 and KLHL40, which distinguishes them from most other members of the Kelch family, has not been previously explored. Our results demonstrate that KLHL41 is required for sarcomere integrity and stabilization of essential muscle structural proteins. The absence of KLHL41 in mice results in severe NM with general sarcomere disarray, accumulation of nemaline bodies and perinatal death as seen in humans with KLHL41 mutations. Our results reveal a unique pro-stabilizing function of poly-ubiquitinated KLHL41 in which it prevents NEB aggregation. A model consistent with our findings is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7F</xref>. We surmise that under normal conditions KLHL41 functions as a chaperone, preventing NEB aggregation and degradation. Loss of KLHL41 or reduced poly-ubiquitination of KLHL41 results in loss of KLHL41 activity, NEB aggregation and NM. These regulatory events suggest that KLHL41 may serve as a poly-ubiquitination sensor, offering a new layer of complexity to the abundant ubiquitin ligases and deubiquitinases resident in muscle sarcomeres.</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>KLHL41 is a poly-ubiquitin dependent chaperone</title><p>Protein ubiquitination involves the covalent attachment of the 76-amino acid ubiquitin peptide to the epsilon amino group of target lysine residues. Poly-ubiquitin chains can be formed by sequential addition of ubiquitin molecules through any of its 7 lysines (K6, K11, K27, K29, K33, K48 and K63) or the free amino group of the initial methionine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Yau and Rape, 2016</xref>). K48-linked poly-ubiquitination has been extensively characterized as the canonical signal for proteasomal degradation and most Kelch proteins whose functions have been explored mediate protein degradation via E3 ligase-dependent poly-ubiquitination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Furukawa and Xiong, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Liu et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Shibata et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Xu et al., 2003</xref>). However, new nonproteolytic roles for Kelch proteins are also being reported. For example, KLHL20 controls trafficking of the actin stabilizing protein Coronin 7 via K33-linked poly-ubiquitination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Yuan et al., 2014</xref>), while mono-ubiquitination NOLC1 and TCOLF by KBTBD8 regulates translation and cell fate specification (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Werner et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>Our findings highlight a unique protein stabilizing function of KLHL41. In contrast to other Kelch proteins, KLHL41 stabilizes its partner, NEB, instead of marking it for degradation. Inhibition of the two major degradation pathways (the ubiquitin-proteasome and the lysosome) was not sufficient to rescue NEB<sub>frag</sub> levels in the absence of KLHL41, suggesting that KLHL41 does not regulate another E3 ligase responsible for NEB degradation. Intriguingly, inhibition of poly-ubiquitination abolished the ability of KLHL41 to stabilize NEB<sub>frag</sub>. Additionally, we could not identify a degron responsible for NEB<sub>frag</sub> instability in the absence of KLHL41 but rather, multiple mutants were stable when short sequences of the protein were deleted. These results suggest that KLHL41 stabilizes NEB<sub>frag</sub> by regulating its folding rather than by degrading an unknown protein that might decrease NEB<sub>frag</sub> levels. Specific inhibition of K48-linked poly-ubiquitination decreased NEB<sub>frag</sub> stabilization by KLHL41. Besides its canonical role in degradation, K48-linked poly-ubiquitination has been implicated in substrate stabilization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Flick et al., 2006</xref>) and segregation of ubiquitinated proteins from their partners (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Ramadan et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Rape et al., 2001</xref>). In contrast to those studies, however, KLHL41 itself is ubiquitinated instead of its partner. Components of the E3 ubiquitin ligase complex can be self-ubiquitinated during the transfer of ubiquitin to their substrates or as a negative feedback loop to downregulate their protein levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Fang et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Nuber et al., 1998</xref>), but the requirement of Kelch protein poly-ubiquitination for protein stabilization constitutes a novel regulatory mechanism.</p><p>We speculate that K48-linked poly-ubiquitination of KLHL41 could regulate protein-protein interactions between the BTB domain and other partners. K48-linked poly-ubiquitination can act as a recognition signal for CDC48, a chaperone required to extract misfolded proteins from the ER during ER-associated protein degradation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Jentsch and Rumpf, 2007</xref>). Additional work will be required to understand how KLHL41 activity is regulated in a poly-ubiquitin dependent manner.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>KLHL40 and KLHL41 stabilize their partners via distinct mechanisms</title><p>Although KLHL40 and 41 share extensive homology, and loss of either gene causes NM, our results indicate that these two proteins possess both overlapping and distinct functions. Loss of either KLHL40 or KLHL41 leads to severe NM in humans, whereas <italic>Klhl41</italic> KO mice present earlier onset of muscle dysfunction than <italic>Klhl40</italic> KO mice. While both proteins stabilize NEB, KLHL41 stabilizes LMOD3 at lower levels than KLHL40. Considering that the loss of function phenotype of KLHL41 is stronger than that of KLHL40, it is likely KLHL41 is more critical for sarcomere integrity by interacting with additional partners.</p><p>The stabilization of LMOD3 by KLHL40 occurs through a mechanism distinct from the stabilization of NEB, as inhibition of poly-ubiquitination does not decrease LMOD3 protein levels in the presence of KLHL40 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Garg et al., 2014</xref>). Furthermore, in the absence of KLHL40, LMOD3 levels are increased by proteasome inhibition. KLHL40 and KLHL41 are highly similar in their BTB and BACK domains, which could explain why both are sensitive to poly-ubiquitination. However, they present differences within the Kelch repeats, which likely enables them to discriminate between different substrates. It is currently unknown whether other Kelch proteins, especially those closely related to KLHL41, act as chaperones or can stabilize their partners in a poly-ubiquitin dependent manner. Of special interest is KBTBD13, the only other Kelch protein associated with NM. Further work is needed to understand if KBTBD13 acts through a similar mechanism to that of KLHL40 and KLHL41.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Therapeutic implications</title><p>NM and other protein aggregation myopathies are characterized by formation of pathogenic protein inclusions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Goebel and Blaschek, 2011</xref>).

Briefly, 80% confluent Platinum E cells (Cell Biolabs) on 15 cm plates were transfected with pBx-3xFLAG-HA-GFP or pBx-3xFLAG-HA-KLHL41 using Fugene 6 (Promega) at a 3:1 DNA to Fugene 6 ratio according to manufacturer’s directions. Viral media were collected 24, 36 and 48 hr after transfection and filtered through a 0.45 µm syringe filter (Corning). Polybrene was added to the media at a final concentration of 6 µg/mL. Media were added to 80% confluent C2C12 myoblasts (American Type Culture Collection) in growth media (DMEM with 10% fetal bovine serum and 1% antibiotic-antimycotic) (Life Technologies). C2C12 cells were then washed with PBS and differentiated for 5 days with differentiation media (DMEM with 2% horse serum and 1% antibiotic-antimycotic) (Life Technologies). Protein was collected from C2C12 myotubes by washing cells and then collecting them into 5 mL of PBS by scraping cells with a sterile cell lifter. Protein extraction was done in IP-A buffer according to standard procedures. Anti-FLAG M2 affinity gel (A2220, Sigma) and EZView Red anti-HA affinity gel (E6779, Sigma) were used for pull-down after equilibration in IP-A buffer. 3xFLAG peptide (F4799, Sigma) and HA peptide (I2149, Sigma) were used for elution in IP-A buffer as per manufacturer’s instructions. IP-B buffer (50 mM Tris, 700 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 1% Triton) was used to wash beads before elution. Silver staining and peptide identification were performed as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Garg et al., 2014</xref>). C2C12 and PE cells were tested for mycoplasma contamination with Universal Mycoplasma Detection Kit (30–1012K, ATCC) and they were negative for mycoplasma.</p></sec><sec id="s4-10"><title>Protein analysis in COS-7 cells</title><p>COS-7 cells (American Type Culture Collection) in 60 mm dishes were transfected at 75% confluency using Fugene 6 (Promega) as per manufacturer’s directions. A total of 5 ug of DNA was used for each transfection. 48 hr after transfection, cells were washed with PBS and lysed in IP-A for 15 min. Lysates were rotated for 1 hr at 4°C and centrifuged at 20,817 x <italic>g</italic> for 15 min. The pellet was discarded. Standard SDS-PAGE was performed. FLAG M2 (F1804, Sigma, 1:5,000), mouse c-myc (R950-25, ThermoFisher, 1:5,000), rabbit c-myc (sc-789, Santa Cruz, 1:500), HA (32–6700, ThermoFisher, 1:5,000), GAPDH (MAB374, EMD Millipore 1:20,000), LC3 (NB100-2220, Novus Biologicals, 1:2,000) and fibrillarin (ab5821, Abcam, 1:1,000) antibodies were used for blotting.

For sample preparation, each sample was added 8 M urea in 50 mM ammonium bicarbonate, pH 8.0 at a constant 10 µL per mg of tissue. Samples were then subjected to mechanical disruption using a Tissue Tearer followed by 2 rounds of probe sonication on ice at 30% power. Samples were spun to remove insoluble material and 4 µL was removed and subjected to Bradford assay to determine protein quantity. From each sample, 100 µg of total protein was removed and concentrations were normalized. Samples were then diluted in 1.6M urea with 50 mM ammonium bicarbonate. All samples were reduced for 20 min at 80°C with 10 mM dithiothreitol and alkylated for 40 min at room temperature with 25 mM iodoacetamide. Trypsin was added to a 1:50 ratio (enzyme to total protein) and allowed to proceed for 18 hr at 37°C. Samples were then acidified with 0.2% TFA (pH 2.5) and subjected to C18 SPE cleanup (Sep-Pak 50 mg bed). Following elution, all samples were frozen and lyophilized to dryness.</p><p>For TMT labeling, each sample was resuspended in 100 µL 200 mM triethylamonium bicarbonate, pH 8.0. Fresh TMT reagents (0.8 mg for each 6-plex reagent) were resuspended in 100 µL acetonitrile. 50 µL of each TMT tag was added to a specific sample and incubated for 4 hr at room temperature. Afterwards, 8 µL 5% hydroxylamine was added to quench the reaction. 20% of each sample were combined at 1:1:1:1:1:1 ratio and was then lyophilized to dryness prior to LC/LC-MS/MS analysis.</p><p>Quantitative two-dimensional liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC/LC-MS/MS) was performed on approximately 5 µg of protein digest per sample. The method uses two-dimensional liquid chromatography in a high-low pH reverse phase/reverse phase configuration on a nanoAcquity UPLC system (Waters Corp.) coupled to a Thermo QExactive Plus high resolution accurate mass tandem mass spectrometer with nanoelectrospray ionization. Peptides were first trapped at 2 ul/min at 97/3 v/v water/MeCN in 20 mM ammonium formate (pH 10) on a 5 µm XBridge BEH130 C18 300 µm x 50 mm column (Waters Corp.). A series of step-elutions of MeCN at 2 µl/min was used to elute peptides from the 1<sup>st</sup> dimension column. Ten steps of 14.0%, 16.0%, 17.3%, 18.5%, 20.3%, 22.0%, 23.5%, 25.0%, 30.0% and 50.0% MeCN were utilized for the analyses; these percentages were optimized for delivery of an approximately equal load to the 2<sup>nd</sup> dimension column for each fraction. For 2<sup>nd</sup> dimension separation, the elution of the 1<sup>st</sup> dimension was first diluted 10-fold online with 99.8/0.1/0.1 v/v/v water/MeCN/formic acid and trapped on a 5µ Symmetry C18 180 µm x 20 mm trapping column (Waters Corp.). The 2<sup>nd</sup> dimension separations were performed using a 1.7 µm Acquity BEH130 C18 75mmx250mm column (Waters Corp.) using a 90 min gradient of 3% to 25% acetonitrile with 0.1% formic acid at a flow rate of 400 nL/min with a column temperature of 55°C. Data collection on the QExactive Plus mass spectrometer was performed in a data-dependent acquisition mode of acquisition with a r = 70,000 (at m/z 200) full MS scan from m/z 375–1600 with a target AGC value of 1e6 ions followed by 20 MS/MS scans at r = 17,500 (at m/s 200) at a target AGC value of 5e4 ions. A 30 s dynamic exclusion was employed to increase depth of coverage. The total analysis cycle time for each sample injection was approximately 2 hr.</p><p>Following the 10 LC-MS/MS analyses, raw data were processed by Protein Discoverer to create MGF files. These MS/MS data were searched against a SwissProt_Mouse database within Mascot Server (Matrix Science) that also contained a reversed-sequence ‘decoy’ entry for each protein for false positive rate determination. Because mouse nebulin (NEB) is not a reviewed entry in SwisProt_Mouse, the unreviewed entry E9Q1W3_MOUSE was manually included in the analysis. Search tolerances were 5ppm precursor and 0.02 Da product ions with full trypsin protease rules and up to two missed cleavages. Search results were imported to Scaffold Q + S v4.4.6 (Proteome Software) and data was annotated at a Protein False Discovery Rate of 1.0%.</p><p>The overall dataset yielded identifications for 23,910 TMT labeled peptides corresponding to 4,418 TMT labeled proteins. Only peptides uniquely identified to a protein were considered. To normalize the six different channels to account for differences in labeling efficiencies and mixing percentages, the summed intensity for each channel was calculated and then normalized to the 126 channel. Then, protein level intensities were generated by summing all of the unique peptide intensities to that protein.

Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, one of whom, Amy Wagers is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors and the evaluation has been overseen by Amy Wagers and Didier Stainier as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Alan Beggs (Reviewer #2).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>Nemaline myopathy (NM) is congenital disease that effects sarcomere function and muscle defects. Several disease alleles have been mapped for NM, and these include two Kelch domain containing proteins that are likely substrate adaptors for the Cul3-based Cullin Ring E3 ubiquitin ligase. The molecular contribution of KLHL41 to NM disease has not yet been determined.</p><p>This manuscript describes the generation and analysis of KLHL41-deficient mice, in which expression and function of KLHL41 is ablated. The authors show that KLHL41 knockout mice develop a severe and fatal myopathy that resembles human NM, and that this phenotype is associated with a failure to stabilize Nebulin, and likely other proteins involved in maintaining sarcomere integrity, in the KO muscle cells. They further provide evidence that the normal role of KLHL41 in stabilizing Nebulin depends upon polyubiquitination of a particular lysine residue in the BTB domain of the protein, and suggest a somewhat unexpected chaperone function for the protein in this context. Finally, they draw distinctions in the functions of KLHL41 with respect to its close homolog KLHL40 (also mutated in patients with NM), arguing that these two Kelch protein possess both common and distinct targets for their actions (with 41 targeting only Nebulin, and 40 targeting both Nebulin and LMOD3 for stabilization).</p><p>Overall, the study is logically designed, carefully executed and thoughtfully presented. Most conclusions are well justified by the data presented and provide an important advance in our understanding of the biology of kelch proteins in normal and diseased muscle. However, the reviewers did raise concerns about two aspects of the authors model: (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">1</xref>) a failure to consider or exclude an alternative model in which KLHL41 ubiquitinates and degrades a third protein, which would normally function to ubiquitinate and degrade Nebulin, and (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">2</xref>) a lack of strong evidence indicating that KLHL41 does not interact with LMOD3. These concerns are further articulated below, along with suggestions for experiments to address them and for improving the clarity and transparency of the presentation.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The most significant concern with this study is that the authors fail to rule out a very simple, alternative hypothesis. That is, that KLHL41 is an E3 ubiquitin ligase for a second E3 enzyme that promotes the degradation of NEB. Thus, when KLHL41 is overexpressed, this leads to the ubiquitin mediated, k48-chain dependent, degradation of another E3, and that in the absence of this second enzyme NEB accumulates to high levels. Notably, there are many examples of E3 ligase cross-talk in the ubiquitin system (e.g. the cell cycle E3 APC/C controls the degradation of SKP2, an adaptor for the SCF). The authors need to address this by identifying the binding site (degron) between KLHL41 and NEB that controls the regulation. When that degron site is mutated the regulation should be lost, akin to mutating a kinase consensus motif thereby blocking signaling. As an alternative, they might show that in vitro KLHL41 can ubiquitylate NEB, which would be supportive of the direct regulation they propose, but not as convincing as the degron experiment. As the authors' conclusion that K48 linked ubiquitination is driving protein stability and not degradation through the proteasome is highly unusual, and there are few if any concrete examples of this happening, the data supporting this conclusion should be very strong.</p><p>2) There is a correlation between KLHL41 being ubiquitylated and NEB being stabilized.</p><p>However, there is little reason to directly connect these two phenomena. Many, if not most, CRL substrate receptors are ubiquitylated by their respective E3s. KLHL41 could be ubiquitylated, and NEB degradation could be dependent on K48 ubiquitylation, but these two things might have nothing to do with each-other. As stated above, a much more simple hypothesis is that KLHL41 targets an NEB ligase for degradation.</p><p>3) The authors' conclusion that KLHL41 fails to stabilize LMOD3, which represents the sole evidence presented for a function distinct from that of KLHL40 is somewhat unconvincing. It appears from the blot in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref> that KLHL41 does stabilize LMOD3 to some degree, although clearly not to the same level as KLHL40. Adding to the concern, while the authors state that they did not see co-immunoprecipation of KLHL41 with LMOD3, this data is not actually included in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>. It would also have been helpful if they had performed some sort of immunodetection (e.g. Western) of the TAP-isolated proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>) to confirm the lack of LMOD3 association in this study. Anyway, since the distinctive interactions of KLHL41 is presented as a major conclusion of the paper, and depends almost entirely on whether or not stabilization of LMOD3 occurs, the authors should provide additional evidence to strengthen these data, or temper their conclusions. Finally, though perhaps not necessary for the current manuscript, an experiment in which the KLHL40 and KLHL41 domains suspected by the authors as mediating their distinct activities are swapped and analyzed for changes in NEB/LMOD3 stabilization capacity would add significantly to the study.</p><p>4) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>: What criteria were applied to select the proteins for display in the heat map? Was there are fold-change threshold or other quantitative criterion? The statement is made that &quot;A remarkable number of up-regulated proteins were involved in ubiquitination,…&quot; (subsection “KLHL41 is required to maintain normal levels of sarcomeric proteins in vivo”). Have, or can, the authors apply a statistical method such as DAVID or other form of Gene Set Enrichment Analysis to support this, and are there other functional groups of proteins exhibiting unusual degrees of up or down regulation?</p><p>5) The authors state in subsection “KLHL41 is required to maintain normal levels of sarcomeric proteins in vivo” that NEB is the second most down-regulated protein in KLHL41 KO muscle, but it appears to be farther down the list in their excel file? What about the 12 other proteins (matn2, matn1, lgmn, etc)?</p><p>6) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref> – data and experimental details presented are insufficient for the conclusions drawn and there is no description of these studies in the methods section. How many different litters are represented in the table? How many different sets of parents? Data also lack statistical assessment evaluating divergence from expected values, and specific phenotypes observed/assayed in mice (e.g. premature death, runting, etc.) of each genotype should be included in the table together with the genotype.</p><p>7) It is not clear what the frequency and distribution of sarcomeric disarray, Z line streaming, and electron dense inclusions is in the examined tissues in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref> and the supplement <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>. Each of these findings may often be seen in normal muscles. The authors should provide some semi-quantitative estimation or more detailed description of their nature and abundance in KLHL41 KO muscles relative to WT.</p><p>8) NEB transcript levels should be confirmed by qPCR. While NEB transcripts were found in the RNA seq data, the conclusions here hinge on the existence of post-translational mechanism. It says this data is in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>, but only lmod3 is checked there.</p><p>9) An immunoblot of NEB in muscles from control and KO mice is never shown. This is essential as it would confirm that NEB is in fact downregulated after KLHL41 KO.</p><p>10) Consistent with their predictions and mass spec data, the authors show in many experiments that KLHL41 overexpression increases the levels of NEB. It is essential that they also show that KLHL41 depletion reduces NEB levels, and this should be done using multiple RNAi reagents (or crispr KO).</p><p>11) The authors should clarify how <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D</xref> reveal a role for Klhl41 in shifting the pool of NEB from the insoluble pellet to the soluble fraction. How is this distinguished from the stabilization of NEB seen in all of the previous figures? For the IF in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D</xref>, this would require an enormous amount of normalization since the total fluorescence should be significantly higher in the presence of KLHL41. If this was done, how was it achieved?</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were requested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for resubmitting your work entitled &quot;KLHL41 stabilizes skeletal muscle sarcomeres by nonproteolytic ubiquitination&quot; for further consideration at <italic>eLife</italic>, and sorry for the delay in the reviewing process. Your revised article has been favorably evaluated by Didier Stainier (Senior editor), a Reviewing editor (Amy Wagers), and two reviewers.</p><p>The manuscript has been provisionally accepted, but there are a few remaining issues that need to be addressed before final acceptance and publication, as outlined below. All of these issues should be addressable by simple revision to the text.</p><p>1) The authors demonstrate clearly that KLHL41 expression positively modulates the abundance of NEB. Mechanistically, the argue that KLHL41 gets ubiquitylated (which they show clearly) and that this in turns increases its ability to rescue NEB for an insoluble material, suggesting it acts as a chaperone and this is dependent on its k48-linked ubiquitylation. While the data demonstrating that KLHL41 enhances NEB levels, preventing its aggregation and that this depends on ubiquitin chain formation is compelling, the current manuscript falls short of showing that this is specifically dependent on KLHL41 ubiquitylation. Rather than showing that the &quot;stabilizing activity of KLHL41 is dependent on K48-linked poly-ubiquitination of KLHL41.&quot; (quoted from the abstract), the data actually show that KLHL41 is ubiquitylated on K48 AND that KLHL41 stabilizes NEB. This is an important distinction, and, particularly as the authors are proposing a largely new mechanism, they should tone down the language they use (throughout the paper) to make this mechanistic argument.</p><p>2) In Subsection “KLHL41 and KLHL40 stabilize different substrates despite their high homology”, the authors state that &quot;These results indicate that KLHL41 stabilizes NEB<sub>frag</sub> but not LMOD3, confirming the functional distinctions between KLHL40 and KLHL41.&quot;; however, as discussed in the prior review and apparent from the data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>, KLHL41 stabilizes both NEB and LMOD3, although its stabilizing activity for LMOD3 is not as robust as that of KLHL40. Similarly, in subsection “KLHL40 and KLHL41 stabilize their partners via distinct mechanisms”: &quot;only KLHL40 stabilizes LMOD3 significantly&quot; – it is unclear from the data that the modest stabilization of LMOD3 by KLHL41 is insignificant. These sentences should be revised to more accurately represent the data.</p><p>3) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref> – HA-Ub-KO seems to be labeled KO instead of K0 (zero), which could be confusing. It is labeled correctly in the other panels (B and C). Also, it does not appear that Ub-K0 is overexpressed in the absence of KLHL41 in this experiment, in contrast to what is stated in the text (subsection “KLHL41 stabilizing activity is regulated through K48-linked poly-ubiquitination of the BTB domain”).</p><p>4) Change KO to K0 in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref> also.</p><p>5) Subsection “KLHL41 prevents aggregation of NEB<sub>frag</sub> “states that &quot;all mutants exhibited increased protein levels in the presence of KLHL41…&quot;, and references <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref>; however, I do not see such data in this figure. The top blot does not evaluate protein abundance of the deletion mutants in the presence of KLHL41, and the bottom blot is an IP, which cannot separate changes in protein stability from differences in association with KLHL41. Please revise the text or add the relevant data.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.26439.024</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>Essential revisions:</italic> </p><p> <italic>1) The most significant concern with this study is that the authors fail to rule out a very simple, alternative hypothesis.

However, our data argues against the existence of another E3 enzyme. If a second E3 enzyme was being degraded by KLHL41, inhibition of protein degradation would be sufficient to stabilize NEB<sub>frag</sub> even in the absence of KLHL41. However, NEB<sub>frag</sub> failed to accumulate by addition of MG132 or overexpression of Ubiquitin(K0), which precludes the involvement of another E3 enzyme (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">6D</xref>).</p><p>Furthermore, in an attempt to identify a potential degron in NEB<sub>frag</sub>, we generated NEB<sub>frag</sub> mutants with small deletions spanning the whole protein and tested their stability with and without KLHL41 (revised <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref> and revised <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1B-C</xref>). Our results show most mutants were stable in the absence of KLHL41, indicating that there is no degron being targeted by an unknown E3 ubiquitin ligase. Moreover, the fact that most deletion mutants are stable indicates that KLHL41 stabilizes NEB by a nonproteolytic mechanism.</p><p> <italic>2) There is a correlation between KLHL41 being ubiquitylated and NEB being stabilized.</italic> </p><p><italic>However, there is little reason to directly connect these two phenomena.

As stated above, a much more simple hypothesis is that KLHL41 targets an NEB ligase for degradation.</italic> </p><p>We agree these data may seem correlative but we have data to show the connection. As seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E</xref>, deletion of the BTB of KLHL41 (ΔBTB) is able to rescue NEB levels in the presence of Ubiquitin(K0) while full length KLHL41 cannot. This observation the BTB domain. We highlighted this observation in the revised Results.</p><p>As mentioned in Point 1, we addressed the possibility of a NEB ligase by using NEB deletion mutants (revised <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref>), and observed that most deletions rendered the protein stable in the absence of KLHL41. These findings, in addition to the results showing NEB<sub>frag</sub> aggregation in the absence of KLHL41 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figures 7D and 7E</xref>) support KLHL41 acting as a chaperone. These points were included in the revised Discussion section.</p><p> <italic>3) The authors' conclusion that KLHL41 fails to stabilize LMOD3, which represents the sole evidence presented for a function distinct from that of KLHL40 is somewhat unconvincing. It appears from the blot in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref> that KLHL41 does stabilize LMOD3 to some degree, although clearly not to the same level as KLHL40. Adding to the concern, while the authors state that they did not see co-immunoprecipation of KLHL41 with LMOD3, this data is not actually included in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>.

However, as the reviewer observed, this increase is not to the same extent as seen with KLHL40. We further validated the stabilization of LMOD3 by KLHL41 in vivo by western blot analysis of WT and KO muscle for LMOD3 (revised <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). We observed a slight decrease in LMOD3 levels in KLHL41 KO, but not as dramatic as in KLHL40 KO, which shows an almost complete loss of LMOD3. We think that KLHL41 may stabilize LMOD3 at lower efficiency than KLHL40. We modified the manuscript to reflect these considerations.</p><p>We modified and optimized our co-immunoprecipitation experiments but were still unable to detect interaction between LMOD3 and KLHL41 in vitro (revised <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4—figure supplement 3B</xref>). As previously reported (Garg et al., 2014), LMOD3 protein levels can be partially rescued in vitro by proteasome inhibition whereas NEB<sub>frag</sub> is still unstable after treatment, which suggests that the stabilization of these proteins may occur through different pathways (protection from degradation versus misfolding). The lack of a direct interaction between LMOD3 and KLHL41 and the sensitivity of LMOD3 protein levels to proteasome inhibition indicate that in this case, LMOD3 stabilization could occur, at least partially, by degradation of another E3 ligase.</p><p>We analyzed KLHL40-KLHL41 chimeras as suggested by the reviewers. However, some constructs were not as stable as the original proteins, so we are not including these data in the revised manuscript.</p><p> <italic>4) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>: What criteria were applied to select the proteins for display in the heat map? Was there are fold-change threshold or other quantitative criterion? The statement is made that &quot;A remarkable number of up-regulated proteins were involved in ubiquitination,…&quot; (subsection “KLHL41 is required to maintain normal levels of sarcomeric proteins</italic> in vivo<italic>”). Have, or can, the authors apply a statistical method such as DAVID or other form of Gene Set Enrichment Analysis to support this, and are there other functional groups of proteins exhibiting unusual degrees of up or down regulation?</italic> </p><p>We apologize for the confusion. For heat map display, we selected an arbitrary threshold of ± 1.3 fold change. In the revised manuscript, we also rearranged the heat map using Morpheus (https://software.broadinstitute.org/morpheus/) and expanded the figure legends for easier comprehension (revised <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>).</p><p>We performed DAVID analysis on the differentially expressed proteins (revised <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>). Among others, we identified “sarcomere organization” and “regulation of muscle contraction” as enriched pathways in the down-regulated proteins, whereas “protein ubiquitination involved in ubiquitin-dependent catabolic process” and “response to unfolded protein” were enriched in the up-regulated proteins. As indicated in the revised Results section, we referenced the DAVID analysis when discussing functional groups of proteins being regulated.</p><p> <italic>5) The authors state in subsection “KLHL41 is required to maintain normal levels of sarcomeric proteins</italic> in vivo<italic>” that NEB is the second most down-regulated protein in KLHL41 KO muscle, but it appears to be farther down the list in their excel file? What about the 12 other proteins (matn2, matn1, lgmn, etc)?</italic> </p><p>We apologize for the confusion. We rearranged the Excel file from most down-regulated (KLHL41) to most up-regulated (HIST1H1D) and modified the heat map (revised <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>) with Morpheus (https://software.broadinstitute.org/morpheus/).</p><p>We decided to focus on the regulation of NEB by KLHL41 because mutations in NEB are reported to be the main cause of nemaline myopathy. For that reason, we have not examined the role of the proteins indicated by the reviewer but agree that they may be interesting for future studies.</p><p> <italic>6) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref> – data and experimental details presented are insufficient for the conclusions drawn and there is no description of these studies in the methods section. How many different litters are represented in the table? How many different sets of parents? Data also lack statistical assessment evaluating divergence from expected values, and specific phenotypes observed/assayed in mice (e.g. premature death, runting, etc.) of each genotype should be included in the table together with the genotype.</italic> </p><p>We did not document phenotypic or histological observations other than premature death. Since these data are not essential to our conclusions and may be more appropriate for another study, we removed these data from the manuscript.</p><p> <italic>7) It is not clear what the frequency and distribution of sarcomeric disarray, Z line streaming, and electron dense inclusions is in the examined tissues in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref> and the supplement <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>. Each of these findings may often be seen in normal muscles. The authors should provide some semi-quantitative estimation or more detailed description of their nature and abundance in KLHL41 KO muscles relative to WT.</italic> </p><p>We quantified the number of protein aggregates (nemaline bodies) in WT and KO for a semi-quantitative assessment of abnormalities in muscle ultrastructure and included these data in revised <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>.</p><p> <italic>8) NEB transcript levels should be confirmed by qPCR. While NEB transcripts were found in the RNA seq data, the conclusions here hinge on the existence of post-translational mechanism. It says this data is in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>, but only lmod3 is checked there.</italic> </p><p>We included data comparing Neb mRNA levels in WT and KO by qRT-PCR (revised <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2C</xref>). No significant differences were found.</p><p> <italic>9) An immunoblot of NEB in muscles from control and KO mice is never shown. This is essential as it would confirm that NEB is in fact downregulated after KLHL41 KO.</italic> </p><p>In addition to proteomics data, we performed western blot analysis from WT and KO mice. We observed a reduction in NEB levels in KO mice (revised <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). This and the previous results confirm that NEB is a target of KLHL41 and it is downregulated post-translationally in <italic>Klhl41</italic> KO mice.</p><p> <italic>10) Consistent with their predictions and mass spec data, the authors show in many experiments that KLHL41 overexpression increases the levels of NEB. It is essential that they also show that KLHL41 depletion reduces NEB levels, and this should be done using multiple RNAi reagents (or crispr KO).</italic> </p><p>We performed western blot analysis for NEB from WT and KO mice. Since we observed a reduction in NEB levels in KO mice (revised <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>), we have shown that KLHL41 depletion reduces NEB levels making it redundant to perform RNAi knockdown or CRISPR KO in cell lines.</p><p> <italic>11) The authors should clarify how <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7c</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D</xref> reveal a role for Klhl41 in shifting the pool of NEB from the insoluble pellet to the soluble fraction. How is this distinguished from the stabilization of NEB seen in all of the previous figures? For the IF in 7D, this would require an enormous amount of normalization since the total fluorescence should be significantly higher in the presence of KLHL41. If this was done, how was it achieved?</italic></p><p>We apologize for any confusion. In our previous study of KLHL40 (Garg et al., 2014), we only examined NEB<sub>frag</sub> protein levels in the soluble fraction. Because we could only detect NEB<sub>frag</sub> in the presence of KLHL40, we concluded that NEB<sub>frag</sub> protein was stabilized by an unknown mechanism (either protection from degradation, chaperone activity or both). In revised <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D</xref> (formerly <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref>), we detected NEB<sub>frag</sub> in the insoluble pellet, which correlates with the nuclear aggregates observed by immunofluorescence in revised <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7E</xref> (formerly <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D</xref>). In the presence of KLHL41, these aggregates disappear and a fraction of NEB<sub>frag</sub> shifts to the soluble fraction. Based on these observations, we concluded that KLHL41 stabilizes NEB<sub>frag</sub> because it prevents NEB<sub>frag</sub> aggregation, which makes it more soluble and detectable in the soluble fraction.</p><p>Regarding normalization and differences between immunofluorescence and western blots, the total levels of NEB<sub>frag</sub> are higher in both experiments in the presence of KLHL41 compared to NEB<sub>frag</sub> alone. To assess total levels of NEB<sub>frag</sub> by western blot analysis, the intensities from soluble and insoluble fractions must be added, as the pellet was solubilized after the soluble fraction was obtained, which reflects the changes also observed by immunofluorescence. We modified the text to clarify this point in the Figure legends (revised <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D</xref>).</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were requested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p><italic>The manuscript has been provisionally accepted, but there are a few remaining issues that need to be addressed before final acceptance and publication, as outlined below. All of these issues should be addressable by simple revision to the text.</italic> </p><p> <italic>1) The authors demonstrate clearly that KLHL41 expression positively modulates the abundance of NEB. Mechanistically, the argue that KLHL41 gets ubiquitylated (which they show clearly) and that this in turns increases its ability to rescue NEB for an insoluble material, suggesting it acts as a chaperone and this is dependent on its k48-linked ubiquitylation. While the data demonstrating that KLHL41 enhances NEB levels, preventing its aggregation and that this depends on ubiquitin chain formation is compelling, the current manuscript falls short of showing that this is specifically dependent on KLHL41 ubiquitylation. Rather than showing that the &quot;stabilizing activity of KLHL41 is dependent on K48-linked poly-ubiquitination of KLHL41.&quot; (quoted from the abstract), the data actually show that KLHL41 is ubiquitylated on K48 AND that KLHL41 stabilizes NEB. This is an important distinction, and, particularly as the authors are proposing a largely new mechanism, they should tone down the language they use (throughout the paper) to make this mechanistic argument.</italic> </p><p>We agree with the distinction and modified the manuscript to better represent our mechanistic data. While we have shown that KLHL41 is poly-ubiquitinated at the BTB domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>) and that poly-ubiquitination inhibition prevents KLHL41 activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>) in a BTB-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E</xref>), the evidence for the role K48-linked ubiquitination of KLHL41 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>) requires further work. To reflect these considerations, we have modified the manuscript: Abstract, Introduction, subsection “KLHL41 stabilizing activity is regulated through K48-linked poly-ubiquitination of the BTB domain “, Discussion and legend for <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>.</p><p> <italic>2) in Subsection “KLHL41 and KLHL40 stabilize different substrates despite their high homology”, the authors state that &quot;These results indicate that KLHL41 stabilizes NEBfrag but not LMOD3, confirming the functional distinctions between KLHL40 and KLHL41.&quot;; however, as discussed in the prior review and apparent from the data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>, KLHL41 stabilizes both NEB and LMOD3, although its stabilizing activity for LMOD3 is not as robust as that of KLHL40. Similarly, in subsection “KLHL40 and KLHL41 stabilize their partners via distinct mechanisms”: &quot;only KLHL40 stabilizes LMOD3 significantly&quot; – it is unclear from the data that the modest stabilization of LMOD3 by KLHL41 is insignificant. These sentences should be revised to more accurately represent the data.</italic> </p><p>We agree with the observation. We modified both statements to indicate that LMOD3 is stabilized by KLHL41 albeit at lower levels than by KLHL40 (subsection “KLHL41 and KLHL40 stabilize different substrates despite their high homology “and subsection “KLHL40 and KLHL41 stabilize their partners via distinct mechanisms”) and legend for <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>.</p><p> <italic>3) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref> – HA-Ub-KO seems to be labeled KO instead of K0 (zero), which could be confusing. It is labeled correctly in the other panels (B and C). Also, it does not appear that Ub-K0 is overexpressed in the absence of KLHL41 in this experiment, in contrast to what is stated in the text (subsection “KLHL41 stabilizing activity is regulated through K48-linked poly-ubiquitination of the BTB domain”).</italic> </p><p>We corrected the labels for <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>. We deleted the statement about Ub-K0 overexpression in the absence of KLHL41 for clarification (subsection “KLHL41 stabilizing activity is regulated through K48-linked poly-ubiquitination of the BTB domain”).</p><p><italic>4) Change KO to K0 in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref> also.</italic> </p><p>We corrected the labels for <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>.</p><p> <italic>5) Subsection “KLHL41 prevents aggregation of NEB<sub>frag</sub> “states that &quot;all mutants exhibited increased protein levels in the presence of KLHL41…&quot;, and references <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref>; however, I do not see such data in this figure. The top blot does not evaluate protein abundance of the deletion mutants in the presence of KLHL41, and the bottom blot is an IP, which cannot separate changes in protein stability from differences in association with KLHL41. Please revise the text or add the relevant data.</italic> </p><p>We agree we did not analyze NEB deletion mutants in the presence or absence of KLHL41 in the same western blot gel. However, both experiments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref> up and bottom) include full length NEBfrag+KLHL41 co-expression. We revised the text and compared each experiment to that control (subsection “KLHL41 prevents aggregation of NEBfrag “).</p></body></sub-article></article>
