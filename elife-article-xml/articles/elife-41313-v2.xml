pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.41313.001</object-id><p>Cellular actin assembly is controlled at the barbed ends of actin filaments, where capping protein (CP) limits polymerization. Twinfilin is a conserved in vivo binding partner of CP, yet the significance of this interaction has remained a mystery. Here, we discover that the C-terminal tail of Twinfilin harbors a CP-interacting (CPI) motif, identifying it as a novel CPI-motif protein. Twinfilin and the CPI-motif protein CARMIL have overlapping binding sites on CP. Further, Twinfilin binds competitively with CARMIL to CP, protecting CP from barbed-end displacement by CARMIL. Twinfilin also accelerates dissociation of the CP inhibitor V-1, restoring CP to an active capping state. Knockdowns of Twinfilin and CP each cause similar defects in cell morphology, and elevated Twinfilin expression rescues defects caused by CARMIL hyperactivity. Together, these observations define Twinfilin as the first ‘pro-capping’ ligand of CP and lead us to propose important revisions to our understanding of the CP regulatory cycle.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.41313.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Plant and animal cells are supported by skeleton-like structures that can grow and shrink beneath the cell membrane, pushing and pulling on the edges of the cell. This scaffolding network – known as the cytoskeleton – contains long strands, or filaments, made from many identical copies of a protein called actin. The shape of the actin proteins allows them to slot together, end-to-end, and allows the strands to grow and shrink on-demand. When the strands are the correct length, the cell caps the growing ends with a protein known as Capping Protein. This helps to stabilize the cell’s skeleton, preventing the strands from getting any longer, or any shorter.</p><p>Proteins that interfere with the activity of Capping Protein allow the actin strands to grow or shrink. Some, like a protein called V-1, attach to Capping Protein and get in the way so that it cannot sit on the ends of the actin strands. Others, like CARMIL, bind to Capping Protein and change its shape, making it more likely to fall off the strands. So far, no one had found a partner that helps Capping Protein limit the growth of the actin cytoskeleton.</p><p>A protein called Twinfilin often appears alongside Capping Protein, but the two proteins seemed to have no influence on each other, and had what appeared to be different roles. Whilst Capping Protein blocks growth and stabilizes actin strands, Twinfilin speeds up their disassembly at their ends. But Johnston, Hilton et al. now reveal that the two proteins actually work together. Twinfilin helps Capping Protein resist the effects of CARMIL and V-1, and Capping Protein puts Twinfilin at the end of the strand. Thus, when Capping Protein is finally removed by CARMIL, Twinfilin carries on with disassembling the actin strands.</p><p>The tail of the Twinfilin protein looks like part of the CARMIL protein, suggesting that they might interact with Capping Protein in the same way. Attaching a fluorescent tag to the Twinfilin tail revealed that the two proteins compete to attach to the same part of the Capping Protein. When mouse cells produced extra Twinfilin, it blocked the effects of CARMIL, helping to grow the actin strands. V-1 attaches to Capping Protein in a different place, but Twinfilin was also able to interfere with its activity. When Twinfilin attached to the CARMIL binding site, it did not directly block V-1 binding, but it made the protein more likely to fall off.</p><p>Understanding how the actin cytoskeleton moves is a key question in cell biology, but it also has applications in medicine. Twinfilin plays a role in the spread of certain blood cancer cells, and in the formation of elaborate structures in the inner ear that help us hear. Understanding how Twinfilin and Capping Protein interact could open paths to new therapies for a range of medical conditions.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>actin</kwd><kwd>cytoskeleton</kwd><kwd>cell culture</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Other</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01 GM063691</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Goode</surname><given-names>Bruce L</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000774</institution-id><institution>Defense Threat Reduction Agency</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>HDTRA1-16-1-0033</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Amarasinghe</surname><given-names>Gaya K</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R35 GM118171</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Cooper</surname><given-names>John A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000001</institution-id><institution>National Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>MRSEC DMR-1420382</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Goode</surname><given-names>Bruce L</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>P01 AI120943</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Amarasinghe</surname><given-names>Gaya K</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01 AI123926</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Amarasinghe</surname><given-names>Gaya K</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Twinfilin functions as a pro-capping ligand of capping protein, dynamically competing with inhibitory ligands of capping proteinto control cellular actin assembly.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Assembly of cellular actin structures with distinct architectural and dynamic properties requires the convergence and coordination of numerous actin assembly, stabilization, and disassembly mechanisms. Although our understanding of the functions and mechanisms of individual actin-binding proteins has grown tremendously, there is a need to consider more deeply how seemingly disparate and sometimes competing factors work together in vivo and take on new mechanistic roles within more complex mixtures. One particularly enigmatic example is the interaction of Twinfilin with Capping Protein (CP). These two conserved proteins directly interact with high-affinity, and yet have seemingly opposite effects on the barbed ends of actin filaments.</p><p>Twinfilin is one of five proteins in the Actin Depolymerization Factor-Homology (ADF-H) domain family, of which ADF/Cofilin is the founding member (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Poukkula et al., 2011</xref>). Twinfilin is unique among the members of this family in containing two ADF-H domains, which are joined by a small linker region and followed by a short C-terminal tail. Initial biochemical studies categorized Twinfilin as an actin monomer sequestering factor because of its high affinity for ADP-bound G-actin and ability to inhibit subunit addition to either end of the filament (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Goode et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Vartiainen et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Wahlström et al., 2001</xref>). However, mouse Twinfilin was later shown to interact directly with the barbed ends of actin filaments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Helfer et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Paavilainen et al., 2007</xref>), and more recently yeast Twinfilin was shown to accelerate depolymerization at actin filament ends (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Johnston et al., 2015</xref>). Alone, yeast Twinfilin enhanced barbed end depolymerization by 3-fold through a processive filament end-attachment mechanism. Further, in conjunction with Srv2/CAP (cyclase-associated protein), yeast Twinfilin increased the rate of pointed-end depolymerization by over 15-fold (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Johnston et al., 2015</xref>). More recently, it was shown that mouse Twinfilin isoforms accelerate barbed end depolymerization, similar to yeast Twinfilin, but do not induce robust pointed end depolymerization in conjunction with Srv2/CAP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Hilton et al., 2018</xref>). Collectively, these studies highlight the biological significance of Twinfilin.</p><p>The conserved barbed-end effects of Twinfilin are particularly interesting given that both yeast and mammalian Twinfilins bind to CP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Falck et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Palmgren et al., 2001</xref>). Further, a barbed-end regulatory role for Twinfilin is suggested by its localization to the tips of stereocilia and filopodia, and to the barbed ends of <italic>Drosophila</italic> actin bristles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Peng et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Rzadzinska et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Wahlström et al., 2001</xref>). In addition, Twinfilin localizes to endocytic actin patches in yeast, and to lamellipodia and cell-cell junctions in animal cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Goode et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Vartiainen et al., 2000</xref>). Twinfilin’s localization to cortical actin patches in yeast is dependent on its interaction with CP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Palmgren et al., 2001</xref>). In both yeast and mammals, this interaction is mediated by conserved sequences in the C-terminal tail region of Twinfilin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Falck et al., 2004</xref>). Despite the high affinity of the Twinfilin-CP interaction (K<sub>d</sub> ~10 nM for the yeast homologs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Poukkula et al., 2011</xref>]), studies have revealed no significant effects of Twinfilin on the barbed end capping activity of CP in vitro, and reciprocally, no obvious effect of CP on Twinfilin interactions with ADP-actin monomers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Falck et al., 2004</xref>). Thus, the functional significance of the Twinfilin-CP interaction has remained highly enigmatic.</p><p>CP is an obligate heterodimer, consisting of alpha and beta subunits, and binds stably to the barbed ends of actin filaments to block subunit addition and loss. CP is ubiquitous and highly conserved across eukaryotes, and has universal roles in controlling the assembly of actin networks that drive cell morphogenesis and cell motility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Cooper and Sept, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Hart and Cooper, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Mejillano et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Schafer et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Schafer et al., 1995</xref>). In vitro, CP binds to the barbed ends of actin filaments with sub-nanomolar affinity, and dissociates from barbed ends very slowly (half-life of ~30 min) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Schafer et al., 1996</xref>). Given the relatively high abundance of CP in the cytosol (1–3 µM) and the strength of its interactions with barbed ends (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Cooper and Sept, 2008</xref>), it is not surprising that cells have evolved a number of regulatory mechanisms to spatiotemporally restrict CP activity.</p><p>Cellular protein inhibitors of CP broadly fall into two classes: steric inhibitors and allosteric inhibitors. Steric inhibitors, which include V-1/myotrophin, bind to CP in a manner that physically obstructs its association with barbed ends (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bhattacharya et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Kim et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Schafer et al., 1996</xref>). V-1 is a highly abundant 13 kDa protein that binds CP with a K<sub>d</sub> ~40 nM and sterically blocks its ability to bind barbed ends (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bhattacharya et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Taoka et al., 2003</xref>). Notably, however, V-1 does not catalyze dissociation of CP from barbed ends (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bhattacharya et al., 2006</xref>). In contrast, allosteric inhibitors induce conformational changes in CP that catalyze its dissociation from barbed ends (‘uncapping’ or ‘displacing’ CP), and also decrease but do not abolish its ability to bind barbed ends.</p><p>The major class of allosteric inhibitors is the capping protein interaction (CPI) motif family of proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Edwards et al., 2014</xref>). The founding and best characterized member of the CPI family is CARMIL (Capping Protein, ARP2/3 and Myosin I linker), which is conserved across metazoans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Stark et al., 2017</xref>). CARMIL catalyzes CP dissociation from barbed ends, reducing CP’s affinity for barbed ends by ~100 fold, transforming it into a transient capper (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Fujiwara et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Stark et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Uruno et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Yang et al., 2005</xref>). CARMIL localizes to the leading-edge plasma membrane, where it promotes cell migration through direct interactions with CP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Fujiwara et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Liang et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Stark et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Yang et al., 2005</xref>). Other proteins with CPI motifs include CD2AP, CKIP-1, CapZIP, CIN85, and WASHCAP (FAM21); their roles in regulating CP are less well understood. CPI-motif proteins share a common mode of interaction with CP, but are otherwise unrelated to each other (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Edwards et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Hernandez-Valladares et al., 2010</xref>). To date, binding partners of CP that antagonize its inhibitors, and thus function as ‘pro-capping’ factors, have not been reported.</p><p>Here, we uncover a novel role for Twinfilin in protecting CP from the negative regulatory effects of V-1 and CARMIL, and thus promoting actin filament capping. These and other data lead us to propose important revisions to current models for the CP regulatory cycle.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>CP inhibits mTwf1-mediated depolymerization by capping barbed ends</title><p>Because CP binding proteins have been studied predominantly in mammalian systems, we focused our investigation on mouse rather than yeast CP and Twinfilin. Mutagenesis on the yeast Twinfilin tail previously identified a mutant, <italic>twf1-11,</italic> that targets a cluster of positively charged residues (R328A, K329A, R330A, R331A) necessary for binding CP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Falck et al., 2004</xref>). While truncations of the C-terminal tail in mouse Twinfilin (mTwf1) also disrupt CP binding, the residues involved have not yet been defined. We therefore first sought to generate a specific mutant in mTwf1 that disrupts the interaction, analogous to yeast <italic>twf1-11</italic>. An alignment of the three mouse and three human Twinfilin isoforms, along with the single Twinfilin genes expressed in <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> and <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>), revealed a region that includes two of the basic residues mutated in the yeast <italic>twf1-11</italic> mutant. We mutated these two residues in mTwf1, changing them to alanines, to produce mTwf1-11 (K332A, R333A). To quantify binding of mTwf1 to CP, we performed fluorescence anisotropy assays using a mTwf1 tail peptide (317-350) labeled at its N-terminus with HiLyte488. The mTwf1 tail peptide displayed high affinity, concentration-dependent binding to CPα1β2, a major non-muscle isoform of CP in mammalian cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). Moreover, full-length mTwf1 protein (unlabeled) competed with the labeled mTwf1 tail for CP binding, whereas full-length mTwf1-11 (unlabeled) did not (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). Thus, the mTwf1-11 mutant effectively uncouples mTwf1 binding to CP.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.41313.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Barbed end capping by Capping Protein inhibits Twinfilin1-mediated depolymerization.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Mouse Twinfilin-1 (mTwf1) domain organization: ADF-H, actin depolymerization factor homology domain; L, linker; T, tail.

Further, mTwf1-11 exhibited a similar rate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>), indicating that this mutant has wild type depolymerization activity, and thus separates Twinfilin’s ability to bind CP from its ability to promote barbed-end depolymerization. Interestingly, the addition of CP was still able to block barbed-end depolymerization by mTwf1-11 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). These observations suggest that CP sterically blocks mTwf1 access to barbed ends, independent of its direct interaction with mTwf1. However, this left open the question of whether CP binding to mTwf1 might alter its mechanism of depolymerization independent of blocking the barbed end. To address this possibility, we utilized a CP mutant, CPαΔ28, which truncates the C-terminal tentacle of the alpha subunit, severely inhibiting capping activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Kim et al., 2010</xref>). Importantly, in binding assays the mTwf1 tail interacted equally well with wild-type CP and CPαΔ28, demonstrating that this mutant binds normally to mTwf1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>).

We were particularly interested in how Twinfilin might impact the regulation of CP by CPI-motif proteins such as CARMIL, since we noticed that the C-terminal tail regions of evolutionarily diverse Twinfilins share sequence homology with the CPI motifs of several CPI family proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). The consensus CPI motif is 17-amino acids long, with some additional contacts contributed from outside this motif, and tolerates significant divergence across the CPI-motif family (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Edwards et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Hernandez-Valladares et al., 2010</xref>).

To test this hypothesis, we used hydrogen-deuterium exchange with mass spectrometry (HDX-MS) to interrogate the conformational dynamics and solvent accessibility of the backbone and sidechains of CP, free and in complex with Twf1. Further, we compared our results to those in our recent study on the interactions of CARMIL with CP using the same approach (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Johnson et al., 2018</xref>).

These constructs were added to CP, either full-length alpha/beta heterodimer, or full-length alpha subunit with a beta subunit truncated at its C-terminus, removing the actin-binding beta tentacle.

Forced expression of mTwf1 partially rescued the defects associated with CP depletion, indicating that a portion of the original defects observed after CP knockdown were likely due to the accompanying loss of mTwf1.

(<bold>D</bold>) Our revised working model for the CP regulatory cycle. We propose that V-1 functions to maintain a cytosolic reservoir of inactive CP, from which Twinfilin and CARMIL activate CP, generating two distinct forms of active CP in cells: Twinfilin-CP complexes and CARMIL-CP complexes. Twinfilin-CP complexes are fully active and support stable capping of barbed ends. In contrast, CARMIL-CP complexes have ~100 fold reduced affinity for barbed ends, and may therefore more transiently cap barbed ends, permitting restricted network growth at the cell membrane where CARMIL localizes. CARMIL and Twinfilin directly compete with each other for binding CP (shown in close up of Transition state), which may result in the displacement of CP from Twinfilin. This would leave Twinfilin at the barbed end to catalyze depolymerization, or alternatively return filaments back to the original state of assembly.</p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="postscript" mimetype="application" xlink:href="elife-41313-fig7-v2"/></fig><fig id="fig7s1" position="float" specific-use="child-fig"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.41313.014</object-id><label>Figure 7—figure supplement 1.</label><caption><title>Structural model for a ternary complex formed by Twinfilin, Capping Protein and the barbed end of an actin filament.</title><p>The three actin protomers at the barbed end are shown in gray, the CP heterodimer is shown in yellow, and Twinfilin is shown in blue. The structure of CP bound to the barbed end was solved by cryo-EM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Narita et al., 2006</xref>). We docked the Twinfilin ADFH domains onto this structure using the following criteria. The Twinfilin N-terminal ADFH (N-ADFH) lobe, shown bound between the first and third subunits from the barbed end of the actin filament, is based on the structure of this domain bound to G-actin (PDB 3DAW) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Paavilainen et al., 2008</xref>), and assumes that this domain also uses its F-site to bind to F-actin in a manner similar to cofilin, which was solved by cryo-EM (PDB 5YU8) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Tanaka et al., 2018</xref>). The Twinfilin C-terminal ADFH (C-ADFH) lobe, shown bound to the first subunit of the actin filament barbed end, is based on the solution structure of this domain bound to G-actin via is G/F-site. The Twinfilin linker sequence (connecting the two ADFH domains) is depicted as an unstructured chain, 25 residues long, which if unstructured (87 Å) is sufficient in length to allow each ADFH domain to bind a different actin protomer. There is no structure available for the CPI motif-containing C-terminal tail of Twinfilin; therefore, in this model we used the known structure of the CPI region of CARMIL bound to the stalk of CP (PDB 3AAE) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Hernandez-Valladares et al., 2010</xref>). Attempts to model Twinfilin bound to the opposite strand of F-actin did not allow sufficient length between the tail (binding CP) and the C-terminal ADFH domain binding to actin.</p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="postscript" mimetype="application" xlink:href="elife-41313-fig7-figsupp1-v2"/></fig></fig-group></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Twinfilin and CP have been inextricably linked as interacting partners in yeast and animal cells for over 15 years (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Palmgren et al., 2001</xref>), yet until now it has remained a mystery what function their interaction serves. Here we discovered that Twinfilin binds to CP using an orphan CPI-like sequence in its C-terminal tail region, and through this interaction protects CP from inhibition and/or barbed end displacement by CARMIL and V-1. We found that Twinfilin binds to CP in a competitive manner with the CPI motif of CARMIL, interacts with a site on CP similar to that of CARMIL, and attenuates CARMIL-mediated uncapping of actin filaments. Separately, Twinfilin binding to CP also accelerates V-1 dissociation from CP, despite Twinfilin and V-1 having non-overlapping binding sites on CP. This might be achieved by an allosteric mechanism, given that CARMIL uses its CPI motif to induce V-1 dissociation from CP through allosteric changes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Fujiwara et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Johnson et al., 2018</xref>). Thus, we have demonstrated that Twinfilin promotes capping by protecting CP from interactions with V-1 and CARMIL. This functional role for Twinfilin is further supported in vivo by our observations of: (i) strong colocalization of Twinfilin and CP, (ii) knockdowns of mTwf1 and CP that each give rise to similar defects in cell morphology, and (iii) over-expression of mTwf1 suppressing defects caused by CARMIL hyperactivity. Taken together, these results reveal that Twinfilin is a new member of the CPI-motif family of proteins, and the first within this group to show the ability to bind CP without reducing CP affinity for barbed ends, and antagonize the negative regulatory effects of another CPI protein.</p><p>These functions of Twinfilin provide important new insights into the CP regulatory cycle. The best working model to date has been the Fujiwara model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Fujiwara et al., 2014</xref>) (depicted here as ‘Earlier Model’; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref>). It posits that the majority of CP in the cytosol is bound to V-1, in an inactive state, which then can be locally ‘activated’ by CARMIL at the leading edge. However, a caveat to this model is that it suggests CP-CARMIL complexes are the dominant capping species in the cell, despite this complex having ~100 fold reduced affinity for barbed ends compared to free CP. While this could potentially explain dynamic capping and uncapping near the plasma membrane, consistent with GFP-CP single molecule speckle analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Miyoshi et al., 2006</xref>), it does not explain how cells maintain a pool of ‘capping competent’ CP further back from the leading edge, where CP is needed to cap barbed ends in stress fibers and other actin networks, and may cap barbed ends generated by severing to promote filament disassembly. This model goes on to suggest that an unknown factor or mechanism dissociates the CP-CARMIL complex, allowing V-1 to rebind CP, restoring it to an inactive state.</p><p>In light of our results, we propose several additions and revisions to the Fujiwara model (see ‘Revised Model’; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D</xref>). First, we suggest that Twinfilin’s protective effects on CP, in particular against V-1, allow cells to maintain a larger pool of fully active CP (Twinfilin-CP complexes) in the cytosol than was previously thought. This view is supported by the relatively high abundance of Twinfilin in cells (~0.5 µM, compared to ~1 µM CP) its high affinity for CP (K<sub>d</sub> = 50 nM), and its ability to increase the rate of dissociation of V-1 from CP. Given these observations, we propose that a substantial fraction of CP is available in a fully active state, as Twinfilin-CP complexes, even in the presence of a high concentration of V-1 in the cytosol (~3 µM) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Fujiwara et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Pollard and Borisy, 2003</xref>). Second, we propose that V-1 functions to maintain a cytosolic reservoir of inactive CP, mobilized by Twinfilin and/or CARMIL dissociating V-1 to generate ‘stable capping’ (Twinfilin-CP) in the cytosol and possibly ‘transient capping’ (CARMIL-CP) complexes at the plasma membrane, respectively. CARMIL-CP complexes at the plasma membrane could facilitate actin network growth to drive leading edge protrusion. In contrast, Twinfilin-CP complexes in the cytosol may facilitate stable capping of barbed ends to limit network growth and promote filament disassembly and turnover. Third, we propose that the association of Twinfilin-CP complexes with barbed ends primes filaments for disassembly. Our data show that CARMIL, and/or other CPI proteins, compete with Twinfilin for binding CP. These interactions may competitively remove CP from barbed ends, leaving Twinfilin at the barbed end to processively depolymerize filaments, either alone or in combination with Srv2/CAP (as depicted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Hilton et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Johnston et al., 2015</xref>). In this manner, the interaction of Twinfilin with CP could serve not only to initially promote capping, and thus limit network growth, but also to position Twinfilin at barbed ends for subsequently catalyzing the disassembly of filaments.</p><p>In summary, our results show that functions of mammalian Twinfilin and CP are closely intertwined. This functional relationship is likely to extend to other species given CPI motif sequence conservation in the Twinfilin tail region (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>) and the conserved nature of the Twinfilin-CP interaction. Indeed, <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> Aim21 was recently identified as the first yeast CPI motif-containing protein, and was shown to regulate CP function at cortical actin patches (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Farrell et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Shin et al., 2018</xref>). We generated a structural model to explore the possible ternary complex formed by Twinfilin, CP, and the barbed end of an actin filament (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1</xref>). In this model, the Twinfilin tail is long enough to allow for simultaneous binding of Twinfilin’s CPI motif to CP and Twinfilin’s C-terminal ADFH domain to an actin subunit at the barbed end. Further, there are no clashes in binding between CP and Twinfilin on actin. It is worth noting that CP and Twinfilin appear to be able to associate with barbed ends individually or as a CP-Twinfilin complex, but with distinct consequences for the function and dynamics of actin networks. CP alone stably caps barbed ends, blocking subunit addition or loss, and our results suggest that CP-Twinfilin complexes may do the same. However, when Twinfilin alone associates with barbed ends, it drives processive depolymerization, while blocking new assembly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Hilton et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Johnston et al., 2015</xref>). Thus, despite key differences in the nature of their associations with barbed ends, CP and Twinfilin each inhibit filament growth, likely explaining why Twinfilin can replace CP in reconstituted actin motility assays in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Helfer et al., 2006</xref>).</p><p>Finally, our data add to a broader emerging view that actin dynamics in vivo are controlled by a complex set of barbed end-associated factors, many of which interact with each other and/or stimulate each other’s dissociation from barbed ends. These multi-component mechanisms may allow cells to control rapid transitions at filament ends through different functional states, including (i) formin-bound elongation, (ii) paused growth by formin-CP ‘decision complexes’, (iii) stable or transiently capped states by CP alone or CP-Twinfilin complexes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bombardier et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Shekhar et al., 2015</xref>), and (iv) depolymerization by Twinfilin, Cofilin, and/or Srv2/CAP. These molecular mechanisms for regulating barbed end growth are vastly more elaborate and dynamic than once thought, and help explain the exquisite spatiotemporal control that cells have in tuning actin network dynamics.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th>Reagent type <break/>(species) or <break/>resource</th><th>Designation</th><th>Source or <break/>reference</th><th>Identifiers</th><th>Additional <break/>information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Antibody</td><td>Rabbit anti- <break/>Twinfilin</td><td>Pekka <break/>Lappalainen <break/>(Univ.

The plasmid for over-expressing CARMIL1 in mammalian cells has been described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Edwards et al., 2013</xref>). To generate plasmids for expressing mouse Twinfilin isoforms as glutathione-S-transferase (GST)-fusions in <italic>E. coli</italic>, ORFs were PCR amplified from pHAT2-mTwf1 and pHAT2-mTwf2a kindly provided by Pekka Lappalainen (Univ. of Helsinki) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Nevalainen et al., 2009</xref>), and subcloned into the EcoRI and NotI sites of pGEX-6p-1, yielding pGEX-6p-1-mTwf1 and pGEX-6p-1-mTwf2a. pGEX-6p-1-mTwf1-11 (K332A, R333A) was generated by site-directed mutagenesis of pGEX-6p-1-mTwf1. For V-1 fluorescence experiments, we used a previously demonstrated strategy of removing two surface cysteine residues to allow direct labeling on the single remaining cysteine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Fujiwara et al., 2014</xref>); this was achieved by performing site-directed mutagenesis on wild type pGEX-GST-V-1 plasmid to introduce two mutations (C45S, C83S). To generate an RNAi-refractive construct of mTwf1 for expression in cultured cells, the ORF of mTwf1 was PCR amplified from pGEX-6p-1 and subcloned into the HindIII and SacI sites of pEGFP-C1 (Clontech, Mountain View, CA). Then, site-directed mutagenesis was used to introduce silent mutations at specific nucleotides of the ORF (703, 709, 711, 715), and the RNAi-refractive ORF was subcloned into the EcoRI and NotI sites of pCMV-M1, a gift from Linda Wordeman (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Stumpff et al., 2008</xref>) (Addgene plasmid # 23007), yielding pCMV-myc-mTwf1. Site-directed mutagenesis was performed on pCMV-myc-mTwf1 to generate mutant pCMV-myc-mTwf1-11 (K332A, R333A).

Lyophilized acetone powder stored at −80°C was mechanically sheared in a coffee grinder, resuspended in G-buffer (5 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.5, 0.5 mM DTT, 0.2 mM ATP, 0.1 mM CaCl<sub>2</sub>), and then cleared by centrifugation for 20 min at 50,000 × g. Actin was polymerized by the addition of 2 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub> and 50 mM NaCl and incubated overnight at 4°C. F-actin was pelleted by centrifugation for 150 min at 361,000 × g, and the pellet solubilized by Dounce homogenization and dialyzed against G-buffer for 48 hr at 4°C. Monomeric actin was then precleared at 435,000 × g, and loaded onto a S200 (16/60) gel filtration column (GE healthcare, Marlborough, MA) equilibrated in G-Buffer. Peak fractions containing actin were stored at 4°C. For labeling actin with biotin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Breitsprecher et al., 2012</xref>) or Oregon Green (OG) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kuhn and Pollard, 2005</xref>), the F-actin pellet described above was Dounced and dialyzed against G-buffer lacking DTT. Monomeric actin was then polymerized by adding an equal volume of 2X labeling buffer (50 mM Imidazole pH 7.5, 200 mM KCl, 0.3 mM ATP, 4 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>). After 5 min, the actin was mixed with a 5-fold molar excess of NHS-XX-Biotin (Merck KGaA, Darmstadt, Germany) or Oregon-Green-488 iodoacetamide (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) resuspended in anhydrous DMF, and incubated in the dark for 15 hr at 4°C. Labeled F-actin was pelleted as above, and the pellet was rinsed briefly with G-buffer, then depolymerized by Dounce homogenization, and dialyzed against G-buffer for 48 hr at 4°C. Labeled, monomeric actin was purified further on an S200 (16/60) gel filtration column as above. Aliquots of biotin-conjugated actin were snap frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at −80°C. OG-488-actin was dialyzed for 15 hr against G-buffer with 50% glycerol and stored at −20°C.</p><p>For bulk actin assembly assays, RMA was fluorescently labeled with pyrenyl-iodoacetamide on cysteine 374 (Pollard and Cooper, 1984; Graziano et al., 2013). An RMA pellet stored at 4°C (prepared as described above) was dialyzed against pyrene buffer (25 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 100 mM KCl, 0.02% NaN3, 0.3 mM ATP, and 2 mM MgSO4) for 3–4 hr and then diluted with pyrene buffer to 1 mg/ml (23.8 μM). A sevenfold molar excess of pyrenyl-iodoacetamide was added, the actin solution was incubated overnight at 4°C, and aggregates were cleared by low-speed centrifugation. The supernatant (containing F-actin) was centrifuged for 3 hr at 4°C at 45,000 rpm in a Ti70 rotor (Beckman Coulter, Indianapolis, IN) to pellet F-actin. The actin pellets were disrupted by Douncing, dialyzed against G-buffer for 1–2 d, and gel filtered on a 16/60 S200 column.

Cells were grown in LB to log phase, then expression was induced for 3 hr at 37°C by addition of 0.4 mM isopropyl-β-D-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG). Cells were collected by centrifugation, washed with 25 ml water, and resuspended in lysis buffer (20 mM Tris pH 8.0, 1 mM EDTA, 0.1% Triton X-100, protease inhibitors) and lysed by lysozyme treatment and sonication. The cell lysate was clarified by centrifugation at 12,500 x g for 30 min at 4°C. Supernatants were loaded onto a 1 ml Q-HiTrap column (GE Healthcare) and eluted with a 45 ml salt gradient (0–500 mM KCl) in 20 mM Tris, pH 8.0.

SNAP-CP was expressed E. coli strain BL21 pLysS. Cells were grown to log phase at 37°C, and then expression was induced for 8 hr at 37°C by addition of 0.4 mM isopropyl-β-D-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG). Cells were collected by centrifugation, and resuspended in 20 mM Tris pH 8.0, 1 mM EDTA, 0.1% Triton X-100, protease inhibitors and lysed by lysozyme treatment and sonication. The cell lysate was centrifuged for 80 min at 60,000 rpm, 4°C in a Ti70 rotor (Beckman/Coulter, Fullerton, CA). The supernatant was rotated with 0.75 ml of Ni2+-NTA-agarose beads (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). SNAP-CP was fluorescently labelled using 9 μM (∼4-fold excess) dye adduct for 2 hr at room temperature, yielding SNAP-649-CP. To remove free dye, beads were washed three times with 20 mM imidazole (pH 8.0), 1X PBS, 1 mM DTT, 200 mM NaCl. Labeled SNAP-649-CP was eluted with 0.5 ml of 300 mM imidazole pH 8.0, 50 mM Tris pH 8.0, 100 mM NaCl, 1 mM DTT, 5% glycerol, then purified by gel filtration on a Superose six column (GE Healthcare) equilibrated in 20 mM Hepes (pH 7.5), 1 mM EDTA, 150 mM KCl, 5% glycerol. Peak fractions were pooled, concentrated, aliquoted, snap-frozen in liquid N2, and stored at −80°C.</p><p>For stopped-flow kinetics, fluorescence anisotropy binding and HDX-MS experiments, His-tagged-α1 and β2 subunits of mouse CP (pRSFDuet-1, pBJ 2041) were co-expressed in <italic>E. coli</italic> BL21 (DE3) pRIL and purified as described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Johnson et al., 2018</xref>). For CP lacking the β tentacle, a premature stop codon was introduced, so that the C-terminal residue of the mouse β2 subunit was L243 instead of C272 (pBJ 1891).</p><p>Twinfilin polypeptides were expressed as GST-fusions in E. coli strain BL21 pRARE. Cells were grown to log phase at 37°C, and then expression was induced for 16 hr at 18°C by addition of 0.4 mM isopropyl-β-D-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG). Cells were collected by centrifugation, washed with 25 ml water, and resuspended in 10 ml of PBS supplemented freshly with 0.5 mM dithiothreitol (DTT), 1 mM phenylmethylsulphonyl fluoride (PMSF), and a standard mixture of protease inhibitors. Cells were incubated with lysozyme (0.5 mg ml−1) on ice for 15 min and then sonicated. The cell lysate was clarified by centrifugation at 12,500 g for 20 min and incubated at 4°C (rotating) for at least 2 hr with 0.5 ml glutathione–agarose beads (Sigma-Aldrich; St. Louis, MO). Beads were washed three times in PBS supplemented with 1M NaCl and then washed two times in PBS. Twinfilin was cleaved from GST by incubation with PreScission Protease (GE Healthcare; Marlborough, MA) overnight at 4°C (rotating). Beads were pelleted, and the supernatant was concentrated to 0.3 ml, and then purified further by size-exclusion chromatography on a Superose12 column (GE Healthcare) equilibrated in HEK buffer (20 mM Hepes pH 7.5, 1 mM EDTA, 50 mM KCl, 0.5 mM DTT).

Flow cells were prepared immediately before use by sequential incubations as follows: 3 min in HEK-BSA (20 mM Hepes pH 7.5, 1 mM EDTA, 50 mM KCl, 1% BSA), 30 s in Streptavidin (0.1 mg/ml in PBS), a fast rinse in HEK-BSA, and then equilibration in 1X TIRF buffer, pH 7.5 (10 mM imidazole, 50 mM KCl, 1 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 1 mM EGTA, 0.2 mM ATP, 10 mM DTT, 15 mM glucose, 20 µg/ml catalase, 100 µg/ml glucose oxidase, and 0.5% methylcellulose (4000 cP)). To initiate reactions, actin monomers (10% OG-labeled, 0.5% biotinylated) were diluted to 1 µM in TIRF buffer, and immediately transferred to a flow chamber. After several minutes, once the actin filaments reached an appropriate length (approximately 10 µm), the reaction mixture was replaced by flow-in. For depolymerization experiments, the solution was replaced with TIRF buffer lacking actin monomers, with or without Twinfilin and/or CP polypeptides. For uncapping experiments, the solution was replaced with TIRF buffer lacking actin monomers, with 3 nM SNAP-649-CP (100% labeled), and filaments were allowed to be capped for 3 min. Subsequently, the solution was again replaced with TIRF buffer lacking actin monomers, with or without 50 nM CARMIL CBR and/or variable concentration of Twinfilin polypeptides. Time-lapse TIRF microscopy was performed using a Nikon-Ti200 inverted microscope equipped with a 150 mW Ar-Laser (Mellot Griot; Carlsbad, CA), a 60X TIRF-objective with a N.A. of 1.49 (Nikon Instruments Inc.; New York, NY), and an EMCCD camera (Andor Ixon; Belfast, Northern Ireland). During recordings, optimal focus was maintained using the perfect focus system (Nikon Instruments Inc). Images were captured every 5 s. The pixel size corresponded to 0.27 µm.</p><p>Filament depolymerization rates were determined by tracing filaments in ImageJ (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://rsbweb.nih.gov/ij">http://rsbweb.nih.gov/ij</ext-link>) and measuring the change in length of individual filaments for 15–20 min after flow-in, or until filaments disappeared. Differences in fluorescence intensity along the length of the filament provided fiduciary marks that allowed us to distinguish barbed- and pointed-ends. Filament uncapping was measured by monitoring the as the amount of time that SNAP-649-CP puncta remained associated with the barbed end of a filament after the addition of CARMIL to the reaction (with or without Twinfilin) and expressing it as a fraction of filaments that remained capped at a given time point. All results shown are data from at least two independent TIRF experiments.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Cell culture, transfection, and RNAi silencing</title><p>Mouse B16-F10 (CRL-6475), Neuro-2a (CCL-131), and NIH/3T3 (CRL-1658) cells obtained directly from ATCC (American Type Culture Collection; Manassas, VA), where their identities were authenticated by short tandem repeat DNA profiling and where they were tested for mycoplasma contamination. Cells were used for experiments within one year. All cells were grown in DMEM (Gibco BRL Life Technologies; Carlsbad, CA) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS; Sigma) and 200 mM L-glutamine (Thermo Fisher Scientific) at 37°C and 5% CO<sub>2</sub>.</p><p>All cell culture experiments were carried out in 6-well dishes that were initially seeded with 100,000 cells. To knockdown Twinfilin-1 or Capping Protein cells were transfected 24 hr after seeding with 30 pmol siRNA oligo using Lipofectamine RNAiMAX (Thermo Fisher Scientific) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. RNAi oligos directed against the mouse Twinfilin-1 coding region targeting (siTwf1) 5’- CGUUACCAUUUCUUUCUGUUU −3’; and against the Capping Protein β subunit coding region targeting (siCP1) 5’- CCUCAGCGAUCUGAUCGACUU-3’, or (siCP2) 5’- GCACGCUGAAUGAGAUCUA-3’. Cells were transfected in parallel with control RNAi oligos (Invitrogen). For over expression experiments cultured cells were transfected using Lipofectamine 3000 (Thermo Fisher Scientific) according to the manufacturer’s instructions 24 hr after seeding. For CARMIL over expression experiments, 5 μG of DNA was transfected, and for Twinfilin over expression experiments 1 μG of DNA was transfected.</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>Antibodies</title><p>The rabbit anti-Twinfilin was a generous gift from Pekka Lappalainen (Univ.

Cells were fixed for 15 min with 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS at room temperature and then permeabilized for 15 min in permeabilization solution (0.5% Triton X-100 and 0.3 M glycine in PBS) at room temperature. Slips were then blocked in 3% BSA dissolved in PBST (1X PBS and 0.1% TWEEN 20) for 1 hr at room temperature, then incubated in primary antibody (in PBST) for 12 hr at 4°C. Coverslips were then washed three times with 1X PBST and incubated with secondary antibodies (in PBST) for 1 hr at room temperature. Slips were washed three times with PBST and two times with PBS, and subsequently mounted on to slides with AquaMount (Thermo Fisher Scientific).

CP and Twf1 samples were buffer-exchanged with 1X phosphate saline buffer (PBS), pH 7.4. HDX was initiated by diluting samples (25 μM, 2 μL) 10-fold with 1XPBS prepared in D<sub>2</sub>O buffer, or 1XPBS H<sub>2</sub>O buffer for samples measured for no-deuterium control. At different time intervals (10, 30, 60, 120, 360, 900, 3600, and 14400 s), the labeling reaction was quenched by rapidly decreasing the pH to 2.5 with 30 μL of quench buffer (3 M urea, 1% trifluoroacetic acid, H<sub>2</sub>O) at 4°C. The protein mixture was immediately injected into a custom-built HDX sample-handling device that enabled digestion with a column containing immobilized pepsin (2 mm ×20 mm) at a flow rate of 100 μL/min in 0.1% formic acid. The resulting peptic peptides were captured on a ZORBAX Eclipse XDB C8 column (2.1 mm ×15 mm, Agilent) for desalting (3 min). The C8 column was then switched in-line with a Hypersil Gold C18 column (2.1 mm ×50 mm, Thermo Fisher), and a linear gradient (4–40% acetonitrile, 0.1% formic acid, 50 μL/min flow rate, over 5 min) was used to separate the peptides and direct them to an LTQ-FTICR mass spectrometer (Thermo Fisher) equipped with an electrospray ionization source. Valves, columns, and tubing for protein digestion and peptide separation were immersed in an ice-water bath to minimize back-exchange.</p><p>To map the peptic peptides, the digest, in the absence of HDX, was submitted to accurate mass analysis by LC–MS/MS with the LTQ-FTICR, and the peptic peptides identified using Mascot (Matrix Science). For samples that underwent HDX, raw mass spectra and peptide sets were submitted to HDX Workbench (Pascal et al., 2012) for calculation and data visualization in a fully automated fashion. Peptides for each run were assessed based on relative representation and statistical validation as implemented within HDX Workbench. Appropriate approach to determine statistical significance between these data is by using Tukey’s multiple comparison test. A representative time point was manually selected, replicate data points from multiple samples at this time point used to conduct a one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) the divergence between the means of the experiments were assessed. In instances with large differences, Tukey method was used to determine statistical significance if the resulting <italic>P</italic> value is less than 0.05. In the case where there was a comparison between two experiments, a <italic>t</italic>-test was used. Only the top six peptides from each MS scan were used in the final analysis. The extent of HDX at each time point was calculated by subtracting the centroid of the isotopic distribution of the nondeuterated peptide from that of the deuterated peptide. The relative deuterium uptake was plotted versus the labeling time to yield kinetic curves (%D vs time). Error bars represent the results of <italic>t</italic>-tests between samples are shown above each time point to illustrate statistical significance. For comparison between apo states and the complexes, differences in HDX for all time points were calculated. Absolute differences in perturbation values larger than 5% D were considered significant. HDX values at 15 min time point were mapped onto the protein three-dimensional (3D) structure for data visualization. Peptide digestions were optimized under HDX assay conditions, and the mass calculations included accommodation for back exchange with solvent.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We are grateful to Julian Eskin, Sean Guo, Silvia Jansen, M Angeles Juanes, and Daisy Leung for helpful discussions and/or comments on the manuscript.

Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Anna Akhmanova as the Senior and Reviewing Editor. The following individuals involved in review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Alphee Michelot (Reviewer #1); Robert Robinson (Reviewer #3). A further reviewer remains anonymous.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>This is an interesting manuscript that reports a significant advance in our understanding of the biochemical and cellular functions of the actin-binding protein twinfilin. The authors report that twinfilin has a capping protein (CP) interacting (CPI) motif, similar to the CPI motif in the CARMIL protein, which binds to and inhibits capping protein. Through a rigorous series of biochemical experiments, they show that twinfilin binds competitively with CARMIL to capping protein. However, twinfilin and CARMIL actually have opposite effect on the capping protein activity, and twinfilin promotes capping activity by competition with CARMIL. Twinfilin also promotes capping by accelerating capping protein dissociation from the inhibitor V-1. In cells, twinfilin and capping protein have similar activities, as silencing their expression causes similar phenotypes. This study identifies twinfilin as the first known example of a pro-capping interaction partner of capping protein, and suggests a revised model of capping protein regulation in cells.</p><p>All reviewers have very positively commented on the quality of the data and the writing of the manuscript. Below is the list of comments that can mostly be addressed by textual changes and some additional clarifications.</p><p>1) The authors demonstrate clearly that the twinfilin/CP interaction is highly conserved from yeast to mammals, and involves the same type of residues. However, the V-1/CP and CARMIL/CP interactions are much less conserved, questioning whether the proposed function for twinfilin as a pro-capper is indeed its main function. For example, there appear to be no proteins inhibiting CP in yeast. Do the authors have any strong argument in favor of a conserved pro-capping function for twinfilin?</p><p>2) Figure 2A – please explain how was the alignment created. The insertion of spaces looks arbitrary. Statistically, it is meaningless to align one long twinfilin sequence against several CPI sequences. One acceptable solution would be to remove all the spaces in the alignment. A second solution would be to align diverse CPI and twinfilin sequences using rigorous methods.</p><p>3) The authors should be careful with their definition of filopodia in describing the data shown in Figures 6 and 7. The cells in which capping protein or twinfilin have been silenced look smaller in area than control cells, with spike-like protrusions. The smaller area suggests possible cell rounding. Thus, the spikes could be filopodia, which are dynamic structures (cycle between protrusion and retraction) or they could be retraction fibers that result from cell rounding (do not actively protrude/retract).</p><p>4) Is twinfilin mislocalized in cells ectopically expressing CARMIL? Please explain or add some data.</p><p>5) Figure 3: Is CP 100% labeled in this experiment or do the authors only analyze filaments originally capped by CP? The authors should provide images for the control condition.</p><p>6) Figure 1: the authors should also provide kymograph examples of the barbed end dissociation assays.</p><p>7) Figure 7D: – This is the take home message of the manuscript. It nicely combines the biological activity with schematic representations of structural knowledge of the components. Two clarifications need to be included:</p><p>A) The action of CARMIL on CP post &quot;transition&quot; state is shown to promote filament dissociation – probably based on the data from Figure 1D,E, which was carried out in a background of zero G-actin. In the cell, where there is plenty of G-actin, the action of ectopic CARMIL (Figure 7A) causes filopodia, consistent with filament elongation. Likely both activities occur, possibly dependent on the proximity to the membrane and pro-elongation factors. The elongation-promoting properties of CARMIL should be worked into the figure, otherwise the figure is misleading.</p><p>B) The structural representation of the &quot;capped&quot; filament should be checked through making a model to be included in the supplementary information. The &quot;actin&quot;/CP interaction is known from the dynactin complex cryoEM structure. The CPI/CP interactions are known from crystallography, which can be used to place a model of the twinfilin tail. The single twinfilin domain/actin is known from crystallography and the location of the side binding sites can be inferred from the cofilin/actin cryoEM structure. Putting these elements together will verify the cartoon model of the &quot;capped&quot; filament. Specifically to be checked: Is the KPK motif running in the correct direction and is the tail long enough to reach to an actin-bound twinfilin domain? And are the twinfilin domain and CP compatible when bound to the same actin?</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.41313.018</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>[…] All reviewers have very positively commented on the quality of the data and the writing of the manuscript.

Two recent studies showed that the <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> protein Aim21 has a CPI motif and regulates CP function at cortical actin patches (Farrell et al., 2017; Shin et al., 2018). Further, we performed BLAST searches for additional CPI motif-containing proteins in the yeast proteome. Our search yielded several candidates, and we have purified two of them. Both yeast CPI proteins negatively regulate yeast CP activity in vitro, and yeast Twinfilin competes with both for CP binding and antagonizes the negative regulatory effects of one. Thus, the CPI family appears to extend from yeast to mammals. Our new story on yeast Twinfilin and CPI proteins is still a work in progress and will require at least another year of experiments before it is ready to publish. We have edited the Discussion by citing the two papers on Aim21, and mentioning that the CPI motif is conserved in yeast Twinfilin (Figure 2A).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Figure 2A – please explain how was the alignment created. The insertion of spaces looks arbitrary. Statistically, it is meaningless to align one long twinfilin sequence against several CPI sequences. One acceptable solution would be to remove all the spaces in the alignment. A second solution would be to align diverse CPI and twinfilin sequences using rigorous methods.</p></disp-quote><p>We replaced Figure 2A with a new alignment generated using the MAFFT algorithm in the DNASTAR Lasergene Suite/MegAlign Pro application. This alignment shows the homology between 8 evolutionarily diverse Twinfilins and 8 known CPI proteins (the same 8 previously shown).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) The authors should be careful with their definition of filopodia in describing the data shown in Figures 6 and 7. The cells in which capping protein or twinfilin have been silenced look smaller in area than control cells, with spike-like protrusions. The smaller area suggests possible cell rounding. Thus, the spikes could be filopodia, which are dynamic structures (cycle between protrusion and retraction) or they could be retraction fibers that result from cell rounding (do not actively protrude/retract).</p></disp-quote><p>We have edited the manuscript (and the figures) for this nomenclature, emphasizing that silencing CP or Twinfilin leads to cells with excessive “microspikes” instead of claiming they are filopodia. We agree that CP and Twinfilin silenced cells have reduced cell area compared to control cells. However, when we replate cells after silencing they spread out on the coverslip, so we don’t think that they are rounding up. Thus, our observations are consistent with the idea raised by the reviewers, which is that instead of putting out filopodial protrusions these silenced cells may be failing to put out robust lamellipodia. We mention this in the Results, and thank the reviewers for raising this point.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) Is twinfilin mislocalized in cells ectopically expressing CARMIL? Please explain or add some data.</p></disp-quote><p>We examined Twinfilin localization in cells ectopically expressing CARMIL, and it does not change. However, this is not necessarily unexpected, given that ectopically expressed CARMIL is restricted to the membrane at the leading edge, and has been shown not to alter CP localization (Edwards et al., 2013). Further, Twinfilin (alone or together with Srv2/CAP) can bind to barbed ends of filaments (and depolymerize them), so even if there is less active CP at the leading edge, this would not necessarily alter Twinfilin localization.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) Figure 3: Is CP 100% labeled in this experiment or do the authors only analyze filaments originally capped by CP? The authors should provide images for the control condition.</p></disp-quote><p>The CP is 100% labeled, which was stated in the Materials and methods. However, for added clarity we have also included this information in the figure legend and Results. In addition, we added a better description of how these experiments were performed in the Results, explaining that: (1) we identified capped filaments prior to flow in of CARMIL and/or Twinfilin, and (2) we then recorded the dwell times of labeled CP molecules on barbed ends. We also added the requested control images to Figure 3B.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) Figure 1: the authors should also provide kymograph examples of the barbed end dissociation assays.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that the paper stands alone better if we include examples of the raw data for the barbed end dissociation assays. To address this, we added Video 1 showing barbed end depolymerization of filaments for the four conditions in Figure 1F: (a) buffer alone, (b) mTwf1, (c) wildtype CP + mTwf1, and (d) mutant CPα∆28 + mTwf1. In the original submission, we did not include this video only because similar videos had been included in another paper we recently published describing the barbed end depolymerization effects of mouse Twinfilin (mTwf) isoforms (Hilton et al., 2018).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7) Figure 7D: This is the take home message of the manuscript. It nicely combines the biological activity with schematic representations of structural knowledge of the components. Two clarifications need to be included:</p><p>A) The action of CARMIL on CP post &quot;transition&quot; state is shown to promote filament dissociation – probably based on the data from Figure 1D,E, which was carried out in a background of zero G-actin. In the cell, where there is plenty of G-actin, the action of ectopic CARMIL (Figure 7A) causes filopodia, consistent with filament elongation. Likely both activities occur, possibly dependent on the proximity to the membrane and pro-elongation factors. The elongation-promoting properties of CARMIL should be worked into the figure, otherwise the figure is misleading.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that ectopic CARMIL promotes uncapping, creating free barbed ends of filaments, which could then grow (e.g., if a formin or Ena/VASP comes on to drive processive elongation) or disassemble (e.g., if Twinfilin comes on to processively drive depolymerization). To incorporate this idea of the ‘elongation-promoting’ effect of CARMIL in our model, we have added an arrow that starts at the transition state (where CARMIL is uncapping the barbed end) and points back to the original state of filament assembly.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>B) The structural representation of the &quot;capped&quot; filament should be checked through making a model to be included in the supplementary information. The &quot;actin&quot;/CP interaction is known from the dynactin complex cryoEM structure. The CPI/CP interactions are known from crystallography, which can be used to place a model of the twinfilin tail. The single twinfilin domain/actin is known from crystallography and the location of the side binding sites can be inferred from the cofilin/actin cryoEM structure. Putting these elements together will verify the cartoon model of the &quot;capped&quot; filament. Specifically to be checked: Is the KPK motif running in the correct direction and is the tail long enough to reach to an actin-bound twinfilin domain? And are the twinfilin domain and CP compatible when bound to the same actin?</p></disp-quote><p>As requested, we have put these elements together in a structural model of the ternary complex formed by Twinfilin, CP, and the barbed end of an actin filament (Figure 7—figure supplement 1). In the configuration shown, the KPK motif runs in the correct orientation, and the tail is long enough to reach the C-terminal ADFH domain of Twinfilin bound to the ultimate actin subunit in the filament. Further, there are no clashes between CP and Twinfilin on actin in this configuration. When we docked Twinfilin onto the opposite strand of F-actin, there was no longer sufficient length between the tail and the C-terminal ADFH domain to allow simultaneous binding of the tail (to CP) and the C-terminal ADFH domain (to actin). We mention this point in the legend.</p></body></sub-article></article>
