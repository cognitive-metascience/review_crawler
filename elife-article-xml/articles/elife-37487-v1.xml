goal-directed behaviors. Yet the temporal dynamic range and mechanism of action of acetylcholine (ACh) on the modulation of VTA circuits and reward-related behaviors are not known. Here, we used a chemical-genetic approach for rapid and precise optical manipulation of nicotinic neurotransmission in VTA neurons in living mice. We provide direct evidence that the ACh tone fine-tunes the firing properties of VTA DA neurons through β2-containing (β2*) nicotinic ACh receptors (nAChRs). Furthermore, locally photo-antagonizing these receptors in the VTA was sufficient to reversibly switch nicotine reinforcement on and off. By enabling control of nicotinic transmission in targeted brain circuits, this technology will help unravel the various physiological functions of nAChRs and may assist in the design of novel therapies relevant to neuropsychiatric disorders.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.37487.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Acetylcholine is one of the most abundant chemicals in the brain, with key roles in learning, memory and attention. Neurons throughout the brain use acetylcholine to exchange messages. Acetylcholine binds to two different classes of receptors on neurons: nicotinic and muscarinic. As the name suggests, nicotinic receptors also respond to nicotine, the main addictive substance in tobacco, while muscarinic receptors respond to muscarine, present in certain poisonous mushrooms.</p><p>Nicotinic and muscarinic receptors each consist of many different subtypes. But standard pharmacology techniques cannot discriminate between the effects of acetylcholine binding to these different subtypes. Likewise, they cannot distinguish between acetylcholine binding to the same receptor subtype on different neurons. Durand-de Cuttoli, Mondoloni et al. have now developed a new nanotechnology that uses light to target specific acetylcholine receptor subtypes in freely moving mice.</p><p>The technology was tested in a brain region called the VTA, which is part of the brain’s reward system. Experiments showed that when acetylcholine binds to a specific subtype of nicotinic receptors on VTA neurons – called β2-containing receptors – it makes the neurons release the brain's reward signal, dopamine. Switching these receptors on and off changed how the mice responded to nicotine. With the receptors switched on, mice preferred locations associated with nicotine. Switching the receptors off removed this preference. Nicotine may thus be addictive in part because it triggers VTA neurons to release dopamine via its actions on β2-containing nicotinic receptors.</p><p>This new technology will help reveal the mechanisms of action of acetylcholine and nicotine. Blocking the effects of nicotine at a specific time and place in the mouse brain may uncover the receptors and brain regions that drive nicotine consumption. Smoking remains a major cause of preventable death worldwide. This new approach could help us develop strategies to prevent or treat addiction.</p></abstract><kwd-group

and diffuse signal in the brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Picciotto et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Sarter et al., 2009</xref>). ACh alters neurotransmitter release from presynaptic terminals and affects neuronal integration and network activity, by acting through two classes of membrane receptors: metabotropic muscarinic receptors and ionotropic nicotinic ACh receptors (nAChRs). nAChRs consist of hetero- and homo-pentameric arrangements of α and β subunits (9 and 3 genes, respectively), yielding a high combinatorial diversity of channel composition, localization and function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Zoli et al., 2015</xref>). Nicotinic neuromodulation controls learning, memory and attention, and has been associated with the development of numerous neurological and psychiatric disorders, including epilepsy, schizophrenia, anxiety and nicotine addiction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Taly et al., 2009</xref>). Understanding how nAChRs mediate such diverse functions requires tools for controlling nicotinic neurotransmission in defined brain circuits.</p><p>ACh is a modulator of the VTA, a midbrain DAergic nucleus key in the processing of reward-related stimuli and in addiction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Di Chiara and Imperato, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Pignatelli and Bonci, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Volkow and Morales, 2015</xref>). The pedunculopontine and laterodorsal tegmental nuclei (PPN and LDT) are the two major cholinergic inputs to the VTA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Beier et al., 2015</xref>). Optogenetic activation of PPN and LDT neurons modulates the firing patterns of VTA DA cells and reward-associated behaviors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Lammel et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Dautan et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Xiao et al., 2016</xref>), implicating ACh in these processes. Yet, whether ACh directly affects neuronal excitability at the post-synaptic level, or whether it potentiates the release of other neurotransmitters through pre-synaptic nicotinic and muscarinic receptors is not known.</p><p>Brain nAChRs are expressed in high densities in the VTA, and in strategic places such as somatic and dendritic sites on GABAergic, glutamatergic and DAergic VTA cells, as well as on pre-synaptic terminals from extra-VTA afferents and from intra-VTA GABAergic interneurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Changeux, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Zoli et al., 2015</xref>). They are also present on DAergic terminals in the Nucleus Accumbens (NAc) and the prefrontal cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Grady et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Changeux, 2010</xref>). Genetic and pharmacological manipulations have implicated VTA nAChRs in tuning the activity of DA neurons and in mediating the addictive properties of nicotine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Mameli-Engvall et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Maskos et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Morel et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Naudé et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Picciotto et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Tapper et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Tolu et al., 2013</xref>). However, understanding the mechanism by which ACh and nicotine participate in these activities requires to comprehend the spatio-temporal dynamics of nAChRs activation. Genetic manipulations can eliminate specific nAChRs, but they cannot provide kinetic information about the time course of nAChR signals that could be crucial for actuating VTA circuits and goal-oriented behaviors. Moreover, gene knock-out can have unintended consequences, which include compensatory changes in expression of other receptors or channels, homeostatic adaptations and developmental impairments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">King et al., 2003</xref>). Pharmacological agents allow activation or inhibition of nAChRs, but they diffuse slowly in vivo, they have limited subtype specificity and they cannot be targeted to genetically-defined neuronal cell types.</p><p>To fill this gap between molecular and circuit knowledge, we have developed the optogenetic pharmacology for rapid and reversible photocontrol of genetically-targeted mammalian neurotransmitter receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Kramer et al., 2013</xref>). We previously demonstrated light-controllable nAChRs (LinAChRs) in Xenopus occcytes, a heterologous expression system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Tochitsky et al., 2012</xref>). Here, we deployed strategies for acutely and reversibly controlling nicotinic transmission in the VTA in the mammalian brain, in vivo. β2* receptors account for the great majority of VTA nAChRs and are crucial for the pathophysiology of nicotine addiction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Maskos et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Faure et al., 2014</xref>). We demonstrate acute interruption of nicotinic signaling in the VTA and reveal that endogenous pontine ACh strongly impacts on the firing patterns of VTA DA neurons. Moreover, we reversibly prevented the induction of nicotine preference in behaving mice by locally photo-antagonizing the effect of nicotine on VTA β2* nAChRs. This approach to optically antagonize neurotransmitter receptors in vivo will help sense the different temporal dynamics of ACh concentrations, and unravel the contribution of specific nAChR isoforms to nicotinic neuromodulation of neural circuits and associated behaviors, including drug abuse.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Design and characterization of β2LinAChR</title><p>The vast majority of nAChRs in the mouse VTA contains the β2 subunit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Zoli et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Faure et al., 2014</xref>). Therefore, we engineered this subunit to enable installation of light sensitivity. We transposed the rat β2E61C mutation, used previously in nAChRs expressed in Xenopus oocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Tochitsky et al., 2012</xref>), to the mouse β2 subunit to generate a photosensitizable receptor that traffics and functions normally in the mouse brain. The single cysteine-substitution, which is used for the anchoring of the photoswitchable tethered ligand Maleimide-Azobenzene-Homocholine (MAHoCh), faces the agonist binding sites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). MAHoCh has a photo-isomerizable azobenzene group, flanked on one side with a thiol-reactive maleimide moiety for conjugation to the cysteine, and on the other with a homocholine ligand for competitive antagonism of nAChRs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). In darkness, the azobenzene group adopts the thermally stable, extended <italic>trans</italic> configuration.

To separately evaluate responding from non-responding neurons, we set a threshold (15% absolute photoswitching) to exclude 95% of the control neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>). Based on this threshold, about a third (33/93) of the pDA neurons of transduced animals responded to light, compared to 1/28 for control animals. Non-responding neurons probably were either not transduced, or received too little endogenous cholinergic drive. We then compared the activity of each responding pDA neuron under both wavelengths of light and observed that some neurons responded with increased firing and some with decreased firing. A majority of the neurons (Type 1, 24/33) showed decreased activity under 390 nm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>), and a transient increase upon switching back to 520 nm, consistent with a direct nAChRs antagonism on VTA DA neurons by <italic>cis</italic> MAHoCh and relief from antagonism when MAHoCh is switched to its <italic>trans</italic> state. The increase in firing upon relief from antagonism suggests that ambient ACh is sufficient to drive nAChRs in an activated state. In addition, bursting activity was significantly reduced in 390 nm light in Type 1 neurons, when β2*nAChRs were antagonized (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref>). Hence, these receptors play a causal role in determining the firing patterns of VTA DA neurons. A smaller fraction of pDA neurons (Type 2, 9/33) showed the opposite profile, i.e. increased activity under 390 nm light compared to 520 nm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3G</xref>). This observation suggests that extracellular ACh acts on β2*nAChRs to exert an inhibitory drive on a sub-population of VTA DA neurons, possibly through an indirect network mechanism or through β2LinAChRs expressed on GABAergic interneurons. In Type 2 pDA neurons, we observed no effect of light on AP bursts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1B</xref>). Altogether, these results indicate that spontaneously-released ACh acts through post-synaptic β2*nAChRs (i.e. receptors expressed on intra-VTA neurons, see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>) to bi-directionally modulate the tonic firing and increase the bursting activity of VTA DA neurons. This excitatory/inhibitory nicotinic drive is consistent with the duality of the responses observed upon optogenetic activation of pontine cholinergic axons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Dautan et al., 2016</xref>), yet it directly implicates nicotinic- and not muscarinic- ACh receptors. It is also consistent with the concurrent excitations and inhibitions observed in DA neurons upon nicotine systemic injections (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Eddine et al., 2015</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>Photo-controlling the effect of nicotine on VTA DA neurons</title><p>In WT mice, VTA DA neurons respond to nicotine with a rapid increase in firing frequency and in bursting activity, and these responses are totally absent in β2<sup>-/-</sup> mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Maskos et al., 2005</xref>).

We tested whether optically blocking β2*nAChRs of the VTA was sufficient to prevent nicotine from producing its reinforcing properties. To this aim, we chronically implanted above the transduced VTA a guide cannula for local delivery of the chemical photoswitch and light (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>) and subjected mice to a conditioned-place preference (CPP) protocol (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>). Proper transduction and placement of the cannula guide were confirmed immunohistochemically (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1A</xref>).

To determine whether nicotine preference could be reversibly photo-controlled in individual animals, CPP tests were conducted with two groups of β2E61C-transduced animals. Pairings were performed first with nicotine and 390 nm light for group 1, and with nicotine and 520 nm light for group 2. Two months after the first CPP test, nicotine pairing was performed with the alternative light condition, i.e. 520 nm light for group 1 and 390 nm light for group 2. For both groups, animals showed preference to nicotine under 520 but not under 390 nm light (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D,E</xref>). These results cannot be attributed to changes in general activity behavior, since locomotion was not affected by viral transduction or light (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1C</xref>). Altogether, these experiments show that nicotine-CPP can be reversibly switched on and off in the same animal, by manipulating β2*nAChRs selectively located in the VTA.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig5" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.37487.015</object-id><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><title>Reversibly disrupting nicotine preference.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Experimental design of the opto-fluidic device for opto-pharmacology experiments in freely-moving mice.

Classical opsin-based optogenetics aims at turning specific neurons on or off for decoding neural circuits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Kim et al., 2017</xref>). Our strategy expands the optogenetic toolbox beyond excitation and inhibition by providing acute interruption of neurotransmission at the post-synaptic level, and provides mechanistic understanding of how specific transmitters and receptors contribute to modulation of circuits and behaviors.</p><p>Our method for photosensitizing receptors relies on the covalent attachment of a chemical photoswitch on a cysteine-modified receptor mutant. The photochemical properties of the azobenzene photoswitch make this strategy ideally suited for reversibly controlling neurotransmitter receptors with high efficacy and at speeds that rival synaptic transmission (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Lemoine et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Levitz et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Lin et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Szobota et al., 2007</xref>). Comparatively, strategies for photosensitizing proteins based on the fusion of light-sensitive modules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Rost et al., 2017</xref>) or chromophore-assisted light-inactivation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Lin et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Takemoto et al., 2017</xref>) are too slow or irreversible, respectively. Due to the constrains of bioconjugation, in vivo use of photoswitch-tethered receptors in mice has been restricted to the eye (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Gaub et al., 2014</xref>) and to superficial layers of the cerebral cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Levitz et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Lin et al., 2015</xref>). Here, we demonstrate rapid on and off control of neuronal nAChRs in deep brain structures and in freely behaving animals. Our data show that photoswitch delivery resulted in an absolute subtype-specificity control of β2*nAChRs, with no apparent off-target effect. Labeling was rapid (minutes) and, due to its covalent nature, persisted for many hours (we have detected strong photosensitization in vivo up to 9 hr after treatment). Importantly, due to the thermal stability of MAHoCh, receptor function was unperturbed in darkness, while brief flashes of light were sufficient to bistably toggle LinAChR between its resting and antagonized states.</p><p>The cysteine-modified subunit was transduced in the VTA of WT mice. This resulted in a local replacement of the native β2 subunit with the cysteine-mutated version, while leaving nicotinic signaling in other brain regions (notably cholinergic pontine afferents) unaffected. Even though the WT β2 subunit remained in transduced cells, photoswitch treatment resulted in robust photo-sensitization of cysteine-mutated β2*nAChRs, indicating incorporation into heteromeric receptors. The pool of receptors remained apparently unchanged, most likely because endogenous nAChR subunits (e.g. α4) limit the total number of heteropentamers at the cell surface. Replacing the WT subunit by its cysteine counterpart in a knock-in animal would guarantee complete gene replacement and untouched expression profile. Yet, viral transduction affords the advantage of allowing the engineered receptor to be targeted for expression in specific types of neurons and in defined neuronal circuits. We used this feature to optically control nAChRs at the level of VTA neurons (both DAergic and non-DAergic cells, see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>), while leaving pre-synaptic receptors from various afferents unaffected, which would be impossible with a transgenic animal. Collectively, our results show that β2E61C competes with native subunits to form functional receptors that, once labeled with MAHoCh, retain their natural functions in darkness, and are made photo-controllable.</p><p>Cholinergic neurons from PPN and LDT project extensively to the VTA and substantia nigra (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Beier et al., 2015</xref>) and are thought to form connections with downstream DAergic and GABAergic neurons through non-synaptic volume transmission. Optogenetic activation of cholinergic pontine axons induces post-synaptic currents in VTA DA neurons that have both nicotinic and glutamatergic signatures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Xiao et al., 2016</xref>), suggesting that extracellular ACh potentiates glutamate release by activating nAChRs located on axon terminals. Contrasting with this view, we show here that activation of post-synaptic (i.e. from intra-site) β2 nAChRs by endogenous ACh is sufficient to fine tune both the tonic and burst firing modes of VTA DA neurons. Furthermore, our results add temporal and causal considerations to previous genetic studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Mameli-Engvall et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Tolu et al., 2013</xref>) by establishing a direct relationship between the activity of β2 nAChRs and the firing patterns of VTA DA neurons. The rebound activity that occurred within 500 ms after de-antagonizing LinAChRs indeed suggests that, even though cholinergic inputs to the VTA are considered sparse, the extracellular levels of ACh are sufficient to activate a large population of receptors and greatly modify the electrical activity of DA neurons. Moreover, we identified a sub-population of VTA DA neurons that is inhibited when β2 nAChRs are de-antagonized, which suggests multiple functional mechanisms by which the cholinergic brainstem neurons may influence the activity of midbrain DA neurons. These results are coherent with the growing body of evidence that show that VTA DA neurons are heterogeneous in their physiological properties (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Morales and Margolis, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Yang et al., 2018</xref>) and in their responses to drugs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Juarez and Han, 2016</xref>), including nicotine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Eddine et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>The rewarding properties of nicotine, and especially reinforcement during the acquisition phase of addiction, implicate an elevation of DA in the NAc (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Di Chiara and Imperato, 1988</xref>). Nicotine administration directly depolarizes and activates VTA DA neurons and, consequently, increases extracellular striatal DA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Maskos et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Tolu et al., 2013</xref>). Nicotine can also increase DA neuron firing by acting on GABAergic and glutamatergic afferent terminals, from local interneurons and projection fibers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Mansvelder et al., 2002</xref>). Finally, nicotine also modulates DA release by desensitizing nAChRs expressed in the striatum at the level of DA terminals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Rice and Cragg, 2004</xref>). These different studies suggest alternative circuit mechanisms to explain the outcome of nicotine action on VTA circuitry, for reviews see (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Juarez and Han, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Faure et al., 2014</xref>). We took advantage of the anatomical and cellular resolution of our approach, and locally blocked the effect of nicotine on VTA DA and non-DA neurons, while leaving pre-synaptic receptors of afferents from other brain areas and of striatal DA terminals unaffected. Our results show that β2*nAChRs of VTA neurons are a key player of both the response to nicotine at the cellular level, and the rewarding properties of this addictive substance at the behavioral level. Importantly, blocking the excitatory phasic input produced by nicotine was sufficient to completely prevent reinforcement learning. This is consistent with our results concerning the ability of β2 nAChRs to tune burst firing in DA neurons, and with the fact that activation of LDT-to-VTA cholinergic neurons causes positive reinforcement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Dautan et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Xiao et al., 2016</xref>). All together, these results strongly suggest that these receptors have a central role in reward processing.</p><p>There is a considerable interest to target-specific nAChRs and specific circuits to treat psychiatric disorders such as addiction, depression or schizophrenia. Yet, we do not know which native receptor subtype mediates specific physiological or pathological function, hampering development of clinically effective drugs, notably for preventing or treating addiction. Optogenetic pharmacology offers the unique opportunity to locally and reversibly ‘knock-out’ the function of a specific receptor isoform in vivo, and to directly evaluate within the same animal the consequences at the cellular, circuit and behavioral levels. Our approach should be applicable to other photo-activatable and -inhibitable nAChR subtypes and other neuronal circuits, and may provide a platform for examining new translational strategies for treating neuropsychiatric disorders.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources

Coronal midbrain sections (250 µm) were sliced using a Compresstome (VF-200; Precisionary Instruments) after intra-cardiac perfusion of cold (0–4°C) sucrose-based artificial cerebrospinal fluid (SB-aCSF) containing (in mM): 125 NaCl, 2.5 KCl, 1.25 NaH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>, 5.9 MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 26 NaHCO<sub>3</sub>, 25 Sucrose, 2.5 Glucose, 1 Kynurenate.

Cells were visualized using an upright microscope with a Dodt contrast lens and illuminated with a white light source (Scientifica). A 460 nm LED (pE-2, Cooled) was used for visualizing eGFP positive cells (using a bandpass filter cube, AHF). Optical stimulation was applied through the microscope with two LEDs (380 and 525 nm, pE-2, CoolLED), with a light output of 6.5 and 15 mW, corresponding to 5 and 11.7 mW/mm<sup>2</sup> at the focal plane, respectively. Whole-cell recordings were performed using a patch-clamp amplifier (Axoclamp 200B, Molecular Devices) connected to a Digidata (1550 LowNoise acquisition system, Molecular Devices). Currents were recorded in voltage-clamp mode at −60 mV. Signals were low pass filtered (Bessel, 2 kHz) and collected at 10 kHz using the data acquisition software pClamp 10.5 (Molecular Devices). Electrophysiological recordings were extracted using Clampfit (Molecular Devices) and analyzed with R.</p><p>To record nicotinic currents from GFP-positive Neuro2A cells, we used the following external solution (containing in mM): 140 NaCl, 2.8 KCl, 2 CaCl<sub>2</sub>, 2 MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 10 HEPES, 12 glucose (pH 7.3 with NaOH). We used a computer-controlled, fast-perfusion stepper system (SF-77B, Harvard Apparatus) to apply nicotine-tartrate (100 μM, Sigma-Aldrich) or carbamylcholine chloride (CCh, 1 mM, Sigma-Aldrich), with an interval of 2 min, under different light conditions.</p><p>To record nicotinic currents from VTA DA neurons, local puffs (500 ms) of nicotine tartrate (30–500 μM in aCSF) were applied every minute, while alternating wavelengths, using a glass pipette (2–3 μm diameter) positioned 20 to 30 μm away from the soma and connected to a picospritzer (World Precision Instruments, adjusted to ~2 psi). DA neurons were characterized in current clamp mode as described in (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Lammel et al., 2008</xref>), see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2A</xref>.

The scalp was opened and a hole was drilled in the skull above the location of the VTA. The saphenous vein was catheterized for intravenous administration of nicotine. Prior to recordings (at least 1 hr), 500 nl of a 400 μM solution of MAHoCh in aCSF were injected within the VTA at a rate of 50 nl/min. Extracellular recording electrodes were made from 1.5 mm O.D./1.17 mm I.D. borosilicate glass (Harvard Apparatus) using a vertical electrode puller (Narishige). Under a microscope, the tip was broken to obtain a diameter of 1–2 µm. The electrodes were filled with a 0.5% Na-Acetate solution containing 1.5% of neurobiotin tracer yielding impedances of 20–50 MΩ. Electrophysiological signals were amplified with a headstage (1x, Axon Instruments) coupled to a high-impedance amplifier (Axoclamp-2A, Axon Instruments) and audio monitored (A.M. Systems Inc.). The signal was digitized (Micro-2, Cambridge Electronic Design), sampled at 12.5 kHz and recorded using Spike2 software (CED). DA neurons were sampled in the VTA with the following coordinates: [AP: −3 to −4 mm; ML:+0.3 to+0.6 mm; DV: −4 to −4.8 mm, from Bregma]. Spontaneously active pDA neurons were identified on the basis of previously established electrophysiological criteria: 1) regular firing rate; 2) firing frequency between 1 and 10 Hz; 3) half AP &gt;1.1 ms. After a baseline recording of at least 5 min, a saline solution (0.9% sodium chloride) was injected into the saphenous vein, and after another 10 min, injections of nicotine- tartrate (30 μg/kg) were administered via the same route in a final volume of 10 μl and under different light conditions (Dark – 390 nm – 520 nm). Successive injections (up to 6) were performed after the neuron returned to its baseline, or when the firing activity returned stable for at least 3 min. Light was applied through an optical fiber (500 µm core, NA = 0.5, Prizmatix) inserted within the glass pipette electrode and coupled through a combiner to 390/520 nm ultra-high-power LEDs (Prizmatix), yielding an output intensity of 4–8 mW at the tip of the fiber for each wavelength. Light was TTL-controlled and applied 10 s before nicotine injection, for 30 s total. When possible, neurons were electroporated and neurobiotin was expulsed from the electrode using positive current pulses as already described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Pinault, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Eddine et al., 2015</xref>). Spikes Within Bursts (SWB) were identified as a sequence of spikes with the following features: (1) short intervals, (2) progressively decreasing spike amplitude, and (3) a progressively increasing inter-spike interval (ISI). When considering extracellular recordings, most studies use two criteria to automatically detect bursts: (1) their onset are defined by two consecutive spikes with an interval inferior to 80 ms, whenever (2) they are closed with an interval greater than 160 ms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Grace and Bunney, 1984</xref>). Firing rate and %SWB were measured on successive windows of 60 s, with a 45 s overlapping period. Responses to nicotine are presented as the mean percentage of firing frequency or %SWB variation from the baseline ±SEM. For photoswitching, maximum of firing variation induced by nicotine occurring 200 s after the injection in purple and green was normalized to the maximum of firing variation in darkness. Spikes were extracted with Spike2 (CED) and analyzed with R (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.r-project.org">https://www.r-project.org</ext-link>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-11"><title>In vivo multi-unit extracellular recordings</title><p>4–8 weeks after viral infection, mice were deeply anaesthetized with chloral hydrate (8%, 400 mg/kg i.p.), supplemented as required to maintain optimal anesthesia throughout the experiment. The scalp was opened and a hole was drilled in the skull above the location of the VTA. We used a MiniMatrix (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>, Thomas Recording) allowing us to lower within the VTA: up to 3 tetrodes (Tip shape A, Thomas Recording, Z = 1–2 MΩ), a stainless-steel cannula (OD 120 μm, Thomas Recording) for photoswitch injection and a tip-shaped quartz optical fiber (100 μm core, NA = 0.22, Thomas Recording) for photostimulation. The fiber was coupled to a 390/520 nm LED combiner (Prizmatix) with an output intensity of 200–500 μW at the tip of the fiber for both wavelengths. These five elements could be moved independently with micrometer precision. 500 nl of MAHoCh (400 μM in aCSF) were infused (rate: 1 nl/s) within the VTA, and tetrodes were subsequently lowered in the same zone to record neurons. Spontaneously active pDA neurons were recorded at least 30 min after MAHoCh infusion and were identified on the basis of the electrophysiological criteria used for juxtacellular recordings. The optical fiber was then lowered 100–200 μm above the tetrodes. Baseline activity was recorded for 200 s in darkness, prior to applying 5 s light flashes of alternative wavelengths (390 nm / 520 nm). Electrophysiological signals were acquired with a 20 channels pre-amplifier included in the Mini Matrix (Thomas Recording) connected to an amplifier (Digital Lynx SX 32 channels, Neuralynx) digitized and recorded using Cheetah software (Neuralynx). Spikes were detected using a custom-written Matlab routine and sorted using a classical principal component analysis associated with a cluster cutting method (SpikeSort3D Software, Neuralynx). Neurons were considered as responding when their change in firing rate (% Photoswitching) at the transition from violet to green light exceeded a threshold of 15%, defined as the maximal % photoswitching observed in controls. This threshold was used for all recorded neurons in every condition. To extract the spikes contained within bursting episodes (SWB) we used the same criteria described in the juxtacellular recordings section. They are represented as the frequency of SWB because of the short analysis window (5 s). All the data were analyzed with R (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.r-project.org">https://www.r-project.org</ext-link>) and Matlab (MathWorks).</p></sec><sec id="s4-12"><title>Chronic guide cannula implantation</title><p>Following stereotaxic viral infection in the VTA (as described above), mice were implanted with a chronic opto-fluid guide cannula (Doric Lenses Inc, Canada, see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>) using the same coordinates. This guide (length = 3 mm from skull surface, ID/OD = 320/430 μm) has interchangeable threaded connectors and is used either with a fluid injection needle (protruding to 4.8 mm from skull surface) for delivering MAHoCh, or with an optic fiber injector (240 μm core, NA = 0.63, protruding to 4.8 mm from skull surface) coupled to a ceramic ferrule (1.25 mm) for light delivery. In-between experiments, a plug is used to close the guide cannula and thus seal the implant. The implant is attached to the skull with a dental cement (SuperBond, Sun Medical).</p></sec><sec id="s4-13"><title>Nicotine-induced place preference paradigm</title><p>The Conditioned Place Preference (CPP) box (Imetronic, France) consists of a Y-maze with one closed arm, and two other arms with manually operated doors. Two rectangular chambers (11 × 25 cm) with different cues (texture and color), are separated by a center triangular compartment (side of 11 cm). One pairing compartment has grey textured floor and walls and the other one has smooth black and white striped walls and floor. The first day (pretest) of the experiment, mice (n = 6–8 animals/group) explored the environment for 900 s (15 min) and the time spent in each compartment was recorded. Pretest data were used to segregate the animals with equal bias so each group has an initial preference score almost null, indicating no preference on average. On day 2, 3 and 4, animals received an i.p. injection of nicotine tartrate (0.5 mg/kg, in PBS) or an equivalent injection of saline (PBS), and immediately confined to one of the pairing chamber for 1200 s (20 min). The CPP test was performed using a single nicotine concentration (0.5 mg/kg) which is known to induce preference in mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Walters et al., 2006</xref>). Groups were balanced so the animals do not always get nicotine in the same chamber. On the evening of the same day, mice received an injection of the alternate solution (nicotine or saline) and were placed in the opposite pairing chamber. The saline control animals received a saline injection in both pairing compartments. On day 5 (test), animals were allowed to explore the whole open-field for 900 s (15 min), and the time spent in each chamber was recorded. The preference score (ps) is expressed in seconds and is calculated by subtracting pretest from test data. Trajectories and time spent on each side are calculated based upon animal detection. Place preference and locomotor activity were recorded using a video camera, connected to a video-track system, out of sight of the experimenter. A home-made software (Labview 2014, National Instruments) tracked the animal, recorded its trajectory (20 frames per s) for 15 min and sent TTL pulses to the LED controller when appropriate (pairing sessions). For optogenetic pharmacology experiments, MAHoCh (400 μM in aCSF, 500 nl in 5 min) was injected early in the morning of pairing days (2, 3 and 4) under light gas anesthesia (Isoflurane 1%). 520/390 nm light was applied during pairing sessions (day 2, 3 and 4), on both sides, through a patch cord (500 μm core, NA = 0.5, Prizmatix, Israel) connected to the implanted ferrule with a sleeve and to the 390/520 nm combined UHP-LEDs (Prizmatix). Light was applied with the following pattern: 2 s pulses à 0.1 Hz with a measured output intensity of 10 mW at the tip of the patch cord. Light was not applied during pre-test and test. Behavioral data were collected and analyzed using home-made LabVIEW (National Instruments) and Matlab (MathWorks) routines.</p></sec><sec id="s4-14"><title>Immunohistochemistry</title><p>After patch-clamp experiments, individual slices (250 μm) were transferred in 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) for 12–24 hr and then to PBS, and kept at 4°C.

In the case of biocytin/neurobiotin labelling, TH identification of the neuron was performed using AMCA-conjugated Streptavidin (Jackson ImmunoResearch) at 1:200 dilution. Floating pons sections were incubated 1 hr at 4°C in a solution of phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.2% Gelatine from cold-water fish skin (Sigma; G7041) and 0.25% Triton X-100 (PBS-GT) and then incubated overnight at 4°C a goat anti-Choline Acetyl-Transferase antibody (ChAT, Merck-Millipore, AB144) at 1:200 dilution and a chicken anti-GFP antibody (Aves Lab, GFP-1020) at 1:500 dilution in PBS-GT.

Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Gary Westbrook as the Senior Editor. The following individuals involved in review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Robert Wickham (Reviewer #2) and Stephanie J Cragg (Reviewer #3). The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary of reviews and post-review discussion</p><p>Durand de-Cotelli et al., uses a highly innovative approach to assess the β2*nAChR's responsiveness to nicotine in vivo as well as to assess this receptor's function in nicotine reward. Previous knockout work is limited due to potential compensatory changes by loss of the β2*nAChR, and pharmacological treatment non-selectively targets non DAergic neurons as well as DAergic neurons, making it challenging to assign a direct function to DAergic β2*nAChRs. This approach may be able to get around these two problems by directly activating/inactivate somatic β2*nAChRs in the VTA. In general, the reviewers were appreciative of the study, but they all agreed that the manuscript suffers from key overinterpretations which limited their enthusiasm. In a nutshell, they questioned the claim (repeatedly made throughout the manuscript and in the title) that the manipulation is specific to &quot;somatic&quot; β2*nAChRs&quot;. The original reviews are summarized below with the essential points that must be addressed in the revision:</p><p>1) It is not clear why the actions described here couldn't involve other non-DA cells and afferents that input to the recorded VTA DA neurons. There is no cell-specific targeting. From the description provided in the manuscript, it seems as if the virus containing the β2E61C construct is transfected in all neurons in the VTA, which should mean pre and post-synaptic neurons should be activated upon light stimulation. Thus, it is unclear how the manipulation only target &quot;somatic&quot;, i.e. postsynaptic, β2*nAChRs. Of note, similar lentiviral methods which the authors cite (Maskos et al., 2005) result in expression in at least DA and GABA neurons in VTA. The authors Figure 4—figure supplement 1A also shows strong GFP where there is no TH (e.g. bottom right). Even the β2<sup>-/-</sup> manipulation is not targeted to DA neurons but is global. The authors strongly intimate postsynaptic &quot;somatic&quot; nAChRs on DA neurons but other sources have simply not been excluded or controlled for. Thus, the authors must provide experimental evidence that their β2E61C is localized to &quot;somatic&quot; compartments. In the CPP experiments notably, direct demonstration of an absence of presynaptic β2*nAChR contribution is necessary (a possible control could be to show that eGFP is not expressed in pedunculopontine and laterodorsal tegmental nuclei).</p><p>2) What is the evidence that stereotaxic injection of PGK-β2E61C-Ires-EGFP lentivirus in the VTA does not transduce presynaptic cholinergic afferents or GABAergic neurons of the VTA? The authors argue that the control of DA firing is only on the control of the somatic post synaptic β2*nAChR expressed in DA VTA neurons but it lacks the demonstration that their stereotactic injection of PGK-β2E61C-Ires-EGFP lentivirus in the VTA does not transduce presynaptic cholinergic afferents. It could be easily done by showing that eGFP is not expressed in pedunculopontine and laterodorsal tegmental nuclei.</p><p>3) In the Discussion, the authors revisit an old debate to distinguish the role of nAChRs in VTA versus DA terminals in nicotine reinforcement because &quot;Nicotine can also induce DA release through pre-synaptic effects, either directly in the striatum at the level of DA terminals&quot;. They are revisiting an old argument to which they have previously contributed and which many have previously addressed. It has previously been discussed that the actions of nicotine at axon terminals appear to involve primarily desensitization (not inducing release) which magnifies the effects of a change in DA neuron firing rate (previous works by Dani, Maskos, Faure, Exley, Cragg). Terminal effects of nAChRs might depend upon changes in DA neuron firing rate. The authors have again revisited the mistakes of the past and concluded that receptors outside of VTA are not important for nicotine reinforcement, which they have not shown here. The writing needs to be more accurate.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.37487.021</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Summary of reviews and post-review discussion</p></disp-quote><p><italic>Durand de-Cotelli et al., uses a highly innovative approach to assess the β2*nAChR's responsiveness to nicotine</italic> in vivo <italic>as well as to assess this receptor's function in nicotine reward.

We agree that our viral strategy does not allow specific targeting of VTA DA neurons, and that photo-manipulation is not restricted to “somatic” receptors. Hence, we removed the word “somatic” from the title. In fact, we changed the title to add emphasis to the technology. The new title is: “Manipulating midbrain dopamine neurons and reward-related behaviors with light-controllable nicotinic acetylcholine receptors”. In addition, we now clearly show that LinAChR expression is restricted to VTA neurons and is absent in afferents from other brain areas. Please see below for a point-by-point answer to the reviewers’ concerns. We combined the answers to points 1 and 2, since they were tightly related.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1) It is not clear why the actions described here couldn't involve other non-DA cells and afferents that input to the recorded VTA DA neurons.

We used a lentiviral vector with a ubiquitous pGK promoter to express β2 LinAChR in VTA neurons (both DA and non-DA cells). Non-DA VTA neurons include GABAergic interneurons; hence, LinAChRs are potentially expressed both at somato-dendritic and at terminal (i.e. pre-synaptic) sites within the VTA. Importantly, we have verified that they were absent in afferents that input VTA neurons. We modified the manuscript in several ways to make this clear. First, we changed Figure 2B (immunocytochemistry) and the associated text to clearly show that, within the VTA, GFP could be found both in tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) positive and negative (i.e. DA and non-DA) neurons. We also added a scheme in Figure 2 to illustrate the expression profile of LinAChRs within the VTA. Second, we modified the Introduction slightly to clearly explain where native nAChRs are expressed (within the VTA and on extra-VTA afferents) and added one reference (Grady et al., 2007); the original sentence lacked precision. Third, we show that GFP is absent in LDT and PPN afferent neurons (new Figure 2—figure supplement 1), in agreement with the absence of retrograde transport capacities of lentiviral vectors (Mazarakis et al., 2001). Hence LinAChRs are only expressed in intra-VTA neurons. Finally, since photocontrol is specific to neurons of the VTA but could involve pre-synaptic nAChRs on GABAergic interneurons, we changed the title (as mentioned above) and modified the Results and Discussion sections where necessary, to avoid using the words “somatic” or “post-synaptic” as much as possible. We hope this new version of the manuscript addresses the reviewer’s concerns satisfactorily.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) In the Discussion, the authors revisit an old debate to distinguish the role of nAChRs in VTA versus DA terminals in nicotine reinforcement because &quot;Nicotine can also induce DA release through pre-synaptic effects, either directly in the striatum at the level of DA terminals&quot;.

We did not aim at revisiting an old debate, rather we aimed at illustrating the fact that our technology makes it possible to manipulate nAChRs in specific sub-cellular compartments, for instance intra-VTA neurons, without affecting nAChRs in DA terminals. This is clearly not possible with other techniques such as viral re-expression strategies, and we wanted to emphasize this aspect. Reviewer is right concerning our lack of precision though. We modified the paragraph in the Discussion according to the reviewer’s comments. Notably we modified the sentence concerning the effects of nicotine at the level of DA terminals, which now is: “nicotine also modulates DA release by desensitizing nAChRs expressed in the striatum at the level of DA terminals”. We also changed “main” by “key” players concerning β2 nAChRs of the VTA. We hope reviewer will be satisfied by the new version.</p></body></sub-article></article>
