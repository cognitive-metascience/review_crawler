Here we present an integrated neuro-histological pipeline as well as a grid-based tracer injection strategy for systematic mesoscale connectivity mapping in the common marmoset (<italic>Callithrix jacchus</italic>). Individual brains are sectioned into ~1700 20 Âµm sections using the tape transfer technique, permitting high quality 3D reconstruction of a series of histochemical stains (Nissl, myelin) interleaved with tracer labeled sections. Systematic in-vivo MRI of the individual animals facilitates injection placement into reference-atlas defined anatomical compartments. Further, by combining the resulting 3D volumes, containing informative cytoarchitectonic markers, with in-vivo and ex-vivo MRI, and using an integrated computational pipeline, we are able to accurately map individual brains into a common reference atlas despite the significant individual variation. This approach will facilitate the systematic assembly of a mesoscale connectivity matrix together with unprecedented 3D reconstructions of brain-wide projection patterns in a primate brain.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>marmoset</kwd><kwd>high-throughput pipeline</kwd><kwd>mesoscale</kwd><kwd>tape-transfer method</kwd><kwd>registration</kwd><kwd>annotation</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Other</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000923</institution-id><institution>Australian Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>CE140100007</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Rosa</surname><given-names>Marcello GP</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100009619</institution-id><institution>Japan Agency for Medical Research and Development</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>JP17dm0207001</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Okano</surname><given-names>Hideyuki</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100005603</institution-id><institution>Clay Mathematics Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Crick-Clay Professorship</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Mitra</surname><given-names>Partha</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100003845</institution-id><institution>Indian Institute of Technology Madras</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>HN Mahabala Chair</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Mitra</surname><given-names>Partha</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100001229</institution-id><institution>Mathers Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Mitra</surname><given-names>Partha</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>A systematic high-throughput neurohistological and computational pipeline for marmoset which establishes a foundational setup in brain mapping and circuit tracing to support current and emerging research in primate studies.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The connectional architecture of the brain underlies all the nervous system functions, yet our knowledge of detailed brain neural connectivity falls largely behind genomics and behavioral studies in humans and in model research species such as rodents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bohland et al., 2009</xref>). To fill this critical gap, a coherent approach for the mapping of whole-brain neural circuits at the mesoscale using standardized methodology was proposed in 2009 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bohland et al., 2009</xref>). Since then, several systematic brain connectivity mapping projects for the mouse have been initialized and established, including the Mouse Brain Architecture Project (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Pinskiy et al., 2015</xref>) (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.brainarchitecture.org">www.brainarchitecture.org</ext-link>), the Allen Mouse Brain Connectivity Atlas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Oh et al., 2014</xref>) (connectivity.brain-map.org), and the Mouse Connectome Project (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.mouseconnectome.org">www.mouseconnectome.org</ext-link><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.mouseconnectome.org)">)</ext-link> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Zingg et al., 2014</xref>). Non-human primates (NHPs) were also proposed as an important group in which to study whole-brain neural architecture. However, the high-throughput experimental approaches for mouse do not automatically apply to NHPs due to bioethical as well as experimental considerations, larger brain sizes coupled with stringent limitations on the numbers, as well as limitations arising from the increased individual variability of the brains.</p><p>There has been an increase in the usage of the common marmoset (<italic>Callithrix jacchus</italic>) as a model organism in contemporary neuroscience research (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Izpisua Belmonte et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Kishi et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Miller et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Okano and Kishi, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Okano et al., 2016</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1</xref>). Marmosets offer a number of experimental advantages over the macaque, including lower cost, ease of handling and breeding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Kishi et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Okano and Mitra, 2015</xref>), smaller brain sizes (â35 mm*25 mm*20 mm) that potentially allow more comprehensive analysis of the neuronal circuitry, and importantly the development of transgenic marmosets and the application of modern molecular tools (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Park et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Sasaki et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Sato et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>Marmosets are New World monkeys, in contrast with the Old World macaque monkeys which are the pre-eminent NHP models used in basic and pre-clinical neuroscience research. As depicted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref>, New World monkeys, together with Old World monkeys, apes and humans, form the simian primates (order Primates, infraorder Simiiformes). Simians diverged from prosimians such as lemurs and lorises approximately 85 million years ago (Mya). Among the simians, New World monkeys have evolved in isolation from Old World monkeys, apes and humans for at least 40 million years. <italic>Prima facie</italic> this seems to indicate a relative weakness in using marmosets as NHP models in contrast with the macaques. Nevertheless, a good case can be made for marmosets as NHP models of humans, despite the earlier evolutionary divergence.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.40042.002</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Phylogenetic tree of extinct and extant primates and numbers of injection sites achieved (in grid-based tracer mapping) for mouse and marmoset.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) Phylogenetic tree (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Benton et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">dos Reis et al., 2014</xref>;Â <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">dos Reis et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Janecka et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">O'Leary et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Mitchell and Leopold, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Springer et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Wilkinson et al., 2011</xref>) showing the ancestral history of extinct and extant primates, after divergence from the common ancestor with rodents (top right inset box) <italic>ca.</italic> 75 million years (Myr) ago.

Marmoset brains are smaller than macaque brains and are comparable in size to some rodents (cf. squirrels and capybara, both species of rodents, have brain volumes comparable to marmosets and macaques). However marmosets are phylogenetically closer to humans than rodents, and thus have more commonality in terms of brain architecture (proportionately larger and more differentiated higher order cortical areas, as opposed to primary cortical areas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Krubitzer and Dooley, 2013</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>).</p><p>Following the BRAIN (Brain Research through Advancing Innovative Neurotechnologies) Initiative in the U.S. and the HBP (Human Brain Project) in Europe in 2013, Japan launched the Brain/MINDS project (Brain Mapping by Integrated Neurotechnologies of Disease Studies) with a focus on the common marmoset (<italic>Callithrix jacchus</italic>) as an NHP model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Okano and Mitra, 2015</xref>) (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.brainminds.jp/">http://www.brainminds.jp/</ext-link>).

By surveying 35 tract tracing studies (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref>) in marmosets since the 1970s, we have collected data from over 400 injections, but much of this knowledge cannot be easily integrated with current efforts given the use of older nomenclatures, and the lack of access to primary data. A full connectivity matrix is yet to be established (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>). Nevertheless existing knowledge about the marmoset visual, auditory, and motor systems indicate strong similarities between marmoset and macaque brain circuitry, suggesting a preserved brain connectivity plan across primates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bakola et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">de la Mothe et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Solomon and Rosa, 2014</xref>). Comparing two NHP brain architectures (marmoset, macaque) will help to better contextualize human brain circuit architecture.</p><p>None of these earlier studies in NHPs have used a single, consistent methodology employing a unified experimental-computational workflow, dedicated to systematic mesoscale connectivity mapping. In addition, an automated throughput image analysis is required for the whole-brain circuit reconstruction and mapping (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Hua et al., 2015</xref>). This became the goal of the pipeline described in this paper. Importantly, brain-wide data sets are already available for grid-based tracer mapping projects in the mouse. A corresponding data set generated using similar techniques will allow us to gain a more unified view of primate brain connectivity architecture, and also permit an unprecedented comparative analysis of mesoscale connectivity in rodents and primates.</p><sec id="s1-1"><title>The injection-grid approach to whole-brain mesoscale connectivity mapping</title><p>Mapping the brain-wide neural circuitry in large vertebrate brains remains one of the most important tasks in neuroscience, yet raises tremendous practical and theoretical challenges. The ideal data set would contain the position, morphology, synaptic connectivity together with transmitter/receptor identities at each synapse, and also spatial maps of the diffuse neuromodulatory transmitters and receptors of every neuron. This is clearly not achievable in practical terms. For example, EM based mapping of individual synaptic connectivity and morphology of every neuron remains impractical for a brain as large as the marmoset.</p><p>Even if comprehensive mapping was performed in one brain, there would remain the problem of individual variation across brains, which would ideally require doing the same detailed map for many brains. All current approaches to this problem therefore constitute practical compromises (e.g. EM mapping of synaptic connectivity for larger vertebrate brains is currently confined to small brain regions). The grid-injection based approach achieves brain-wide coverage but sacrifices the detailed synaptic connectivity, revealing a species-specific, coarse-grained circuit architecture. The availability of 3D volumetric data sets at light microscopic resolution, with the possibility of quantitative analysis and across-brain comparisons, sets this approach apart from classical neuroanatomical studies which are more targeted (e.g. to individual brain regions for injection placement, possibly to test specific hypotheses) and have largely been carried out in the era before digitizing whole brains was practical.</p><p>Within the broad approach, some questions need to be addressed: treatment of individual variation across brains, relation to classical neuroanatomical approaches based on atlas-parcellations, and technical sources of variation, being the difficulty in controlling the locations and sizes of injections, and most importantly the total number of injections. We briefly comment on these inter-related considerations here as they pertain to the design of our injection grid-plan. In the later discussion section, we present some analysis of the degree of individual variation in the data set gathered for this project, and considerations related to completing whole-brain coverage. Further information may be found in Appendix 9 and 10.</p></sec><sec id="s1-2"><title>Planning the grid</title><p>Classical neuroanatomical reference atlases list hundreds of individual gray-matter regions or cell groups (including cortical regions and subcortical nuclei), separated by more or less well-defined boundaries. Within regions, continuous gradients may be present. These atlases were developed largely based on the spatial distributions of morphologies and chemo-architectures of the neuronal somata, and to a lesser extent on the connection architecture. As new information becomes available from modern techniques, these atlases are likely to change, also the atlases do not provide <italic>prima facie</italic> information about individual variation, as they are based on an individual brain (or more recently on averages across brains). It is important to take into account the accumulated knowledge represented by these atlases in planning a grid; on the other hand, the atlases themselves represent imperfect knowledge, and sampling brain-space on a regular grid could itself reveal the necessary meso-architecture.</p><p>We adopt a compromise, by starting from a roughly regular grid, working backwards from the total number of injections that can realistically be placed/processed within a practical time frame (of several years) and within the constraint of the availability of experimental animals. We therefore started with a grid spacing ofÂ ~2 mm, but then adapted the grid in the following ways: (i) grid points overlapping with atlas boundaries were moved to be closer to compartment centers; (ii) atlas compartments smaller than 8 mm^3 were assigned injections upto a size cutoff. Placing this size cutoff at 0.27 mm^3 produces a total of 356 injection centers in 241 target structures in one hemisphereâs grey matter. In cerebral cortex, this corresponds to 221 injection centers in 118 target structures, comprising 74% of the total grey matter volume. Details are presented in Appendix 9.</p><p>We inject each site with an anterograde and a retrograde tracer (in separate animals). To maximize utilization of animals we place four injections/animal, 2 anterograde and two retrograde. Our approach is conservative: better availability and utilization of colors in the tracers could permit more injections per animal. Notably, we are able to process significantly more injections per animal than is possible with single-color 2-photon light microscopy, which is important for a primate species such as the marmoset to minimize the number of animals used.</p></sec><sec id="s1-3"><title>Individual variation</title><p>Classical neuroanatomical studies may place multiple injections in separate animals at a single target to address biological variation. This is impractical for the current approach, it would require too many animals. Nevertheless, we achieve an effective NÂ =Â 2 per long range projection when combining the results of anterograde and retrograde tracing. Additionally, we tailor injections to the individual variations in animals when using in-vivo MRI guidance to target specific sub-cortical nuclei and using landmarks in injecting cortical sites. Finally, results from different animals are mapped onto a common reference atlas using diffeomorphic mapping utilizing the cytoarchitectonic contrast present in the multimodal histological data gathered in the pipeline. In these ways the grid-approach addresses the issues of individual variation. An analysis of brain compartment size variations across animals, as well as of the injection-size variations, is presented in Appendix 10.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><p>A high throughput neurohistological pipeline was established at the RIKEN Center for Brain Science, based on the pipeline developed for the MBA project (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Pinskiy et al., 2015</xref>) at CSHL.

Each brain was sectioned serially into a successive series of four 20 Î¼m sections: a Nissl stained section, a silver (Gallyas) myelin stained section, a section stained (ABC-DAB) for the injected cholera toxin subunit B (CTB) tracer and an unstained section imaged using epifluorescence microscopy to visualize the results of fluorescent tracer injections. Three types of fluorescent neural tracers were injected into the brain to reveal the mesoscale neural connectivity.

This atlas-informed reconstruction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Lee et al., 2018</xref>) improved reconstruction accuracy compared to the atlas-uninformed neighbor-to-neighbor method, as well as reduced the deformable metric cost. The impact of the ex-vivo MRI constraint on the 3D reconstruction is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref> (right). A visible distortion is present in the MRI-unguided reconstruction. The degree of shrinkage is 7% from <italic>in-</italic> to ex-vivo MRI and 1% from ex-vivo MRI to histology. This distortion is corrected by a MRI-guided method using a reference atlas. The MRI-constrained alignment of the Nissl sections produces a Nissl volume which closely resembles the convex hull of the same-subject MRI, leading to accurate parcellation of the brains in question.</p></sec></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>Brain volumes generated by the combined pipeline were further subjected to automated cross-modal registration and atlas segmentation, to obtain a regional connectivity matrix.</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>Connectivity mapping</title><p>The registration process permitted brain surface reconstruction (<xref ref-type="video" rid="video1">Video 1</xref>), 3D visualizations of projections, and virtual cuts in other planes of section than the original coronal sections (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>; right).

The pipeline combines the well-established neuroanatomical protocols with automated instrumentation and a software system for greatly improving the efficiency of the techniques compared to conventional manually-intensive processing. Access to high-quality in-vivo and the ex-vivo MRI provided us with important auxiliary data sets facilitating re-assembly of the section images and atlas mapping, thus ameliorating the challenges arising from increased individual variations in brain geometry in an NHP compared with laboratory mice.</p><p>It is important to compare with other microscopic methods that have become established in recent years for light-microscope based anatomy, including serial block-face two photon scanning microscopy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Denk and Horstmann, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Osten and Margrie, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Svoboda and Yasuda, 2006</xref>) and light sheet microscopy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Glaser et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Nikon, 2018</xref>), as well as knife-edge scanning microscopy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Mayerich et al., 2008</xref>). While these methods have important advantages, particularly the reduced need for section-to-section registration to produce the initial 3D volumes for further analysis, the classical methods have the important advantage of carrying through conventional histochemistry without major protocol alterations, producing long-lasting stains and precipitates that can be imaged using brightfield microscopy. Classical Nissl and myelin stains remain the gold standard for cytoarchitectonic texture-based determination of precise brain region location and delineation. These series are produced routinely with ease in the pipeline. The thin physical sections can be imaged rapidly in whole-slide imaging scanners and at relatively high numerical aperture (resolution in light sheet microscopy is comparatively limited due to reduced NA in the bulk of the sample).</p><sec id="s4-1"><title>Individual variation in brain anatomy in the marmoset</title><p>Previous studies aimed at generating population based atlases onÂ non-human primates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Black et al., 2001b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Black et al., 2001b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Feng et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Hikishima et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Quallo et al., 2010</xref>) have focused on mapping individual brains to a common mean template. Individual variations were addressed in terms of variation in stereotaxic coordinates of major landmarks such as sulci (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Black et al., 2001a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Black et al., 2001b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Hikishima et al., 2011</xref>). A few studies have explicitly reported variations in brain sizes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Hikishima et al., 2011</xref>) but we did not find an analysis of variations of individual regions, or co-variations across regions.</p><p>The data gathered in the project permits an a-posteriori analysis of individual variations in brain anatomy and cytoarchitecture. While a comprehensive analysis has to be left for a future study using this data, we summarize a few observations based on a partial analysis. Within a sample of 26 cases, the whole brain volume had a median of 8222.5 mm<sup>3</sup> with a median absolute deviation (MAD) of 319.4 mm<sup>3</sup>. In comparison to the Paxinos/Hasikawa (Brain/MINDS) template (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hashikawa et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Hikishima et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Woodward et al., 2018</xref>), our animals were older and mostly heavier than the template brain animal. Yet the brain sizes were similar to the template brain. We did not find a significant relationship between whole brain volume and age or body weight (see Appendix 10) within our data set. Nevertheless, some individual compartment sizes significantly departed from the template brain (e.g. the Hippocampal formation showed a consistently smaller size), indicating that the template brain may not be representative of a population average. Quantitative analysis of the covariation of cytoarchitectonic structure across the whole marmoset brain, in a significantly sized sample, is possible with the data gathered in the current study and will be carried out in the near future. We expect that the reference atlas may need to be revised based on the results of such a study.</p></sec><sec id="s4-2"><title>Injection size variations and localization within compartments</title><p>Based on a preliminary analysis, 73% of the injections placed are localized within atlas-determined anatomical compartments, whereas 27% showed some spread across boundaries. Manual analysis of a subset of 15 injections showed diameters in the range 0.8 mm-2.5mm, indicating rough correspondence with the desired grid spacing. Among these 15 injections, six had tracer spread beyond the compartment boundary. On average, for these six injections, about 68% of the volume was restrained within the same region as the injection center, while about 32% of the volume leaked outside to adjacent regions.</p></sec><sec id="s4-3"><title>Combining injections with those from previous studies to increase sample size</title><p>We were able to combine subsets of the injections placed in this study with injections in previous studies, as well as data gathered in collaborating laboratories, to generate and test specific hypotheses, indicating the utility of the data gathered in the project (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Lee et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Majka et al., 2018</xref>). In addition, analysis of injection centers show proximity/overlap of injections from a previous data set from the Rosa laboratory for which 3D spatial information is available (Appendix 10). This should permit virtually increasing N for this project.</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>Completion of Brain-wide coverage in the marmoset</title><p>An estimate of the total number of injections that will provide brain-wide coverage, in the hybrid grid-approach adopted in the paper depends on the lower cutoff placed on atlas compartments to be injected. To obtain an upper bound, we assume a cutoff of 0.8 mm^3 (corresponding to the smallest injections we placed so far), which corresponds to 356 sites (712 injections). So far, 190 injections have been placed in 49 brains. To cover the rest of the brain, 264 more injections would be placed in the cortex, and 258 injections in subcortical regions and cerebellum. This would require 131 brains. The current pipeline has achieved a maximum capacity of 2 brains/month. At this rate, a complete marmoset mesoscale connectivity map would be available by 2024. However, we expect that the process can be sped up considerably by multiple groups working together in a collaborative manner using similar methods. Such a project would necessarily need to have international scope and can be expected to be transformative for our understanding of primate brain architecture.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Larger brains</title><p>The pipeline described here is for 1 Ã 3 inch glass slides that fortunately are large enough to accommodate marmoset brains in coronal section. The pipeline can be generalized in the future to 2 Ã 3 inch slides, which can handle larger brains (such as that of macaque), with a few technical innovations, importantly inÂ stainers/coverslippers for the larger format slides. This should allow the easy and economical neurohistological processing of larger sized vertebrate brains, opening up the possibilities of applying modern computational neuroanatomical techniques to a significantly broader taxonomic range of species, allowing for the study of comparative neuroanatomical questions with unprecedented computational depth.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>The authors would like to acknowledge Tetsuo Yamamori, Akiya Watakabe and Hiroaki Mizukami at RIKEN Center for Brain Science (CBS) for providing the virus tracers.

(Â±1%) isoflurane in oxygen and received an intraperitoneal injection of sterile saline (3 ml) to avoid dehydration during the procedure. Throughout the entire procedure, a mixture of oxygen and 2% (Â±0.5%) isoflurane was administered to maintain anesthesia. A custom-made head holder (Qualita Ltd., Saitama, Japan) was used to fix the marmoset head within the imaging tube, such that the rostral-caudal axis of the head was stereotaxically aligned with the tube. A small glass capillary with a contrast agent was used in each ear bar, such that the positions of the ear bars would be visible in the MRI images. A heating pad was used to maintain the body temperature.

Correcting or improving the pipeline process was an evolutionary and organic process and flagging unwanted sections or materials to reduce unnecessary post-processing was a key step. The researcher had the option to view all the sections of the series (with the comparison of a micro image) and to edit the fields for QC such as tissue damage, missing sections and poor cover-slipping alignment. Once flagged, the QC service would automatically remove the sections from the dataset allowing for proper processing of the image analysis such as 2D alignment and 3D reconstruction.</p><p>The images of brain slices from histological processing were fed directly into the computational process. The post processing data involved several steps from image cropping and image conversion to 2D alignment and 3D reconstruction. This was a major departure for image analysis.

In the case of a JPEG2000 image, the decompression was â 75â90 MB for fluorescence images and brightfield images (Nissl, myelin and CTB). After the proper data acquisition, automatic image processing/analysis was performed. The sections across all brains were registered into a common space. This registration was based on Nissl-stained sections for structural information and ex-vivo MRI as landmarks such that all sections were able to align to each other and produce a shape similar to that of the same subject reference (ex-vivo MRI) while maintaining coherence and continuity from section to section.

The grid-based approach was originally established for the Mouse Brain Architecture project, with an initial regular grid with 1 mm injection spacing, adapted to avoid region boundaries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Grange and Mitra, 2011</xref>). The marmoset brain is larger than the mouse brain and a similarly dense set of injections would be prohibitive to carry out in terms of numbers of animals required. We therefore expanded the grid spacing to 2 mm. Note that our plan is not strictly a regular grid as such a grid would also generally overlap with region boundaries. We started with an initial regular grid, then shifted/adapted grid points to avoid boundaries.</p><p>The process is not entirely automated, as the atlas compartments are heterogeneous, and we adapted injection placement by actual visualization of the compartment volumes. In addition, there is also individual variability between brains, and injections themselves have size variations (e.g. due to differential fluid transport properties in different brain regions). We addressed the question of individual variation in part using in-vivo MRI guidance of injections, particularly for sub-cortical nuclei. We also tried to ensure that the injection surgeries were performed by expert neuroanatomists with knowledge of stereotactic injections in the specifically targeted regions of the marmoset brain. In this way we attempted to perform better than a regular geometrical grid and accounted partially for animal-to-animal variations.</p><p>For grid planning we adapted the Paxinos/Hashikawa atlas as a starting template (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hashikawa et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Hikishima et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Woodward et al., 2018</xref>), and initially placed a 3D 2 mm grid covering all the grey matter areas, which yielded 271 injection centers in one hemisphere. This analysis missed some of the smaller structures which have volumes less than 8 mm<sup>3</sup>. However, some structures in the reference atlas are very small and not practical to inject. To determine a size threshold for future planning purposes we examined the actual sizes of the injections placed. Accounting for size variations in the tracer injections, we have found that a diameter of injection spread diameter as small as 0.8 mm and as large as 2.5 mm (assuming spherical spread; see analysis below) could be achieved in practice. We therefore could plan at least one injection center for each brain region with volume ranging from 0.27 mm<sup>3</sup> to around the grid size of 8 mm<sup>3</sup>. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="app1fig6">Appendix 9âfigure 1</xref> presents the total number of injections, and the number of animals need to be involved in the experiments, with regard to different sizes of injection spread.</p><fig id="app1fig6" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.40042.030</object-id><label>Appendix 9âfigure 1.</label><caption><title>Plots representing the total number of injections, the number of animals needed and injection spread diameter (mm).</title><p>Each plot represents the different sizes of injection spread in diameter (mm); the right side y-axis represents the total number of animals required to be involved in the experiments; the left side y-axis represents the total number of injections.

Since each site in the plan is separately targeted with retrograde and anterograde tracers, this implies a total placement of 510 injections. In our plan we try to maximize the number of tracers per animal, to minimize animal number, byÂ placing 2 retrograde and two anterograde injections. Thus, the placement of 510 injections requires 64 marmosets. It is necessary to prioritize the larger areas (and the areas that will be less failure prone when injected), and also ideally to combine data across groups.</p><p>Given the considerations as described above, in the cerebral cortex, 398 injection centers cover 118 target structures, comprising 74% of the total grey matter volume (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="app1fig6">Appendix 9âfigure 1</xref>). The largest regions such as V1 and V2 contain 33 and 15 injection centers, respectively, while small regions such as anterior intraparietal area (AIP) and temporal area 1 (TE1) have only one injection center each.</p><p><bold>Protocol note:</bold> in-vivo MRI was performed on every animal before tracer injection to obtain <italic>a priori</italic> information of the individual brainâs anatomy. Using the approach of Large Deformation Diffeomorphic Metric Mapping (LDDMM) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Ceritoglu et al., 2010</xref>), the marmoset brain atlas is matched to the individualâs brain MRI images so as to provide guidance on the injections (see Section 2.2). In addition, for specific subcortical injections we adopted an in-vivo MRI based stereotaxic surgery procedure to ensure accurate placement of the injections in subcortical nuclei (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Mundinano et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>It is to be noted, that despite best efforts, it is impossible to guarantee that every injection is placed within the center of a regional boundary as designated by a reference atlas. However, we do not regard this as a fundamental obstacle to obtaining a draft connectivity map of the marmoset brain. Our approach is conservative in that it uses far fewer animals than would be required if there was an insistence of precise placement of the injections, as this more conservative approach is inherently more lossy as well as costly in terms of animals. Secondly, the regional boundaries are themselves open to discussion and debate. Ultimately these debates need to be settled by the availability of unbiased brain-wide data sets and using an existing reference atlas to precisely place injections may occasionally perpetuate previous errors. Thirdly, our data sets are comprehensive 3D brain-wide volumes with multiple histological series, permitting both computational analysis, and expert neuroanatomists to draw their own judgments.</p><p>We feel therefore that the grid-based approach, while imperfect, is an important stepping stone towards understanding marmoset brain circuits in particular and primate brain circuitry in general. It is without doubt the case that the current data set constitutes a major advance in this area.

Manual annotation was performed to assess the fidelity of injection to the plan. 73% of the injections were restrained within the relevant anatomical boundary, while 27% injections had tracer leakage into adjacent regions. About 21% of the injections restrained within one region were within the large cortical regions including V1, V2 and V3. Among the injections with tracer spread into more than one region, about 18% (5 injections) were due to actual injection centers placed too close to the anatomical boundary. Within a sample dataset of 15 injections in V1, V2 and V6 from eight animals, we assessed the extent of tracer injection. For simplicity, we assumed a spherical spread of each tracer injection. The diameter of the injection extent ranged from 0.82 mm to 2.46 mm. When discounted by the variation in tracer volume, the diameter of injection extent based on 0.3 Âµl tracer volume ranged from 0.59 mm to 2.46 mm, with medians of 2.15 mm for AAV-GFP (nÂ =Â 5), 1.60 mm for AAV-tdTom (nÂ =Â 4), and 1.93 mm for FB (nÂ =Â 6). Among these 15 injections, 6 of those had tracer spread beyond the anatomical boundary. On average, for each tracer spread, about 68% of the volume was restrained within the same region as the injection center, while about 32% of the volume leaked outside to adjacent regions.</p></sec><sec id="s15-3"><title>C.Â Future plan</title><p>The adaptive grid plan based on the Paxinos/Hashikawa atlas, with a cutoff 2 mm diameter injection spread, requires 510 tracer injections (anterogradeÂ +Â retrograde) throughout the marmoset brain, including 398 in the cerebral cortex. A total of 190 injections have been placed to date in 49 animals, 178 in the cortex and 12 in the thalamus. To cover the rest of the brain with the cutoff as indicated above, 220 more injections would need to be placed in the cortex, and 100 injections would need to be placed in subcortical regions and cerebellum. This would require a total of 80 more marmosets. The high-throughput pipeline presented in the paper has a capacity of 2 marmoset brains/month but this number may be scaled up by replicating equipment (the scanning being a rate limiting step). If the current rate were maintained the plan could be completed by 2022. However, by prioritizing the larger areas, the project could be completed more quickly and with fewer animals.

Individual variations were addressed in terms of variation in stereotaxic coordinates of major landmarks such as sulci and caudate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Black et al., 2001a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Black et al., 2001b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Hikishima et al., 2011</xref>). Few studies explicitly reported the variations in brain sizes involved in their studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Hikishima et al., 2011</xref>). No study thus far has completed a region-based variation comparison as in this paper, and no study has looked at the multivariate covariance between structures. We will address these questions in a future publication.</p><p>From the considerations above, it is clear that there is both significant variation in the absolute compartment volumes, and in the relative volumes normalized by the whole brain, of individual marmosets compared to the reference atlas. Thus, individual variation is present and cannot be ignored. Nevertheless, we feel that the traditional method of repeating the same injection many times in the same region, is not practical for the brain-wide connectivity mapping using the present approach. We utilize three primary tools to address questions of individual variation. First, we perform in-vivo MRI to ensure injection placement within the compartments of choice. Second, we use 3D histological series and diffeomorphic atlas mapping, in order to quantify the precise placement of each injection and corresponding projections, according to a mapped reference atlas. Third, as discussed below, it is possible to combine injections with data sets gathered by other investigators, to virtually increase the sample size. This is particularly feasible if the other data sets are also available in 3D atlas mapped form. This is discussed further in the next subsection. This approach of combining our project injections with data from other investigators has already led to collaborative publications (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Huo et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Majka et al., 2018</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s16-2"><title>B.

None of these elements have a common bearing. For instance the Introduction has a long section on the phylogenetic tree, which might lead one to expect that the paper deals with marmosets. It doesn't. Marmoset brains are processed in the pipeline but we learn nothing about them that would warrant understanding their position in evolution. Likewise, the Introduction touches on curated databases and develop at length the Felleman and Van Essen, 1991 study leading to the work that established the CoCoMac data base. This might lead one to expect that the paper would lead to data and that the merits and otherwise of curated data would be relevant. That neither is the case.</p><p>My point is that the Introduction could be scrapped with no loss to the paper; Idem for the Discussion. If this paper were to be a study, various parameters of the pipeline would be modulated so as to see how this impacts the results. For example, if one is to embark on a grid approach to determining the connectome (as is the case here) what is the optimal frequency to be used? Clearly this is related to brain size. If one is to use a template approach, as in the present study, what impact does that have on the design of the pipeline and what are the controls that would allow one to isolate the template effect? What are the short-comings of a grid approach? What are the short-comings of a template approach? These are burning issues facing connectomics today that are not touched upon by this methodological paper.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>Achieving a comprehensive connectivity map of the primate brain at the 'mesoscale' is a challenge and the authors are to be commended for taking it on. The manuscript is essentially the description of a method that the authors have designed and tested for its feasibility. It requires high throughput, both experimentally and computationally. The manuscript has indeed described a feasible way of achieving the aim of a whole-brain connectivity map of the marmoset. This can potentially pave the way for applying the same techniques to larger brains such as the macaque's.</p><p>I see three major challenges in the ultimate objective for producing a useful connectivity map for the marmoset:</p><p>1) How well can the size of injections be controlled? Spread to neighbouring areas will be a problem. However, with greater number of animals and appropriate computational tools, I agree that one can improve the results.</p><p>2) Smaller the site of injection, better will be the final resolution of the connectivity map. However, that will increase the number of injections that need to be made.</p><p>3) There will be animal-to-animal variability and with the marmoset, I believe one does not have the same degree of luxury of having precisely the same genetic strain as with mice. This might require the experiments to be repeated with a large number of animals. I am not sure that &quot;access to high-quality in-vivo and ex-vivo MRI&quot; as stated in the manuscript will be adequate.</p><p>I would have liked to have seen some discussion about realistic numbers of animals and injections and the time needed for the project to be completed. I guess this would require a large consortium of laboratories. Some plausible projections would add to the feasibility of this ambitious programme.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic></p><p>This is an important, relevant, and well carried out methodological contribution. While systematic projectional analyses of mouse brains have become available since 2014, the application and extension of such approaches to larger brains, and most notably a non-human primate brain, is of substantial relevance for obtaining comparative data on large-scale brain connectivity. I particularly commend the authors on Figures 1 (evolutionary context) and Figure 7 (detailed explanation and illustration of the connectivity matrix generation).</p><p>Importantly, the data viewer should be operational as advertised.

What we had meant to say (and which is now more explicitly stated), that we are able to ameliorate the issue of individual variations in brain anatomy while placing tracer injections by using in-vivo MRI and mapping to a reference atlas to target specific brain compartments in a given marmoset. This is an important methodological difference from the same approach previously applied to the mouse, since in the latter case it is not standard procedure to use in-vivo MRI to guide tracer injection placement. Further, diffeomorphic mapping applied to the combined in-vivo, ex-vivo MRI and 3D multiple histological series, allows us to determine the injection and projection locations a-posteriori using computational means. These issues are further discussed in the added appendix sections.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The paper is not a study in the usual sense, nevertheless it is subdivided into Introduction, Materials and methods, Results and Discussion. None of these elements have a common bearing. For instance the Introduction has a long section on the phylogenetic tree, which might lead one to expect that the paper deals with marmosets. It doesn't.</p></disp-quote><p>We respectfully disagree with the reviewer that the manuscript does not deal with marmosets. Indeed, it is focused on mapping brain-wide connectivity in the marmoset and presents the largest data set available to date of 3D brain-wide histological series in the marmoset to address questions of brain connectivity. While we do not have complete coverage, and it will take some time to fully analyze the implications of the data gathered, we feel it valuable at this time to share the experience we have gathered with the marmoset community, as well as the data resource. Parenthetically we should note that the resource has already been well received and is already being used by researchers wishing to know about the existence of projections between different brain regions in the marmoset.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Marmoset brains are processed in the pipeline but we learn nothing about them that would warrant understanding their position in evolution.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that we do not yet have new knowledge to add to the evolution of the marmoset brain (we hope to extract such knowledge in future analysis of the data gathered). However, we do feel it appropriate to insert a phylogenetic discussion to contextualize brain-wide connectivity mapping, as this activity has so far been focused on the mouse. We also feel the need to re-invigorate a comparative discussion in the context of modern approaches to neuroanatomy and feel that comparative/evolutionary discussions might become a more standard component of the background portions of papers that might otherwise simply be technique focused. This would give a better understanding of the utility of these techniques beyond say transgenic mice. Even the simple size difference in the brains across taxa may make some of the techniques less compelling than others, and this is indeed a comparative question.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Likewise, the Introduction touches on curated databases and develop at length the Felleman and Van Essen, 1991 study leading to the work that established the CoCoMac data base. This might lead one to expect that the paper would lead to data and that the merits and otherwise of curated data would be relevant. That neither is the case.</p></disp-quote><p>Our goal in reviewing the literature was not to present a comparative study of the findings of Van Essen et al. with a connectivity map in the marmoset. Such a comparison will be appropriate to make in the future once our data is more fully analyzed. Rather, the comparison we wish to draw at present is methodological, between connectivity matrices generated largely by visual inspection of raw materials that are not available to the reader in any image format, and presented as tabular summaries â and our present approach of gathering whole-brain histological image data which is open to the reader for examination. Secondly, we wished to examine the number of tracer injections placed in the past in the literature studies, as a comparison point for the current study. This is presented in tabular form.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>My point is that the Introduction could be scrapped with no loss to the paper; Idem for the Discussion. If this paper were to be a study, various parameters of the pipeline would be modulated so as to see how this impacts the results.</p></disp-quote><p>It is impractical to repeat the entire study with different parameters. However, we did consider different pipeline parameters when designing the study, and some of these considerations are now detailed in the appendix sections (9 and 10). Rather than remove the introductory and Discussion sections, we have expanded them to include discussions on the grid-injection approach, individual variations, and planning for completion of whole-brain coverage.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>For example, if one is to embark on a grid approach to determining the connectome (as is the case here) what is the optimal frequency to be used? Clearly this is related to brain size.</p></disp-quote><p>A discussion of the spatial grid was previously included, but we have expanded on it.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>If one is to use a template approach, as in the present study, what impact does that have on the design of the pipeline and what are the controls that would allow one to isolate the template effect? What are the short-comings of a grid approach? What are the short-comings of a template approach? These are burning issues facing connectomics today that are not touched upon by this methodological paper.</p></disp-quote><p>We have included a more comprehensive discussion of the grid approach, discussing several of the issues raised by the reviewers in this context. By a âtemplate approachâ we presume the reviewer refers here to placement of injections based on a reference atlas. The approach utilized in the study is a hybrid, where the grid is adapted so as to avoid major anatomical boundaries. We discuss the context of such a hybrid approach.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2:</p><p>Achieving a comprehensive connectivity map of the primate brain at the 'mesoscale' is a challenge and the authors are to be commended for taking it on. The manuscript is essentially the description of a method that the authors have designed and tested for its feasibility. It requires high throughput, both experimentally and computationally. The manuscript has indeed described a feasible way of achieving the aim of a whole-brain connectivity map of the marmoset. This can potentially pave the way for applying the same techniques to larger brains such as the macaque's.</p><p>I see three major challenges in the ultimate objective for producing a useful connectivity map for the marmoset:</p><p>1) How well can the size of injections be controlled? Spread to neighbouring areas will be a problem. However, with greater number of animals and appropriate computational tools, I agree that one can improve the results.</p></disp-quote><p>We have included an analysis of the injection sizes in the data set acquired so far. We place pressure injections, so that the injection size is nominally controlled by the volume injected, but examination of the data shows that there is additional variability, some of which may originate from differing fluid transport properties in different brain regions. We also analyze the data set gathered so far to estimate the number of injections that spread across anatomical boundaries (we find that most of the injections are localized within major compartments).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Smaller the site of injection, better will be the final resolution of the connectivity map. However, that will increase the number of injections that need to be made.</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewer is quite correct in noting the relation between the size of the injection and the resolution of the connectivity map. This is ultimately a practical issue as the number of injections is upper bounded by the availability of experimental animals. Some guidance as to size of injections may be obtained from the distribution of sizes of the neuroanatomical compartments. While we capture the major compartments, it is not practical to inject the smallest compartments delineated on the reference atlas in question. We therefore chose a pragmatic cutoff.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) There will be animal-to-animal variability and with the marmoset, I believe one does not have the same degree of luxury of having precisely the same genetic strain as with mice. This might require the experiments to be repeated with a large number of animals. I am not sure that &quot;access to high-quality in-vivo and ex-vivo MRI&quot; as stated in the manuscript will be adequate.</p><p>I would have liked to have seen some discussion about realistic numbers of animals and injections and the time needed for the project to be completed. I guess this would require a large consortium of laboratories. Some plausible projections would add to the feasibility of this ambitious programme.</p></disp-quote><p>Indeed, we cannot constrain to an inbred strain in the present study as such a strain is not available. No previous anatomical study has been done with inbred marmosets, so this might be too high a bar for the current study. As for the utility of in-vivo and ex-vivo MRI: as discussed elsewhere, this is for individually-targeted injection placement, and a-posteriori analysis of individual variation.</p><p>We have now provided a more detailed projection of the number of animals and injections required to obtain the comprehensive brain-wide connectivity map in the marmoset.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3:</p><p>This is an important, relevant, and well carried out methodological contribution. While systematic projectional analyses of mouse brains have become available since 2014, the application and extension of such approaches to larger brains, and most notably a non-human primate brain, is of substantial relevance for obtaining comparative data on large-scale brain connectivity. I particularly commend the authors on Figures 1 (evolutionary context) and Figure 7 (detailed explanation and illustration of the connectivity matrix generation).</p><p>Importantly, the data viewer should be operational as advertised. Currently, http://riken.marmoset.brainarchitecture.org/ doesn't load, and shows black data only. Please assure that the data browser is operational at review stage, since this is one important aspect of the presented methods.</p></disp-quote><p>We do apologize that the reviewer found the data portal to be offline, possibly during an update while the manuscript was in review. The portal is now online and we do not anticipate significant downtime, except possibly for brief outages during maintenance.
