The recent approval of the CFTR potentiator drug ivacaftor (Vx-770) for the treatment of CF patients has marked the advent of causative CF therapy. Currently, thousands of patients are being treated with the drug, and its molecular mechanism of action is under intensive investigation. Here we determine the solubility profile and true stimulatory potency of Vx-770 towards wild-type (WT) and mutant human CFTR channels in cell-free patches of membrane. We find that its aqueous solubility is ~200 fold lower (~60 nanomolar), whereas the potency of its stimulatory effect is &gt;100 fold higher, than reported, and is unexpectedly fully reversible. Strong, but greatly delayed, channel activation by picomolar Vx-770 identifies multiple sequential slow steps in the activation pathway. These findings provide solid guidelines for the design of <italic>in vitro</italic> studies using Vx-770.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>cystic fibrosis</kwd><kwd>potentiator drug</kwd><kwd>F508del</kwd><kwd>G551D</kwd><kwd>Vx-770</kwd><kwd>solubility</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>Xenopus</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000897</institution-id><institution>Cystic Fibrosis Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>CSANAD17G0</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Csanády</surname><given-names>László</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100003825</institution-id><institution>Magyar Tudományos Akadémia</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Lendület grant LP2017-14/2017</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Csanády</surname><given-names>László</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Aqueous solubility of cystic fibrosis drug ivacaftor is ~200-fold lower, whereas the potency of its stimulatory effect on the CFTR channel is &gt;100-fold higher, than reported, and is fully reversible.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>CFTR belongs to the family of ATP Binding Cassette (ABC) proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Riordan et al., 1989</xref>), and forms an anion selective channel which is activated by phosphorylation of its cytosolic regulatory (R) domain by cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Berger et al., 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Tabcharani et al., 1991</xref>). In phosphorylated CFTR channels opening and closing (gating) of the anion pore is coupled to conformational changes induced by ATP binding and hydrolysis at two cytosolic nucleotide binding domains (NBDs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Anderson et al., 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Li et al., 1996</xref>). CFTR channels are present in the apical membrane of epithelial cells that line the lung, intestine, pancreatic duct, and sweat duct, and the regulated flow of anions, primarily chloride and bicarbonate, through CFTR is indispensable for the salt-water homeostasis of those epithelia. CF, the most common lethal inherited disease among Caucasians, is caused by CFTR mutations which have been classified based on their molecular consequences. Thus, some mutations diminish production (Class I and V), folding/trafficking (Class II), or stability (Class VI) of the CFTR protein, wheres others impair channel gating (Class III), or anion permeation through the open pore (Class IV) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">De Boeck and Amaral, 2016</xref>). The most common CF mutation, deletion of phenylalanine 508 (ΔF508), is present in ~90% of patients and impairs both channel surface expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Cheng et al., 1990</xref>) and open probability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Miki et al., 2010</xref>).</p><p>Pharmacotherapy of CF is currently focused on developing compounds that either enhance surface expression (‘correctors’) or stimulate channel gating (‘potentiators’) of mutant CFTR. The potentiator Vx-770 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Van Goor et al., 2009</xref>), identified by Vertex Pharmaceuticals using high-throughput screening, has proven successful and was approved by the FDA for the treatment of patients carrying G551D and other gating mutations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Ramsey et al., 2011</xref>). This breakthrough has demonstrated the feasibility of efficient causative CF therapy using small-molecule potentiators, at least for this subset of patients (&lt;5% of all CF cases). Moreover, in a recent phase two clinical trial, patients carrying the most common CF mutation ΔF508 also experienced significant clinical improvement from co-administration of Vx-770 with a combination of corrector drugs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Boyle et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Wainwright et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Davies et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>Although treatment with Vx-770 (administered orally, either alone or in combination with corrector drugs) is accepted as the standard of care for the majority of CF patients in the US, many of the basic properties of the drug have remained unexplained or controversial. Thus, CFTR channel stimulation by Vx-770 in cell-free patches is reportedly irreversible (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Jih and Hwang, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Lin et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Yeh et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Yeh et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Wang et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Wang et al., 2018</xref>), maximal stimulation of WT CFTR channels shows large variability (ranging from ~1.1 fold [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Cui and McCarty, 2015</xref>] to ~3 fold [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Wang et al., 2018</xref>]), and in some studies its acute application caused (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Cholon et al., 2014</xref>) – or accentuated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Wang et al., 2014</xref>) – CFTR channel inactivation.

Starting from crystalline Vx-770 (Selleck Chemicals), solubilities (S) of the drug in various organic solvents could be readily determined by adding incremental small volumes of solvent until all crystals had been dissolved (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>). We found Vx-770 extremely soluble in anhydrous dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) (S ~ 0.77 M), and reasonably soluble in 1-octanol (S ~ 3.9 mM) and ethanol (S ~ 3.1 mM). However, even the smallest amounts that we could weigh out (~0.1 mg) failed to dissolve in 1 liter of aqueous saline (pH = 7.1), as evident from clearly visible crystals even after vigorous shaking for 24 hr, forcing us to take a different approach. To generate an aqueous solution exactly saturated with Vx-770, a small aliquot of crystals was added to an aqueous saline (pH = 7.1) and, after vigorous shaking for 24 hr, visible crystals were removed by repeated filtering and microcrystals sedimented by centrifugation (Materials and methods). The resulting supernatant (our ‘1x saturated’ stock solution) was then used both for determination of Vx-770 solubility (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1b–c</xref>), and for functional experiments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">5</xref>). Vx-770 dissolved in 1-octanol at 1–4 μM showed clearly measurable light absorption with a peak at 311 nm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1b</xref>, <italic>blue spectra</italic>), yielding a calibration line in the micromolar range (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1c</xref>, <italic>blue dots</italic> and <italic>fitted straight line</italic>). For our 1x saturated aqueous stock solution the absorbance spectrum was flat against the background saline, but when we extracted it with 1-octanol at a volume ratio of 20:1, the extract showed clear absortion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1b</xref>, <italic>red spectrum</italic>, ‘<italic>1st extract</italic>’), corresponding to a Vx-770 concentration of ~1.2 μM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2b</xref>). Repeated extraction of the aqueous stock with 1-octanol yielded a flat spectrum (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2a</xref>, <italic>green spectrum</italic>, ‘<italic>2nd extract</italic>’), confirming that all Vx-770 had been efficiently extracted in the first round. Considering that Vx-770 was concentrated 20-fold during the extraction procedure, we conclude that the true aqueous solubility of Vx-770 at 25°C is only ~60 nM (S<sub>aq</sub>(25°C, pH = 7.1)=62 ± 2 nM, n = 4), almost 200-fold lower than generally believed, and severalfold lower even than its reported EC<sub>50</sub> values for potentiation of various CFTR mutants (160–600 nM) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Van Goor et al., 2014</xref>).</p><table-wrap id="table1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.46450.002</object-id><label>Table 1.</label><caption><title>Solubilities of Vx-770 in various solvents at 25°C.</title><p>Solubilities were determined as described in detail in Materials and methods. *Aqueous saline with composition described in Materials and methods.</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr valign="top"><th>Solvent</th><th>S (mol/L)</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr valign="top"><td>water (pH=7.1)*</td><td>6.2·10<sup>-8</sup></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td>pentane</td><td>1.8·10<sup>-5</sup></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td>octane</td><td>2.6·10<sup>-3</sup></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td>ethanol</td><td>3.1·10<sup>-3</sup></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td>1-octanol</td><td>3.9·10<sup>-3</sup></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td>DMSO</td><td>7.7·10<sup>-1</sup></td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.46450.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Determination of aqueous solubility for Vx-770.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) Structural formula of Vx-770 and 3D surface rendering by Molinspiration (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.molinspiration.com/cgi-bin/properties">https://www.molinspiration.com/cgi-bin/properties</ext-link>). <italic>Red arrows</italic> identify potentially deprotonatable groups.

However, upon drug removal the current readily declined back to its pre-drug value (time constant τ ~2 min, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2a</xref>, <italic>red fit line</italic>), demonstrating full reversibility of Vx-770 effects. In single-channel recordings (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2b</xref>), even a 20-fold dilution of our 1x saturated Vx-770 stock stimulated open probability of WT CFTR to a comparable level, by ~4 fold (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2c</xref>, <italic>left</italic>).

Of note, a recent study suggested two potential binding sites for Vx-770 in the transmembrane domains of CFTR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Yeh et al., 2019</xref>). We therefore evaluated a simplistic model which postulates independent drug binding to two sites, with identical affinities, but a substantial change in open probability (from P<sub>o;bas</sub> to P<sub>o;max</sub>) only for diliganded channels (Scheme 3, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5c</xref>).

This transmembrane pH gradient might influence the distribution of Vx-770 in the body, as the drug contains two potentially deprotonatable groups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref>, <italic>red arrows</italic>), and the negative charge acquired upon deprotonation is expected to greatly enhance its aqueous solubility. Because the computationally (Chemaxon) predicted strongest acidic pK<sub>a</sub> value varies between 6.57 and 8.66, depending on the method of prediction, we measured Vx-770 solubility in our standard bath solution after adjusting its pH to 7.4 (see Materials and methods). From three independent measurements we obtained an estimate of S<sub>aq</sub>(25°C, pH = 7.4) = 50 ± 1 nM (mean ± S.E.M.), which is not larger than that obtained for pH = 7.1, the small difference likely reflecting experimental limitations. This finding suggests that the strongest acidic pK<sub>a</sub> value of the drug is substantially higher than 7.4, and so the uncharged, fully protonated form remains the dominant microspecies in the entire physiological pH range. The corollary is that the aqueous solubility of the drug is similar in the cytosol and the extracellular space.</p><p>As a further parameter of clinical interest, we also determined the aqueous solubility of Vx-770 at body temperature (pH = 7.1). Consistent with reports for other hydrophobic drugs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Baena et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Garzón and Martínez, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Mota et al., 2009</xref>), Vx-770 aqueous solubility at 37°C was ~2 fold higher compared to that at 25°C, three independent measurements yielding an estimate of S<sub>aq</sub>(37°C, pH = 7.1) = 138 ± 1 nM (mean ± S.E.M.). The standard enthalpy of solution, estimated from the solubilities at 37°C vs. 25°C, is ΔH<sup>o</sup><sub>sol</sub> = +51.2 kJ/mol, and the standard free energy of solution at 25°C is ΔG<sup>o</sup><sub>sol</sub> = +41.1 kJ/mol (Materials and methods). Thus, the thermodynamic explanation for the extremely low aqueous solubility of Vx-770 is that the entropy increase (TΔS<sup>o</sup><sub>sol</sub> = +10.1 kJ/mol at 25°C) associated with the solution process is too small to compensate for the large increase in enthalpy, likely caused by the disruption of hydrogen bonds between water molecules.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>The discovery of the CFTR potentiator Vx-770 has caused a major change in the therapy of CF patients, allowing to address for the first time the root cause of the disease. To date, thousands of patients are taking the drug on a daily basis, which warrants that studying its mechanisms will remain in the center of research efforts for years to come. As for all drugs approved for clinical use, extensive clinical studies have established its pharmacokinetic profile and safety features, and quantified its clinical effects. On the other hand, many of its basic physicochemical properties, as well as its precise molecular mechanism of action, remain to be established. Vx-770 shows good oral bioavailability, and peak plasma concentrations of ~4 μM, and &gt;10 μM, respectively, have been measured in patients receiving twice daily 150 mg (therapeutic) or 450 mg (supratherapeutic) doses (FDA report by Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.accessdata.fda.gov/drugsatfda_docs/nda/2012/203188Orig1s000OtherRedt.pdf">https://www.accessdata.fda.gov/drugsatfda_docs/nda/2012/203188Orig1s000OtherRedt.pdf</ext-link>). In the plasma, most of the drug is bound to plasma proteins, which are important for its pharmacokinetics, as they tremendously increase the drug transport capacity of the blood and therefore oral bioavailability, and act as a drug buffer system that replenishes the free drug pool during the time course of its elimination from the body. On the other hand, cell membranes are at equilibrium with free dissolved Vx-770, not with the protein-bound drug. Therefore, in a living organism the target cell membranes will accumulate Vx-770 only to an extent that is at equilibrium with free dissolved Vx-770 (in the extracellular fluid and/or in the cytosol). In the present study, we have established an upper limit for the latter parameter, which thus determines the maximal possible drug concentration achievable in target cell membranes. We have further shown that Vx-770 solubility is independent of pH in the physiological pH range, which implicitly indicates that its smallest acidic pK<sub>a</sub> value is far higher than 7.4, and that the dominant microspecies is therefore the fully protonated uncharged form. Consequently, the distribution of the drug between the cytosol and extracellular space is unaffected by the transmembrane pH gradient and the membrane potential.</p><p>Because in all published <italic>in vitro</italic> studies Vx-770 was applied at concentrations ranging from 100 nM to 10 μM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Cui and McCarty, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Yeh et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Yeh et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Langron et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Liu and Dawson, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Van Goor et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Van Goor et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Yu et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Wang et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Wang et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">DeStefano et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Jih and Hwang, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Lin et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Kopeikin et al., 2014</xref>), our present solubility estimate (50–62 nM at 25°C, 138 nM at 37°C) indicates that Vx-770 effects have so far been characterized only at highly (up to ~200 fold) supersaturated concentrations, that also exceed (by up to ~100 fold) the highest free drug concentrations that can be ever attained at 37°C, that is in the human body using oral drug administration. This circumstance readily explains some of the reported puzzling features of the drug. For instance, when superfusing a patch with a supersaturated aqueous solution of Vx-770, the drug will accumulate at supersatured concentrations even in the membrane, likely resulting in the formation, and time-dependent growth, of crystalline precipitates within the bilayer. Such precipitates might have contributed to CFTR channel inactivation observed in some studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Cholon et al., 2014</xref>). Moreover, following removal of Vx-770 from the aqueous perfusate, the membrane-dissolved drug pool might be replenished from such intra-membrane crystalline precipitates as long as the crystals last (which will depend on the degree of supersaturation of the applied aqueous test solution, and on exposure time), explaining the reported irreversibility of drug effects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Jih and Hwang, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Lin et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Yeh et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Yeh et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Wang et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Wang et al., 2018</xref>). Indeed, we show here that the potentiating effect of Vx-770 on CFTR is fully reversible (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">3</xref>), as long as supersaturating drug concentrations are avoided.</p><p>Based on our data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3c,f</xref>), the apparent affinity of Vx-770 for WT CFTR is 600-fold, for G551D CFTR ~200 fold, and for ΔF508 CFTR 20–300-fold higher than previously reported. One likely explanation for the discrepancy between previous estimates of Vx-770 potencies and those obtained here is the use of static recording chambers in the previous studies as opposed to the continuous superfusion employed here. The octanol/water distribution coefficient of Vx-770 is ~60000 (cf., <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>). Thus, if cellular membranes constitute as little as ~0.17% of the total assay volume, then ~99% of the drug will accumulate in those membranes and its free aqueous concentration will remain only ~1% of the total. Furthermore, when applied at supersaturated concentrations, large fractions of the drug will precipitate onto the walls of the recording chamber.</p><p>Precise molecular interpretation of the complex kinetic steps involved in drug-activation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4a</xref>) will clearly require much further work, including definitive localization of the drug binding site(s). However, a simple kinetic model which postulates two independent and similar-affinity binding sites, with potentiation requiring simultaneous binding of two drug molecules (Scheme 3, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5c</xref>), afforded a remarkably good description of current activation/deactivation time courses over a broad range of applied drug concentrations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5f</xref>, <italic>blue fit lines</italic>). The reasonable fit of an ensemble of four highly non-linear curves by a single set of only four free parameters (k<sub>out</sub>, k<sub>on</sub>', k<sub>off</sub>, and P<sub>o;max</sub>/P<sub>o;bas</sub>; with k<sub>in</sub> constrained to k<sub>in</sub> = k<sub>out</sub>⋅D<sub>oct/wat(pH=7.1)</sub>) strongly argues in favor of this model. Recently, <italic>in silico</italic> docking to high-resolution CFTR structures of the potentiator GLPG-1837, a drug known to compete with Vx-770 for CFTR activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Yeh et al., 2017</xref>), identified potential drug binding sites in CFTR's transmembrane domains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Yeh et al., 2019</xref>). Interestingly, mutations introduced into either of two putative sites strongly impaired potentiation by both GLPG-1837 and Vx-770 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Yeh et al., 2019</xref>). However, because dose response curves for GLPG-1837 activation are fitted with Hill coefficients close to unity, the authors were uncertain how to interpret those findings. They suggested that either both sites are true drug binding sites, or only one site is a true binding site, while mutations at the other site allosterically affect the structure of the true site. Of note, Scheme 3 predicts an apparent Hill slope of only ~1.17 (see Materials and methods) which is consistent with the values obtained both for GLPG-1837 by Yeh and colleagues, and for Vx-770 in the present study (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). We therefore consider Scheme 3 the best current working model for describing the molecular mechanism of CFTR potentiation by Vx-770.

One possible explanation for this slow apparent on-rate could be that the drug remains associated with the polar surface of the bilayer, consistent with the hydrogen bonding capability of its five polar groups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref>). In that case, if the drug binding sites on the CFTR protein are located in the outer leaflet of the membrane, drug binding could be rate limited by slow flipping of the drug from the inner to the outer leaflet. Such a scenario could be consistent with the location of the two binding sites proposed by Yeh and colleagues, which are closer to the extracellular than to the intracellular membrane surface (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Yeh et al., 2019</xref>). However, despite the introduction of an additional free parameter (k<sub>flip</sub>), a two-compartment membrane model (Scheme 4, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5d</xref>) only marginally improved the fits (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5f</xref>, <italic>red fit lines</italic>). Thus, unless molecular dynamics simulations provide further support for such a model, we do not consider Scheme 4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5d</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2">Table 2</xref>, <italic>right</italic>) a substantially better working model compared to Scheme 3. An alternative possible explanation for the drug's slow apparent on-rate could be diffusion-limited loose binding followed by a slower induced fit conformational change.</p><p>Two common mechanistic conclusions suggested by the Scheme-3 and Scheme-4 fits are that (i) two drug molecules need to bind to the channel protein to achieve potentiation, and that (ii) the slow channel deactivation time course following drug removal reflects the slow dissociation rate of the bound drug from the protein (k<sub>off</sub>), rather than slow washout of unbound drug molecules from the membrane (k<sub>out</sub>).</p><p>In conclusion, we have established the basic physicochemical properties of Vx-770, including its solubility profile and the thermodynamic parameters of the aqueous solution process. We have further determined its true potency towards WT, G551D, and ΔF508 CFTR, which is orders of magnitude higher than previously believed. Finally, we have identified a kinetic model which is suitable to describe its molecular mechanism. Our findings provide a solid framework to guide extensive current research efforts aimed at studying Vx-770 effects <italic>in vitro</italic>. A clinically relevant aspect of our findings is that half-maximal CFTR potentiation is achieved already by an ~100 fold dilution of a saturated Vx-770 solution. Thus, it might be worth testing whether drug doses lower than the currently approved dosage regimes are equally beneficial to CF patients, as this could reduce treatment costs that are currently ~300000 USD/patient/year.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th>Reagent type <break/>(species) <break/>or resource</th><th>Designation</th><th>Source <break/>or reference</th><th>Identifiers</th><th>Additional <break/>information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Biological sample (<italic>Xenopus laevis</italic>)</td><td><italic>Xenopus laevis</italic> oocytes</td><td>African Reptile Park</td><td>RRID: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/RRID:NXR_0.0080">NXR_0.0080</ext-link></td><td valign="bottom">mandyvorster@xsinet.co.za</td></tr><tr><td>Commercial assay or kit</td><td>HiSpeed Plasmid Midi Kit</td><td>Qiagen</td><td>12643</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Commercial assay or kit</td><td>QuickChange II Mutagenesis Kit</td><td>Agilent Technologies</td><td>200524–5</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Commercial assay or kit</td><td>mMESSAGE mMACHINE T7 Transcription Kit</td><td>ThermoFisher</td><td>AM1344</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Chemical compound, drug</td><td>Collagenase type II</td><td>Gibco</td><td>17107–0125</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Chemical compound, drug</td><td>Adenosine 5′-triphosphoribose magnesium (ATP)</td><td>Sigma-Aldrich</td><td>A9187</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Chemical compound, drug</td><td>Protein kinase A catalytic subunit, bovine</td><td>Sigma-Aldrich</td><td>P2645</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Chemical compound, drug</td><td>Vx-770 (solid)</td><td>Selleck Chemicals</td><td>S1144</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Chemical compound, drug</td><td>Vx-770 <break/>(10 mM in <break/>DMSO)</td><td>Selleck Chemicals</td><td>S1144</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Software, algorithm</td><td valign="bottom">Pclamp9</td><td>Molecular Devices</td><td>RRID: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/SCR_011323">SCR_011323</ext-link></td><td/></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap><sec id="s4-1"><title>Determination of Vx-770 solubility profile</title><p>Crystalline Vx-770 (purity 99.58% by HPLC) was purchased from Selleck Chemicals (Houston, TX, USA). Solubilities (S) at 25°C in anhydrous dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) (S ~ 0.77 M), 1-octanol (S ~ 3.9 mM), ethanol (S ~ 3.1 mM), octane (S ~ 2.6 mM), and pentane (S ~ 18 μM) were determined by weighing out a small amount (1–2 mg) of crystals on an analytical balance (Kern ABJ), and adding incremental small volumes of solvent, followed by mixing, until all crystals had been dissolved. However, even the smallest amount of Vx-770 that we could weigh out (~0.1 mg, obtained by manually dividing an ~0.5 mg aliqout into five comparable heaps under a stereomicroscope) failed to dissolve in 1 liter of water, as evident from clearly visible crystals even after vigorous shaking (200 RPM, New Brunswick Excella E24) for 24 hr at 25°C.</p><p>To obtain an aqueous solution (pH = 7.1) exactly saturated with Vx-770 (our ‘1x saturated’ stock), a small aliquot of Vx-770 crystals (~0.1 mg) was added to 250 ml of our standard bath solution (in mM: 134 NMDG-Cl, 2 MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 5 HEPES, 0.5 EGTA, pH = 7.1 with NMDG), and the solution was shaken for 24 hr at 25°C at 200 RPM (New Brunswick Excella E24). Remaining, clearly visible, macrocrystals were removed by filtering the solution twice through an 0.22 μm pore size filter (Millipore Durapore Steritop + Stericup, Merck KGaA, Darmstadt, Germany). To sediment invisible microcrystals, the filtrate was centrifuged at 7200 RCF for 1 hr in 50 ml conical tubes, and the supernatant carefully removed, leaving the last ~1 ml behind. The resulting cleared filtrate was stored and used as a stock solution for all subsequent studies.</p><p>The concentration of Vx-770 in the 1x saturated stock was determined by spectrophotometry (NanoPhotometer P300, Implen GmbH). Vx-770 dissolved in 1-octanol shows strong absorption with a peak at 311 nm. To obtain a calibration curve, Vx-770 (from a commercial 10 mM stock dissolved in DMSO, purchased from Selleck Chemicals) was diluted into 1-octanol (saturated with water) to final concentrations of 1, 2, 4, 8, and 16 μM. Absorption spectra were measured in a 1 ml quartz cuvette against 1-octanol (saturated with water) as a blank (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1b</xref>, <italic>blue spectra</italic>). Peak absorption at 311 nm was linear with Vx-770 concentration across the entire range (the 0–4 μM range is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1c</xref>, <italic>blue dots</italic>). To extract Vx-770 from the 1x saturated aqueous stock, two 15 ml conical tubes, each containing 14 ml of the 1x aqueous stock plus 0.7 ml 1-octanol, were vortexed for 1 min, and then centrifuged at 7200 RCF for 30 min. Approximately 2 × 0.6 ml of the 1-octanol phase was recovered, pooled, and its absorption spectrum measured in a 1 ml quartz cuvette against 1-octanol (saturated with water) as a blank (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1b</xref>, <italic>red spectrum</italic>). To extract the remaining aqueous phase for a second time, the remnants of the 1-octanol phase were carefully discarded from both conical tubes, and 12.5 ml of the remaining aqueous phase (removed by inserting the pipette tip well below the surface) was transferred into two clean conical tubes. The extraction was then repeated using 2 × 0.625 ml 1-octanol, from which 2x ~ 0.5 ml was recovered, pooled, and assayed for optical density (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1b</xref>, <italic>green spectrum</italic>).</p><p>Aqueous solubility at pH = 7.4 (25°C) was measured as described above for pH = 7.1, but starting from a standard bath solution with pH adjusted to 7.4 using NMDG. The spectrophotometric calibration curve was obtained in this case using 1, 2, 4, 8, and 16 μM Vx-770 dissolved in 1-octanol (saturated with the pH = 7.4 bath solution). The obtained calibration curve was identical to that shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1b–c</xref> (i.e., Vx-770 fluorescence was insensitive to whether it was dissolved in 1-octanol saturated with water (as in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>), or with saline buffered to either pH = 7.1, 7.3, or 7.4).</p><p>To determine aqueous solubility at 37°C (pH = 7.1), an aliquot of standard bath solution was heated to 37°C in a water bath. Because the pK<sub>a</sub> of HEPES is temperature dependent, heating to 37°C caused a decrease in pH by 0.17 units. The pH of the solution was therefore readjusted to 7.1 at 37°C using NMDG. To obtain a 1x saturated solution at 37°C, overnight shaking with Vx-770 crystals, subsequent 2x filtering, and centrifugation were all perfomed at 37°C. To measure Vx-770 concentration in the 1x saturated stock solution, 0.7 ml 1-octanol was added to 14 ml aliquots of the stock at 37°C, the tubes were vortexed for 1 min, and the subsequent steps of the 1-octanol extraction procedure, as well as the spectrophotometric determination, were performed at room temperature, as described above.</p></sec><sec id="s4-2"><title>Estimation of thermodynamic parameters of the Vx-770 aqueous solution process</title><p>The standard enthalpy of solution was calculated as ΔH<sup>o</sup><sub>sol</sub> = ((RT<sub>1</sub>T<sub>2</sub>)/(T<sub>2</sub>−T<sub>1</sub>))⋅ln(S(T<sub>2</sub>)/S(T<sub>1</sub>)), where R = 8.31 Jmol<sup>−1</sup>K<sup>−1</sup>, T<sub>1</sub> = 298 K (25°C), T<sub>2</sub> = 310 K (37°C), and S(T<sub>1</sub>) and S(T<sub>2</sub>) are the measured aqueous solubilities of Vx-770 at the respective temperatures (pH = 7.1).

Before each experiment 300 nM catalytic subunit of PKA (Sigma-Aldrich Kft., Budapest, Hungary) was applied for ~1 min to phosphorylate CFTR channels. Vx-770 (Selleck Chemicals) was diluted into the bath solution either from a ‘1x saturated’ aqueous stock solution (see above, concentration ~62 nM), or from a commercially obtained 10 mM stock dissolved in DMSO (Selleck Chemicals). Following patch excision the patch pipette was moved into a flow chamber, and recordings were done under continuous superfusion of the cytosolic patch surface. Solution compositions were exchanged using computer-driven electronic valves (solution exchange time constant &lt;50 ms). After each recording day perfusion tubings were extensively washed with distilled water. Although supersaturated solutions of Vx-770 were not employed here, any perfusion tubing that had ever been in contact with a given concentration of Vx-770 was subsequently used only for solutions that contained the same, or higher, concentrations of the drug. After every 5–6 experimental days the entire perfusion system was replaced. Currents were recorded at 25°C, at a membrane potential of −40 mV, digitized at 10 kHz, Gaussian-filtered at 2 kHz, and recorded to disk (Axopatch 200B, Digidata 1322A, Pclamp9 (Molecular Devices, RRID: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/SCR_011323">SCR_011323</ext-link>)).

Compound states S<sub>1</sub>-S<sub>4</sub> in this scheme are not interpreted as channel conformational states, but rather as states of the entire system (aqueous solution +patch membrane leaflets + channels), and could reflect various stages of drug distribution among those compartments.

For Schemes 1 and 3 the volume of the membrane patch was taken as 10<sup>−16</sup> liter (assuming a macroscopic patch surface area of ~4 μm<sup>2</sup> increased by ~5 fold at a microscopic level due to the presence of microvilli (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Dascal, 1987</xref>), and a membrane thickness of ~5 nm), and for Schemes 2 and 4 the volume of the outer membrane leaflet was taken as 5⋅10<sup>−17</sup> liter. C<sub>t</sub> was then calculated as N/N<sub>A</sub> divided by the relevant volume (N<sub>A</sub>, Avogadro's number). (In control trials in which up to 5-fold larger/smaller fixed membrane volumes were used, the fits showed little sensitivity to the choice of membrane volume, apart from appropriate rescaling of the obtained values for k<sub>on</sub>' and k<sub>flip</sub>.)</p><p>For the ensemble fitting, all experimental current traces were normalized to their steady-state values observed prior to exposure to Vx-770. Predicted normalized on- and off- current time courses for each model were calculated from the above dynamic equations by solving for the time-dependent evolution of the vector <bold>x</bold>, using a modified Euler's method (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Press, 1992</xref>). For the on- time courses the initial values for all x<sub>i</sub> were set to zero, for the off- time courses the final <bold>x</bold> vector of the preceding on- time course served as the initial vector while V<sub>c</sub> was set to zero. The predicted time course of the normalized current trace was then obtained as x<sub>2</sub>(t)/C<sub>t</sub> + (1–x<sub>2</sub>(t)/C<sub>t</sub>)⋅(P<sub>o;max</sub>/P<sub>o;bas</sub>) (Scheme 1), x<sub>3</sub>(t)/C<sub>t</sub> + (1–x<sub>3</sub>(t)/C<sub>t</sub>)⋅(P<sub>o;max</sub>/P<sub>o;bas</sub>) (Scheme 2), (x<sub>2</sub>(t)+x<sub>3</sub>(t))/C<sub>t</sub> + (1–(x<sub>2</sub>(t)+x<sub>3</sub>(t))/C<sub>t</sub>)⋅(P<sub>o;max</sub>/P<sub>o;bas</sub>) (Scheme 3), and (x<sub>3</sub>(t)+x<sub>4</sub>(t))/C<sub>t</sub> + (1–(x<sub>3</sub>(t)+x<sub>4</sub>(t))/C<sub>t</sub>)⋅(P<sub>o;max</sub>/P<sub>o;bas</sub>) (Scheme 4), respectively. The sets of predicted normalized on-off time courses were fitted to the sets of normalized experimental current traces by simple least squares, using a downhill simplex method for optimization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Press, 1992</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>Steady-state solutions of the models and calculation of predicted apparent affinities</title><p>Under the conditions used here, that is upon prolonged exposure of the cytosolic face of the patch to a constant concentration of Vx-770, with no Vx-770 present on the extracellular side, all four kinetic models shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref> predict relaxation of the system to a steady state. At steady state there is a constant outward directed transmembrane flux of Vx-770, while its concentration remains constant within the membrane (or membrane leaflets), and close to zero in the extracellular (pipette) solution. (The volume of the pipette solution, on the order of 10<sup>−5</sup> l, can be considered infinitely large relative to the volume of the patch membrane). For Schemes 1 and 3, the steady-state membrane concentration of the drug is V<sub>m;∞</sub>=V<sub>c</sub>⋅k<sub>in</sub>/(2⋅k<sub>out</sub>). For Schemes 2 and 4, the steady-state drug concentrations in the cytosolic and external membrane leaflets (V<sub>mc;∞</sub>, V<sub>me;∞</sub>), respectively, are given by V<sub>mc;∞</sub>=V<sub>c</sub>⋅(k<sub>in</sub>/k<sub>out</sub>)⋅(k<sub>out</sub> +k<sub>flip</sub>)/(k<sub>out</sub> +2⋅k<sub>flip</sub>) and V<sub>me;∞</sub>=V<sub>c</sub>⋅(k<sub>in</sub>/k<sub>out</sub>)⋅k<sub>flip</sub>/(k<sub>out</sub> +2⋅k<sub>flip</sub>).</p><p>Once the drug concentrations in the various compartments have stabilized, the channel pool approaches an equilibrium distribution between its available (unliganded, ligandbound, and, for Schemes 3 and 4, diliganded) forms. The concentration-dependence of steady-state current activation reflects the concentration-dependence of the fractional occupancy of the monoliganded state (Y<sub>1</sub>) for Schemes 1 and 2, but of the diliganded state (Y<sub>2</sub>) for Schemes 3 and 4. The latter are given by Y<sub>1</sub> = V<sub>∞</sub>/(K<sub>d;mem</sub> +V<sub>∞</sub>) and Y<sub>2</sub> = (V<sub>∞</sub>/(K<sub>d;mem</sub> +V<sub>∞</sub>))<sup>2</sup>, respectively, where K<sub>d;mem</sub> = k<sub>off</sub>/k<sub>on</sub>', and V<sub>∞</sub>=V<sub>m;∞</sub> for Schemes 1 and 3, but V<sub>∞</sub>=V<sub>me;∞</sub> for Schemes 2 and 4. The midpoints of these predicted concentration response curves (K<sub>0.5;mem</sub>), that is the drug concentrations in the target compartment (membrane or external membrane leaflet) that cause half-maximal stimulation, are obtained as K<sub>0.5;mem</sub> = K<sub>d;mem</sub> for Schemes 1 and 2, but K<sub>0.5;mem</sub> = (1+√2)⋅K<sub>d;mem</sub> for Schemes 3 and 4. When plotted using a logarithmic abscissa, the midpoint slope of the dose response curve for Schemes 3 and 4 corresponds to that of a Hill function with Hill coefficint n<sub>H</sub> = 2⋅(2–√2). The apparent drug affinities (K<sub>0.5;aq</sub>), that is the drug concentrations in the cytosolic solution that cause half-maximal stimulation, are obtained as K<sub>0.5;aq</sub> = K<sub>0.5;mem</sub>/(k<sub>in</sub>/(2⋅k<sub>out</sub>)) for Schemes 1 and 3, but K<sub>0.5;aq</sub> = K<sub>0.5;mem</sub>/((k<sub>in</sub>/k<sub>out</sub>)⋅k<sub>flip</sub>/(k<sub>out</sub> +2⋅k<sub>flip</sub>)) for Schemes 2 and 4.</p></sec><sec id="s4-10"><title>Statistics</title><p>Data are presented as mean ± S.E.M from 3 to 13 independent measurements, as indicated in the figure legends.

Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, including Leon D Islas as the Reviewing Editor and Reviewer #1, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Sidney Simon (Reviewer #3).</p><p>Our decision has been reached after consultation between the reviewers. Based on these discussions and the individual reviews below, we regret to inform you that your work will not be considered further for publication in <italic>eLife</italic>.</p><p>While the reviewers agree that the data presented in the manuscript is sound and represents an important technical development in understanding the action of ivacaftor on CFTR, they also think that the paper did not provide any insight into the molecular interaction of the drug with the channel and the determinants of solubility in biological tissues. The reviewers point out that this diminishes the relevance and interest of the paper to a broader readership.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic> </p><p>The CFTR Cl<sup>-</sup> ion channel is responsible for adequate mucus secretion in respiratory epithelia. Multiple mutations are associated with CFTR dysfunction and consequent induction of cystic fibrosis (CF), which can be lethal. One of the few treatments approved for CF is the drug Vx-770, which has been shown to be effective in potentiating CFTR mutants characterized by a low open probability, a gating defect.</p><p>In this paper by Csanády and Töröcsik present data that resolve a standing controversy in the CFTR and Vx-770 literature and which could also have an impact in the clinical application of this drug to CF patients.</p><p>The experiments included in this manuscript show that Vx-770 has an extremely low solubility in water. As a consequence of this, the dose utilized in diverse laboratories is likely extremely high and mostly undetermined, accounting for the different values of EC<sub>50</sub> reported. More interestingly, Vx-770 effects are reportedly irreversible. This manuscript presents a determination of the solubility of Vx-770 in several solvents, including water, and shows that when the correct activating doses (below nM concentrations) are applied, the drug effects are perfectly reversible.</p><p>The experiments are of high quality and represent a solid foundation to start to understand the biophysics and molecular basis of the gating effects of this drug.</p><p>In addition, this is an important contribution that might have clinical relevance, as it will help understand the pharmacokinetics of Vx-770.</p><p>I have a suggestion regarding the use of the multiple-step model employed to explain the delay in activation time course when Vx-770 is applied. The suggested model is an irreversible model, which may appear as a contradiction with the finding that the drug effects are indeed reversible.

And finally it should be clearly stated that this is not a scheme that explain gating, that is, states S1 to S4 are not to be interpreted as channel conformational states.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic> </p><p>In this study the authors determine the solubility profile and stimulatory potency of Vx-770 (ivacaftor), a CFTR potentiator drug in clinical use to treat people with cystic fibrosis, towards wild-type and mutant human CFTR channels using the patch-clamp technique with excised inside-out membrane patches. They find that its solubility in aqueous saline (pH=7.1) is ~200-fold lower (~60 nanomolar), whereas the potency of its stimulatory effect is &gt;100-fold higher, than previously reported, and is fully reversible. They find evidence that several slow steps are involved in the activation pathway. The experiments are generally well done and of high quality. The manuscript is well written. However, significance is reduced because no new insight is gained how Vx-770 interacts with CFTR to activate channel activity. Usually a methodological progress is presented in the context of describing an important new insight that could be obtained because of the method. In addition, because solubility in biological fluids at physiological pH and body temperature is not studied, the results appear only relevant to a small group of readers who perform CFTR patch clamp electrophysiology with excised membrane patches.</p><p>In addition, I have the following comments:</p><p>In subsection “CFTR channel stimulation by Vx-770 is fully reversible”: the authors state &quot;up to ~200-fold higher than those that can be ever attained in the human body using oral drug administration.&quot; This statement appears not justified by the data. The authors do not study solubility of Vx-770 in biological fluids and tissues. For instance, protein present in a biological intra- or extracellular fluid may increase solubility substantially. In this context it is also not clear to me why the authors do not test solubility at 37°C and pH values that resemble intra- or extracellular pH.</p><p>Figure 2C: A one-tailed Student t-test appears not appropriate. First, since CFTR channel inactivation by Vx-770 has been described among the effects of Vx-770 in the literature (see Introduction section final paragraph) the statistical test should be two-tailed.

In my opinion the most important finding of this work is that they found is that, in contrast to previous studies that found Vx-770 to be irreversible, they found that by using lower concentrations that it is completely reversible. They measured its oil (octanol etc.)/water (saline) partition coefficient although I think it would have been more useful to measure the membrane (GUV's) +/- cholesterol/saline partition coefficient given they were testing the drug in frog oocytes. Moreover, since they wrote &quot;the basic properties of the drug remain unknown or controversial&quot;, I think a description of the drug, its shape (planar), purity (important as K1/2 = 0.47 nM) and its pK<sub>a</sub> values in salt and low dielectric media (if known, and if not discuss) would be useful to the reader. Also, I would like to know (if known) where on the membrane or channel is it binding and if its action a consequence of membrane deformation and/or to a binding site on CTFR that has not been alluded to.

The Reviewers all agreed that the results support the conclusions. The rejection was based on two issues: (1) a lack of insight into the molecular interaction of the drug with the channel, and (2) a lack of information on its solubility in biological tissues. I have serious objections against both of these major criticisms, as discussed in detail below.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1) &quot;significance is reduced because no new insight is gained how Vx-770 interacts with CFTR to activate channel activity. Usually a methodological progress is presented in the context of describing an important new insight that could be obtained because of the method.&quot; (Reviewer 2)</p></disp-quote><p>As to the question of significance, I had sent a presubmission inquiry to Senior Editor Richard Aldrich, describing him the main findings of this study, and explicitly pointing out that no biological mechanisms are addressed. In his response, Dr. Aldrich judged the findings of sufficient interest, and encouraged submission to <italic>eLife</italic>. It comes therefore as a surprise that the findings are judged insignificant at the present stage. I do agree that in general determination of solubility and potency of a drug is in itself not a major advance. But there are not many drugs that make it to the clinics, and ivacaftor is one of them. The fact that ~100000 CF patients are taking the drug on a daily basis warrants that studying its mechanisms will remain in the center of research efforts for years to come. On the other hand, despite a very large number (&gt;500) of studies published on the drug since its discovery, both its binding site on the protein and its mechanism remain elusive, in large part due to inadequately designed experiments in which highly supersaturated solutions were used. Therefore, I do think that in the present case the simple establishment of the drug's true solubility profile, true potency, and concentration dependence of its apparent on- and off-rates, is a major breakthrough which will put all published studies into a new perspective, and allow all future studies to be planned adequately.</p><p>As to the second point, reviewers 2 and 3 seem to have misunderstood the relevance of a saturated vs. supersaturated solution, and they have confounded the relevance of drug-protein binding with that of true solubility. In truth − except for a potential effect on solubility of elevating temperature to 37<sup>o</sup>C (which we could verify) − all our results apply to the biological fluids and cell membranes of a living organism, as discussed below.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2.1) &quot;solubility in biological fluids at physiological pH and body temperature is not studied&quot; and&quot;the authors state &quot;up to ~200-fold higher than those that can be ever attained in the human body using oral drug administration.&quot; This statement appears not justified by the data. The authors do not study solubility of Vx-770 in biological fluids and tissues. For instance, protein present in a biological intra- or extracellular fluid may increase solubility substantially.&quot; (Reviewer 2)</p></disp-quote><p>Of course, it is well known that Vx-770 binds to plasma proteins, and total plasma concentrations in patients following drug administration have been measured and documented by the FDA: peak total plasma concentrations may reach values up to 10 μM. However, cell membranes are at equilibrium with FREE dissolved Vx-770, not with the protein-bound drug. Therefore, in a living organism the target cell membranes will accumulate Vx-770 only to an extent that is at equilibrium with FREE dissolved Vx-770 (in the extracellular fluid and/or in the cytosol). Thus, although drug binding proteins are important for pharmacokinetics (they increase the drug transport capacity of the blood and therefore oral bioavailability, and act as a drug buffer system that replenishes the free drug pool during the time course of its elimination from the body), for the effective drug concentration in the target cell membrane the only relevant parameter is FREE dissolved Vx-770 − for which we have established an upper limit here.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2.2) &quot;In this context it is also not clear to me why the authors do not test solubility at 37°C and pH values that resemble intra- or extracellular pH.&quot; (Reviewer 2)</p></disp-quote><p>The composition of the aqueous saline in which Vx-770 solubility was determined resembled that of an intracellular fluid with respect to ionic strength, osmolarity, as well as pH (7.1). We did not test solubility at 37<sup>o</sup>C, but this could be very easily added. Of note, although solubility at 37<sup>o</sup>C is clearly of academic interest, we believe that solubility at 25<sup>o</sup>C is practically more relevant: solubility has to be known under the conditions that are used in experiments aimed at understanding the mechanisms of the drug. The majority of such experiments have been conducted at room temperature.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2.3) &quot;I am sure Vx-770 will bind to various biological structures and proteins when it is in the body so I doubt it at supersaturated concentrations in the fluid phase.&quot; (Reviewer 3)</p></disp-quote><p>This is a misunderstanding. We did not claim that supersaturated concentrations are reached in the body. Quite on the contrary, we claim that in the body FREE drug concentrations will never become higher than saturated.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2.4) &quot;Is there any evidence that Vx-770 will form crystalline precipitates in the bilayer?&quot; (Reviewer 3)</p></disp-quote><p>This is a thermodynamic necessity. When a saturated aqueous solution is at equilibrium with a membrane, the membrane also has to be saturated. Similarly, when a membrane is exposed to a supersaturated solution (that is, a solution which is kept supersaturated by continuous superfusion), the membrane will also become supersaturated. Thus, over time crystals will have to form. Indirect experimental evidence comes from our demonstration that Vx-770 effects are fully reversible when supersaturating concentrations are avoided, whereas they are reportedly irreversible when supersaturated solutions are used.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2.5) &quot;by definition a solution is saturated when it is in equilibrium with its bulk phase (i.e. Xstals)- it is not necessarily supersaturated then.&quot; (Reviewer 3)</p></disp-quote><p>We agree. This is exactly how we generated our 1x saturated stock: by equilibrating the solution with crystals, followed by removal of undissolved crystals. In contrast, in previous studies supersaturated solutions were obtained by diluting Vx-770 from a DMSO-based stock into an aqueous buffer. Because Vx-770 is 10-million times more soluble in DMSO compared to water, it is easy to generate supersaturated aqueous solutions using the latter approach.</p><p>3) The remaining comments are all issues that could be easily amended as follows:</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3.1) &quot;I have a suggestion regarding the use of the multiple-step model employed to explain the delay in activation time course when Vx-770 is applied.

It is also true that in its present (irreversible) form the fitted scheme seems to contradict the demonstrated reversibility of the drug effects, and so allowing reversibility for all three steps would seem logical. However, in the absence of more specific structural information, we feel that postulation of any specific mechanistic model would be highly speculative. We therefore simply aimed to find the mathematical function with the smallest number of free parameters suitable to describe the on- time courses, and used the fitted curves only to obtain the apparent on- time constant (τ*). All this could be of course stated and explained much more clearly in Materials and methods.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3.2) &quot;Figure 2C: A one-tailed Student t-test appears not appropriate.

Solubilities in ethanol or DMSO were added for practical reasons, since those solvents are used by researchers to generate stock solutions of the drug. Solubility in octanol, and the octanol:water partition coefficient, were determined for three reasons. First, the octanol:water distribution coefficient is a very good predictor of a drug's overall membrane solubility, and is one of the key parameters used in the pharmaceutical industry to compare drugs. Second, octanol is immiscible with water, and can therefore be conveniently used to extract the drug from the aqueous phase. Third, Vx-770 dissolved in octanol is a well defined, homogeneous, single-phase system (a true solution) in which the drug concentration can be readily measured using spectrophotometry. The latter two properties were exploited to determine the aqueous solubility of the drug. In contrast, GUV's (i) represent a poorly defined system (with properties highly dependent on lipid composition), (ii) form a colloidal suspension in water rather than a homogeneous system, and (iii) determination of drug solubility in GUV's would be technically challenging.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3.4) &quot;a description of the drug, its shape (planar), purity (important as K1/2 = 0.47 nM) and its pK<sub>a</sub> values in salt and low dielectric media (if known, and if not discuss) would be useful to the reader.&quot; (Reviewer 3)</p></disp-quote><p>Formula and shape can be added to Figure 1.

It is true that sonication can also speed up dissolution of small molecules, however, it can easily result in the generation of supersaturated solutions. Therefore, for the determination of true solubility sonication is better avoided. Our approach of vigourous shaking of drug crystals in small volumes (250 ml) of buffer for 24 hours seems a safer approach for reaching thermodynamic equilibrium. Of note, in four independent experiments we obtained identical final aqueous drug concentrations (62 ± 2 nM) following removal of undissolved crystals (by filtering + centrifugation), although the total amount of added drug was not identical, as the crystals were not weighed out on a balance. This indicates that in all four cases saturation was achieved.</p><p>Heating is clearly irrelevant for the determination of drug solubility at 25<sup>o</sup>C.

We have extensively revised the manuscript along three major lines:</p><p>i) We have measured pH-dependence (in the physiological pH range), as well as temperature dependence of aqueous solubility of Vx-770, and calculated thermodynamic parameters of the solution process. We find that solubility is not increased when pH is elevated from 7.1 (intracellular pH) to 7.4 (extracellular pH). This implies that the smallest acidic pK<sub>a</sub> value of the drug is substantially higher than 7.4. Therefore, in physiological fluids, the major microspecies of the drug is the fully protonated uncharged form. Thus, the distribution of the drug between the extra- and intracellular space is not influenced by the transmembrane pH gradient or the membrane potential (subsection “pH- and temperature dependence of Vx-770 solubility” first paragaph). We further find an ~2-fold higher aqueous solubility of the drug at 37<sup>o</sup>C relative to 25<sup>o</sup>C, which is consistent with reported temperature dependences of solubilities of other highly hydrophobic drugs, and offers a thermodynamic explanation for the low solubility of Vx-770 (subsection “pH- and temperature dependence of Vx-770 solubility” second paragraph).</p><p>ii) While this paper was under review, a study, presented at the 2019 European Cystic Fibrosis Society Basic Science Conference, identified two potential binding sites of Vx-770 on the CFTR protein using in silico docking combined with site-directed mutagenesis. These findings, published in the mean time in the Journal of General Physiology (Yeh et al., 2019), have prompted us to attempt proposing and testing mechanistic kinetic models to explain the complex time courses of channel activation/deactivation that we had observed in response to addition/removal of the drug. Our modeling is indeed consistent with the presence of two independent binding sites for Vx-770 on the CFTR protein, and suggests that channel potentiation requires simultaneous binding of two drug molecules. These extensive modeling results are summarized in a new section of Results, two new figures (Figure 5 and Figure 5—figure supplement 1), and a new Table (Table 2).</p><p>iii) To clarify misunderstandings, and to better explain the physiological relevance of our findings, we now provide a more elaborate discussion of our findings. Due to the expansion of both data and discussion, the original &quot;Results and Discussion&quot; section has now been separated into &quot;Results&quot; and &quot;Discussion&quot;.</p><p>These major additions have significantly broadened the scope of our study, which we now hope will be found suitable for publication.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Our suggestion is that you make the changes that are proposed in their appeal letter, especially in response to the minor issues raised in the previous review and that you place more emphasis on the clinical and physiological relevance of the findings.</p></disp-quote><p>We now discuss physiological implications at several places. In particular, we discuss the relevances (i) of protein-bound vs. free Vx-770 to drug transport vs. drug accumulation in target cell membranes (Discussion paragraph one), (ii) of aqueous solubility as an upper limit of free drug concentration in the body (Discussion paragraph one), (iii) of drug deprotonation to the distribution of the drug between the extra- and intracellular space (subsection “pH- and temperature dependence of Vx-770 solubility” paragraph one; Discussion first paragraph), (iv) of two-orders-of-magnitude higher (compared to reported values) apparent drug affinities to clinical dosage regimes (Discussion section final paragraph).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Pay attention to the suggestion of measuring solubility at 37°C and make a point of clarifying the applicability of the results to the context of biological fluids.</p></disp-quote><p>We have measured solubility at 37<sup>o</sup>C (subsection “pH- and temperature dependence of Vx-770 solubility” second paragraph), and have analyzed the thermodynamic implications of the data (second paragraph).

We also discuss that the measured aqueous solubility provides an upper limit of free drug concentration in the body. Finally, we discuss how deprotonation might affect the distribution of a drug between the extra- and intracellular space. We show that Vx-770 remains fully protonated (uncharged) and that, therefore, the transmembrane pH gradient and membrane potential do not affect its distribution (subsection “pH- and temperature dependence of Vx-770 solubility”; Discussion first paragraph).</p></body></sub-article></article>
