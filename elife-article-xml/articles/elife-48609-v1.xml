Although much is known about the kinases that control inflammatory signaling, less is known about the opposing phosphatases. Here we report that deletion of the gene encoding PH domain Leucine-rich repeat Protein Phosphatase 1 (PHLPP1) protects mice from lethal lipopolysaccharide (LPS) challenge and live <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> infection. Investigation of PHLPP1 function in macrophages reveals that it controls the magnitude and duration of inflammatory signaling by dephosphorylating the transcription factor STAT1 on Ser727 to inhibit its activity, reduce its promoter residency, and reduce the expression of target genes involved in innate immunity and cytokine signaling. This previously undescribed function of PHLPP1 depends on a bipartite nuclear localization signal in its unique N-terminal extension. Our data support a model in which nuclear PHLPP1 dephosphorylates STAT1 to control the magnitude and duration of inflammatory signaling in macrophages.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>STAT1</kwd><kwd>PHLPP1</kwd><kwd>inflammation</kwd><kwd>phosphatase</kwd><kwd>transcription factors</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R35 GM122523</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Newton</surname><given-names>Alexandra C</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>DK091183</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Glass</surname><given-names>Christopher K</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>GM067946</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Newton</surname><given-names>Alexandra C</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>HL125352</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Nizet</surname><given-names>Victor</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>DK063491</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Glass</surname><given-names>Christopher K</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>T32 CA009523</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Cohen Katsenelson</surname><given-names>Ksenya</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund7"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>T32 GM007752</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kawashima</surname><given-names>Agnieszka T</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Uncovering a mechanism for how inflammatory signaling is opposed by a phosphatase identifies a potential druggable target to treat <italic>E. coli</italic> sepsis.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Gene expression is an exquisitely regulated process that maintains cellular homeostasis and orchestrates appropriate responses to environmental stimuli such as hormones, cytokines, and pathogenic microbes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Dawson and Kouzarides, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Flavahan et al., 2017</xref>). Homeostatic control of inflammatory genes is particularly relevant to cancer since chronic inflammation promotes tumorigenesis and influences patient response to cancer therapeutics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Coussens and Werb, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Grivennikov et al., 2010</xref>). Dysregulated gene expression, a hallmark of cancer, can arise from mutations in transcription factors (exemplified by p53; see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Sabapathy and Lane, 2018</xref>), alterations in signaling pathways controlling transcription factor function (for example, hormone-dependent transcription factors in prostate and breast cancers; see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Jernberg et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Pejerrey et al., 2018</xref>), or upregulation of oncogenic transcription factors (notably c-myc, which regulates essential cell-cycle checkpoints; see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kalkat et al., 2017</xref>). Aberrant protein phosphorylation underpins all of these mechanisms, via dysregulation of signaling pathways, alterations in transcription factor machinery, and/or effects on the chromatin epigenetic landscape (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Rossetto et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Whitmarsh and Davis, 2000</xref>). Thus, targeting phosphorylation mechanisms is of considerable therapeutic interest.</p><p>Macrophages are among the first responders to infection, engaging foreign pathogens via pattern recognition receptors, including the Toll-like receptors (TLRs). TLRs are a conserved family of cell surface or phagosome-associated receptors that discriminate distinct features of microbial and viral pathogens, including lipoproteins (TLR1/2/6), lipopolysaccharide (LPS) (TLR4), flagellin (TLR5), single-stranded RNA (TLR7/8), double-stranded RNA (TLR3), and double-stranded DNA (TLR9) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Karin et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">O'Neill et al., 2013</xref>). Upon pathogen recognition by TLRs, a pro-inflammatory response is initiated that activates the signal-dependent transcription factors nuclear factor-κ B (NFκB), activator protein 1 (AP1), interferon response factors (IRFs), and, through secondary mechanisms, the signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) protein family (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">O'Neill et al., 2013</xref>). These activated transcription factors function in a combinatorial manner to drive expression of antimicrobial and inflammatory response genes that aid in elimination of foreign pathogens. However, while inflammation is required for protection against foreign microbes, it can lead to excessive cytokine production, chronic inflammation, and cancer if not properly resolved (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Coussens and Werb, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Fullerton and Gilroy, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Grivennikov et al., 2010</xref>). Thus, macrophages have evolved regulatory mechanisms to resolve inflammatory responses in a timely manner, including shut down of STAT1 signaling pathways by the suppressor of cytokine signaling (SOCS) family of proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">O'Shea and Murray, 2008</xref>), suppression of nitric oxide production by the enzyme arginase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Wynn and Vannella, 2016</xref>), and inhibition of a key subset of NFκB-dependent genes by anti-inflammatory omega-3 fatty acids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Oishi et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>STAT1 is the founding member of the STAT transcription factor family and serves as a paradigm for how phosphorylation regulates transcription factor structure, function, and localization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Darnell et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Morris et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Stark and Darnell, 2012</xref>). In the canonical pathway, STATs are recruited from the cytosol to cytokine-bound and Tyr-phosphorylated receptors where they are phosphorylated on a key Tyr residue (Tyr701 for STAT1) by Janus Kinases (JAKs). This phosphorylation event promotes STAT dimerization and nuclear entry, allowing STAT binding to specific promoter sequences and thus initiating gene transcription. Upon promoter binding, STATs become additionally phosphorylated on a regulatory Ser residue at a MAPK consensus sequence (Ser727 for STAT1), a modification that enhances their transcriptional activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Darnell, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Sadzak et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Wen et al., 1995b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Whitmarsh and Davis, 2000</xref>). Importantly, STAT1 transduces signals from type I and II interferons (IFNs), resulting in binding to IFN-stimulated response elements (ISREs) and to IFN-gamma (IFNγ)-activated site (GAS) elements in the promoters of IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs), inducing their transcription and stimulating inflammation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Platanias, 2005</xref>). While the kinases that phosphorylate Tyr701 and Ser727 on STAT1 have been extensively studied, as have been the phosphatases that dephosphorylate Tyr701, the phosphatases that oppose the Ser727 phosphorylation are unknown.</p><p>PH domain Leucine-rich repeat Protein Phosphatase 1 (PHLPP1) is one of the newest members of the phosphatome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chen et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Gao et al., 2005</xref>). Originally discovered for its function in suppressing growth factor signaling by dephosphorylating Akt on the hydrophobic motif site, Ser473 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Gao et al., 2005</xref>), the repertoire of PHLPP1 substrates is continually expanding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Grzechnik and Newton, 2016</xref>). PHLPP1 is a bona fide tumor suppressor: its expression is frequently lost in cancer and its genetic ablation in a mouse model results in prostate neoplasia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Chen et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Liu et al., 2009</xref>). PHLPP1 is also involved in the immune response, where its dephosphorylation of Akt reduces the capacity of regulatory T cells to transduce T cell receptor signals, a key function in T cell development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Patterson et al., 2011</xref>). Additionally, mice lacking PHLPP1 have enhanced chondrocyte proliferation as a result of increased Akt2 activity, diminished FoxO1 levels, and increased <italic>Fgf18</italic> expression, suggesting PHLPP1 inhibition could be a strategy to promote cartilage regeneration and repair (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bradley et al., 2015</xref>). PHLPP1 also suppresses receptor tyrosine kinase gene expression by a mechanism distinct from its effects on Akt, to influence growth factor signaling, including that mediated by the epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Reyes et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>PHLPP1 is unusual among protein phosphatases in that its regulatory modules and catalytic domain are on the same polypeptide. Most notably, it has a PH domain essential for dephosphorylation of protein kinase C (PKC) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Gao et al., 2008</xref>), a PDZ ligand necessary for Akt recognition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Gao et al., 2005</xref>), and a leucine-rich repeat (LRR) segment required for transcriptional regulation of receptor tyrosine kinases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Reyes et al., 2014</xref>). In addition, PHLPP1 possesses an approximately 50 kDa N-terminal extension (NTE) of unknown function. Stoichiometric association with substrates by direct binding to the protein-interaction domains on PHLPP or common scaffolds (e.g. PDZ domain proteins such as Scribble; see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Li et al., 2011</xref>) allows fidelity and specificity in PHLPP function, and may account for its &gt; 10 fold lower catalytic rate compared to the closely related phosphatase PP2Cα (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Sierecki and Newton, 2014</xref>). Given its transcriptional regulation of at least one family of genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Reyes et al., 2014</xref>), PHLPP1 is an attractive pharmacological target for modulation of gene expression.</p><p>Here we report that nuclear-localized PHLPP1 opposes STAT1 Ser727 phosphorylation to inhibit its transcriptional activity and promote normal resolution of inflammatory signaling. We find that <italic>Phlpp1<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice have improved survival following infection with <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> (<italic>E. coli</italic>), indicating a role of the phosphatase in innate immunity. Since macrophages are key in the initial response to lipopolysaccharide (LPS) from Gram-negative bacteria such as <italic>E. coli</italic>, we further explored the role of PHLPP1 in controlling LPS-dependent signaling in this cell type. The STAT1 binding motif was identified from the most common promoter sequences of 199 genes that remained elevated following LPS treatment of bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDMs) from <italic>Phlpp1<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice compared to those from wild-type (WT) mice. We validated common transcriptional targets of PHLPP1 and STAT1, showing that loss of PHLPP1 upregulates the transcription of several genes including guanylate binding protein 5 (<italic>Gbp5</italic>), whereas loss of STAT1 downregulates them. Cellular studies revealed that dephosphorylation of STAT1 on Ser727 suppresses its transcriptional activity by a mechanism that depends both on the catalytic activity of PHLPP1 and a previously undescribed nuclear localization signal (NLS) in the NTE of PHLPP1. Taken together, our results identify PHLPP1 as a major player in the resolution of inflammatory signaling.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>PHLPP1 regulates the innate immune response</title><p>To explore the role of PHLPP1 in acute inflammation, we examined the kinetics and outcome of sepsis-induced death caused by intraperitoneal (i.p.) injection of Gram-negative <italic>E. coli</italic> bacteria in WT and <italic>Phlpp1<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice. Surprisingly, absence of PHLPP1 provided a strong protective effect; at a dose where more than 50% of WT mice died within 12 hr of <italic>E. coli</italic> challenge, 50% of the <italic>Phlpp1<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice remained alive after 10 days (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Similarly, <italic>Phlpp1<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice were protected from toxicity induced by the purified Gram-negative bacterial cell wall component LPS, with nearly half of the <italic>Phlpp1<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice alive after 10 days compared to only 1 out of 16 of the WT mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). To understand the lower mortality rates in <italic>Phlpp1<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice, we measured levels of different cytokines in the serum of mice across a time course following LPS injection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C–E</xref>). Serum levels of pro-inflammatory cytokine interleukin 6 (IL-6) were significantly increased in WT mice within 5 hr of LPS injection, returning to baseline within 12 hr (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). In contrast, the <italic>Phlpp1<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice had 2-fold lower IL-6 levels at 5 hr post-infection, but these levels were sustained for up to 24 hr, suggestive of improper resolution of inflammation. Levels of another pro-inflammatory cytokine, IL-1β, were likewise consistently higher in <italic>Phlpp1<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice compared with WT mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). By contrast, levels of the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10 did not differ significantly between the WT and <italic>Phlpp1<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). Note that cytokine levels were measured up to 24 hr post LPS injection, when the protective effect of PHLPP1 loss was not yet apparent. These findings indicate an essential role for PHLPP1 in regulation of the innate immune response at the whole organism level.</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.48609.002</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>PHLPP1 knock-out mice are protected against sepsis-induced death.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Survival curve of WT and <italic>Phlpp1<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice i.p. infected with 1 × 10<sup>7</sup> cfu of <italic>E. coli</italic>.

Because STAT1 functions in the nucleus, we next asked whether PHLPP1 regulation of STAT1 occurs in the cytoplasm or nucleus. To this end, we assessed the effect of expressing either the PP2C domain of PHLPP1 or a nuclear-targeted (NLS) PP2C domain of PHLPP1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>) on IFNγ-induced STAT1 promoter activity via the GAS luciferase assay. The overexpressed PP2C domain of PHLPP1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>, blue) was considerably less effective in inhibiting STAT1 promoter activity compared to full-length PHLPP1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>, red). However, forcing the PP2C domain into the nucleus by attaching an NLS to its N-terminus inhibited STAT1 promoter activity as effectively as overexpression of full-length PHLPP1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>, orange). Analysis of the subcellular localization of the constructs used in this experiment revealed that full-length PHLPP1 was primarily cytosolic, the isolated PP2C domain had increased nuclear localization, and the NLS-PP2C was enriched in the nucleus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s3">Figure 6—figure supplement 3</xref>). To address whether PHLPP1 catalytic activity is required for STAT1 regulation, we utilized a phosphatase-dead PP2C domain in which two active site residues, Asp1210 and Asp1413 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Sierecki and Newton, 2014</xref>) were mutated to Ala (DDAA). The catalytically-inactive NLS-PP2C was no longer able to suppress STAT1 activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>, purple); immunofluorescence confirmed its nuclear localization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s3">Figure 6—figure supplement 3</xref>). Thus, both the catalytic activity and nuclear localization of PHLPP1 are necessary for it to regulate STAT1 transcriptional activity.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>PHLPP1 has a bipartite nuclear localization signal in its N-Terminal extension</title><p>Bioinformatics analysis of the sequence of PHLPP1 using SeqNLS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Lin and Hu, 2013</xref>) revealed a potential Arg-rich bipartite NLS (<sup>92</sup>RRRRR-X-<sup>122</sup>RRGRLKR) in the N-terminal extension unique to the PHLPP1 isozyme (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>). To test whether these basic segments function as an NLS, we examined the subcellular localization in HeLa cells of the NTE alone or NTE in which the basic residues in each or both halves of the potential bipartite NLS were mutated to Ala (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E</xref>). Immunofluorescence revealed that the NTE localizes to the nucleus. Mutation of the first NLS or the second NLS increased the distribution of the NTE to the cytosol, and mutation of both decreased the nuclear:cytoplasmic ratio to be comparable to that of a construct of the NTE with a strong Nuclear Export Signal (NES) (LALKLAGLDI from PKI; see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Wen et al., 1995a</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6F</xref>). Full-length PHLPP1 was primarily cytosolic, leading us to ask whether there may also be an NES. Bioinformatics analysis of the primary sequence identified a potential Leu-rich NES (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Xu et al., 2015</xref>) immediately following the last LRR and preceding the phosphatase domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s4">Figure 6—figure supplement 4</xref>). Attachment of this 14-residue sequence to the N-terminus of the NTE resulted in distribution of the NTE to the cytosol (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s4">Figure 6—figure supplement 4</xref>). Thus, PHLPP1 nuclear localization is controlled by a bipartite NLS in the NTE and is opposed by an NES following the LRR. Lastly, we examined the effect of mutating the NLS on the ability of full-length PHLPP1 to reduce STAT1 transcriptional activity as assessed using the GAS promoter assay. The reduction in IFNγ-induced STAT1 activity resulting from PHLPP1 overexpression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6G</xref>, red) was abolished upon mutation of NLS2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6G</xref>, brown) or both halves of the NLS (NLS1/2) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6G</xref>, purple). Mutation of NLS1 had an intermediate effect (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6G</xref>, blue).

It is likely that this immunoregulatory phenotype reflects roles of PHLPP1 in several immune cell types, and future studies of mice with cell-specific deletions of <italic>Phlpp1</italic> will be of great interest. Investigation of <italic>Phlpp1</italic><sup>-/-</sup> macrophages indicates a significant role in counter-regulation of STAT1-dependent transcription that emerges as a secondary response to TLR4 ligation. Our mechanistic analyses show that PHLPP1 dephosphorylates STAT1 on a key regulatory site to suppress its transcriptional activity towards an array of genes involved in mounting an inflammatory response to IFNγ. Specifically, PHLPP1 directly dephosphorylates Ser727 on STAT1 <italic>in vitro</italic> and specifically suppresses phosphorylation of Ser727, but not Tyr701, on STAT1 in cells, correlating to decreased transcriptional activity of STAT1 at one of its major binding sites, the GAS promoter. The intrinsic catalytic activity and nuclear localization of PHLPP1 is required for this transcriptional regulation; while the isolated PP2C domain is not efficient in suppressing GAS promoter activity, forcing the PP2C domain into the nucleus is as effective as the full-length phosphatase in controlling transcriptional activity. Nuclear localization of the full-length enzyme is driven by a bipartite NLS we identify in the NTE. Elimination of PHLPP1 results in global changes in KLA-dependent transcriptional regulation, with 20% of the approximately 2000 genes whose expression changes upon KLA stimulation differing by more than two-fold in BMDMs from <italic>Phlpp1<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice compared to WT mice.</p><p>Phosphorylation of STAT1 on Ser727 has been proposed to occur following the binding of the Tyr-phosphorylated STAT1 dimer to chromatin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Sadzak et al., 2008</xref>). Ser727 phosphorylation on the C-terminal transactivation domain of STAT1 is necessary for maximal transcriptional activity. Identification of PHLPP1 as a phosphatase that opposes this phosphorylation provides a mechanism to counter-regulate the activity of this key transcription factor. Several lines of evidence suggest that PHLPP1 may be the major phosphatase that controls this regulatory site. First, genetic depletion of PHLPP1 increases both STAT1 Ser727 phosphorylation and transcriptional activity at the GAS promoter, whereas PHLPP1 overexpression decreases both STAT1 Ser727 phosphorylation and transcriptional activity at the promoter. Second, both the IFNγ-induced phosphorylation of Ser727 and resulting increase in transcriptional activity at the GAS promoter are insensitive to OA, a phosphatase inhibitor that is ineffective towards PP2C family members but highly effective towards the abundant PP2A in cells. The insensitivity of STAT1 Ser727 phosphorylation to OA is consistent with PHLPP1 directly dephosphorylating this site in cells, a reaction it catalyzes <italic>in vitro</italic>. Furthermore, although PHLPP1 does suppress the signaling output of Akt (by dephosphorylating Ser473; see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Gao et al., 2005</xref>) and Erk (by reducing the steady-state levels of RTKs; see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Reyes et al., 2014</xref>), its effect on STAT1 is unlikely to involve either of these targets because the activities of both kinases are sensitive to OA. Nor are the effects on Ser727 a result of PHLPP1 reducing PKC steady-state levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Baffi et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Gao et al., 2008</xref>), as the general PKC inhibitor Gö6983 did not alter GAS promoter activity <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">(Figure 6—figure supplement 2</xref>). Third, genetic depletion of either PHLPP1 or STAT1 has opposing effects on transcriptional targets of STAT1: whereas KLA causes a larger increase in mRNA of <italic>Cd69</italic>, <italic>Ifit2</italic>, and <italic>Gbp5</italic> in BMDMs from <italic>Phlpp1<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice compared to WT mice, a reduction in these transcripts is observed upon STAT1 knockdown. Lastly, we have previously shown that PHLPP1 regulates transcription of genes and binds chromatin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Reyes et al., 2014</xref>). Cumulatively, these data are consistent with PHLPP1 being the major phosphatase to oppose the activating phosphorylation of STAT1 on Ser727, thereby limiting its transcriptional activity.</p><p>The interaction of PHLPP1 with STAT1, mediated by its NTE, affords fidelity and specificity in its dephosphorylation of the transcription factor. PHLPP1 binding to STAT1 is consistent with this multi-valent protein utilizing its protein-interaction domains to position it near its substrates, either via direct interaction or by binding protein scaffolds, such as PDZ domain proteins that coordinate Akt signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Li et al., 2011</xref>). Such coordination is essential for its dephosphorylation of relevant substrates, in part due to the low catalytic activity of the phosphatase (approximately one reaction per sec towards peptide substrates, over an order of magnitude lower than that of the related phosphatase PP2Cα; see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Sierecki and Newton, 2014</xref>). The importance of enzyme proximity to its substrate is best illustrated with Akt, where deletion of the last three amino acids of PHLPP1 to remove the PDZ ligand abolishes the ability of PHLPP1 to dephosphorylate Akt in cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Gao et al., 2005</xref>). Thus, binding of PHLPP1 via its NTE to STAT1 affords an efficient mechanism to restrict its activity by directly opposing its phosphorylation in the nucleus (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>).</p><fig id="fig8" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.48609.013</object-id><label>Figure 8.</label><caption><title>Proposed model for PHLPP1-dependent suppression of STAT1 activity.</title><p>Binding of IFNγ to IFN receptors results in their dimerization and phosphorylation, promoting the recruitment of JAK, which phosphorylates STAT1 on Tyr701. This promotes the dimerization of STAT1 and its translocation into the nucleus where it binds the GAS promoter to allow the transcription of inflammatory response genes. Activity of STAT1 is enhanced by phosphorylation on Ser727. However, nuclear-localized PHLPP1, which binds STAT1 via its N-terminal extension, tunes the activity of STAT1 by directly dephosphorylating this site to keep activity finely controlled. Loss of PHLPP1 results in poor resolution of inflammatory response. The nuclear localization of PHLPP1 is controlled by a bipartite NLS (pink rectangles) in the NTE (green line) and an NES (purple rectangle) in the segment between the LRR (gray oval) and the PP2C domain (red oval).</p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-48609-fig8-v1.tif"/></fig><p>The regulation of STAT1 by PHLPP1 occurs in the nucleus, and we identify motifs in the phosphatase that control both the entry into (NLS) and exit from (NES) the nucleus. First, we identify a bipartite NLS in the NTE of PHLPP1 whose integrity is necessary for the phosphatase to regulate the transcriptional activity of STAT1. Second, we identify an NES in the segment between the LRR and PP2C domain that drives export out of the nucleus. Under the ‘unstimulated’ conditions of our immunofluorescence, PHLPP1 localized primarily to the cytosol, suggesting masking of the NLS and exposure of the NES. Inputs that regulate the exposure of the NLS and NES are likely important regulators of PHLPP1 function.</p><p>Our transcriptomic data support a key role for PHLPP1 in the resolution of the inflammatory response specific to genes downstream of type II IFN signaling pathways. This suggests the possibility that PHLPP1 can selectively discriminate between inflammatory promoters that are differentially regulated by distinct transcription factor families. Surprisingly, over 50% of the inflammatory genes that fail to properly resolve in the macrophages from <italic>Phlpp1<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice contain a consensus STAT-binding motif in their proximal promoters. Our studies have demonstrated a direct interaction between PHLPP1 and STAT1, thus it is highly likely that PHLPP1 is recruited to gene promoters through its association with STAT1. Elevated STAT1 occupancy and delayed dismissal kinetics of STAT1 from its target promoters in <italic>Phlpp1<sup>-/-</sup></italic> macrophages indicate a major function of PHLPP1-dependent dephosphorylation in termination of STAT1 signaling and its dismissal from chromatin.</p><p>Germline mutations that impair STAT1 function, by reducing either Tyr701 phosphorylation (L706S) or DNA binding (Q463H and E320Q), increase the susceptibility of otherwise healthy patients to mycobacterial and viral infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Chapgier et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Dupuis et al., 2001</xref>). This increased susceptibility was proposed to arise because of reduced transcription of genes involved in bacterial and viral immunity from the GAS and ISRE promoters, respectively. Similarly, genetic ablation of <italic>Stat1</italic> on the background of a mouse that has enhanced TLR4 signaling (because of deletion of <italic>Il6st</italic>, a key regulator of systemic inflammatory responses during LPS-mediated endotoxemia) provides protection against LPS-induced toxemic death compared to mice with normal STAT1 levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Luu et al., 2014</xref>). Although the current study does not provide direct evidence that enhanced phosphorylation of STAT1 causes the protective effect of PHLPP1 loss on both <italic>E. coli-</italic>induced sepsis and LPS-induced endotoxemia in mice, our data indicate that PHLPP1 inhibitors could be explored as adjunctive therapies to antibiotics and supportive care of patients with Gram-negative sepsis, a leading cause of mortality in intensive care units.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources

Transfections of pRL-CMV encoding Renilla luciferase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Heinz et al., 2010</xref>), together with a firefly luciferase promoter-reporter construct containing eight GAS consensus sequences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Horvai et al., 1997</xref>), control vector, or the indicated PHLPP constructs, were performed using Lipofectamine 3000 reagent (Invitrogen, L3000) for MEFs or Fugene six reagent (Promega, E269A) for HEK-293T cells. Cells were treated with murine or human IFNγ (PeproTech, 315–05, 300–02, respectively) for the indicated times at 37°C and activity was measured using the Dual-Glo Luciferase Assay System (Promega, E2940) in a Tecan Infinite M200 Pro multi-well plate reader. Promoter activity was corrected for the luciferase activity of the internal control plasmid, pRL-CMV, and Relative Response Ratios (RRR) were calculated.</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>Immunoprecipitation and western blot</title><p>DNA was transfected into HEK-293T cells using FuGene 6.

For co-immunoprecipitation, cells were lysed and the detergent-solubilized cell lysates were incubated with an anti-HA antibody (BioLegend, 901503) at 4°C overnight. Samples were incubated with protein A/G PLUS-Agarose (Santa Cruz Cat sc-2003) for 1 hr at 4°C and washed three times in lysis buffer containing 0.3 M NaCl and 0.1% Triton X 100.

Cells were permeabilized and blocked in 0.3% Triton X 100% and 3% BSA for 30 min at room temperature, followed by three 5 min washes in PBS-T. Primary antibodies were diluted at the following dilutions: mouse anti-HA, 1:500; rabbit anti-α-tubulin (Cell Signaling, 2125), 1:200. Secondary antibodies were diluted at the following dilutions: Alexa647 anti-mouse (Life Technologies, A21235), 1:500; Alexa488 anti-rabbit (Life Technologies, A11034), 1:500. Coverslips were mounted onto slides with ProLong Diamond Antifade Mountant with DAPI (ThermoFisher, P36966). Images were acquired on a Zeiss Axiovert 200M microscope (Carl Zeiss Microimaging Inc) using an iXon Ultra 888 EMCCD camera (ANDOR) controlled by MetaFluor software (Molecular Devices) and analyzed on ImageJ (NIH). The Nuclear to Cytoplasmic ratio was calculated as follows: the mean signal intensity was measured for a region of the nucleus and cytoplasm for each cell, and the mean signal intensity of the background was subtracted from these values. Then the Nuclear to Cytoplasmic ratio was calculated by dividing the background subtracted mean signal intensity for the nuclear signal by the background subtracted value for the cytoplasmic signal.</p></sec><sec id="s4-11"><title><italic>In vitro p</italic>hosphatase assay</title><p>pCMV 3xFLAG PHLPP1 was transfected into HEK-293T cells plated in four 10 cm plates (approximately 9 × 10<sup>6</sup> cells per plate, 80% transfection efficiency) using Fugene 6.

The first decision letter after peer review is shown below.]</p><p>Thank you for submitting your work entitled &quot;PHLPP1 counter-regulates STAT1-mediated inflammatory signaling&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, including Kim Orth as the Reviewing Editor and Reviewer #1, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and a Senior Editor.</p><p>Our decision has been reached after consultation between the reviewers. Based on these discussions and the individual reviews below, we regret to inform you that your work will not be considered further for publication in <italic>eLife</italic>. Although the work is seen as important, it is not a complete story and would require experiments that will take longer than the allowed time. If the author chooses to address the issues brought up by these reviewers, we encourage them to submit a new manuscript to <italic>eLife</italic> with this data and we will do our best to use the same editors and reviewers for the new submission.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic> </p><p>The authors report that the PHLPP1 phosphatase specifically targets phosphorylated Ser727 on STAT1 and thereby inhibits its activity as a transcription factor. This is an important finding because STAT1 is a transcriptional activator that mediates the cellular response to interferons, cytokines and growth factors. The authors begin by showing that <italic>Phlpp1<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice have improved survival during <italic>E. coli</italic> infection and LPS-induced toxicity, indicating an important role for the PHLPP1 phosphatase in innate immune signaling. The authors then performed RNA-seq BMDMs derived from WT and <italic>Phlpp1<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice to determine how loss of Phlpp1 altered gene expression and found a significant enrichment in STAT binding motifs in the Phlpp1-null elevated transcripts. Importantly, the authors validated the Phlpp1's effect on STAT1 promoter occupancy through ChIP experiments. Finally, the authors show that dephosphorylation of Ser727 on STAT1 does indeed suppress its activity as a transcription factor and that PHLPP1 specifically dephosphorylates Ser727 <italic>in vitro</italic> and that loss of Phlpp1 increases basal STAT1 Ser727 phosphorylation in vivo. Although this manuscript elucidates an important level of control in STAT1 signaling the following major and minor concerns must be addressed before this manuscript can be accepted for publication.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>Figure 2E-G:</p><p>The text states that these are RT-PCR data (subsection “Loss of PHLPP1 results in a prolonged STAT1-dependent transcription in macrophages”), however the figure legend states that they are RNA-seq values. Which are they? If they are qRT-PCR then are they relative expression values or absolute expression? There is no detailed information in the Materials and methods section as to how the qPCR was performed and no sequences for primers to normalization genes if they are indeed relative values. The reference given is behind a paywall so the common reader would not be able to access any detailed information about the qRT-PCR methods used. The methods used to obtain these data must be further elucidated to be able to determine if the proper controls and normalization were performed.</p><p>Figure 5:</p><p>The analysis of the subcellular localization of PHLPP1 would be greatly improved by the addition of an experiment in which nuclear export was inhibited by Leptomcyin B. The authors reported that full-length PHLPP1 is cytosolic, but they failed to take into account that nuclear export/import is an equilibrium process and the only way to tell if a protein is indeed primarily localized in the cytosol is to block nuclear export.</p><p>It would also strengthen this line of inquiry if the authors tried (even if just with bioinformatics) to identify the native NLS of PHLPP1. The authors add a foreign NLS (from what protein? what type of NLS?) to show that driving the protein to the nucleus inhibits STAT1 promoter activity suggesting nuclear localization of PHLPP1 is important for its activity. They do not elucidate PHLPP1's native NLS, which must exist in order for the effect of nuclear localization of PHLPP1 on STAT1 promoter activity to actually be significant in vivo.</p><p>Figure 5D shows that PHLPP1 dephosphorylates STAT1 Ser727 <italic>in vitro</italic> and is out of place in Figure 5 which is all about nuclear localization. Figure 5D should either be incorporated into Figure 6 or moved to the supplement. This would leave room in Figure 5 for the suggested Leptomycin B experiment and NLS bioinformatics in this figure.</p><p>Figure 7:</p><p>Can you comment on the fact that pAkt T308 is elevated in all conditions in the PHLPP1 KO in 7A? PHLPP1 dephosphorylation of Ser473 was mentioned in the Discussion section, but not T308.</p><p>As it is presented, Figure 7C is confusing. It seems like the luciferase assay graph and the pAkt blot should be separated into Figure 7C and 7D or at least the blot needs to be mentioned in the figure legend which currently only explains the luciferase assay for Figure 7C. I understand that the blot is only for validation purposes, but it still needs to be mentioned in the figure legend if it is be included.</p><p>Subsection “PHLPP1 binds to STAT1 and dephosphorylates Ser727”: Please revise to &quot;…interacts with STAT1 and reduces its promoter activity&quot;. You have shown that the PHLPP1 NTE can pull down STAT1 and that the PHLPP1 NTE reduces STAT1 promoter activity, but not exactly that one causes the other.</p><p>And as these were IPed out of lysate and not shown to directly interact with purified recombinant proteins, a direct interaction cannot be claimed.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic> </p><p>The presented paper identifies a potential phosphatase for STAT1. Deletion of the phosphatase-encoding gene Phlpp1 increases survival of mice upon LPS or <italic>E. coli</italic> challenge. Molecular analysis in macrophages revealed that PHLPP1 dephosphorylates Ser727 in STAT1 and thus suppresses inflammatory signaling.</p><p>Strong points of the paper are its detail in the characterization of PHLPP1 and its effect on STAT1. Weak points of the paper are the apparent presence of PHLPP1 even in knockouts, minimal in vivo analysis and exclusive focus on macrophages.</p><p>1) The manuscript is lacking controls and/or appropriate quantification for their knockdown and knockouts. The authors should show the efficiency of Phlpp1 knockdown by WB or PCR and that siCtl does not affect STAT1. Most importantly, neither the CRISPR knockout (Figure 6A) in BMDM nor BMDM from PHLPP1 KO (Figure S1) are convincingly lacking PHLPP1. The band intensity of PHLPP1 is almost the same between knockout and WT. Why is there a band at all for PHLPP1 in PHLPP1 KO? In Figure 6 and Figure S1, there seems to be only one band, whereas in Figure 7C the higher molecular band is marked with the arrow for PHLPP1. The authors have to show convincingly that PHLPP1 is absent in their KO cells.</p><p>2) The focus of the manuscript is the characterization of molecular interactions of PHLPP1. Nevertheless, the in vivo experiments should be analyzed in more detail. Is there increased dissemination in peripheral organs and blood in WT mice compared to KO mice? The increase in inflammatory cytokines could be either due to a higher inflammatory profile of immune cells or an increased recruitment/number. Thus, ideally the authors would measure recruitment of neutrophils, macrophages and DCs to the peritoneum and lymph nodes.</p><p>3) The authors show in vivo levels of only 3 cytokines and conclude from 2 cytokines that <italic>Phlpp1<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice had a diminished initial pro-inflammatory cytokine burst. Only IL-1β levels were consistently higher in KO mice. The authors should analyze more cytokines to draw this conclusion. For <italic>in vitro</italic> experiments, e.g. in vivo levels of IFNγ would be highly relevant and should be measured.</p><p>4) Figure 5C. Is the transfection efficiency the same? From the images, it seems that different constructs have different transfection efficacy. Confocal images lack scale bars. Bar graphs lack statistical analysis.</p><p>5) The rationale for choosing GBP5, IFIT2 and CD69 as representative genes should be provided.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic> </p><p>This is an interesting study that seeks to identify roles of the PHLPP1 phosphatase. The authors conclude that PHLPP1 dephosphorylates STAT1 on Ser727 and serves to promote resolution of inflammation by suppressing STAT1 activity. This is an important finding because while the kinases that cause STAT1 Ser727 phosphorylation have been characterized, little is known concerning the mechanism of dephosphorylation.</p><p>The authors' conclusions are supported by the data presented, although several aspects of the analysis appear incomplete.</p><p>1) The biological focus of the study is the protection against endotoxin and bacterial sepsis while the mechanistic studies focus on the resolution of inflammation. There is a logical problem here. Indeed, this is acknowledged by the authors who briefly state in subsection “PHLPP1 regulates the innate immune response” that the reduced mortality is most likely associated with a diminished initial cytokine response. The mechanism of the reduced initial cytokine response is not defined. Instead, the manuscript focusses on a second phenotype – reduced resolution – that may have little to do with the reduced mortality associated with endotoxin and bacterial sepsis. This lack of coherence between biology and mechanism needs to be fixed.</p><p>2) The conclusion that PHLPP1 deficiency promotes sustained STAT1 signaling is not strongly supported by the gene expression data (Figure 2E-G) that show increased expression at 6 hours and a similar level of decline in expression at 24 hours. Since the heat map is presented as the ratio of KO:WT, it is not clear that this expression pattern is not shared by the other genes in this group. A similar argument could be made for some of the genes in the ChIP analysis that show increased binding at all time points (Figure 3D-F). Please clarify. Moreover, this increase in gene expression at all time points correlates poorly with the decrease in the initial cytokine response that may contribute to the protection against sepsis and LPS (see #1 above).</p><p>3) The authors conclude (Abstract) that PHLPP1 catalytic activity is required for suppression of STAT1. The data to support this conclusion is incomplete. While the authors do show – by mutational analysis – that PHLPP1 catalytic activity is required for PHLPP1 Ser727 dephosphorylation <italic>in vitro</italic> (Figure 5D), this is not demonstrated in vivo. For example, knockout macrophages complemented with WT and catalytically inactive PHLPP1 should be compared to investigate the regulation of STAT1 Ser727 phosphorylation.</p><p>4) The CRISPR studies are unclear. First, the KO cells still express PHLPP1 (Figure 6A and Figure S1). Second, no controls for the CRISPR KO are presented.

This is an important finding because STAT1 is a transcriptional activator that mediates the cellular response to interferons, cytokines and growth factors. The authors begin by showing that Phlpp1-/- mice have improved survival during E. coli infection and LPS-induced toxicity, indicating an important role for the PHLPP1 phosphatase in innate immune signaling. The authors then performed RNA-seq BMDMs derived from WT and Phlpp1-/- mice to determine how loss of Phlpp1 altered gene expression and found a significant enrichment in STAT binding motifs in the Phlpp1-null elevated transcripts. Importantly, the authors validated the Phlpp1's effect on STAT1 promoter occupancy through ChIP experiments. Finally, the authors show that dephosphorylation of Ser727 on STAT1 does indeed suppress its activity as a transcription factor and that PHLPP1 specifically dephosphorylates Ser727 in vitro and that loss of Phlpp1 increases basal STAT1 Ser727 phosphorylation in vivo. Although this manuscript elucidates an important level of control in STAT1 signaling the following major and minor concerns must be addressed before this manuscript can be accepted for publication. Essential revisions: Figure 2E-G: The text states that these are RT-PCR data (subsection “Loss of PHLPP1 results in a prolonged STAT1-dependent transcription in macrophages”), however the figure legend states that they are RNA-seq values. Which are they? If they are qRT-PCR then are they relative expression values or absolute expression? There is no detailed information in the Materials and methods section as to how the qPCR was performed and no sequences for primers to normalization genes if they are indeed relative values. The reference given is behind a paywall so the common reader would not be able to access any detailed information about the qRT-PCR methods used. The methods used to obtain these data must be further elucidated to be able to determine if the proper controls and normalization were performed.</p></disp-quote><p>The data in Figure 2E-G are RNA-Seq, whereas those in Figure 3A-C are qPCR. We have updated the text to indicate “normalized mRNA-Seq data” where appropriate. In addition, we have updated the Materials and methods section to include the primer sequences for 36B4 that were used for normalization. We have also included additional references for the Materials and methods section.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Figure 5:</p><p>The analysis of the subcellular localization of PHLPP1 would be greatly improved by the addition of an experiment in which nuclear export was inhibited by Leptomcyin B. The authors reported that full-length PHLPP1 is cytosolic, but they failed to take into account that nuclear export/import is an equilibrium process and the only way to tell if a protein is indeed primarily localized in the cytosol is to block nuclear export.</p><p>It would also strengthen this line of inquiry if the authors tried (even if just with bioinformatics) to identify the native NLS of PHLPP1.</p></disp-quote><p>We have now identified a bipartite NLS in the unstructured N-Terminal Extension (NTE) of PHLPP1 (new Figure 6D). We show that a construct encoding the NTE localizes to the nucleus, that mutation of either half of the bipartite mutation significantly increases localization in the cytosol, and that mutation of both halves of the bipartite motif results in cytosolic localization that is almost as complete as the addition of a strong NES (new Figure 6E and 6F). Additionally, we show that the decrease in STAT1 promoter activity observed upon overexpression of PHLPP1 in HEK cells depends on a functional NLS: mutation of either or both halves of the NLS reduces or abolishes, respectively, the PHLPP1-dependent effects on STAT1 promoter activity (new Figure 6G). Additionally, we identify a nuclear exclusion signal (NES) preceding the phosphatase domain (Figure 6—figure supplement 2). We appreciate the reviewer’s suggestion we address the mechanism for nuclear localization as identification of the NLS provides the first functional role of the NTE, which is unique to PHLPP1. We have also revised the model in Figure 8 to indicate the NLS and NES.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The authors add a foreign NLS (from what protein? what type of NLS?) to show that driving the protein to the nucleus inhibits STAT1 promoter activity suggesting nuclear localization of PHLPP1 is important for its activity.</p></disp-quote><p>We have added the information on the NLS, which is from PKI.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>They do not elucidate PHLPP1's native NLS, which must exist in order for the effect of nuclear localization of PHLPP1 on STAT1 promoter activity to actually be significant in vivo.</p></disp-quote><p>See above.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Figure 5D shows that PHLPP1 dephosphorylates STAT1 Ser727 in vitro and is out of place in Figure 5 which is all about nuclear localization. Figure 5D should either be incorporated into Figure 6 or moved to the supplement. This would leave room in Figure 5 for the suggested Leptomycin B experiment and NLS bioinformatics in this figure.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate these helpful recommendations and have reorganized all the biochemical figures as follows: the <italic>in vitro</italic> dephosphorylation assay (previously Figure 5D) is now presented in the new Figure 4, which focusses exclusively on phosphorylation of Ser727 of STAT1 by PHLPP1. Specifically, the figure shows that (1) STAT1 phosphorylation on Ser727 is enhanced in primary bone marrow derived macrophages from <italic>Phlpp1<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice compared to WT mice (new Figure 6 A,B), (2) pSer727 is dephosphorylated <italic>in vitro</italic> by PHLPP1 (Figure 4 C,D), and (3) STAT1 has reduced phosphorylation on Ser727 in cells overexpressing PHLPP1 (Figure 4 D,E).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Figure 7:</p><p>Can you comment on the fact that pAkt T308 is elevated in all conditions in the PHLPP1 KO in 7A? PHLPP1 dephosphorylation of Ser473 was mentioned in the Discussion section, but not T308.</p></disp-quote><p>Phosphate at the hydrophobic motif (Ser473) decreases the phosphatase sensitivity at the activation loop (Thr308), that is why the PHLPP1 KO cells have elevated phosphorylation at both sites, even though only Ser473 is a direct PHLPP. In the revision, we replaced the original Figure 7A,B with a better analysis, which now is the new Figure 5A,B. Here, we make the point that the Ser727 phosphorylation is okadaic-acid insensitive in the primary bone marrow-derived macrophages, under conditions where known PPA sites are okadaic-acid sensitive (the phosphorylation of T308 on Akt and T202/Y204 on Erk increases with okadaic acid yet there is no detectable change on Ser727 phosphorylation).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>As it is presented, Figure 7C is confusing. It seems like the luciferase assay graph and the pAkt blot should be separated into Figure 7C and 7D or at least the blot needs to be mentioned in the figure legend which currently only explains the luciferase assay for Figure 7C. I understand that the blot is only for validation purposes, but it still needs to be mentioned in the figure legend if it is be included.</p></disp-quote><p>The luciferase assay is now Figure 6A; we removed the blot and replaced it with the new data in the new Figure 5A,B.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Subsection “PHLPP1 binds to STAT1 and dephosphorylates Ser727”: Please revise to &quot;…interacts with STAT1 and reduces its promoter activity&quot;.

Weak points of the paper are the apparent presence of PHLPP1 even in knockouts, minimal in vivo analysis and exclusive focus on macrophages.</p><p>1) The manuscript is lacking controls and/or appropriate quantification for their knockdown and knockouts. The authors should show the efficiency of Phlpp1 knockdown by WB or PCR and that siCtl does not affect STAT1. Most importantly, neither the CRISPR knockout (Figure 6A) in BMDM nor BMDM from PHLPP1 KO (Figure S1) are convincingly lacking PHLPP1. The band intensity of PHLPP1 is almost the same between knockout and WT. Why is there a band at all for PHLPP1 in PHLPP1 KO?</p></disp-quote><p>We have replaced all the experiments using CRISPR knockdown with ones using primary BMDM isolated directly from the WT vs. <italic>Phlpp1<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice.

Nevertheless, the in vivo experiments should be analyzed in more detail. Is there increased dissemination in peripheral organs and blood in WT mice compared to KO mice? The increase in inflammatory cytokines could be either due to a higher inflammatory profile of immune cells or an increased recruitment/number. Thus, ideally the authors would measure recruitment of neutrophils, macrophages and DCs to the peritoneum and lymph nodes.</p></disp-quote><p>These are very interesting suggestions but beyond the scope of our expertise. Additionally, the two co-first authors are no longer in our labs, and the third author is on maternity leave. While we recruited another postdoc to address all the biochemical revisions, we are not equipped to do whole animal studies. Thus, although very interesting experiments, our current contribution focuses on the molecular mechanisms of how PHLPP1 suppresses STAT1 signaling.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) The authors show in vivo levels of only 3 cytokines and conclude from 2 cytokines that Phlpp1<sup>-/-</sup> mice had a diminished initial pro-inflammatory cytokine burst. Only IL-1β levels were consistently higher in KO mice. The authors should analyze more cytokines to draw this conclusion. For in vitro experiments, e.g. in vivo levels of IFNγ would be highly relevant and should be measured.</p></disp-quote><p>We have focused on the mechanistic aspects given our lack of personnel (please see previous comment).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) Figure 5C.

The authors conclude that PHLPP1 dephosphorylates STAT1 on Ser727 and serves to promote resolution of inflammation by suppressing STAT1 activity.
