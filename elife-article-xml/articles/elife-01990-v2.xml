It is generally unknown how complex bacterial structures such as PGNs are perceived by plant pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) and whether host hydrolytic activities facilitate decomposition of bacterial matrices and generation of soluble PRR ligands. Here we show that <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic>, upon bacterial infection or exposure to microbial patterns, produces a metazoan lysozyme-like hydrolase (lysozyme 1, LYS1). LYS1 activity releases soluble PGN fragments from insoluble bacterial cell walls and cleavage products are able to trigger responses typically associated with plant immunity. Importantly, <italic>LYS1</italic> mutant genotypes exhibit super-susceptibility to bacterial infections similar to that observed on PGN receptor mutants. We propose that plants employ hydrolytic activities for the decomposition of complex bacterial structures, and that soluble pattern generation might aid PRR-mediated immune activation in cell layers adjacent to infection sites.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.01990.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.01990.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.01990.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>The immune response of plants and animals is triggered when cells detect small molecules that are present on the surface of the bacteria or fragments of peptidoglycans—the polymers that are a major component of the bacterial cell wall.

Immunogenic microbial signatures are collectively referred to as pathogen- or microbe-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs/MAMPs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Janeway and Medzhitov, 2002</xref>). Bacteria-derived PAMPs such as lipopolysaccharides (LPS) or flagellins possess immunity-stimulating activities in metazoans and plants, suggesting that the ability to sense bacterial surface structures and mount immunity is conserved across lineage borders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Nürnberger et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Boller and Felix, 2009</xref>).</p><p>Likewise, peptidoglycans (PGNs) are major building blocks of the cell walls of Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria that have been shown to trigger host immune responses in mammalians, insects, and plants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Dziarski and Gupta, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Gust et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Erbs et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Kurata, 2014</xref>). Structurally, PGNs are heteroglycan chains that are composed of polymeric alternating β(1,4)-linked N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc) and N-acetylmuramic acid (MurNAc) residues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Schleifer and Kandler, 1972</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Glauner et al., 1988</xref>). Such chains are interconnected by oligopeptide bridges which form a coordinate meshwork, thereby providing structural integrity to the bacterial envelope. Recognition of different PGN substructures in animal hosts is brought about by structurally diverse PRRs such as nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain-containing proteins (NODs), peptidoglycan recognition proteins (PGRPs/PGLYRPs), scavenger receptors, or Toll-like receptor TLR2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Strober et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Royet and Dziarski, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Dziarski and Gupta, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Müller-Anstett et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Magalhaes et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Kurata, 2014</xref>). In plants, a tripartite PGN recognition system at the plasma membrane of <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic> with shared functions in PGN sensing and transmembrane signaling was recently described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Willmann et al., 2011</xref>). This system comprises Lysin motif (LysM) domain proteins LYM1 and LYM3 for PGN ligand binding and the transmembrane LysM receptor kinase CERK1 that is likely required for conveying the extracellular signal across the plasma membrane and for initiating intracellular signal transduction. All three proteins were shown to be indispensable for PGN sensitivity and to contribute to immunity to bacterial infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Willmann et al., 2011</xref>), which is in agreement with their proposed role as a PGN sensor system. More recently, a similar PGN perception system made of LysM domain proteins LYP4 and LYP6 has been reported from rice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Liu et al., 2012a</xref>).</p><p>Microbial patterns such as bacterial PGN, LPS, flagellin, or fungal chitin harbor immunogenic epitopes that are parts of supramolecular structures building microbial surfaces (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Boller and Felix, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Kumar et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Newman et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Pel and Pieterse, 2013</xref>). It is therefore assumed that recognition by host PRRs most likely requires the presence of soluble, randomly structured ligands derived from a complex matrix. X-ray structure-based insight into the binding of bacterial flagellin to the Arabidopsis receptor complex FLS2/BAK1 or of fungal chitin to the Arabidopsis receptor CERK1 supports this view (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Willmann and Nürnberger, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Liu et al., 2012b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Sun et al., 2013</xref>). Moreover, the existence of fungal LysM effector proteins that scavenge soluble chitin fragments, thus preventing recognition by plant PRRs, suggests that mechanisms releasing these soluble fragments from fungal cell walls must exist (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">de Jonge et al., 2010</xref>). Most often, however, it is an open question whether soluble ligand presentation to eukaryotic host PRRs is the result of spontaneous decomposition of the microbial extracellular matrix during infection or, alternatively, whether host-derived factors contribute to the generation of immunogenic ligands for PRR activation. For example, only monomers of bacterial flagellin induce immune responses through human TLR5 whereas filamentous flagella, in which the immunogenic flagellin structure is buried and thus is not accessible to TLR5, do not (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Smith et al., 2003</xref>). It was proposed that a number of circumstances cause flagellin monomer release from intact flagella. For instance, <italic>Caulobacter crescentus</italic> deliberately ejects its flagellum once it is no longer required for the bacterial life cycle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Jenal and Stephens, 2002</xref>). Moreover, during infection, <italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic> produces rhamnolipids which act as surfactants and cause flagellin shedding from intact flagella, resulting in a more pronounced immune response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Gerstel et al., 2009</xref>). Alternatively, host factors such as proteases or environmental conditions such as pH, temperature, or bile salts have been proposed to mediate shearing of flagella from bacterial surfaces (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Ramos et al., 2004</xref>). Likewise, recognition of PGN by intracellular receptors, such as mammalian NOD1 and NOD2, or by plasma membrane receptors, such as mammalian TLR2 or plant LYM1, LYM3 and CERK1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Müller-Anstett et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Sorbara and Philpott, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Willmann et al., 2011</xref>), is facilitated by soluble ligands. Animal lysozymes have been implicated in PGN hydrolysis, bacterial lysis, and host immunity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Callewaert and Michiels, 2010</xref>), probably through partial PGN degradation and generation of soluble ligands for PGN sensors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Cho et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Dziarski and Gupta, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Davis et al., 2011</xref>).</p><p>In plants, knowledge of the mode of release of immunogenic fragments from microbial extracellular structures and their contribution to plant immunity is lacking. We here describe a plant enzyme activity (LYS1) that hydrolyzes β(1,4) linkages between N-acetylmuramic acid and N-acetylglucosamine residues in PGN and between N-acetylglucosamine residues in chitooligosaccharides, thus closely resembling metazoan lysozymes (EC 3.2.1.17). Importantly, PGN breakdown products produced by LYS1 are immunogenic in plants, and <italic>LYS1</italic> mutant genotypes were immunocompromised upon bacterial infection. Our findings suggest that plant enzymatic activities, such as LYS1, are capable of generating soluble PRR ligands that might contribute to the activation of immune responses in cells at and surrounding the site of their generation. We also infer that eukaryotic hosts more generally make concerted use of PGN hydrolytic activities and of PRRs in order to cope with bacterial infections.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Arabidopsis PGN binding proteins LYM1 and LYM3 are devoid of PGN hydrolytic activity</title><p>Soluble oligomeric PGN fragments have previously been shown to stimulate plant immune responses in Arabidopsis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Gust et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Erbs et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Willmann et al., 2011</xref>). As some metazoan PGRPs harbor PGN-degrading enzyme activities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Gelius et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Wang et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bischoff et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Dziarski and Gupta, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Kurata, 2010</xref>), we tested whether recombinant Arabidopsis PGN binding proteins LYM1 and LYM3 were able to catalyze PGN degradation. For this, we have employed a standard lysozyme assay (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Park et al., 2002</xref>) that is based on reduced turbidity in suspensions of Gram-positive <italic>Micrococcus luteus</italic> cell wall preparations due to PGN degradation. PGN-degrading activity of hen egg-white lysozyme served as a positive control in these assays. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, lysozyme, but not recombinant LYM1 or LYM3, displayed cell wall-degrading lytic activity, suggesting that the latter are unable to release PGN fragments from bacterial cell walls. This is in agreement with a lack of sequence similarities between LYM1 or LYM3 and known metazoan PGN hydrolytic activities. We therefore conclude that LYM1 and LYM3 constitute plant PGN sensors that appear to be functionally related to non-enzymatic mammalian or Drosophila PGRPs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Cho et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bischoff et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Dziarski and Gupta, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Kurata, 2010</xref>).<fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.01990.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>The Arabidopsis lysozyme 1 (LYS1) gene is transcriptionally activated upon pathogen-infection.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) LYM1 and LYM3 do not possess peptidoglycan (PGN) hydrolytic activity. <italic>Micrococcus luteus</italic> cell wall preparations were incubated with 20 μg affinity-purified His6-tagged LYM1 or LYM3 or 0.5 μg hen egg-white lysozyme and PGN hydrolytic activity was assayed in a turbidity assay at the indicated time points.

Solubilized PGN fragments found in the supernatant of LYS1-digested PGN were subsequently analyzed by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>). Only a few peaks could be detected in the supernatant of PGN incubated with a buffer control or with heat-inactivated LYS1. In contrast, PGN digests produced by native LYS1 yielded several characteristic peaks that were also detectable in the supernatants of PGN preparations treated with mutanolysin, which has been shown to cleave O-glycosidic bonds between GlcNAc and MurNAc residues in complex PGN (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Yokogawa et al., 1975</xref>). LYS1-generated PGN fragments were subsequently tested for their ability to trigger plant immunity-associated responses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B–D</xref>). First, supernatants of PGN preparations treated with either native or heat-denatured LYS1 were used to trigger immune marker gene <italic>FRK1</italic> expression in Arabidopsis seedlings.

Second, we tested whether LYS1-generated PGN fragments were able to trigger an immunity-associated response, medium alkalinization, in rice cell suspensions.

However, prolonged incubation with LYS1 again resulted in a loss of activity with overnight digestion completely abolishing stimulatory activity of the PGN digest. We assume that LYS1 is capable of releasing immunogenic fragments from complex PGNs, but extensive or complete digest into PGN monomers or small PGN fragments appears to abolish the immunogenic activity of PGN fragments.

This holds true for bacterial PGNs, but also for other patterns including bacterial LPS, flagellin, or fungus-derived chitin or glucan structures, all of which have been ascribed triggers of innate immunity in metazoans and plants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Boller and Felix, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Kumar et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Newman et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Pel and Pieterse, 2013</xref>). Limited insight into the 3D structure of ligand–PRR complexes, as well as knowledge on ligand structural requirements for plant immune activation, suggests that small ligand epitopes are crucial for binding to host PRRs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Liu et al., 2012b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Sun et al., 2013</xref>). It is thus generally assumed that soluble fragments derived from complex microbial matrices serve as ligands for host PRRs and subsequent immune activation in both lineages.</p><p>Two possible scenarios as to how soluble PGN fragments might be generated from macromolecular assemblies of cross-linked PGNs are discussed. First, during bacterial multiplication and cell wall biogenesis, large portions of soluble PGN fragments are shed into the extracytoplasmic space from which only 50–90% are recycled (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Park and Uehara, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Reith and Mayer, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Johnson et al., 2013</xref>). This implies that imperfect recycling of bacterial walls might serve as a source of soluble ligands for host PRRs sensing PGN (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Boudreau et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Wyckoff et al., 2012</xref>). Indeed, muramylpeptides spontaneously shed by <italic>Shigella flexneri</italic> directly stimulate NOD1-dependent immune responses in mammalian immune cells, and bacterial mutants impaired in PGN recycling hyperactivate host immunity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Nigro et al., 2008</xref>). Second, host lysozyme activity has been demonstrated to generate soluble PGN ligands for NOD2 receptor-mediated immune activation and clearance of <italic>Streptococcus pneumoniae</italic> colonization in mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Callewaert and Michiels, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Clarke and Weiser, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Davis et al., 2011</xref>). Importantly, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Davis et al. (2011)</xref> established a role for host lysozymes in PGN release from bacteria in the absence of detectable bacterial lysis. Likewise, Drosophila Gram-negative bacteria-derived binding protein 1 (GNBP1) was shown to possess PGN-hydrolyzing activity and to deliver fragmented PGN to the PGN sensor, PGRP-SA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Filipe et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Wang et al., 2006</xref>). Thus, both passive and active mechanisms of PGN decomposition appear to occur simultaneously during host pathogen encounters and might not be mutually exclusive.</p><p>We here report on a lysozyme-like enzyme (LYS1) that is produced in infected Arabidopsis plants and is capable of generating soluble PGN fragments from complex bacterial PGNs. LYS1 has been demonstrated to hydrolyze β(1,4) linkages between N-acetylmuramic acid and N-acetylglucosamine residues in PGN and between N-acetylglucosamine residues in chitin oligomers, thus closely resembling metazoan lysozymes. LYS1-generated fragments trigger immunity-associated responses in a PGN receptor-dependent manner. Activation of defenses has been further shown to occur in the two plants (Arabidopsis and rice) for which PGN perception systems have been described to date (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Willmann et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Liu et al., 2012a</xref>). Importantly, Arabidopsis plants with strongly reduced <italic>LYS1</italic> expression were impaired in immunity to bacterial infection, suggesting strongly that LYS1 function is an important element of the immune system of this plant. Notably, immunocompromised phenotypes in <italic>LYS1</italic><sup><italic>KD</italic></sup> plants were comparable to those observed in either <italic>lym1 lym3</italic> or <italic>cerk1</italic> PGN receptor mutant genotypes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Willmann et al., 2011</xref>). We further found that plants overexpressing LYS1 were also susceptible to bacterial infections, suggesting that defined LYS1 levels in wild-type plants are required for LYS1 immune function. The most compelling explanation for this phenotype is that PGN hyperdegradation (in <italic>LYS1</italic><sup><italic>OE</italic></sup> plants) or lack of PGN degradation (in <italic>LYS</italic><sup><italic>KD</italic></sup> mutants) are equally disadvantageous to plant immunity and that immune activation in Arabidopsis requires oligomeric PGN fragments of a particular minimum degree of polymerization (DP). This view is supported by our findings that prolonged digestion of PGN by LYS1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>) or by mutanolysin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Gust et al., 2007</xref>) abolished the immunogenic activity of PGN. Likewise, immunogenic activities of fungal chitin or oomycete glucans have been reported to require defined minimum ligand sizes with a minimum DP of &gt;5 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Cheong et al., 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Zhang et al., 2002</xref>). We therefore propose that <italic>LYS1</italic> overexpression might result in PGN fragments of insufficient size, thereby mimicking the physiological status in <italic>LYS1</italic><sup><italic>KD</italic></sup> mutants lacking major PGN hydrolytic activities.</p><p>Plants produce various carbohydrate-degrading hydrolytic enzyme activities, some of which have been implicated in plant immunity to microbial infection, such as glucanases and chitinases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">van Loon et al., 2006</xref>). While it is often not entirely clear how these enzymes contribute to plant immunity, it is widely assumed that this is due to microcidal activities of these proteins. In our study we have shown that Arabidopsis LYS1 cleaves O-glycosidic bonds formed between GlcNAc (indicative of chitinolytic activity) as well as those formed between GlcNAc and MurNAc (indicative of peptidoglycanolytic activity). However, we have been unable to demonstrate any deleterious effect of LYS1 overexpression on fungal infections, suggesting that <italic>B. cinerea</italic> and <italic>A. brassicicola</italic> at least are not affected by LYS1 function. Likewise, we have been unable to demonstrate direct bactericidal activity of LYS1 to <italic>P. syringae</italic> (not shown), suggesting that the positive role of LYS1 in plant immunity to bacterial infection is not due to its direct inhibitory effect on bacterial fitness. This view is further supported by the fact that <italic>LYS1</italic><sup><italic>OE</italic></sup> plants with strongly enhanced PGN hydrolytic activity do not exhibit enhanced immunity to <italic>Pseudomonas</italic> infections but become hypersusceptible to infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>). We cannot rule out at this point LYS1-mediated bacterial lysis, which would likely also result in the release of immunogenic PGN fragments. We would like to emphasize, however, that our findings are in agreement with a predominant role of LYS1 in the generation of PGN fragments that subsequently can trigger plant immunity via PRRs. Hence, plant LYS1 functionally resembles recently described mammalian lysozymes that were shown to generate soluble PGN fragments for PGN receptor NOD2, thereby mediating immunity to <italic>S. pneumoniae</italic> infection in mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Davis et al., 2011</xref>).</p><p><italic>LYS1</italic> gene expression is strongly enhanced upon PAMP administration or bacterial infection while expression levels in naive plants are low. It is conceivable that the low constitutive LYS1 levels are sufficient to generate soluble PGN fragments from bulk PGN-containing bacterial walls which are then perceived via the LYM1-LYM3-CERK1 receptor complex. It is possible that the pathogen-inducible later increase in LYS1 activity could have further roles for generating diffusible signals that might serve innate immune activation, not only in cells that are directly in contact with invading microbes but also in cell layers adjacent to infection sites.</p><p>A role for plant glycosyl hydrolases in immunogenic PAMP generation and immune activation has been proposed previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Mithöfer et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Fliegmann et al., 2004</xref>). An extracellular soluble bipartite soybean glucan binding protein (GBP) was shown to harbor 1,3-β-glucanase activity and binding activity for glucan fragments of DP &gt;6 derived from intact glucans. Complex glucans constitute major constituents of various <italic>Phytophthora</italic> species, many of which are plant pathogens (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Kroon et al., 2011</xref>). It was therefore suggested that, during infection, GBP endoglucanase activity produces soluble <italic>Phytophthora</italic>-derived oligoglucoside fragments as ligands for the high-affinity binding site within this protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Fliegmann et al., 2004</xref>). While this study supported the concept of plant hydrolases tailor-making ligands for plant PRRs, causal evidence for the involvement of the endoglucanase activity in plant immunity was not provided.</p><p>Eukaryotic PGN recognition proteins (PGRP, PGLYRP) are conserved from insects to mammals, bind PGN, and function in antibacterial immunity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Cho et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bischoff et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Dziarski and Gupta, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Kurata, 2010</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">2014</xref>). Some PGRP family members are non-enzymatic PRRs (NOD1, NOD2) while others possess PGN-degrading activities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Gelius et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Wang et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bischoff et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Dziarski and Gupta, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Kurata, 2010</xref>). PGN hydrolytic enzyme activities such as lysozymes have been ascribed functions in direct bacterial killing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Cho et al., 2005</xref>) and in generating soluble PGN fragments as ligands for PRRs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Wang et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Davis et al., 2011</xref>). LYS1 constitutes the first plant lysozyme-type activity for which a role in host immunity has been established. LYS1 is capable of generating immunogenic fragments from complex PGNs, which themselves serve as ligands for the LYM1-LYM3-CERK1-PGN recognition complex in Arabidopsis. It is noteworthy that LYM1 and LYM3 are PGN recognition proteins that lack apparent intrinsic PGN-degrading activity. We conclude that metazoans and plants employ hydrolytic activities for the decomposition of bacterial PGNs during host immune activation. In addition to the established role of PGNs in pattern-triggered immune activation, host-mediated degradation of bacterial PGNs constitutes another conserved feature of innate immunity in both lineages. However, as the molecular components involved differ structurally among phyla, both facets of PGN-mediated immunity might have evolved convergently.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Plant growth conditions and infections</title><p><italic>A. thaliana</italic> Columbia-0 wild-type and <italic>N. benthamiana</italic> plants were grown on soil as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Brock et al., 2010</xref>).

After addition of elicitors, the pH in the cell culture was monitored with an InLab Micro electrode (Mettler Toledo, Gießen, Germany).</p><p>For assays with LYS1-digested PGN, 100 µg/ml <italic>B. subtilis</italic> PGN was incubated with 40 µg LYS1 purified from <italic>LYS1</italic><sup><italic>OE</italic></sup> plants or controls in 2.5 mM MES, pH 5.2, at 37°C with shaking for 4 hr. After stopping the reaction by heating at 100°C for 10 min, the reaction was centrifuged and the supernatant used for triggering immune responses.</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>Statistical methods</title><p>Statistical significance between two groups has been checked using the Student’s <italic>t</italic> test. Asterisks represent significant differences (*p&lt;0.05; **p&lt;0.01; ***p&lt;0.001).

Your article has been favorably evaluated by a Senior editor and 3 reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors.</p><p>The following individuals responsible for the peer review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Jean Greenberg (Reviewing editor).</p><p>The Reviewing editor and the other reviewers discussed their comments before we reached this decision, and the Reviewing editor has assembled the following comments to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>The authors are interested in whether plants help generate soluble MAMPs from pathogens that can then be detected by plant receptors to induced defenses. They focus on LYS1, which they show can generate PGN fragments; the LYS1 gene is induced by various MAMPs and “Non-adapted” or non-pathogenic <italic>P. syringae</italic>. Recombinant LYS1 is not active, so they overexpress LYS1-GFP in plants and use this as a source for enzyme to characterize. They also characterize the overexpression plants and knockdowns. The biochemical effects are for the most part convincing but might be more so if they were presented as specific activities with some kinetic analyses that were compared with the known enzymes they use. A major finding is that the plants with OE and KD seem to have the same phenotypes with respect to hypersusceptibility to <italic>P. syringae</italic> and lack of MAMP response (at least FRK1 expression) with PGN treatment. Several very important issues came up in the review process that need to be addressed:</p><p>1) Claims of specificity: Since LYS1 has chitinolytic activity, there is the potential that this activity could be playing a role in anti-fungal defense. Although the authors tested this, they can’t exclude that with certain fungal isolate/host combinations LYS1 might have a role in fungal defense. Therefore, we advise toning down the claim of specificity for responses to bacteria.</p><p>2) Organization and analysis methods: Figure panels should be organized in the order they are discussed. Add something about how many times each experiment was replicated. Statistical analysis needs to be improved. In complex experiments where multiple comparisons can/should be made, use ANOVA and multiple comparison post hoc test. It’s especially difficult to understand the comparisons made in 3E and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>.These data should all be analysed together and grouped into significance groups.</p><p>3) Concerning the KD and overexpression plants: the specificity of the artificial miRNA needs to be established. The authors need to show that only the LYS1 gene is being silenced and not other genes that may have some sequence similarity. Because the results of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref> are confusing, it would be good to use a knockout plant such as a SALK mutant (e.g. SALK_095362). <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref> is the only example where the KD seems to affect the relative PGN hydrolysis activity. Therefore, it’s especially important to do the correct statistical analysis. The effect of the KD would be more convincing if we had conditions where the level of protein in WT can be detected (or maybe one of the bands in D in the Col lane is right?). Did the authors try using apoplast washes to enrich for the activity? How about inducing conditions (e.g. MAMP treatment?) Since LYS expression is normally PAMP-induced, it is important to show that a PAMP-induced increase in PGN-degrading activity is decreased in extracts from <italic>LYS1-KD</italic> lines, when compared to extracts from WT plants.</p><p>The overexpression lines with 300 fold higher than wild type seems way too high (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>) and could be causing unforeseen effects. At a minimum the authors should check that the consequence of OE is not causing downregulation of the receptors that perceive the PGNs. If this were the case, it would change the interpretation of the experiments. Some lines where the overexpression is more modest would be helpful for determining if increased resistance can be achieved. In any case with <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8.C</xref>, the authors should check the kinetics to see if there is a time point at which the response of OE is faster/higher than WT.</p><p>4) Localization: The experiments performed in protoplasts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>) is not sufficient to claim that LYS1 localizes to the apoplast, as it is highly likely that the protoplast medium also contains damaged protoplasts. The authors should transiently express LYS1-GFP in <italic>N. benthamiana</italic>, and show by immunoblot analysis that LYS1-GFP is enriched in apoplastic fluids after PAMP treatment. This experiment should be very straight-forward in this system.</p><p>5) Consequence of down and up-regulation for susceptibility to infection: The results of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8A and 8B</xref> are very puzzling. They show that over-expression lines have the same phenotype, with regard to bacterial virulence, as the silenced lines. This is not due to co-suppression since the authors measured significant levels of both mRNA and protein levels in these over-expression lines. In the Discussion, the authors postulate that higher levels of LYS1 results in a more extensive hydrolysis of the PGN resulting in the loss of the correct sized fragment for induction of innate immunity. This seems a reasonable hypothesis but one that requires experimental validation. This requires the use of a quantitative assay for the immune response that can be followed over time. There are many such relatively easy assays that could be used, such as ROS production or gene expression. The authors should test whether the <italic>LYS1</italic> OE and KD lines differ in their temporal response to both PGN and bacterial inoculation using such assays. If their hypothesis is correct, then one might predict that the OE lines would show some response very early but this would decline rapidly as the elicitor is completely hydrolyzed. One might also predict, for example, that adding higher levels of PGN elicitor might elicit a response on the OE lines (i.e., one might be able to saturate the enzyme and slow hydrolysis to the point where elicitation can be measured).</p><p>6) Association of PGN-degrading activity with LYS1. The authors must demonstrate that the PGN-degrading activity detectable upon over-expression of <italic>LYS1</italic> is indeed due to LYS1 itself, and not to another enzyme whose expression or activity is increased by <italic>LYS1</italic> over-expression. For this, the authors should transiently express a catalytically-inactive variant of LYS1 (based on the knowledge on similar enzymes in other kingdoms) and compare the PGN-degrading activity of the corresponding extract when compared to an extract from leaves over-expressing WT LYS1.</p><p>7) What is LYS1 generating? In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>, the authors say that the mutants don't respond to the fragment generated, but the data shows there is some response. In fact, it looks like the basal FRK1 level with buffer is much lower in the mutants than in the Col-O. Therefore, are the fold inductions are retained and just the basal responses are altered? As mentioned above, all the data should be analysed together for significance groups. LYM1, LYM3 and CERK1 genes are essential for PGN signal transduction, so the mutants should have almost no response to soluble PGN. So it’s not clear whether this LYS1-generated peptidoglycan (PGN) fragments is soluble PGN or not, if <italic>cerk1</italic> mutants are still responding to it.</p><p>Other issues to address:</p><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> text says suspensions of Micrococcus luteus cell but legend and methods say it’s really cell wall prep/extract. It’s not clear what the negative control is. This should be documented in the Methods.</p><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref> 100 µg PGN but 100 µg/ml LPS. Need consistent description (per ml )</p><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>: how can the authors be sure that the fast-migrating band corresponds to the full-length LYS1 protein, or actually, event to LYS1. Did the authors attempt to confirm the identity of this band by mass spectrometry?</p><p>In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>, the relative hydrolytic activity of LYS1 was calculated using chitinase as a standard. It would be better if the authors could directly measure LYS1 kinetic parameters (e.g., Kd). This would be an important measurement since it would get directly to the issue of physiological relevance. These are standard techniques, which should be within the authors' ability given their access to purified LYS1 protein.</p><p>In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>, there is another band which located between 35Kd and 40 Kd shown in LYS1OE samples, please clarify what it is. If it is possible, please do this experiment again; the picture looks very bad. What are the possible effects of proteolysis on the protein, which seems essential for its purification? To be thorough, the authors should identify the cleavage site so that they have a better idea of how much of the LYS1 protein remains. For example, could proteolysis be eliminating a key regulatory portion of the protein?</p><p>[Editors' note: further clarifications were requested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>The authors did a good job trying to respond to the comments to improve the manuscript. They added analysis of an additional O/E line that does not seem to cause statistically significant increase in <italic>P. syringae</italic> growth after 2 days; this line shows only moderate overexpression of <italic>LYS1</italic>. However, there are a few issues with part of the analysis that need to be addressed before final acceptance.</p><p>1) The authors need to harmonize the description of the statistical analysis with what is presented in the figures. The authors say they added multiple comparison tests, but the way they describe these is confusing. For example in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>, if the multiple comparison test was done, then all values in the panel should be labeled by grouping into like categories (i.e. A, B etc). Similarly in 6B (or 6C), significance at P&lt;0.001 are given, but we cant tell whether LYS1 is different from mutanolysin or whether all the treatments in the mutants are giving the same or different values. If all the data was analyzed together, you should be able to label each group (all values that are similar get a different letter).</p><p>2) For the P. syringae infection experiments, the authors say in the discussion that overexpression or down-regulation of LYS1 causes the same magnitude of defect. Actually, they don't do any multiple comparison test of the data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Fig 9</xref> and it looks like the O/E are even more susceptible than the down-regulated plants. The authors should use multiple comparison test here to show whether the effects are the same or not. A couple of other things about the description of this experiment. (1) the title of the <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref> should be changed, since there is no “mutation of LYS1”. (2) This experiment does not measure the growth rate since only one endpoint is taken. Therefore no conclusion about the rate can be given.</p><p>3) The authors tested the transcript level of receptors that would detect PGN fragments liberated by LYS1 in the <italic>LYS1</italic> overexpression plants; this is important for excluding the possibility that high overexpression of <italic>LYS1</italic> has unintended consequences on the receptor levels. A more informative experiment would be to check protein levels, as this is the most relevant assay (transcript levels don't always reflect protein levels). There is an available antibody for CERK1- did the authors try using this antibody?</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.01990.018</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>1) Claims of specificity: Since Lys1 has chitinolytic activity, there is the potential that this activity could be playing a role in anti-fungal defense.

For ion leakage we measured every hour starting 1 hour post infection up to 6 hours and then every 12 hours up to 36 hours, but in three independent experiments we could not observe any differences between the responses in the different lines at these early time points. For the determination of <italic>FRK1</italic> transcript levels we took samples after 30 min, 1 hour, 3 hours and 6 hours. Here, at early time points such as 30 min to 1 hour, <italic>FRK1</italic> gene expression is not really induced by PGN, thus error bars are very big. At time points 3 and 6 hours, however, we observed <italic>FRK1</italic> induction in WT samples but not in <italic>LYS1</italic><sup><italic>KD</italic></sup> lines, confirming our results shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9C</xref>.

Use of the fluorescent dye FM4-64, a plasma membrane and early endosome marker (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bolte et al., 2004</xref>), revealed that LYS1 signals co-localized to a large extent with the plasma membrane (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1B</xref>).

They show that over-expression lines have the same phenotype, with regard to bacterial virulence, as the silenced lines. This is not due to co-suppression since the authors measured significant levels of both mRNA and protein levels in these over-expression lines. In the Discussion, the authors postulate that higher levels of LYS1 results in a more extensive hydrolysis of the PGN resulting in the loss of the correct sized fragment for induction of innate immunity.

However, there are other prominent examples in the literature where overexpression of a protein mimics the effect of genetic inactivation. For instance, strong overexpression of BAK1, a co-receptor of leucine-rich-repeat receptor kinases, triggers inappropriate plant cell death (Belkhadir et al., PNAS 2012, 109,297-302) as is also observed in <italic>bak1</italic> mutants (Kemmerling et al., Curr. Biol.17, 1116–1122). Hence, it can be assumed that wild-type levels of proteins are optimized during evolution and it is therefore not surprising that either too little or too much activity (at least in some cases) might have a deleterious effect.</p><p>However, as suggested by the Referees and as explained in more detail in Reply 3.7., we measured ion leakage in leaves infected with <italic>Pto</italic> DC3000, but could not observe any differences in wild type plants compared to <italic>LYS1</italic><sup><italic>KD</italic></sup> or <italic>LYS1</italic><sup><italic>OE</italic></sup> lines. In all lines, ion leakage was increased starting at 2 to 3 hours post bacterial infiltration. Moreover, we analysed <italic>FRK1</italic> transcript levels at early time points, also using PGN concentrations up to 500 µg/ml, but again we could not observe an enhanced <italic>FRK1</italic> gene expression in the <italic>LYS1</italic><sup><italic>OE</italic></sup> lines at any time point. Notably, in our hands PGN does not induce an oxidative burst and was thus not used as an assay here.</p><p>As only <italic>LYS1</italic><sup><italic>OE</italic></sup> lines with a massively increased LYS1 protein level (lines 1 and 2) show an increased susceptibility to bacterial infection we believe it to be quite challenging to find the right time point for detecting differences in immune responses in <italic>LYS1</italic><sup><italic>OE</italic></sup> lines compared to wild type or <italic>LYS1</italic><sup><italic>KD</italic></sup> lines as the enhanced LYS1 enzyme activity is present at the beginning of all experiments. We might have simply missed the short time frame in which such differences might occur, if they do occur at all.</p><p>For further information, please refer to Reply 3.7.</p><p><italic>6) Association of PGN-degrading activity with LYS1. The authors must demonstrate that the PGN-degrading activity detectable upon over-expression of</italic> LYS1 <italic>is indeed due to LYS1 itself, and not to another enzyme whose expression or activity is increased by</italic> LYS1 <italic>over-expression. For this, the authors should transiently express a catalytically-inactive variant of LYS1 (based on the knowledge on similar enzymes in other kingdoms) and compare the PGN-degrading activity of the corresponding extract when compared to an extract from leaves over-expressing WT LYS1</italic>.</p><p>As suggested, we generated Ala-replacement mutants for the two amino acid residues Asn154 and Glu156, positions which were shown to be crucial for enzymatic activity of rubber tree hevamine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bokma et al., 1997</xref>). However, protein extracts from <italic>N. benthamiana</italic> leaves transiently expressing the LYS1<sup>N</sup>154<sup>A/E156A</sup>-myc or LYS1<sup>N</sup>154<sup>A/E156A</sup>-HA variants yielded the same enzyme activity towards 4-MUCT as the corresponding wild type extracts, hence these mutations did not render LYS1 catalytically inactive.</p><p>For hevamine a mutation of the D<sup>125</sup>E<sup>127</sup> motif to A<sup>125</sup>A<sup>127</sup> rendered the enzyme completely inactive. However, an amino acid alignment of hevamine and LYS1 indicated that LYS1 contains a N<sup>154</sup>E<sup>156</sup> motif instead of the DE motif. Additional Aspartate residues are spread around this motif and any of those might be required for enzymatic activity. As we do not have any information from crystal structures for LYS1 it will be challenging to determine which Aspartate residue will be the most important one for catalytic activity.</p><p>Thus, our experimental data indeed cannot exclude the theoretical risk of an up-regulation of the activity of an enzyme other than LYS1 by LYS1 over-expression, but are there any precedents/examples in the literature showing such scenarios?</p><p><italic>7) What is LYS1 generating? In</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5"><italic>Figure 5A</italic></xref><italic>, the authors say that the mutants don't respond to the fragment generated, but the data shows there is some response. In fact, it looks like the basal FRK1 level with buffer is much lower in the mutants than in the Col-O. Therefore, are the fold inductions are retained and just the basal responses are altered? As mentioned above, all the data should be analysed together for significance groups. LYM1, LYM3 and CERK1 genes are essential for PGN signal transduction, so the mutants should have almost no response to soluble PGN. So it’s not clear whether this LYS1-generated peptidoglycan (PGN) fragments is soluble PGN or not, if</italic> cerk1 <italic>mutants are still responding to it</italic>.</p><p>As requested, we now analyzed all data shown in new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B and 6C</xref> with ANOVA and the multiple comparison post hoc test. Following this analysis, only the wild type samples treated with supernatants from the digest with native LYS1 and mutanolysin are significantly different (p &lt; 0.001) from all other samples. Additionally, the mutanolysin-digest was also significantly less active (p &lt; 0.05) in the <italic>lym1 lym3</italic> double mutant. For a better understanding, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref> now also includes the water control samples, which were set to 1 for each mutant.</p><p>However, we would like to point out that none of the PGN receptor mutants <italic>lym1</italic>, <italic>lym3</italic> and <italic>cerk1</italic> are completely devoid of any responses to PGN treatment, which we detected in our comprehensive micro-array studies (Willmann et al., PNAS 2011). This is most likely due to contaminations which are present in PGN preparations, and might not be removed by LYS1 digest and subsequent HPLC purification. Thus a null-response cannot be expected but, as demonstrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9B</xref> (formerly <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8B</xref>), a massive reduction in PGN responses in the mutants is evident.</p><p><italic>Other issues to address:</italic></p><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1"><italic>Figure 1</italic></xref> <italic>text says suspensions of Micrococcus luteus cell but legend and methods say it’s really cell wall prep/extract.

We agree with the referees that from the western blot analysis it cannot be judged if this fast-migrating band indeed represents the full-length LYS1 protein.

It would be better if the authors could directly measure LYS1 kinetic parameters (e.g., Kd).

These are standard techniques, which should be within the authors' ability given their access to purified LYS1 protein</italic>.</p><p>We agree with the Referees and now indicate specific enzyme activities as calculated in comparison to the commercially available chitinase and lysozyme, for which activities are now also shown (new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>).</p><p>We also determined K<sub>m</sub> values for purified LYS1.</p><p><italic>In</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2"><italic>Figure 2C</italic></xref><italic>, there is another band which located between 35Kd and 40 Kd shown in LYS1OE samples, please clarify what it is. If it is possible, please do this experiment again; the picture looks very bad. What are the possible effects of proteolysis on the protein, which seems essential for its purification? To be thorough, the authors should identify the cleavage site so that they have a better idea of how much of the LYS1 protein remains. For example, could proteolysis be eliminating a key regulatory portion of the protein?</italic></p><p>We apologize for this low quality western blot and repeated this experiment (now <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). Additional bands in the <italic>LYS1</italic><sup><italic>OE</italic></sup> line were most of the time hardly visible but most likely represent degradation products derived from the LYS1-GFP fusion protein.</p><p>As the analysis of the total mass of the cleavage product by MALDI was not possibly due to the large size of the protein with approximately 35 kDa, we analysed the major cleavage product by LC-MS/MS after tryptic in-gel digestion and by peptide mass fingerprint, analyses which were conducted in two independent laboratories (Boris Macek, Proteome Center Tübingen, and Hubert Kalbacher, Medical and Natural Sciences Research Centre, both University of Tübingen). As stated in Reply 10, this not only confirmed the identity of LYS1 in this band but also yielded peptides spanning almost the whole protein sequence. We lacked the first 53 amino acids at the N-terminus (with the signal peptide comprising 22 amino acids); however, as these analysis rarely yield a 100 % peptide coverage and as the far N- terminus might not ionize easily, we are confident that the cleavage of the LYS1-GFP fusion protein occurs between LYS1 and GFP yielding an untagged, full length LYS1 protein.</p><p>[Editors' note: further clarifications were requested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p><italic>The authors did a good job trying to respond to the comments to improve the manuscript.

However, there are a few issues with part of the analysis that need to be addressed before final acceptance</italic>.</p><p><italic>1) The authors need to harmonize the description of the statistical analysis with what is presented in the figures. The authors say they added multiple comparison tests, but the way they describe these is confusing. For example in</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4"><italic>Figure 4E</italic></xref><italic>, if the multiple comparison test was done, then all values in the panel should be labeled by grouping into like categories (i.e. A, B etc). Similarly in 6B (or 6C), significance at P&lt;0.001 are given, but we cant tell whether LYS1 is different from mutanolysin or whether all the treatments in the mutants are giving the same or different values. If all the data was analyzed together, you should be able to label each group (all values that are similar get a different letter)</italic>.</p><p>As requested, the data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4 fig6">Figure 4E, 6B and 6C</xref> are now presented as significance groups labeled with letters rather than asterisks.</p><p><italic>2) For the P. syringae infection experiments, the authors say in the discussion that overexpression or down-regulation of LYS1 causes the same magnitude of defect. Actually, they don't do any multiple comparison test of the data in</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9"><italic>Fig 9</italic></xref> <italic>and it looks like the O/E are even more susceptible than the down-regulated plants. The authors should use multiple comparison test here to show whether the effects are the same or not. A couple of other things about the description of this experiment. (1) the title of the</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9"><italic>Figure 9</italic></xref> <italic>should be changed, since there is no “mutation of LYS1”. (2) This experiment does not measure the growth rate since only one endpoint is taken. Therefore no conclusion about the rate can be given</italic>.</p><p>We agree that the statement “We further found that plants overexpressing LYS1 were as susceptible as knock down mutants to bacterial infections, suggesting that defined LYS1 levels in wild-type plants are required for LYS1 immune function” in the Discussion was incorrect and misleading. We have therefore changed the statement into:</p><p>“We further found that plants overexpressing LYS1 were also susceptible to bacterial infections, suggesting that defined LYS1 levels in wild-type plants are required for LYS1 immune function.”</p><p>It was never intended to claim that <italic>LYS1</italic><sup><italic>OE</italic></sup> lines were AS susceptible as the <italic>LYS1</italic><sup><italic>KD</italic></sup> lines. The Referee is very much entitled to say that to state this would require more in-depth statistical analysis. However, we would like to state that by Student’s t-test, <italic>LYS1</italic><sup><italic>OE</italic></sup> lines as well as <italic>LYS1</italic><sup><italic>KD</italic></sup> lines were both more susceptible to bacterial infection than WT plants in a statistically significant manner. Student’s t-test is the most commonly used statistical analysis in current literature. We therefore prefer to represent our data using this statistical method.</p><p>As suggested, we changed the title of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref> which now reads as follows: “Manipulation of LYS1 levels causes hyper-susceptibility towards bacterial infection and loss of PGN-triggered immune responses.”</p><p>We agree that for bacterial infections, no growth rates can be given. However, the figure legends state “bacterial growth” (and not growth rates), which can be determined by counting colony forming units at different times after inoculation.</p><p><italic>3) The authors tested the transcript level of receptors that would detect PGN fragments liberated by LYS1 in the</italic> LYS1 <italic>overexpression plants; this is important for excluding the possibility that high overexpression of</italic> LYS1 <italic>has unintended consequences on the receptor levels. A more informative experiment would be to check protein levels, as this is the most relevant assay (transcript levels don't always reflect protein levels). There is an available antibody for CERK1- did the authors try using this antibody?</italic></p><p>We agree with the Referees that protein levels are more informative than transcript levels. We have thus conducted a Western blot analysis with total protein from mature leaves using an anti-CERK1 antibody. New <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9s1">Figure 9 – supplement 1A</xref> shows that there is no difference in CERK1 protein levels in WT and LYS1<sup>OE</sup> lines.</p></body></sub-article></article>
