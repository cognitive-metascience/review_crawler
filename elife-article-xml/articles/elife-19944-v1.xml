membrane via an unknown mechanism. We have employed cysteine labelling and linkage analysis to the full length of Bak in mitochondria. This comprehensive survey showed that in each Bak dimer the N-termini are fully solvent-exposed and mobile, the core is highly structured, and the C-termini are flexible but restrained by their contact with the membrane. Dimer-dimer interactions were more labile than the BH3:groove interaction within dimers, suggesting there is no extensive protein interface between dimers. In addition, linkage in the mobile Bak N-terminus (V61C) specifically quantified association between dimers, allowing mathematical simulations of dimer arrangement. Together, our data show that Bak dimers form disordered clusters to generate lipidic pores. These findings provide a molecular explanation for the observed structural heterogeneity of the apoptotic pore.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.19944.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.19944.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.19944.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>A healthy organism must carefully remove unwanted, diseased or damaged cells. These unwanted cells can bring about their own death in a controlled process known as apoptosis. Maintaining an appropriate level of apoptosis is crucial to good health: excessive cell death can contribute to neurodegenerative disorders, whereas too little can result in cancer.</p><p>All cells contain powerhouses called mitochondria, which produce energy. Mitochondria are the scene of a critical ‘point of no return’ in apoptosis. When a cell receives a death signal, a ‘killer’ protein known as Bak punches holes (or pores) in the membrane of the mitochondria. These pores allow toxic molecules to leak out from the mitochondria into the interior of the cell, where they trigger a series of events that dismantles the cell from the inside out.</p><p>To create the pores, Bak undergoes extensive shape changes that allow the proteins to form dimers that then cluster and perforate the membrane. To investigate how Bak clusters assemble on the mitochondrial membrane, Uren et al. used cultured cells and biochemical techniques to show where the Bak dimers contacted each other before and after the pore formed; these findings were complemented with mathematical modelling. The results show that during apoptosis, Bak dimers contact each other at several different places (rather than at one or two places) to assemble into disorderly, ever-changing clusters. Based on these observations, Uren et al. suggest that the enlarging clusters stress the membrane and cause pores to form.</p><p>The next step is to investigate whether physical forces that act within the mitochondrial membrane could drive the clustering of Bak proteins. This knowledge could ultimately enable us to learn how to manipulate apoptosis in cells, potentially as part of treatments for the diseases in which this cell death process occurs inappropriately.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.19944.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.19944.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>Bak</kwd><kwd>apoptotic pore</kwd><kwd>oligomer</kwd><kwd>Bcl-2 proteins</kwd><kwd>cell death</kwd><kwd>disordered cluster</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000925</institution-id><institution>National Health and Medical Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Project grant 637337</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kluck</surname><given-names>Ruth M</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004752</institution-id><institution>State Government of Victoria</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Operational Infrastructure Support</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kluck</surname><given-names>Ruth M</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000925</institution-id><institution>National Health and Medical Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Program grant 1016701</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kluck</surname><given-names>Ruth M</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Dimers of Bak assemble into clusters without using a distinct protein-protein interface, which may explain the apparent difficulties in obtaining high resolution structures of the pore complex and in targeting dimer-dimer interactions to regulate apoptosis.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The Bcl-2 family of proteins are the principal regulators of apoptotic cell death, with either Bak or Bax required to permeabilise the mitochondrial outer membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Lindsten et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Wei et al., 2001</xref>). Bak and Bax are triggered to convert to their activated conformation by the binding of BH3-only relatives, such as Bid and Bim (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Gavathiotis et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Dai et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Du et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Czabotar et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Leshchiner et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Brouwer et al., 2014</xref>), and once activated can be sequestered by pro-survival relatives, such as Mcl-1 and Bcl-x<sub>L</sub> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Llambi et al., 2011</xref>).</p><p>The ability of Bak and Bax to change conformation and oligomerise in the mitochondrial outer membrane appears crucial for their capacity to perforate this membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Westphal et al., 2014</xref>). Both proteins comprise nine α-helices that adopt a globular fold in the non-activated state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Suzuki et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Moldoveanu et al., 2006</xref>). Non-activated Bak is anchored in the mitochondrial outer membrane via the α9-helix forming a transmembrane domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Iyer et al., 2015</xref>). In contrast, non-activated Bax is largely cytosolic due to binding of α9 to its own hydrophobic groove (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Wolter et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Gahl et al., 2014</xref>). Following binding of BH3-only proteins, both Bak and Bax undergo similar conformation changes including α1 dissociation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Weber et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Alsop et al., 2015</xref>) and separation of the ‘latch’ domain (α6-α8) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Czabotar et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Brouwer et al., 2014</xref>) from the ‘core’ domain (α2-α5). The core and α6 then collapse onto the membrane surface and become shallowly inserted into the membrane to lie in-plane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Aluvila et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bleicken et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Westphal et al., 2014</xref>). Symmetric homodimers then form when the exposed BH3 domain of each molecule is re-buried in the hydrophobic groove of another activated molecule (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Dewson et al., 2008</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Czabotar et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Brouwer et al., 2014</xref>). Bax oligomers may also form prior to membrane insertion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Luo et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Sung et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>How symmetric homodimers of Bak or Bax then associate to porate the mitochondrial outer membrane is still unknown. Although there is structural information for Bak and Bax homodimers, no structures of higher order oligomers of Bak or Bax have been resolved. Upon an apoptotic stimulus, Bak and Bax have been shown to coalesce into clusters at the mitochondria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Nechushtan et al., 2001</xref>) and small clusters of Bax have been implicated in the rapid release of cytochrome <italic>c</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Zhou and Chang, 2008</xref>). The availability of full-length recombinant Bax makes biochemical assays more amenable for Bax than for Bak. Thus, recent studies using artificial membranes and recombinant Bax have detected Bax complexes of various shapes and sizes with fluorescence microscopy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Subburaj et al., 2015</xref>) and cryo-electron microscopy has revealed Bax protein exclusively associated with pore edges (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kuwana et al., 2016</xref>). Furthermore, super-resolution microscopy has shown Bax can be found in ring-like structures, arcs and clusters at the mitochondrial outer membrane of apoptotic cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Große et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Salvador-Gallego et al., 2016</xref>), although the orientation of Bax dimers in these structures could not be visualised. Higher order oligomers of both Bak and Bax vary in size when assessed by gel filtration, blue native PAGE or linkage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">George et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Dewson et al., 2012</xref>). Moreover, linkage studies have identified several points at which dimers might associate, including interactions at α-helices 1, 3, 5, 6, and 9 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Dewson et al., 2008</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Zhang et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Pang et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Ma et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Aluvila et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bleicken et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Gahl et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Iyer et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Mandal et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Zhang et al., 2016</xref>). Critically, it is not clear whether any of these interaction sites are required for dimer-dimer association and assembly of the apoptotic pore. Here, we compare linkages through the full length of Bak in cells and show that dimers associate in a disordered and lipid-mediated fashion.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>The Bak N-segment, α1 and α1- α2 loop are solvent-exposed in Bak oligomers</title><p>To resolve how Bak dimers coalesce to porate the mitochondrial outer membrane, we sought to generate a more detailed biochemical map of the membrane topology of Bak dimers. This work complemented our previous cysteine-accessibility analyses of Bak α5, α6 and α9 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Westphal et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Iyer et al., 2015</xref>), by analyzing the Bak N-terminus and additional residues in the α2-α5 core and C-terminus. The two native cysteine residues of human Bak (C14 and C166) were first substituted with serine to generate Bak Cys null (BakΔCys, i.e. C14S/C166S), and then a single cysteine residue substituted at several positions throughout the molecule. Each Bak variant was stably expressed in <italic>Bak<sup>-/-</sup>Bax<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) and tested for function (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>). To convert Bak to the activated oligomeric form, membrane fractions enriched for mitochondria were incubated with tBid, as previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Dewson et al., 2008</xref>). To label solvent-exposed cysteine residues, membrane fractions were treated with the thiol-specific labelling reagent IASD (4-acetamido-4'-((iodoacetyl) amino)stilbene-2,2'-disulfonic acid). Two negative sulfonate charges prevent IASD from accessing cysteine in hydrophobic environments (such as the mitochondrial outer membrane or the hydrophobic protein core), and also allow isoelectric focusing (IEF) to resolve IASD-labelled and IASD-unlabelled Bak (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Tran et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Westphal et al., 2014</xref>). We assessed each cysteine-substituted Bak variant for labelling before, during or after incubation with recombinant tBid or tBid<sup>Bax</sup>, a tBid variant containing the Bax BH3 domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Hockings et al., 2015</xref>), that activates Bak analogous to tBid, as well as a control not exposed to IASD and another fully exposed to labelling by denaturation and membrane solubilisation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Figure 1—source data 1</xref>).

Those residues remained exposed following incubation with tBid. Four residues in α1 (R36C, Y41C, Q44C and Q47C) that were not fully accessible before tBid treatment became exposed following incubation with tBid (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). An additional α1 residue, V39C, also showed a tendency for increased labelling. These changes suggest that the α1-α2 loop separates from α1, consistent with increased labelling of A54C in the α1-α2 loop that opposes α1. Thus, the increased labelling of cysteine residues placed throughout the N-segment, α1 and the α1-α2 loop, together with exposure of several N-terminal antibody epitopes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Alsop et al., 2015</xref>), indicate that the Bak N-terminus becomes completely solvent-exposed after activation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>).</p><p>To complete our survey of the core and C-termini of Bak dimers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Westphal et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Iyer et al., 2015</xref>), we tested the cysteine accessibility of additional selected residues in the α2-α5 core and the α7-α8 region (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). A summary of current and previous cysteine labelling data for the full length of the Bak protein is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref> and supports the following picture of Bak dimer topology (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). Certain cysteine residues placed in α2 became transiently exposed, consistent with exposure of the BH3 domain followed by its burial in the hydrophobic groove in the α2-α5 core dimer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>), as predicted by the published structure of the Bak BH3:groove homodimer (4U2V) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Brouwer et al., 2014</xref>). Cysteine substitutions on the exposed surface of α3 were successfully labelled with IASD before, during and after tBid treatment. In contrast, two buried residues in α4 were refractory to IASD labelling throughout. In the α4-α5 linker region, although I123C became more exposed following activation, it was still incompletely labelled. This pattern of I123C labelling may reflect initial loss of contact between I123C and two hydrophobic residues in the ‘latch’ (I167 and W170), followed by shallow membrane insertion of I123C, as it resides on the hydrophobic face of the Bak dimer core. Partial labelling of this residue is consistent with shallow membrane insertion as IASD can label cysteine moieties up to 7.5 Å into the hydrocarbon core of a lipid bilayer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Gründling et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Westphal et al., 2014</xref>). Within the C-termini, the profile of IASD-labelling was consistent with the amphipathic α6 helix lying in-plane on the membrane surface (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Westphal et al., 2014</xref>) and the hydrophobic α9 forming the sole transmembrane domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>).</p><p>In summary, Bak undergoes a series of conformational changes as it transitions from its non-activated monomeric state, to an activated BH3-exposed monomeric intermediate, to the symmetric dimer that is the building block of the Bak oligomer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). In the course of these structural rearrangements, some regions of Bak display changes in solvent exposure (such as α1 which becomes more exposed, or α2 which is transiently exposed) whilst others remain buried throughout (such as the α9 transmembrane anchor).</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>The N- and C-termini of activated Bak are mobile</title><p>Linkage studies have provided significant insight into structural changes in Bak, as well as how the activated proteins associate into higher order oligomers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Dewson et al., 2008</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Ma et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Aluvila et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Brouwer et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Iyer et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Mandal et al., 2016</xref>). To directly compare reported linkages, and to analyse the full length of Bak, we used our expanded library of single-cysteine Bak variants. Each substituted cysteine was tested for the ability to disulphide bond to the same residue in a neighbouring Bak molecule (or to a cysteine in a nearby protein) upon addition of the oxidant copper phenanthroline (CuPhe). Linkage between Bak molecules was indicated by the presence of 2x complexes corresponding to twice the molecular weight of the Bak monomer on non-reducing SDS-PAGE. It is important to note that these 2x complexes are the product of CuPhe-mediated linkage between Bak molecules and do not necessarily represent the native Bak BH3:groove dimer that will form even in the absence of linkage, as shown below on BNP. This system of single cysteine substitutions offers an elegant screening approach for assessing the proximity of single cysteine residues in neighbouring molecules in a point-to-point manner, but does not identify interaction surfaces where a single cysteine substitution may not contact its counterpart (See Discussion).</p><p>Even in the absence of tBid treatment, cysteine residues in flexible regions displayed some linkage to neighbouring non-activated Bak molecules (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>, upper panels). For example, some 2x complexes were captured by cysteine substitutions in the flexible N-segment (G4C, C14, L19C, S23C), and α1-α2 loop (G51C, D57C, P58C, Q66C, S68C, S69C), indicating some proximity of Bak monomers in untreated mitochondria. Furthermore, disulphide linkage to proteins other than Bak resulted in Bak complexes larger than the 2x species and was observed for cysteine substitutions in the α2-α3 helices (D84C, R87C), α4-α5 loop (S121C, N124C), α8-α9 linker (G186C, I188C) and C-terminal end of α9 (V205C). This is unsurprising as the MOM is a protein-rich environment and there are documented examples of monomeric Bak associating with other membrane proteins such as VDAC2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Cheng et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Lazarou et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Ma et al., 2014</xref>).<fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.19944.008</object-id><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>The N- and C-extremities of oligomerised Bak are mobile relative to the α2-α5 core dimer.</title><p>Mitochondrial fractions from cells expressing the indicated Bak cysteine mutants were incubated with tBid to oligomerise Bak, and oxidant (CuPhe) added to induce disulphide bonds.

Upon tBid activation, SDS-PAGE (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>, upper panel) showed an increased proportion of 2x complexes, and higher order complexes (&gt;10x) were observed on BNP for all residues. Of note was a stretch of residues from approximately E59 to T62 that, following tBid treatment, exhibited very efficient linkage by SDS-PAGE (obvious 2x, negligible 1x). In this stretch, BNP showed no dimer species and a concomitant shift to 4x species and higher order complexes, indicating efficient linkage between dimers but no linkage within dimers. Residues closer to the α2-α5 core (Q66C to S69C), showed progressively more 1x species (SDS-PAGE) and an increase in dimers (BNP), indicative of becoming closer to the constrained core of the dimer. Together, these linkage data further argue that dimers possess flexible N-extremities capable of efficient linkage within and between dimers, with linkage becoming exclusively between dimers as residues approach the constrained α2-α5 core (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). Interestingly, because the linkage of cysteine residues in the E59-T62 region occurs <italic>only</italic> between dimers, and is very efficient, this linkage provides a molecular sensor that can specifically quantitate dimer-dimer interactions, and is the first assay to do so.</p><p>The V61C:V61C' molecular sensor for dimer-dimer interaction is generalisable to other stimuli and to the Bax pore (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>).

We also generated the V61C equivalent in membrane localised Bax (Bax A46C/S184L) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>). This Bax variant could be linked between (but not within) dimers, suggesting that Bax dimers also have flexible N-terminal extremities.</p><p>In the Bak C-terminus also, cysteines could link dimers to larger complexes on BNP, although a striking laddering pattern was apparent (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>, lower panels). Absence of the large (&gt;10x) complexes common at the N-extremity is explained by the relatively restricted range of motion of the membrane-associated C-extremity. The very weak laddering pattern for certain residues in the α6-α8 region is explained by those residues facing either the membrane or the cytosol rather than laterally to a nearby Bak dimer. Lastly, linkage in the C-extremity may be only between dimers (rather than within dimers) as the proportion of 2x to 1x species on SDS-PAGE is similar to the proportion of higher order complexes to dimers on BNP.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>Single-cysteine mutants in the rigid core can capture some linkage, mostly at the lateral edges</title><p>Previous studies suggested that the structured α2-α5 core of the Bak (or Bax) dimer might form a dominant, symmetric interface capable of driving dimers to form higher order complexes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Aluvila et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Brouwer et al., 2014</xref>).

However, this was attributed to crystal packing effects, as a chemical crosslinking between the α4-α5 loops was not detected (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Brouwer et al., 2014</xref>). Accordingly, in the present studies, disulphide bonding between the α4-α5 loops was not captured with CuPhe (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>, lower panel). End-to-end associations were suggested by α3:α3’ or α5:α5’ linkages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Aluvila et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Brouwer et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Mandal et al., 2016</xref>), and disulphide bonding at the equivalent residues was also evident in this study (H99C:H99C for α3:α3’; H145C:H145C’ for α5:α5’)(<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>, lower panel).

Thus, screening individual cysteine substitutions in the Bak dimer core for linkage did not uncover any dominant sites of interaction between Bak dimers, but showed widespread linkage of residues around the lateral edges of the dimer, consistent with the random collision of Bak dimers.</p><p>These findings support a flexible extremity model for full-length Bak dimers in the MOM, outlined in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref> with side-on (left) and top-down views (right).

Extending from both ends of the dimer core is the solvent-exposed, flexible and mobile N-extremity of ~70 residues. Each circle in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref> illustrates the range of possible positions for the flexible N- and C-extremities (blue and pink respectively). Overlap of the largest blue circles (labelled G4C) indicates the potential for residues close to the N-terminus to link within dimers. In contrast, the smaller blue circles (labelled V61C) do not overlap, indicating a lack of linkage within the dimer at this residue.

We simulated the membrane as a flat surface (i.e. a 2D plane). Each subunit representing a Bak dimer, was evenly distributed on a geometric grid imposed on this surface (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>), and to avoid edge effects the grid was wrapped onto a torus. A hexagonal grid, rather than square or triangular, was selected to best represent the close packing of objects on a plane with the greatest degrees of freedom. The linkage potential of each subunit in the grid was based on the known linkage constraints of the V61C residue; i.e. linkage occurred exclusively and efficiently between dimers and each dimer could make at most two cysteine linkages, but possibly only 1 or 0 linkages if no other free cysteines were available. Furthermore, the simulation allowed linkages only between immediately adjacent dimers, based on the short 4 Å limit of the CuPhe-mediated disulphide linkage and the known dimensions of the Bak dimer. Thus, each hexagonal subunit had the freedom to link with at most two neighbouring hexagons, in any direction, and this random linkage between neighbouring dimers would result in a mixture of linkage states including double, single or no linkages. With this hexagonal grid, four types of double linkage were possible; opposite, obtuse, acute or reciprocal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>). An equal probability for each of the double linkages (opposite, obtuse, acute or reciprocal) was imposed, to reflect close but random packing of dimers at the membrane. Furthermore, the simulation was allowed to proceed to complete linkage of available cysteine residues to reflect the near-complete linkage of V61C:V61C’.

In the first test, we performed mitochondrial experiments in which ~50% of the Bak molecules lacked cysteine residues. In those experiments, Bak V61C was co-expressed with Bak Cys-null that was FLAG-tagged (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s3">Figure 6—figure supplement 3A</xref>, upper panel). As expected, only half of the Bak molecules could link to 2x species after activation by tBid and induction of linkage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s3">Figure 6—figure supplement 3A</xref>, middle panel, lane 4). In addition, all molecules formed BH3:groove dimers after incubation with tBid, as shown by BNP, but the capture of higher order oligomers mediated by cysteine-linkage was greatly reduced (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s3">Figure 6—figure supplement 3A</xref>, lower panel, lane 4; quantified in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s3">Figure 6—figure supplement 3B</xref>). In simulations of this system, we assumed an equal expression of V61C and the Cys null variants, as indicated by western blot analysis. We also assumed that this population of monomers forms dimers in Mendelian proportions: 25% of dimers are V61C doublets and can link twice, 50% are V61C:Cys null and can link once, and the remaining 25% are Cys null doublets and cannot link (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s3">Figure 6—figure supplement 3C</xref>).

As noted above, because T62C, Q66C, S68C, and S69C substitutions were closer than V61C to the constrained α2-α5 core, they did not link efficiently (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref> lower, quantified in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s4">Figure 6—figure supplement 4B</xref>). To simulate this steric hindrance caused by a shorter distance from the constrained core, an <italic>edge blocking</italic> effect was introduced to the model; every edge of every hexagon was prohibited from having a link form across it with this probability for the duration of each simulation. As the edge blocking probability increased from 0 to 0.75, linkage between dimers decreased to generate patterns comparable to BNP analysis of these core-proximal residues (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s4">Figure 6—figure supplement 4C</xref>). Thus, modification of a single parameter could describe linkage of residues closer than V61C to the Bak dimer core.

Failure of the N-extremity to re-engage in protein-protein or protein-lipid interactions argues that it does not contribute to the assembly of dimers.

Notably, however, a dominant protein-protein interface between dimers was not evident. Rather, linkage between the membrane-associated regions could be detected at many positions, arguing for a disordered arrangement. As our single-cysteine scanning approach can only examine the homotypic pairing of cysteine residues, it remains possible that heterotypic pairing of cysteine substitutions may detect a more complex protein interface between dimers, as seen for linkage at the Bak BH3:groove interface (M71C:K113C, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Dewson et al., 2008</xref>).

Moreover, the lability of dimer-dimer association was highlighted by the capacity of Bax to intermingle with pre-formed Bak dimers.

The large membrane surface occupied by Bax dimers, together with disturbance of the outer leaflet, may explain why Bax, but not the prosurvival proteins, could disrupt Bak dimer-dimer association in this assay.</p><p>A variety of biophysical and imaging techniques have been deployed to better understand how Bak (or Bax) dimers associate, yet it remains unclear. Well-characterised pore-forming proteins typically reveal an extensive interface between subunits that facilitates pore formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Song et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Mueller et al., 2009</xref>). Versions of this regular architecture have recently been considered for Bak and Bax as a closed circuit of dimers lining a circular pore (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Aluvila et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bleicken et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Brouwer et al., 2014</xref>). In contrast to these hypothetical linear dimer arrangements, our biochemical data revealed that there is no single dominant interface between the α2-α5 core dimers and support the random collision of Bak dimers in two dimensions at the mitochondrial outer membrane during apoptosis. Here a novel approach of mathematical modelling was used to simulate linkage between Bak dimers and showed the feasibility of random dimer association. For example, as the V61C residue linked only between Bak dimers, and did so very efficiently, this provided a powerful tool for testing different arrangements of Bak dimers on the membrane. A minimalist set of assumptions were adopted for stochastic simulations of V61C:V61C’ linkage between Bak dimers: linkage is complete and irreversible but occurs only between dimers; only two linkages are possible per dimer; and neighbouring dimers can only link if both have a free cysteine available for disulphide bonding. Indeed, the simulation showed good concordance with different sets of linkage data obtained from fully oligomerised Bak in mitochondria. From this, we conclude that Bak dimers are closely packed and aggregate with a random orientation.</p><p>While our data indicate that most Bak (and probably Bax) oligomers are disordered clusters, it remains possible that a sub-population of ordered oligomers are responsible for driving pore formation. However, in our model system, preventing ~50% Bak from locating to mitochondria prevented pore formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Ferrer et al., 2012</xref>) argues that, of the whole population of Bak surveyed in our linkage studies, at least 50% is required for a pore to form somewhere in the mitochondrion. Thus, the patterns observed in our linkage assays are at least 50% representative of Bak engaged in driving pore formation.</p><p>A disordered cluster of dimers is reminiscent of the ‘carpet’ model of pore formation by peptides (reviewed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Gilbert [2016]</xref>). In this model, amphipathic antimicrobial peptides such as melittin lie parallel to the membrane plane, with accumulation causing strain in the outer layer of the membrane until at higher concentrations the lamellar structure of the membrane is destabilised and non-lamellar lipidic pores form (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Lee et al., 2008</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">2013</xref>). Like an amphipathic peptide, the Bak and Bax α2-α5 core dimers and α6-helices penetrate the outer leaflet of the bilayer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Czabotar et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Aluvila et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Brouwer et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Westphal et al., 2014</xref>). While very high concentrations of antimicrobial peptides can disintegrate membranes in a detergent-like manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Lee et al., 2008</xref>), this does not appear to occur with near-physiological levels of Bak and Bax. Antimicrobial peptides also have membrane thinning attributes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Chen et al., 2003</xref>), as reported for Bax (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Satsoura et al., 2012</xref>). Satsoura and colleagues discuss how membrane deformation by Bax may promote oligomerisation mediated not by protein:protein interactions but by long-range changes in membrane tension (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Satsoura et al., 2012</xref>). For example, the attractive forces between membrane wrapped particles can arise purely as a result of membrane forces (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Reynwar et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">van der Wel et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Katira et al., 2016</xref>). Thus, as illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>, we hypothesise that Bak dimers penetrate the outer leaflet to attract further dimers and in doing so increase the membrane disturbance. Enlarging clusters then destabilise the membrane sufficiently to form lipidic pores that release apoptogenic factors. The pores may then be stabilised by parts of the Bak and Bax dimers rearranging to line the pore (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Terrones et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">García-Sáez, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Westphal et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kuwana et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Mandal et al., 2016</xref>), consistent with the lipidic pore model first proposed for Bax (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Basañez et al., 1999</xref>). Hence, our model for the disordered clustering of Bak dimers provides a holistic molecular explanation for the detection of Bak and Bax in a variety of formations including complete rings, arcs, lines and clusters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Große et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Nasu et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Salvador-Gallego et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>In conclusion, this study proposes a novel means of oligomerisation by Bak and Bax in apoptotic cells: that dimers aggregate in dense clusters without a dominant interface and this dynamic association requires the involvement of the lipid membrane. We have described molecular tools that can precisely monitor the aggregation of Bak dimers in cells, and could also be used to examine how the pro-survival proteins inhibit Bak oligomerisation, which may impact on the development of cancer therapies that target these proteins. Critically, the combination of linkage data and mathematical simulations described here has offered, for the first time, insight into the assembly of the apoptotic pore with single molecule resolution.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Recombinant proteins</title><p>Recombinant proteins were prepared as previously described; caspase 8-cleaved human Bid (tBid) (as per [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Kluck et al., 1999</xref>]), tBid<sup>Bax</sup> and Bcl-x<sub>L</sub> full length (as per [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Hockings et al., 2015</xref>]), Cys null Bax full length (as per [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Czabotar et al., 2013</xref>]), Mcl-1ΔN151ΔC23 (as per (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chen et al., 2005</xref>). tBid<sup>M97A</sup> was kindly provided by E.

Your article has been favorably evaluated by John Kuriyan as the Senior Editor and three reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>Uren et al. investigate structural rearrangements associated with the oligomerization of BAK during MOMP, which is an important and debated research question in the apoptosis field. Following previous work, the authors used an expanded set of monocysteine BAK mutants in IASD labeling and cysteine crosslinking experiments to extract new information about the topology and multimerization surfaces of cBID-activated BAK. In addition, the authors used a novel approach of mathematical modeling to simulate linkage between BAK dimers and showed feasibility of random dimer association into high-order oligomers. Based on these collective approaches, Uren et al. elaborate a model where BAK dimers aggregate into disordered clusters lacking a dominant protein-protein interface to elicit MOMP.</p><p>Essential revisions requiring new experimental work:</p><p>Considering the information already available for BAX/BAK membrane topologies, IASD labelling data appears rather incomplete (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). First of all, following previous work by this and other groups it should be straightforward to discriminate between membrane-inserted and protein buried residues, at least for a few key residues (see below). Second, the author´s conclusion that the entire BAK helix 1 becomes solvent-exposed upon BAK activation primarily relies on the finding that several hydrophilic sites within BAK helix 1 (R36, Y41, Q44 and Q47) show increased IASD labelling after cBID treatment. To firmly establish this point, the IASD labelling test should be extended to additional hydrophobic sites in the BAK helix 1 (such as V27, F35, V39, and F40), because these hydrophobic sites display the highest potential for becoming buried in the hydrophobic interior of the membrane or a proteinaceous structure. Similarly, additional hydrophobic sites in BAK helix 2 (I81, I85) and BAK helix 4 (F111, T112) should also be tested for IASD labelling to unambiguously establish that cBID-activated BAK adopts a BH3-into-groove dimeric structure at the MOM, as the authors claim. This is also critical, because Zhang et al. recently reported that active BAX adopt an helix 2-helix 3-helix 4 dimeric structure rather than a BH3-into-groove structure at the MOM by analysing analogous sites in BAX helix 2 (I66, L70) and BAX helix 4 (F92, F93). In addition to BAK helix 1, extending the IASD-labelling studies to more hydrophobic sites in the BAK helix 7-8 region also appears highly desirable.</p><p>2) To establish the generality of the findings obtained with the BAK V61C mutant, it is important to show that the same crosslinking pattern elicited by cBID is reproduced by other apoptotic stimuli such as heat (43°C), etoposide (+QVD-oph), and/or BIMs overexpression (+QVD-oph). Also, have the authors excluded the possibility that VDAC2 or BCLXL molecules are present in the high-order BAK V61C multimeric bands detected by BN-PAGE?</p><p>Other important points to consider (not necessarily requiring experimental work:</p><p>1A) One confusing aspect is why these assemblies of Bax and Bak don't diffuse in the plane of the membrane throughout the mitochondrial surface. There must be some affinity among the dimers to keep them near enough to interact, appear focal in imaging studies and to destabilize the membrane (as shown by the authors in Figure 7Bi and ii). And &quot;some affinity&quot; likely means a protein protein interface. It is hard to understand how the Bak to mitochondria ratio used in this study relates to in vivo situations. If it is too high, non-specific non-physiologic interactions may mask the specific interactions that occur at endogenous levels of protein.</p><p>1B) Would consideration of possible non-symmetric dimer-dimer contact sites (i.e. linkage of different cys), as the authors brought up, challenge the authors strong conclusion of &quot;no single dominant interface between the α2-α5 core dimers&quot;? Please rebut these points or tone down the related statements in the manuscript.</p><p>2) In the last paragraph of the subsection “Mobility of the N- and C-extremities permits linkage between dimers”, where the data is discussed regarding the BNP ladder after crosslinking Bak with C-terminal helix cysteines – it would be valuable to add in another scheme into <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref> that depicts what the authors mean by α6-α8 shielding of regions of helix 9.</p><p>3) In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>: is the tBID removed from the Bak and membranes prior to adding the Bax and Bcl-x<sub>L</sub>? If not, tBID activating Bax or potentially inhibiting Bcl-x<sub>L</sub> confounds the interpretations. I realize the authors use a mutant tBID to minimize this worry but the fact that Bcl-x<sub>L</sub> and Mcl1 translocate to mitochondria, as they do in cells upon BH3 only protein induction, suggests it may be a problem even for these anti-apoptotic proteins. If removal of tBid is impractical, why not activate Bak with the 7D10 antibody used previously by the Kluck group? It would be interesting to compare Bax and Bcl-x<sub>L</sub> activity on Bak oligomers activated by 7D10 with and without added tBid.</p><p>4) As it stands now, the manuscript presents very limited experimental evidence supporting the notion that disordered BAK clusters directly cause MOMP, rather than merely an epiphenomenon that accompanies MOMP. This is a critical issue that needs to be further substantiated by experimental evidence or at least their claim that BAK clusters mediate MOMP, rather than merely accompanying MOMP, toned down.</p><p>5) As in any similar type of approaches where one uses mutations to probe conformation, the conclusion from the observations hinges on two main assumptions: 1) The conformation of the protein itself has not been altered by the mutation to incorporate cysteine, or modification of the introduced cysteine by a chemical compound (such as IASD) has not triggered additional conformational change; 2) The physical properties of the modified protein has not changed so that the authors are not observing non-physiological events. I do understand that in some of these studies experimental controls to the above assumptions may not be easy or possible, but it would be useful if the authors can at least attempt at considering them. Testing apoptotic function of the mutant Bak in cells is a good start. Especially those mutations that involved hydrophobic and buried residues.</p><p>6) How did the authors determine that the linkages for some mutants were to other proteins rather than Bak? The authors suggested that this is due to close proximity on the mitochondria membrane and not due to potential physical interaction. It could be argued that the potential interaction with other proteins can't be completely ruled out in the linkage bands observed.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.19944.022</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>Essential revisions requiring new experimental work:</italic> </p><p><italic>Considering the information already available for BAX/BAK membrane topologies, IASD labelling data appears rather incomplete (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>).

Unfortunately, in our hands the use of urea and CHAPS has been unreliable for Bak (not shown).</p><p><italic>Second, the author´s conclusion that the entire BAK helix 1 becomes solvent-exposed upon BAK activation primarily relies on the finding that several hydrophilic sites within BAK helix 1 (R36, Y41, Q44 and Q47) show increased IASD labelling after cBID treatment.</italic> </p><p>As the reviewer notes, the conclusion that the entire BAK helix 1 becomes solvent-exposed upon Bak activation is supported by increased solvent exposure of R36C, Y41C, Q44C and Q47C (and new data also reveals a trend for increased exposure of V39C). However, we also show that 30 other residues tested (out of a total of 70) in the Bak N-extremity were solvent-exposed both before and after activation. That is, no residues tested in the N-extremity become buried (35 residues summarised in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). As discussed in the text, extensive exposure of the N-terminus is also consistent with a recent study from our group (Alsop et al., Nat Commun 2015) showing exposure of several N-terminal antibody epitopes following activation of Bak (each of which recognised linear epitopes). In addition, several studies have shown that this region becomes increasingly sensitive to protease digestion upon activation. Thus, several approaches argue that the Bak N-terminus becomes fully exposed upon activation.</p><p><italic>To firmly establish this point, the IASD labelling test should be extended to additional hydrophobic sites in the BAK helix 1 (such as V27, F35, V39, and F40), because these hydrophobic sites display the highest potential for becoming buried in the hydrophobic interior of the membrane or a proteinaceous structure.</italic> </p><p>As requested, we have conducted IASD labelling for additional hydrophobic sites in Bak helix 1 (F35C, V39C, F40C). We find that V39C shows a trend for increased solvent exposure upon activation, whereas F35C and F40C are solvent exposed throughout. These data agree with our conclusion that the Bak N-terminus is fully exposed upon activation. These new data have been incorporated into <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3A</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Figure 1—source data 1</xref> . The second paragraph of the subsection “The Bak N-segment, α1 and α1- α2 loop are solvent-exposed in Bak oligomers” now incorporates the new data, and clarifies evidence for full exposure of the N-terminus.</p><p><italic>Similarly, additional hydrophobic sites in BAK helix 2 (I81, I85) and BAK helix 4 (F111, T112) should also be tested for IASD labelling to unambiguously establish that cBID-activated BAK adopts a BH3-into-groove dimeric structure at the MOM, as the authors claim. This is also critical, because Zhang et al. recently reported that active BAX adopt an helix 2-helix3-helix4 dimeric structure rather than a BH3-into-groove structure at the MOM by analysing analogous sites in BAX helix 2 (I66, L70) and BAX helix 4 (F92, F93).</italic> </p><p>We note that the helix 2-3-4 dimeric Bax structure reported by Zhang et al. appeared to be a subpopulation of Bax, with BH3-into-groove structures also present and the physiological importance of the alternate 2-3-4 dimeric Bax is not yet established.</p><p>We also note that Bak variants I81T, I85T and F111S cannot mediate apoptosis in cells and fail to homodimerise (Dewson et al., Mol Cell 2008). We have since generated the Bak I85C variant and have found that this variant is also non-functional. We did not pursue the generation of cysteine substitutions for I81 or F111 and we have not tested mutation of position T112.</p><p>However, we can now show that our findings with linkage at Bak V61C are generalisable to Bax. We have created the equivalent of the Bak V61C mutation in membrane localised Bax (Bax A46C/S184L) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>). This Bax variant can be linked between (but not within) dimers, indicating that Bax dimers have flexible N-terminal extremities and a constrained core with a topology similar to the Bak dimer. Additional text has been added in the third paragraph of the subsection “Mobility of the N- and C-extremities permits linkage between dimers”.</p><p><italic>In addition to BAK helix 1, extending the IASD-labelling studies to more hydrophobic sites in the BAK helix 7-8 region also appears highly desirable.</italic> </p><p>We have already presented IASD labelling data for cysteine substitutions in helix 7 (Q173C) and helix 8 (V178C, A179C, L181C, N182C) in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3D</xref> (where Bak was activated by tBid<sup>BaxBH3</sup>). We now include data for Q173C in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1B,C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3C</xref>.</p><p>We also generated an additional variant at a hydrophobic site in Bak helix 7 (W170C). Unfortunately, expression of Bak W170C in Bak<sup>-/-</sup> Bax<sup>-/-</sup> MEFs was very low and accordingly mitochondrial fractions from these cells did not release cytochrome <italic>c</italic> in response to tBid treatment. As there was no evidence that this is a functional Bak variant, IASD labelling analysis was not performed.</p><p><italic>2) To establish the generality of the findings obtained with the BAK V61C mutant, it is important to show that the same crosslinking pattern elicited by cBID is reproduced by other apoptotic stimuli such as heat (43°C), etoposide (+QVD-oph), and/or BIMs overexpression (+QVD-oph).</italic> </p><p>As requested, we present a comparison of tBid treatment with heat treatment (43°C) in our mitochondrial cysteine linkage assay with the Bak V61C mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>, compare lanes 4 (tBid treatment) and lane 5 (43°C treatment). The same crosslinking pattern is induced by tBid or heat treatment, arguing that the linkage pattern between dimers is generalisable not only to both Bak and Bax, but to the two activators tBid and heat. Additional text has been added in the third paragraph of the subsection “Mobility of the N- and C-extremities permits linkage between dimers”.</p><p><italic>Also, have the authors excluded the possibility that VDAC2 or BCLXL molecules are present in the high-order BAK V61C multimeric bands detected by BN-PAGE?</italic> </p><p>We cannot exclude the possibility that VDAC2, Bcl-x<sub>L</sub>, and other molecules may be in some of the complexes. However, we note that the molecular weights of VDAC2 (~32 kDa) and Bcl-x<sub>L</sub> (~26 kDa) differ from that of Bak (~23 kDa), so low-order complexes would be expected to run differently to that of Bak multimers. We note also that in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s3">Figure 6—figure supplement 3</xref>, where V61C is co-expressed with Bak Cys null, the greatly reduced linkage argues that Bak V61C links mostly to itself. This conclusion has now been noted in the figure legend.</p><p><italic>Other important points to consider (not necessarily requiring experimental work):</italic> </p><p><italic>1A) One confusing aspect is why these assemblies of Bax and Bak don't diffuse in the plane of the membrane throughout the mitochondrial surface. There must be some affinity among the dimers to keep them near enough to interact, appear focal in imaging studies and to destabilize the membrane (as shown by the authors in Figure 7Bi and ii). And &quot;some affinity&quot; likely means a protein protein interface.</italic> </p><p>We and others have searched for a protein protein interface between dimers to explain why dimers do not diffuse in the plane of the membrane. However, the present study has failed to identify such an interface, and thus we hypothesise that membrane forces are driving Bak dimer aggregation. This hypothesis is consistent with a reversible attraction occurring between membrane wrapped particles purely as a result of membrane forces (Reynwar et al., Nature 2007, van der Wel et al., Sci Reports 2016, Katira et al., eLife 2016).</p><p>We have discussed this concept in more detail in the sixth paragraph of the Discussion. Briefly, our data suggest that when the Bak dimer forms, it adopts an in-plane topology at the membrane and the C-terminal α6 helix becomes partially embedded in-plane with the outer leaflet of the membrane bilayer. Furthermore, the Bak dimer structure (4U2V) has several hydrophobic moieties on the underside of the dimer (helices 4 and 5) thus it is plausible that this dimer would “sink” into the hydrophobic environment of the outer membrane. We hypothesise that this embedded dimer displaces molecules in the outer leaflet, and this deformation induces line tension in the membrane. The membrane is a fluid environment and random movement of Bak dimers on this surface will occur. However, the membrane will drive aggregation of these patches of disturbed membrane surrounding embedded dimers as it seeks to minimise the elevated line tension that occurs with the asymmetric burial of Bak dimers in the outer leaflet of the membrane.</p><p>We hypothesise that when this cluster of dimers reaches a critical size and perturbs a sufficient surface area on the membrane, the increased line tension can no longer be accommodated, thus the membrane is ruptured. We predict that the downstream reorganisation of protein and lipids to bury newly exposed hydrophobic surfaces results in the formation of lipidic pores of varying geometry (as observed in Grosse 2016, Nasu 2016, Salvador-Gallego 2016).</p><p><italic>It is hard to understand how the Bak to mitochondria ratio used in this study relates to in vivo situations. If it is too high, non-specific non-physiologic interactions may mask the specific interactions that occur at endogenous levels of protein.</italic> </p><p>We agree that greater than physiological levels of Bak may mask the presence of infrequent but perhaps more meaningful physiological interactions. However, in the present studies, the level of re-expressed human Bak is comparable to endogenous mouse Bak protein levels. This was shown in a recent study (Alsop et al., Nat Commun 2015), aided by the use of antibodies that recognise a linear epitope which is identical in mouse and human Bak. This is now clarified in the Methods (subsection “Preparation of membrane fractions enriched for mitochondria”).</p><p><italic>1B) Would consideration of possible non-symmetric dimer-dimer contact sites (i.e. linkage of different cys), as the authors brought up, challenge the authors strong conclusion of &quot;no single dominant interface between the α2-α5 core dimers&quot;? Please rebut these points or tone down the related statements in the manuscript.</italic> </p><p>A comprehensive single cysteine mutant screen has not revealed any dominant interface between dimers, and we acknowledge that heterotypic cysteine substitutions in such a screen may have highlighted non-symmetric dimer-dimer contact sites. And those within the highly structured α2-α5 core region would be of most interest in terms of driving oligomers. This is stated in the text (Discussion, third paragraph).</p><p>However, our conclusion of no significant interface between the core dimers does not rely entirely on the lack of linkage in the single mutant screen (as discussed in the aforementioned paragraph). That is, detergent can more readily disturb formation of an interface between dimers than the primary BH3:groove interface within dimers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>), indicating that interactions between dimers are less robust than those within dimers. We have also found that pre-formed aggregates of Bak dimers can be dispersed with the addition of recombinant Bax (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>), thus an energetically favoured protein-protein contact between Bak dimers appears unlikely. In summary, we have used several different approaches to explore the strength of interactions between Bak dimers and have not yet found any evidence of a robust protein interface between Bak dimers.</p><p> <italic>2) In the last paragraph of the subsection “Mobility of the N- and C-extremities permits linkage between dimers”, where the data is discussed regarding the BNP ladder after crosslinking Bak with C-terminal helix cysteines – it would be valuable to add in another scheme into <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref> that depicts what the authors mean by α6-α8 shielding of regions of helix 9.</italic></p><p>We apologise for the lack of clarity in that paragraph. It has now been re-written (subsection “Mobility of the N- and C-extremities permits linkage between dimers”, last paragraph). The topology is also discussed in further detail in the discussion, with reference to the schematic presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref> that shows how the randomly oriented C-terminal helices α6, α7 and α8 on the membrane surface might limit contact between the α2-α5 core region of each dimer and also limit collisions between the transmembrane α9 helices.</p><p><italic>3) In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>: is the tBID removed from the Bak and membranes prior to adding the Bax and</italic> Bcl-x<sub>L</sub><italic>? If not, tBID activating Bax or potentially inhibiting</italic> Bcl-x<sub>L</sub><italic>confounds the interpretations.</italic> </p><p>In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>, the tBid was not removed, but this does not confound the key conclusion drawn from this data: that Bak dimer clusters are dynamic and can be interspersed with another membrane protein (in this case Bax).</p><p>For example, as the reviewer suggests, tBid was not removed so we expect that there is sufficient to activate Bax and to bind to some Bcl-x<sub>L</sub> and Mcl-1. As the reviewer notes, binding to Bcl-x<sub>L</sub> and Mcl-1 may occur despite this version of tBid (tBid M97A) binding very poorly to Bcl-x<sub>L</sub> and Mcl-1 (Supplementary Figure 1A in Lee et al., Genes Dev 2016). However, the most important aspect of Bax, Bcl-x<sub>L</sub> and Mcl-1 behavior is that a significant portion was able to associate with the membrane fraction, and thus test whether Bak clusters are dynamic. Of these, only Bax was able to intermingle with pre-formed Bak dimers. We did not intend to explore the nuanced interactions between pro-survival proteins and Bak dimers in this work, rather we added Bcl-x<sub>L</sub> and Mcl-1 as a contrast to recombinant Bax. We were confident that Bcl-x<sub>L</sub>, Mcl-1 and Bax would all localise to the mitochondrial outer membrane, but appreciated that they might have different properties once at the membrane, and this is evident in this assay.</p><p><italic>I realize the authors use a mutant tBID to minimize this worry but the fact that BCl<sup>-</sup>xL and Mcl1 translocate to mitochondria, as they do in cells upon BH3 only protein induction, suggests it may be a problem even for these anti-apoptotic proteins.</italic> </p><p>As noted above, we did not intend to explore the nuanced interactions between pro-survival proteins and Bak dimers in this work, rather we added Bcl-x<sub>L</sub> and Mcl-1 as a contrast to recombinant Bax.</p><p>We note however, that the localisation of Mcl-1 and Bcl-x<sub>L</sub> to the membrane fractions could occur for several reasons. First, as tBid has a membrane anchor, any Mcl-1 or Bcl-x<sub>L</sub> it bound may also be at the mitochondria, but possibly in a slightly different conformation to the unbound forms. Second, Bcl-x<sub>L</sub> has the transmembrane domain which may insert without any interaction with other Bcl-2 family members. Third, Mcl-1 and Bcl-x<sub>L</sub> may bind to activated Bak which is inserted in the membrane, although this population is likely to be minimal as Bak is fully dimerised prior to the addition of Mcl-1 or Bcl-x<sub>L</sub> (as seen on BNP, e.g. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1A</xref>, lane 2).</p><p><italic>If removal of tBid is impractical, why not activate Bak with the 7D10 antibody used previously by the Kluck group? It would be interesting to compare Bax and</italic> Bcl-x<sub>L</sub><italic>activity on Bak oligomers activated by 7D10 with and without added tBid.</italic> </p><p>Yes, the 7D10 antibody would be an appropriate alternate stimulus for Bak activation, however as discussed, an alternative to tBid is not necessary at this time.</p><p><italic>4) As it stands now, the manuscript presents very limited experimental evidence supporting the notion that disordered BAK clusters directly cause MOMP, rather than merely an epiphenomenon that accompanies MOMP. This is a critical issue that needs to be further substantiated by experimental evidence or at least their claim that BAK clusters mediate MOMP, rather than merely accompanying MOMP, toned down.</italic> </p><p>The key data supporting the role of disordered Bak clusters in MOMP is that if we reduce the amount of Bak by 50%, we no longer see pores (Figure 4A in Ferrer et al., PLoS One 2012). Thus, of the whole population of Bak that is surveyed in our linkage studies, at least 50% is required for pore formation. So, the patterns observed in our linkage assays are at least 50% representative of Bak engaged in pore formation. This has been clarified in the fifth paragraph of the Discussion.</p><p>As indicated in the Discussion, our current assays allow a range of membrane-perturbing agents to be tested for the ability to inhibit pore formation at the step of dimer-dimer association.</p><p><italic>5) As in any similar type of approaches where one uses mutations to probe conformation, the conclusion from the observations hinges on two main assumptions: 1) The conformation of the protein itself has not been altered by the mutation to incorporate cysteine, or modification of the introduced cysteine by a chemical compound (such as IASD) has not triggered additional conformational change; 2) The physical properties of the modified protein has not changed so that the authors are not observing non-physiological events. I do understand that in some of these studies experimental controls to the above assumptions may not be easy or possible, but it would be useful if the authors can at least attempt at considering them. Testing apoptotic function of the mutant Bak in cells is a good start. Especially those mutations that involved hydrophobic and buried residues.</italic> </p><p>We agree that certain assumptions are made when using Bak cysteine substitution variants. As the reviewer suggests, testing the apoptotic function of the mutant Bak proteins in cells is a good start to ensuring data based on those mutants are physiologically relevant. Thus, a cell death assay in response to etoposide has been performed for all variants used in this study, and are reported either in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref> (newly generated variants only) or in our previous publications.</p><p>Many variants have also been screened in mitochondrial assays for the ability to permeabilise mitochondria in response to tBid. We now include this information as <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>. In each case, cell killing in response to etoposide correlated with cytochrome c release from membrane fractions treated with tBid.</p><p><italic>6) How did the authors determine that the linkages for some mutants were to other proteins rather than Bak? The authors suggested that this is due to close proximity on the mitochondria membrane and not due to potential physical interaction. It could be argued that the potential interaction with other proteins can't be completely ruled out in the linkage bands observed.</italic> </p><p>Linkage between Bak molecules was indicated by the presence of complexes corresponding to twice the molecular weight of the Bak monomer on non-reducing SDS-PAGE. In addition, linkage throughout Bak is a reliable measure of Bak:Bak association, as validated by dimer and oligomer migration on BNP. We note also that it is impressive that our simple computational model of Bak dimers linking (V61C:V61C) only to other Bak dimers shows such good concordance with our empirical BNP data and suggests that linkage to proteins other than Bak is a minor species in the Bak clusters. (Also, see response to Essential Point 2).</p><p>We do not rule out linkage to other proteins and the possibility of physiologically relevant interactions between Bak and other proteins. For instance, it has been established that non-activated Bak can associate with VDAC2 in the mitochondrial outer membrane (Cheng E et al., Science 2003; Lazarou M et al., JBC 2010).</p></body></sub-article></article>
