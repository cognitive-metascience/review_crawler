Proteins are made of chains of amino acids. When a protein chain folds, some of these amino acids interact with other amino acids and these contacts dictate the overall shape of the protein. This means that identifying the pairs of contacting amino acids could make it possible to predict the protein’s structure.</p><p>Interactions between pairs of contacting amino acids tend to remain conserved throughout evolution, and if a mutation alters one of the amino acids in a pair then a 'compensatory' change often occurs to alter the second amino acid as well. Compensatory mutations can suggest that two amino acids are close to each other in the three-dimensional shape of a protein, but the computational methods used to identify such amino acid pairs can sometimes be inaccurate.</p><p>In 2012, researchers generated mutants of a bacterial protein called CcdB with changes to single amino acids that caused the protein to fail to fold correctly. Now, Sahoo et al. – who include two of the researchers involved in the 2012 work – have developed an experimental method to identify contacting amino acids and use the CcdB protein as a test case. The approach involved searching for additional mutations that could restore the activity of five of the original mutant proteins when the proteins were produced in yeast cells. The rationale was that any secondary mutations that restored the activity must have corrected the folding defect caused by the original mutation. Sahoo et al. then predicted how close the amino acids affected by the secondary mutations were to the amino acids altered by the original mutations. This information was used to select reliable three-dimensional models of CcdB from a large set of possible structures that had been generated previously using computer models.</p><p>Next, the technique was applied to a protein called diacylglycerol kinase A. The structure of this protein had previously been inferred using techniques such as X-ray crystallography and nuclear magnetic resonance, but there was a mismatch between the two methods. Sahoo et al. found that the amino acid contacts derived from their experimental method matched those found in the crystal structure, suggesting that the functional protein structure in living cells is similar to the crystal structure. In the future, the experimental approach developed in this work could be combined with existing methods to reliably guide protein structure prediction.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.09532.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.09532.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>protein stability</kwd><kwd>Pairwise contacts</kwd><kwd>model discrimination</kwd><kwd>structure prediction</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd>None</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001407</institution-id><institution>Department of Biotechnology , Ministry of Science and Technology</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>NO.BT/COE/34/SP15219/2015, DT.20/11/2015</award-id> <principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Varadarajan</surname><given-names>Raghavan</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001409</institution-id><institution>Department of Science and Technology, Ministry of Science and Technology</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>FNo.SB/SO/BB-0099/2013 DTD 24.6.14</award-id> <principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Varadarajan</surname><given-names>Raghavan</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001412</institution-id><institution>Council of Scientific and Industrial Research</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Graduate Student Fellowship</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Sahoo</surname><given-names>Anusmita</given-names></name><name><surname>Jain</surname><given-names>Pankaj</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001407</institution-id><institution>Department of Biotechnology , Ministry of Science and Technology</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Graduate Student Fellowship</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Khare</surname><given-names>Shruti</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Experimental determination of residue contacts from mutational data allows model discrimination and identification of in vivo functional conformations of proteins.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Deducing the native conformation of a protein provides insight into its biological function. X-ray crystallography, NMR and more recently Cryo-EM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bartesaghi et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Cheng, 2015</xref>) are the major techniques used to accomplish this at atomic resolution. However, these require soluble purified protein at high concentration. In a few cases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Garbuzynskiy et al., 2005</xref>), the structures solved by different methods do not agree with each other, for various reasons. In many cases, the folded conformation is believed to be at a global free energy minimum (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Anfinsen, 1973</xref>). This can be used as a guide to either deduce the structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Havel et al., 1979</xref>) or fold a protein <italic>in silico</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Das et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Das and Baker, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Pande et al., 2003</xref>).</p><p>The structural and functional integrity of a protein requires maintenance of specific interactions during the course of evolution. Evolution allows either conservation of these interacting pairs of residues or mutation at interacting positions in a correlated manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Godzik and Sander, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Melero et al., 2014</xref>). The fitness cost of most amino acid substitutions depends on the genetic context in which they occur. Substitutions beneficial in one background can be detrimental in a different background (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Breen et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Shah et al., 2015</xref>). Interestingly, some sites are conserved not because a given amino acid is functionally irreplaceable, but rather because the right context is not available for its evolution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Wellner et al., 2013</xref>). This provides further evidence of correlation amongst mutations, that is epistatic interactions.</p><p>Often, the detrimental effects of a mutation can be alleviated by a second (suppressor) mutation which compensates for defects in stability, packing or function caused by the first mutation. Such correlated substitutions have been experimentally identified in attempts to screen for second-site suppressors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Araya et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Hecht and Sauer, 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Machingo et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Pakula and Sauer, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Sideraki et al., 2001</xref>). Correlated mutations have also been employed to identify protein interaction sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Melamed et al., 2015</xref>). Two other recent studies have described a large number of second-site suppressors for the RRM2 domain of the yeast poly(A)-binding protein (Pab1) and the IgG-binding domain of protein G (GB1), respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Melamed et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Olson et al., 2014</xref>). While there have been past efforts to identify compensatory mutations, a comprehensive method to explicitly identify suppressors and to distinguish suppressors that are spatially proximal from those that are distal to the site of the original inactive mutation is lacking. In the current work, we attempt to address these issues.</p><p>In addition to experimental studies to identify correlated mutations, several computational methods also exist which detect coevolution of residues in homologous sequences. Various statistical approaches which identify correlated mutations have been used to decode such evolutionary information contained in multiple homologous sequences of a protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Göbel et al., 1994</xref>). Progressive improvement in this area has resulted in more accurate strategies such as use of a Bayesian network model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Burger et al., 2010</xref>), maximum entropy in DCA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Morcos et al., 2011</xref>) and EVfold (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Marks et al., 2011</xref>), sparse inverse covariance estimation in PSICOV (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Jones et al., 2012</xref>) and a pseudo-likelihood based approach in GREMLIN (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Kamisetty et al., 2013</xref>) to predict residue-residue contacts to computationally build protein 3D structures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Marks et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Jones et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Ovchinnikov et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Sulkowska, et al., 2012</xref>). A sparse network of co-evolving residues of a protein constraining its structure, specificity and function has been examined by statistical coupling analysis of evolutionarily rich sequence data in protein families (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Halabi et al., 2009</xref>). Although these methods show great promise in the area of macromolecular structure determination, the fidelity of the predictions is questionable for candidates with small protein families, where the total number of sequences is less than five times the length of the protein in case of GREMLIN (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Kamisetty et al., 2013</xref>) or less than 1000 for some of the other methods (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Morcos et al., 2011</xref>). Further, stringent constraints present during natural evolution limit the number and nature of sequences that are sampled. We propose alternative experimental methodology termed saturation suppressor mutagenesis to complement and extend residue contact information obtained from computational analyses of correlated mutations in a multiple sequence alignment.</p><p>The test protein in this study, Controller of Cell Division or Death B (CcdB) is the toxin component of the <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> CcdA-CcdB antitoxin-toxin system. It is a globular, dimeric protein with 101 residues per protomer, involved in maintenance of F plasmid in cells by a mechanism involving its binding to and poisoning of DNA Gyrase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Dao-Thi et al., 2005</xref>). CcdB has two primary ligands with overlapping binding sites. These are its cognate antitoxin, CcdA and its cellular target, DNA Gyrase. CcdB has ~350 homologs in its protein family, which is less than five times the length of the protein. Therefore, computational methods cannot be reliably employed to deduce correlated mutations from a multiple sequence alignment of CcdB homologs.</p><p>Using CcdB, we identify spatially proximal residues by doing an exhaustive search for suppressor mutations for a given inactive mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). We subsequently use this information for protein model discrimination and structure prediction. We have previously constructed a saturation mutagenesis library of CcdB in which each residue was individually randomized. The library was screened at multiple expression levels in <italic>E. coli</italic> and relative activities of ~1430 individual mutants were inferred by deep sequencing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Adkar et al., 2012</xref>). It was observed that the mutational sensitivity of each residue of CcdB is related to its depth from the protein surface. Residue depth is defined as the distance of any atom/residue to the closest bulk water (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Chakravarty and Varadarajan, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Tan et al., 2011</xref>). An empirical parameter (RankScore) related to mutational sensitivity was defined for each residue, which could be reliably used as a proxy for the residue’s depth, provided the residue was not part of the active-site. Active-site residues could be deduced solely from mutational sensitivity data. A brief description of the screening procedure and definitions of mutational sensitivity score and RankScore are provided in the Materials and methods section.</p><p>In the present study, residues likely to be present at the core of CcdB were identified by their mutational sensitivity in the single mutant library (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Adkar et al., 2012</xref>). Inactive mutants at five such putative buried residues were identified. Next, exhaustive second-site saturation mutagenesis libraries constructed in the background of each inactive mutant were displayed on the surface of yeast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Chao et al., 2006</xref>) and screened for binding to the CcdB ligand, DNA Gyrase, to identify suppressors. Distal and proximal suppressors could readily be distinguished based on the RankScore of the suppressor site in the original single-site saturation mutagenesis library (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Adkar et al., 2012</xref>). The residue proximity information thus obtained, was used to generate spatial constraints, which were in turn able to capture the protein’s native structural features and recovered &gt;98% of native-like models (with backbone RMSD within 2.5 Å of the native structure) from a pool of decoys. Thus, high-throughput, exhaustive application of this approach, combined with ways to disentangle proximal from distal suppressors would be a useful way to identify a substantial number of distance constraints, which can be used for protein structure prediction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Marks et al., 2011</xref>).</p><p>Diacylglycerol kinase A (DgkA) is a homotrimeric integral transmembrane protein (121 residues per protomer) in <italic>E. coli</italic>, catalyzing the phosphorylation of diacylglycerol to phosphatidic acid. Gram-negative bacteria use this reaction product to shuttle water-soluble components to membrane-derived oligosaccharide and lipopolysaccharide in their cell envelope (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Van Horn and Sanders, 2012</xref>). The protein has been captured in two distinct conformations by X-ray crystallography (PDB id 3ZE5 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Li et al., 2013</xref>]) and NMR (PDB id 2KDC [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Van Horn et al., 2009</xref>]), respectively. The two structures are significantly different from each other, with ‘domain swapping’ being the key feature of the NMR model. Each structure is characterized by several unique residue contacts. It is important to identify whether one or both these structures are present in-vivo. We therefore isolated inactive mutants at residues involved in differential contacts in the two structures. Next, we experimentally identified suppressors of these inactive mutants. The residue contact pairs identified via these suppressors were consistent only with the contacts found in the crystal structure, thereby suggesting that the X-ray structure represents the native, active conformer of this membrane protein in-vivo.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Selection of parent inactive mutant</title><p>In the current work, we aimed at identifying suppressors for buried inactive non-active site residues of CcdB. Since WT CcdB is toxic to <italic>E. coli</italic> only cells transformed with inactive mutants will survive, thus providing a facile selection for such mutants. Relative activities of ~1430 single-site mutants of CcdB have been obtained previously from phenotypic screening of a single-site saturation mutagenesis library at multiple expression levels in <italic>E. coli.</italic> Deep sequencing was used to determine the identities of all surviving (inactive) mutants at each expression level (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Adkar et al., 2012</xref>). An empirical parameter (RankScore) was defined for each residue (see Materials and methods). It is related to the average mutational sensitivity (see Materials and methods) at each position. It was observed that for non-active site positions, RankScore is proportional to residue depth.</p><p>The sequencing data from the above library was analyzed to select five inactive mutants; V5F, V18W, V20F, L36A and L83S (hereafter referred to as parent inactive mutants) at buried, non-active site residues. Several buried, non-active site residues were identified from sequencing data. Parent inactive mutants were chosen so as to include different kinds of mutations, namely large→small, small→large and hydrophobic→polar. Patterns of mutational sensitivity (MS<sub>seq</sub>) for mutants at a position were analysed to distinguish between active-site and buried mutations as described below.</p><p>Both buried and active-site residue positions possess high RankScores and high average mutational sensitivity (MS<sub>seq</sub>) values. Active-site residues can be distinguished from buried ones based on the pattern of mutational sensitivity. Mutational sensitivity (MS<sub>seq</sub>) scores were determined from the sequencing analysis of the single-site saturation library of CcdB and refer to the expression level at which partial loss of function mutants show an active phenotype (methodology described in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Adkar et al., 2012</xref>]). Patterns of MS<sub>seq</sub> values for active-site, buried and exposed positions differ from each other. Representative plots are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>. At buried positions, typically most aliphatic substitutions are tolerated; hence they have low MS<sub>seq</sub> values. Polar and charged residues are poorly tolerated at buried positions, thus showing high MS<sub>seq</sub> values (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>). By contrast, mutations to aliphatic residues are often poorly tolerated at active-site residues (which are typically exposed) and have higher MS<sub>seq</sub> values (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref>). Polar and charged residues are sometimes tolerated and the average mutational sensitivity for active-site residues is typically higher than for buried residues. By analyzing the mutational sensitivity patterns at all positions, Q2, F3, Y6, S22, I24, N95, W99, G100 and I101 can be identified as putative active-site residues. These residues were identified based solely on mutational data (unpublished results). Similar mutational patterns are seen for at least two other proteins for which extensive mutational data exist, the PDZ domain (PSD95<sup>pdz3</sup>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">McLaughlin et al., 2012</xref>) and the IgG-binding domain of protein G (GB1) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Olson et al., 2014</xref>) (unpublished results).<fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.09532.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Strategy adopted to determine proximal residue pairs.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Parent inactive mutant binds cognate ligand with lower apparent affinity than Wild-Type protein (WT).

In addition to differences in mutational sensitivity patterns which are employed here to discriminate between active-site and buried residues, an important difference between active-site and buried mutations is that the former typically affect specific activity and not the level of properly folded protein, while the latter primarily affect the level of properly folded protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bajaj et al., 2008</xref>). Thus, measurements of protein levels, and possibly sensitivity of mutant activity to chaperone overexpression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Tokuriki and Tawfik, 2009</xref>), can also be used to distinguish between active-site and buried mutants.

Recombination yielded ~10<sup>5</sup> transformants for each library. Yeast surface display (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Chao et al., 2006</xref>) and Fluorescence Activated Cell Sorting (FACS) were used as screening tools to isolate populations exhibiting (i) enhanced binding to the ligand DNA Gyrase, and (ii) increased surface expression relative to the corresponding parent inactive mutant. The ligand concentration was decreased in subsequent rounds of sorting to increase the stringency in selection of true suppressors (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Supplementary file 1</xref>). The methodology used to generate the library along with the use of very low (pg) amount of template DNA for PCR was effective in introducing the parent inactive mutant into all members of the single-site saturation mutagenesis library. This is important as the presence of even a small fraction of WT residue at the position of the parent inactive mutant will rapidly lead to its selection, resulting in a high amount of false positive data. Following multiple rounds of sorting (typically 3–4), over 10% of the population was shown to bind significantly better to DNA Gyrase than the parent inactive mutants. Data for the L83S mutant library is shown (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>).

For example, a cavity formed by a large→small substitution of a residue may be compensated by a small→large substitution of the partner residue in contact with it. Consequently, while each of the individual mutations will be destabilizing in the WT background, the pair will have increased stability and activity relative to their corresponding single mutants, thus demonstrating positive sign epistasis.</p><p>However, suppressors can be either spatially proximal or distal from the site of the original inactive mutation. In contrast to proximal suppressors, distal suppressors will typically be on the surface of protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bank et al., 2015</xref>) and, hence, the individual suppressor mutation is expected to be neutral in the WT background. Further, unlike proximal suppressors no complementarity in amino acid property relative to the parent inactive mutant is expected for a distal suppressor. In the present study, we use RankScore values to discriminate between proximal and distal suppressors. The approach is validated by mapping proximal and distal suppressors onto the known crystal structure of CcdB.</p><p>We have previously shown that the RankScore parameter correlates with residue depths derived from the crystal structure of the protein (Figure 4B of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">[Adkar et al., 2012</xref>]). The value for RankScore ranges between 1 to 100. For a given non-active site residue, a higher value of RankScore indicates that the residue is likely to be buried in the protein structure. All the parent inactive mutants were chosen such that they are non-active site and have a high RankScore. These residues are predicted to be buried and indeed are found to be buried in the crystal structure. It is therefore expected that positions at which local suppressors occur will also have high depth, high RankScores and high average mutational sensitivity in the single-site saturation mutagenesis library (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>).</p><p>All the positions with low RankScores are found to be exposed on the protein structure. Hence, suppressors with RankScore=1 were classified as distal suppressors (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>). A RankScore of 1 is a conservative cutoff for distal suppressors, probably a cutoff of five or ten would yield similar results. The RankScore cutoff of 25 which we have chosen for proximal suppressors, clearly identifies only buried residues with depth &gt; 5.5 Å. All these residues have accessibility &lt; 1.5%.</p><p>The PCR strategy adopted (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref>) to construct the second-site suppressor mutagenesis library for screening suppressors against the parent inactive mutants of CcdB was designed to generate (i) 50% double mutants with each member containing the parent inactive mutant and a single mutant, and (ii) 50% parent inactive mutants. Sequencing data obtained was analyzed to identify proximal and distal suppressors (as discussed above). We largely obtained double mutants containing the parent inactive mutant and a suppressor, and a small fraction of the triple mutant (V5F/L36M/A81G) (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>). Occurrence of the triple mutant was due to selection and enrichment of an additional mutation introduced into the double mutant library likely due to PCR based errors. The selected triple mutant contained the parent inactive mutant V5F and two proximal suppressors (L36M and A81G). Overall, six residue pairs were identified, which contained the parent inactive mutant and a putative proximal suppressor (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>).</p><p>The shortest distance between individual members of the identified (parent inactive mutant, proximal suppressor) pairs in the structure of WT CcdB was 2.8–4.8 Å (PDB id: 3VUB (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Loris et al., 1999</xref>), <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). This validated the methodology described above. Two residues, R10 and E11 (in the pairs L36A/R10G, L36A/E11P, V20F/E11R and V20F/E11K) were identified as locations for distal suppressors based on their low RankScore values in the single-site saturation mutagenesis library. Mutations at E11 were observed to suppress parent inactive mutants at multiple residue positions. The shortest distances between L36-R10 and V20-E11 are 11.6 Å and 18.4 Å, respectively. As expected, the proximal suppressors are clustered together in the protein interior while the distal ones are present on an exposed loop region (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>, <xref ref-type="other" rid="media1">Video 1</xref>).<fig id="fig3" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.09532.009</object-id><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>Experimentally obtained (Parent inactive mutant, suppressor) pairs mapped onto the crystal structure of CcdB (PDB id 3VUB [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Loris et al., 1999</xref>]).</title><p>Only the Wild-Type (WT) residues of each member of the pair are shown as structures of the mutants are not available.

Increased surface expression of R10G paired with each of V5F, V18W, L36A and L83S was seen relative to the individual parent inactive mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A,B</xref>). This demonstrates that R10G likely acts as a global suppressor. E11 suppresses activity of two parent inactive mutants, L36A and V20F (L36A/E11P, V20F/E11R, V20F/E11K) and is anticipated to play a role similar to R10G.</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>Characterization of distal suppressors</title><p>The presence of the CcdB ligand, CcdA during thermal denaturation of CcdB, shifts the unfolding equilibrium towards the folded fraction of CcdB, resulting in an increased T<sub>m</sub> than when monitored in its absence (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2-data">Supplementary file 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2</xref>). This increase in T<sub>m</sub> was observed for all mutants except R10G. L36A/R10G showed an increase of only 9<sup>o</sup>C in the presence of CcdA while other mutants showed an increase of &gt;20<sup>o</sup>C. These observations indicated a decrease in affinity of R10G CcdB for CcdA. The distal suppressors R10G and E11R are present on an exposed loop of CcdB and contact CcdA in the crystal structure of the CcdB-CcdA complex, PDB id 3G7Z (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">De Jonge et al., 2009</xref>). R10 forms a hydrogen bond (2.9 Å) with N69 of CcdA. Hence, mutations at R10 and E11 are likely to destabilize binding of CcdB to CcdA, consistent with our results. The suppressor mutant, R10G has an increased stability relative to WT (R10G (T<sub>m</sub>(R10G)=74.8 ± 0.2<sup>o</sup>C, T<sub>m</sub>(WT)=66.8 ± 1.0<sup>o</sup>C, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2-data">Supplementary file 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>). However, the compromised ability to bind to its antitoxin CcdA results in increased toxicity in native contexts where CcdB and CcdA are both present. Thus, to maintain homeostasis in the system, evolutionary pressure defines a trade-off between function and stability of the protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Schreiber et al., 1994</xref>), settling on an optimally stable wild type protein rather than a maximally stable one. This explains why the R to G mutation is not found in naturally occurring CcdB homologs. The screen employed in this work identifies stabilizing variants which are functionally competent to bind to only one of the binding partners, DNA Gyrase, explaining the identification of the R10G like mutation. To understand the molecular mechanism(s) by which R10G rescues L36A present at the core, we examined if any long range functional interaction was predicted between the sites by the program SCA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Halabi et al., 2009</xref>). No interaction was seen although this analysis was limited by low sequence diversity of CcdB. Experimentally, we observed that R10G stabilized the WT protein and other parent inactive mutants while the E11R substitution stabilized the parent inactive mutant V20F. The large conformational flexibility of glycine (in case of R10G) might stabilize the loop harboring residue 10 by accessing conformations not accessible to other residues. Further experiments need to be done to understand the mechanism of stabilization of the parent inactive mutant V20F by E11R and to determine if E11R, like R10G also functions as a global suppressor.</p></sec><sec id="s2-6"><title>ContactScore as a model discriminator</title><p>A decoy set of 10,659 models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Adkar et al., 2012</xref>) (doi:10.5061/dryad.3g092) of CcdB was used to probe the utility of the experimentally obtained contact information in model discrimination. The decoy set contained models ranging from 1.9–20.4 Å (backbone RMSD relative to the crystal structure, PDB id 3VUB [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Loris et al., 1999</xref>]). The models were scored based on ContactScore, which was defined as the number of times the experimentally identified residue contact pairs (6 pairs) are within a cutoff distance of 7 Å of each other in a given model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>) (see Materials and methods). ContactScore is an integral value ranging from 0 to 6, as there are six (Parent inactive mutant, proximal suppressor) pairs. Proximal suppressor mutants are likely to have their side chains facing towards the corresponding parent inactive mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B–F</xref>), and hence, the side chain centroids of the pair are likely to be closer than their corresponding Cα atoms. Results for other choices of distances are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>.

Models satisfying all the experimental constraints that is ContactScore=6 are distributed in the RMSD bin &lt;4 Å. The distribution progressively shifts towards a higher RMSD range with decrease in the number of constraints being satisfied (ContactScore&lt;6).

Indeed, in the case of CcdB it was more challenging to find suppressors for the aromatic parent inactive mutants (V18W, V20F), relative to other parent inactive mutants (such as L36A and L83S) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Supplementary file 1</xref>). V62Q, M66S, M66L, I67V, V68G and W112V were identified as parent inactive mutants from screening of single-site saturation mutagenesis libraries constructed at these positions.

The top ranked pairs which typically lie in the top L/2 pairs, where L is the length of the protein sequence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Jones et al., 2012</xref>) are predicted to be in contact. The methods perform well when the size of the multiple sequence alignment is large, that is &gt;5L (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Kamisetty et al., 2013</xref>). DgkA (121 residues per protomer) exhibits large sequence diversity (4175 sequences in the multiple sequence alignment).

Some high scoring, co-varying pairs predicted by DCA, GREMLIN, PSICOV and EVfold were found to be true contacts (centroid-centroid distance &lt;7 Å, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>) when mapped onto the crystal structure. There were a few high scoring pairs which were either far apart in the X-ray structure (predictions by PSICOV) or were in proximity when analyzed with the NMR structure (predictions by GREMLIN, PSICOV and EVfold). However, overall sequence co-variation data are more consistent with the X-ray structure, in agreement with conclusions from suppressor mutagenesis. Of the six contacts identified from our suppressor analyses (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl2">Table 2</xref>), three (62–41, 67–104, 68–100) were predicted in the top L/2 co-varying pairs by GREMLIN, PSICOV and EVfold (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>), only 67–104 was predicted by DCA and none by SCA.

The predictions therefore are not specific to the identities of the side-chains of the residues present in the sequence of interest at the predicted contact positions. Therefore, we also analyzed the predictions by calculating the Cα-Cα distances between the predicted pairs using both X-ray and NMR structures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1</xref>). No side chain information is involved in these calculations. Similar results were obtained as when using the sidechain-sidechain centroid distances. Co-variation prediction becomes increasingly challenging for proteins with very few homologs. CcdB (101 residues per protomer) has only 350 sequences (&lt;5 L, where L is the length of the protein) in the multiple sequence alignment. Therefore, co-variation predictions for CcdB were not included.</p></sec><sec id="s2-9"><title>ΔΔG calculations for local suppressors of CcdB</title><p>There is considerable interest in accurate prediction of mutational effects on the free energy of folding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Guerois et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Kellogg et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Shen and Sali, 2006</xref>). We therefore examined whether ΔΔG calculations could be used to rationalize the identity of the experimentally observed local suppressors. To this end the difference in stability between the (Parent inactive mutant, suppressor) pair and the parent inactive mutant for CcdB mutants was calculated. △△G<italic><sub>folding</sub> </italic>(△G<italic><sub>folding</sub></italic>Double mutant<italic>-</italic>△G<italic><sub>folding</sub></italic>Parent inactive mutant) was calculated using Rosetta v3.3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Kellogg et al., 2011</xref>). Putative proximal suppressors were considered to arise at residues within 7 Å (sidechain–sidechain centroid distance) of the parent inactive mutant. Many stable substituents were predicted (△△G<italic><sub>folding</sub></italic>&lt;0, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>). However, amongst the six experimentally identified stable compensatory pairs, only L36A/M63L (−3.7 kcal/mol) was predicted to be stable. The remaining five contact pairs were predicted to be either marginally stable or unstable. Several other mutations besides the experimentally determined ones were predicted to be stabilizing for example V5F/L16G, V18W/I90A, V20F/I90A, L36A/V54I and L83S/V18I. These might be present in the earlier rounds of sorting but are lost in later rounds due to stringent sort conditions. A marked bias for aromatic substitutions was observed in the predictions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>, substitutions underlined in magenta) though such aromatic substitutions were not observed experimentally. Aromatic substitutions are rigid and were found to over pack the cavity created by the parent inactive mutants in the models generated using Rosetta. Further, several of the mutations that were computationally predicted to be highly stabilizing are unlikely to be so as they are not complementary in size to the original parent inactive mutant, for example L36A/W61F, V5F/L16Y, V18W/I90F and V20F/I90F.

The saturation-suppressor mutagenesis methodology described here (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref>) enabled identification of 8 residues at the hydrophobic core and their pairwise interactions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A,F</xref>) placing important constraints on packing of the model protein CcdB. Encouragingly, proximal suppressors could be obtained for four of the five parent inactive mutants in the case of CcdB as well as DgkA. There may be mutations in the core which allow the protein to fold but are functionally defective (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Roscoe et al., 2013</xref>). We eliminated such mutations as the CcdB screen required variants to both fold into a stable conformation and be functionally active to bind to Gyrase. The experimentally identified residue pairs for CcdB are in physical contact and have suppressor positions common to each other (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B–F</xref>, <xref ref-type="other" rid="media1">Video 1</xref>). This interlinked network of residues restricts the conformational space during folding. The ContactScore metric defined above selects models satisfying the identified spatial constraints. A histogram of recovery of models with respect to backbone RMSD of the models selected by this metric shows a maximum of 100% for models with backbone RMSD &lt;2 Å, gradually decreasing to 66% for models &lt;4 Å and subsequently plateauing to 0% for models &gt;5 Å, reflecting the sensitivity and accuracy of the parameter. A high recovery is important for protein model discrimination, as typically there will be very few low RMSD models in the candidate set of predictions. The ContactScore metric also performs better than a simpler approach based on deviation of residue accessibilities in a model from their average values in a large dataset of proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bahadur and Chakrabarti, 2009</xref>) though an exhaustive comparison with other metrics for model discrimination has not been carried out. The efficiency of model discrimination using the ContactScore metric will likely be a function of quality of the decoy dataset as well as the accuracy of the contacts inferred from suppressor mutagenesis. In a dataset where very few low RMSD models are present or where not all contacts identified are true contacts, the model recovery will be lower than for the CcdB decoy dataset described here. Further, the small number of (Parent inactive mutant, suppressor) pairs identified here will not be sufficient for larger proteins, thereby affecting the model discrimination efficiency. However, most of these limitations can be overcome by identifying a higher number of (Parent inactive mutant, suppressor) pairs for the protein of interest and by combining residue contacts inferred from saturation mutagenesis with other experimental or computational constraints.</p><p>The saturation suppressor mutagenesis approach was extended to the important case of membrane proteins. Many membrane proteins adopt multiple conformations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Tokuriki and Tawfik, 2009</xref>) and membrane mimetics used to solubilize and stabilize membrane proteins can affect their conformations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Cross et al., 2013</xref>). There are two reported structures of the integral membrane protein DgkA, one solved by X-ray crystallography (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Li et al., 2013</xref>) and one by solution NMR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Van Horn et al., 2009</xref>) which differ significantly from each other. Using our suppressor methodology, we unambiguously identified six residue-residue contacts which were all present in the crystal structure but were spatially distant in the NMR structure. This suggests that the conformation of the protein in the lipidic (monoacylglycerol) cubic phase conditions (used in X-ray crystallography [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Li et al., 2013</xref>]) is the functional conformer in-vivo and is not an artifact resulting from the presence of thermostabilizing mutations and minor distortions that might result from crystal contacts. Our results are also consistent with a recent reanalysis of oriented sample solid state NMR data for the protein in liquid crystalline bilayers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Murray et al., 2014</xref>) which showed better overall agreement with the crystal than with the solution NMR structure.</p><p>Broad application of suppressor methodology to systems where no structural information is available requires accurate discrimination of buried from exposed active-site residues and of distal from proximal suppressors. As discussed above, buried and active-site residues can be distinguished based on their mutational sensitivity patterns as well as from data on mutant protein levels, sensitivity to chaperone overexpression patterns (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Tokuriki and Tawfik, 2009</xref>) and residue conservation patterns (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Melamed et al., 2015</xref>). Distal suppressors are likely to be on the surface (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bank et al., 2015</xref>). If the correlation of mutational sensitivity/RankScore with depth seen for CcdB holds for other globular proteins, this should allow distinction of local and global suppressors in such systems, as long as the majority of global suppressors lie on the surface. However, unambiguous distinction between global and local suppressors will likely not always be possible with a limited number of (Parent inactive mutation, suppressor) pairs. Also, in some cases, a single suppressor mutation may not be sufficient to restore the activity of a parent inactive mutant. In such cases, the network of correlating residues will be more complex and additional experimental data will be required to identify a set of mutations which will suppress a parent inactive mutant.</p><p>Unlike globular proteins, little is known about sensitivity to mutation in membrane proteins or natively unfolded proteins. Until such data becomes available it will be challenging to apply this methodology to these systems. In the case of DgkA, we had the much simpler objective of distinguishing between two possible structures. While distinguishing between global and local suppressors maybe more challenging in membrane proteins, given sufficient double mutant data, it should be straightforward because each global suppressor should suppress a much larger number of parent inactive mutants than all local suppressors. The average relative frequency of obtaining proximal versus distal suppressors is currently unknown. If a single-site saturation mutagenesis library is enriched for inactive mutants (Parent inactive mutants), subjected to random mutagenesis and screened for suppressors, the resulting population will be enriched for global suppressors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Bershtein et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">2008</xref>). This is because a global suppressor will suppress multiple parent inactive mutants. However, for a specific parent inactive mutant, it is not obvious that global suppressors will dominate. A recent study examined a library of the 75 amino acid RRM domain of the yeast poly-A binding protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Melamed et al., 2013</xref>). Functional scores for 1246 single and 39,912 double mutants were obtained. Epistatic interactions were enriched for residue pairs with short sequence spacing (&lt;5) and short distance (10–15Å). Another recent study reported exhaustive screening of single and double mutants of GB1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Olson et al., 2014</xref>). The majority of pairs displaying positive epistasis had Cβ-Cβ distances &lt;8 Å. Both of the above studies indicate that local suppressors may occur at a higher frequency than global ones with respect to individual parent inactive mutants but more data is required to confirm this.</p><p>Experimental approaches discussed previously to identify second-site suppressors used random mutagenesis and/or directed evolution to generate suppressor libraries. Although these libraries have high diversity and mutations at multiple residue positions, they typically do not have more than a single base substitution at any codon. It should be noted that single base changes can sample only 39% of all possible amino acid substitutions. Hence, they do not exhaustively sample all possible second-site suppressors for a given inactivating mutation. This is important, since for a given parent inactive mutant there appear to be only a few local suppressors, and these could well be absent in a library generated by conventional random mutagenesis.</p><p>Computational approaches to identify spatially proximal residues require a large number of homologous sequences to be present (typically greater than five times the length of the protein) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Kamisetty et al., 2013</xref>). These approaches do not work well for proteins like CcdB due to the limited evolutionary diversity in the multiple sequence alignment. Another constraint is that the range of substitutions sampled at a given position during natural evolution is limited by functional and stability constraints, that can be relaxed in a laboratory setting. For the protein DgkA, for which there are several sequences, the results of the five computational approaches to identify co-varying residues were more consistent with the crystal structure of DgkA than with the NMR structure. Several of the contacts identified by our suppressor approach were not identified by the sequence co-variation. Since our experimental strategy identifies only a few (Parent inactive mutant, suppressor), a direct comparison of these results with predictions by computational methods is not possible. However, our approach, provides complementary information to these existing methods, and can be usefully combined with them to guide protein structure prediction. The approach described here uses saturation-suppressor mutagenesis to identify spatially proximal residues. The library generation design adopted here for CcdB, constructs the second-site saturation library in the background of individual inactive mutants chosen from a single-site saturation mutagenesis library comprising of ~1430 mutants of CcdB (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Adkar et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>Second-site suppressors can be either proximal or distal to the mutation site. Virtually all suppressors identified in the study (for CcdB) increased the thermal stability relative to the original parent inactive mutant. Proximal suppressors are likely to ameliorate packing defects and hence restore stability. These have previously been reported to restore activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Machingo et al., 2001</xref>), increase thermal stability and restore packing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Pakula and Sauer, 1989</xref>). Residues distant from the site have previously been found to function by either increasing global thermodynamic stability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Araya et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Bershtein et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Pakula and Sauer, 1989</xref>), increasing activity relative to the wild type protein without any substantial increase in stability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Hecht and Sauer, 1985</xref>) or improving foldability without much effect on the thermodynamic stability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Sideraki et al., 2001</xref>). In the present study, local suppressors could be obtained for each of the five parent inactive mutants in CcdB and five of six parent inactive mutants in DgkA, regardless of the location and nature of the parent inactive mutant. The distal suppressor R10G in CcdB increased the T<sub>m</sub> by 8<sup>o</sup>C, relative to WT CcdB (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2-data">Supplementary file 2</xref>) which rescues the destabilized mutant L36A.</p><p>Global suppressors have been shown to often comprise of consensus/ancestral mutations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Bershtein et al., 2008</xref>). We analyzed the consensus/ancestral mutations for CcdB. The consensus sequence was obtained from a multiple sequence alignment of 350 homologs using MATLAB and the ancestral sequence was obtained using the FastML server (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Ashkenazy et al., 2012</xref>). The likely global suppressors we obtained in the present study are R10G and E11(R/K/P). At R10 the ancestral and consensus amino acids are P and R respectively and at E11 they are A and N respectively. Hence, at least for these two positions, the ancestral/consensus amino acids were different from the experimentally obtained suppressors. Further experiments are required to ascertain whether the ancestral/consensus amino acids will also act as global suppressors.</p><p>Advances in the field of protein structure prediction integrate various computational approaches with distance restraints derived from cross-linking experiments and mass spectrometry (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Young et al., 2000</xref>), sparse NOE data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Bowers et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Li et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Thompson, et al., 2012</xref>), residual dipolar coupling data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Haliloglu et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Qu et al., 2004</xref>), chemical shift data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Shen et al., 2008</xref>) from NMR experiments, co-varying residues identified from statistical analysis of genomic data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Hopf et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Jones et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Ovchinnikov et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Ovchinnikov et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Sulkowska, et al., 2012</xref>) to determine structure. The combination of site-directed mutagenesis or doped oligonucleotide based synthetic library generation strategies with deep sequencing has expanded our understanding of sequence, structure, function relationships (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Tripathi and Varadarajan, 2014</xref>). High resolution mutational analyses using single-site saturation mutagenesis have facilitated understanding the influence of each residue on a protein’s structure, stability, activity, specificity and fitness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Adkar et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Fowler et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Roscoe et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Tripathi and Varadarajan, 2014</xref>). Expanding this landscape by integrating spatial constraints isolated from paired mutational phenotypes can greatly advance our efforts to construct highly accurate structural models especially where evolutionary information is sparse, because of the paucity of homologous sequences. Unbiased examination of all pairwise mutant combinations is currently not feasible because the large library size cannot easily be sequenced at sufficient depth using deep sequencing (<sup>100</sup>C<sub>2 </sub>× 400 or 2 × 10<sup>6</sup> for a 100 residue protein [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Tripathi and Varadarajan, 2014</xref>]). However, with continuous improvements in deep sequencing and mutant generation technologies this is likely to change soon. The methodology outlined here can be similarly applied to any protein or protein complex where mutation can be coupled to a phenotypic readout. In the two systems studied here, we identified intramolecular suppressors of core packing defects, and active-site mutants were excluded from the set of parent inactive mutants. However, a similar approach can be used to obtain structural information on biomolecular protein:protein complexes. In this case, single-site saturation mutagenesis libraries at active-site residues of one partner would be screened against parent inactive mutants located, at active-site residue of the other partner to identify inter-molecular suppressors. These in turn would provide constraints to build structural models of the complex.</p><p>In these proof of principle studies, mutant identities were determined after single (DgkA) or multiple (CcdB) rounds of screening, using Sanger sequencing. In the case of CcdB, residue burial was accurately inferred exclusively from mutational data. Proximal and distal suppressors could be accurately distinguished based on their mutational sensitivity when present as single mutants and all proximal suppressors were in close contact with the corresponding parent inactive mutant. For other systems it remains to be seen how well this approach will work and how many suppressors will be required for accurate model discrimination. However, as with earlier studies using single mutant libraries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Adkar et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Fowler et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Tripathi and Varadarajan, 2014</xref>), enrichment of mutant pairs at each stage during selection or screening can be monitored using deep sequencing. Using this approach it will be possible to compare phenotypes of large numbers of partial loss-of function single mutants and corresponding double mutants. This data will help distinguish local from global suppressors and provide multiple constraints to guide macromolecular structure prediction and determination. These efforts may prove beneficial in resolving the gap between protein sequence and structure and also in the isolation of mutants with improved stability and foldability, relative to WT.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>A.

It can be deduced from the number of sequencing reads as the MID at which the number of reads for a particular mutant decreases by fivefold or more compared to the previous MID. The MS<sub>seq</sub> values range from 2 to 9, two representing the least sensitive (most active) and nine the most sensitive (least active) mutants. The cumulative number of mutants active at each MS<sub>seq</sub> value was calculated along with their percentage frequency in the population. Mutants with an MS<sub>seq</sub> of two were assigned a rank of one (say, they constitute a% of the total mutant population). For mutants with MS<sub>seq</sub> of three, a rank of a+1 was assigned (say b% of the total mutant population). For mutants with MS<sub>seq</sub> of four, rank of b+1 was assigned. Similarly, ranks are assigned to the remaining mutants. RankScore is the average of assigned ranks of all the available mutants at a position. It combines the protein activity data at various expression levels. A lower RankScore indicates lower mutational sensitivity.

The following criteria were additionally used to select X, that is (i) charged residues (X) were removed (ii) X and Y should not be involved in side-chain hydrogen bonding with each other (iii) X should have ≥2 contact partners in at-least one of the structures (iv) Sequence separation between X and Y, X-Y &gt;30 (v) Y<sub>NMR</sub> – Y<sub>X-ray</sub> &gt;6.</p></sec><sec id="s4-3-2"><title>Cloning, mutagenesis and isolation of parent inactive mutants and their suppresssors</title><p>The gene sequence corresponding to a cysteine-less (C46A/C113A) form of DgkA (referred as WT here) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Van Horn et al., 2009</xref>) along with an upstream 30 bp RBS sequence (CTCGAGCCCGGGGTCGACGGCTCTGCGGGC) was synthesized and cloned between <italic>KpnI </italic>and <italic>PstI</italic> sites in the pBAD-33 vector (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Guzman et al., 1995</xref>), under the AraC promoter at GenScript.

Growth-defective parent inactive mutants (i.e. capable of growth only in media with high osmolarity) were screened by replica plating on selective media (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Wen et al., 1996</xref>) (1% tryptone, 0.5% yeast extract, 0.01% arabinose, 1.6% agar, 34 µg/ml chloramphenicol and 50 µg/ml kanamycin) at decreasing concentrations of NaCl (0.15%, 0.03%, 0.01%, 0.007% and 0%), at 37<sup>o</sup>C for 12–16 hr. Identities of the parent inactive mutants were confirmed by Sanger sequencing. Each parent inactive mutant was used as template to randomize corresponding potential contact partners using the inverse PCR method discussed above, to construct X-ray and NMR structure specific second-site suppressor mutagenesis libraries. Screening of the libraries was carried out on selective media at varying concentrations of NaCl (mentioned above). Probable suppressors were identified as those which appear before the appearance of the corresponding parent inactive mutant on a plate at low NaCl concentration (&lt;0.15%), that is restore the growth defect of the parent inactive mutant. WT DgkA and the empty vector pBAD-33 were used as positive and negative controls, respectively. Second-site putative suppressors were identified by Sanger sequencing at Macrogen, Korea. Fresh transformation of individual suppressors into <italic>E. coli ΔdgkA</italic> strain and comparison of the phenotype with the corresponding parent inactive mutant confirmed the result from the initial screen.</p></sec><sec id="s4-3-3"><title>Co-variation analysis for DgkA</title><p>Alignments of homologous sequences of DgkA were constructed by the jackhammer package of HMMER 3 (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://hmmer.janelia.org/search/jackhmmer">http://hmmer.janelia.org/search/jackhmmer</ext-link>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Finn et al., 2011</xref>) with the number of iterations set to 3, E-value cut-off 1e-6, with a search against the nr database (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/</ext-link>).

Your submission has been favorably evaluated by John Kuriyan (Senior editor) and three reviewers. One of three reviewers has agreed to reveal his identity: Dan Tawfik.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Review:</p><p>The authors present a novel approach to determine 3D contacts in proteins using mutagenesis scans. They demonstrate the value of the inferred 3D contacts by showing their utility in discriminating between inaccurate and accurate 3D models. The experimental methodology involves an initial single mutagenesis scan that is used to identify residue mutations for a secondary mutation scan on that particular background.</p><p>In the case of the bacterial toxin CcdB, the single saturation mutagenesis scan was previously published by themselves (Adkar 2012). In this current work, they choose 5 deleterious mutations, based on a &quot;RankScore&quot; identified in their previous work. On each of the 5 backgrounds they did an exhaustive second site scan to find suppressors; i.e. those mutations that rescue the deleterious effect of the single mutation. They find a total of 10 suppressor mutations and then divide these into those likely to be contacts or not (proximal or distal) based on the RankScore of the suppressor mutation in the single saturation scan. Those secondary mutations with low deleteriousness – low RankScore – in the first scan are assumed to be 3D contacts.</p><p>The idea of using systematic suppressor-mutagenesis for the determination of protein structures is highly appealing, and constantly in 'the air'. Several groups are engaged in such efforts, and this paper may well be the first actual demonstration of what is likely to become a very powerful methodology. Specifically, the prediction demands a large number of sequences, and in such families, crystal structures are more likely to be available anyway. Membrane proteins comprise a particular challenge that this paper addresses.</p><p>Overall, this work is highly valuable, and the mechanisms of suppression are interesting. The manuscript, however, demands some rewriting, and a few critical points need to be addressed or clarified in a satisfactory manner before the paper can be considered acceptable for <italic>eLife</italic>.</p><p>Major concerns that must be addressed:</p><p>1) A key idea underlying the method is the discrimination between proximal and distal suppressor mutants, where the proximal ones will indicate physical contacts. The key result is given in <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>. Based on this Table, 5 positions are mutated and 10 suppressor mutations tested. Thus, the crux of these methods (systematic suppressor mapping) is how to distinguish between distal and proximal suppressors, or global and local suppressors as they are often dubbed. The reviewers are not convinced that the selection criteria applied are objective and generic, namely applicable to any protein. The authors give no justification for the thresholds chosen, and do not show how the results would differ upon changes in these thresholds. The data in <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref> suggest a very clear cutoff (the distant ones having RankScore 1, the contacting ones having ⩾ 26 scores) but the sample of sequences is so small, and this clearcut separation looks too good to be true.</p><p>Also, how do the authors exclude the active site? By checking the structure or blind? If blind the authors need to explain how.</p><p>To summarize, the reviewers are concerned that the classification of the residues in distal or proximal positions requires knowledge of the structure, or at least of the surface exposure. This is a limitation that may not make the method useful for structure prediction (or at least less useful). The revised paper must have a clear justification for the steps taken, explained cogently in the Introduction, and also later as necessary.</p><p>2) The application of the method to discriminate between different conformations of the DgkA multimers is an interesting one. The authors identify differential contacts between the 2 published conformations and present in <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl2">Table 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>. However, some of the contacts identified as unique to one structure are really not at all far away in the other structure – even though closer in the example given. For instance, the M66-A99 minimum atom distance is 6.7 Å and 5.5 Å in the crystal structure 3ZE5 (inter monomers as with the NMR structures) and I67-E34 distance is 5.5 Å in the crystal structure 3ZE5 within the monomers (inter monomers in NMR structures) – therefore neither of these contacts is so unique to the NMR structures despite the domain swap, despite the fact they are closer in the crystal. Similarly, though much closer in the crystal, the min atom distance between V62- A41 (between monomers) in one of the NMR structures is 6.3 Å. Therefore, despite the domain swap, many 3D contacts are common to both structures within a looser definition, and therefore it is not clear that one can be sure that the structures are actually discriminated. It would be useful to tabulate the unique contacts with the minimum atom distance in both the structures including the multimeric assemblies.</p><p>3) The reviewers feel that global suppressors dominate compensation of highly destabilizing mutations, as applied here (e.g. see PMID: 17122770; PMID: 18495157). So the cases explored here, and especially dgkA, whereby all suppressors were local, may not reflect the difficulty of separating local/global in other proteins (e.g. see PMID: 25455030). Thus, the approach taken here need to be explained and justified with more rigor.</p><p>4) Comparison with other methods: The discussion of computational approaches to predict spatially proximal residues seems somewhat biased. It is not clear why EVFOLD, which is now deemed as the most successful method, was not examined. Further, one would like to see a comparison of the structural models offered by EVFOLD and other methods to both the X-ray and NMR structure. Some of these methods will give predictions that unambiguously coincide with the X-ray structure.</p><p>The result of the first test, i.e. selection of structures from a fold library may be less convincing than what the authors argue. The field of protein structure prediction went very deep into the use of decoy libraries to test prediction methods in the late 90's and early 2000's. It was later clear that discriminating structures in those conditions was a quite easy exercise and almost any simple method (i.e. surface exposition prediction) was able to perform well in that type of test. In other words, to be convincing these experiments will have to show that the discrimination is substantially better than the one provided by simple prediction methods.</p><p>To summarize the reviewers’ concerns, if the authors decide to include comparisons to other methods, then the comparisons should be done on fair basis. Two examples may be sufficient to illustrate the point. The prediction methods based on multiple sequence alignments are not specific for any of the proteins in the alignments and therefore it does not make sense to evaluate them in terms of distances between sidechains (that are specific to each structure), as the authors do. Second, and very important, since the publications of those prediction methods it was very clear that they can be applied <italic>only</italic> to rich alignments with thousands of sequences. The current application to small alignments does not demonstrate anything but a known principal limitation of the methods (&quot;350 alignments&quot; as reported in the paper).</p><p>The authors should decide whether or not to present comparisons to other methods in this paper, and present a judicious discussion of the value of their method.</p><p>Other issues to address:</p><p>1) While the rationale of detection of proximal suppressors is clear when it comes to protein stability, the effect on function does not follow this rationale. If you disturb a give side-chain-DNA contact, why would a mutation in an adjacent position compensate for that? Unlike the packing-stability that is accounted for (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>), the mechanistic basis of compensation of functional residues remains therefore unclear. Perhaps the authors should not use &quot;function&quot;, i.e. ligand binding, to illustrate the method (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>) but rather, core-packing compensation.</p><p>2) Introduction, first sentence – “X-Ray crystallography and NMR…”. Cryo-EM is threatening to shadow both.</p><p>3) The Introduction/Discussion overlooks a large body of work that is highly relevant to this one. What the authors dub as systematic suppressor-mutagenesis was done before, often with the aim of unraveling epistatic interactions in proteins in relation to one, or few chosen positions (e.g. PMID: 20975933; 23935519), and sometimes in a systematic manner and in a context that is very similar to the authors (foremost, but not exclusively, PMID: 25455030). We're all prone to cite 'classics' (“Hecht and Sauer, 1985; Machingo et al, 2001; Pakula and Sauer, 1989; Sideraki et al, 2001”) and avoid recent literature that may compromise &quot;novelty&quot; but this does injustice to a lot of very good work, including, eventually, our own. The authors should do a more thorough search and reading, to provide an update picture of experimental explorations of covariance, or epistasis, in individual proteins, and specifically, in support of the claim that: &quot;Though a small number of compensatory mutations were identified, in some cases these were ascertained to be spatially proximal while in others they were distal from the site of the original inactive mutation.&quot;</p><p>4) &quot;In contrast to proximal suppressors, distal suppressors will typically be on the surface of protein and hence the individual suppressor mutation is expected to show WT like activity.&quot; This explanation is very confusing, also because the authors do not use &quot;fitness&quot; terms that would be easier to comprehend. What they mean in effect is that the suppressor mutation is expected to be neutral on its own, and beneficial, or compensatory in combination with the deleterious mutation (PIM in their terminology) – this would be positive sign epistasis in evolutionary terms. The meaning of the next sentence is completely unclear: &quot;Further, unlike proximal suppressors no complementarity relative to the PIM is expected for a distal suppressor.&quot;</p><p>5) RankScore: 'residue depth' – define please, and also 'mutational tolerance'.</p><p>6) Subsection “Application of suppressor methodology to identify the functional conformation of the membrane protein DgkA in-vivo“: V62Q, M66S, M66L, I67V, V68G and W112V were identified as PIMs from screening of SSM – is this from previous work, or this one? If the latter, data need to be provided, and also the criteria for selecting these mutations for the suppressors screen.</p><p>7) The Abstract is somewhat misleading as one gets the impression that all possible compensatory pairs in the target proteins were identified. Upon reading further, it becomes clear that half a dozen deleterious mutations were chosen, and suppressors were identified for this small set. This does not make this work less valuable, on the contrary, it demonstrates its power to obtain structural information by exploring a relatively small number of positions. But it would be best to clarify this point.</p><p>8) One 'trick' of identifying global suppressors is that they in most cases comprise 'consensus/ancestral' mutations (see PMID: 18495157). The authors may wish to consider this as another parameter in their algorithm.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were requested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for resubmitting your work entitled &quot;Residue proximity information and protein model discrimination using saturation-suppressor mutagenesis&quot; for further consideration at <italic>eLife</italic>. Your revised article has been favorably evaluated by John Kuriyan (Senior editor) and three reviewers. The manuscript has been improved but there are some remaining issues that need to be addressed before acceptance, as outlined below:</p><p>Your manuscript has been read and discussed by three reviewers and the editor, and the decision is the work is, in principle, acceptable for publication in <italic>eLife</italic>. There are, however, a number of issues with the manuscript, as written, that can be improved by judicious editing. These issues are outlined below, and we ask that they be addressed in a revised manuscript. The revised manuscript will be handled by the editor, without further external review.</p><p>1) One of the reviewers is still not convinced that the method you use to distinguish between proximal/distal pairs, and to identify active site residues, is robust. You have provided a manuscript that has been submitted elsewhere that addresses the underlying concepts. Please provide a more complete justification for these points in the present manuscript, so that a non-specialist reader can fully understand the logic behind the method. Cite the submitted manuscript as appropriate. Refer to standard methods of analysis where appropriate, rather than to methods developed in your lab.</p><p>2) This reviewer is also not convinced that the superiority of this method is clearly demonstrated by the limited set of decoy calculations done and by the one EV-fold comparison that is provided. On the whole, though, we feel that these comparisons are useful, but you could make it more clear in the manuscript that these are illustrative differences rather than definitive demonstrations of superiority. Please point out limitations of the comparisons.</p><p>3) The manuscript is quite difficult for a non-specialist to follow, and in this way it obscures the innovation and depth of the work. It is essential that the manuscript be edited so that it is accessible to a generally knowledgeable structural biologist or biochemist. Some of the points to note are listed below, but it is recommended that the revised manuscript be read by a seasoned non-specialist colleague, and their advice taken, before being resubmitted to <italic>eLife</italic>.</p><p>A) The manuscript is heavy on long run-on paragraphs that introduce multiple ideas, making it difficult for the reader to follow. Break up the flow into separate paragraphs for each idea, concept or result.</p><p>B) Ideas are introduced out of order, often with highly specific and cryptic information provided before a more general explanation. For example, CcdB is used without explanation first. Later, concerning CcdB, the incomprehensible statement (to a non-specialist) that &quot;This is &lt;5L&quot; is made. Only later is the biological function explained, and the &quot;&lt;5L&quot; statement is never explained. This is but one of several such instances that make the paper difficult for a general audience.</p><p>C) Please avoid the use of inessential abbreviations – we are not under page limits in an online publication. For example, it is highly recommended that &quot;parent inactivating mutation&quot; be spelt out everywhere – the editor sees no reason why this should not be done, and the use of PIM is felt to add to the incomprehensibility of the manuscript. Likewise, why use SSM when it can be spelt out? Why abbreviate yeast surface display with the incomprehensible YSD? The editor asks that you retain only standard abbreviations or gene names.</p><p>D) Please ensure that all metrics are clearly explained to the non-specialist reader. For example, in the subsection “Discrimination between proximal and distal suppressors “&quot;RankScore&quot; is used with no explanation.</p></body></sub-article> <sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.09532.037</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>[…] Overall, this work is highly valuable, and the mechanisms of suppression are interesting.

Active-site residues can be distinguished from buried ones based on the pattern of mutational sensitivity (unpublished data). Mutational sensitivity (MS<sub>seq</sub>) was determined from the sequencing analysis of the single-site saturation library of CcdB (methodology described in (Adkar et al, 2012)). At buried positions (unpublished data), typically most aliphatic substitutions are tolerated. Polar and charged residues are poorly tolerated at buried positions. In contrast, mutations to aliphatic residues are often poorly tolerated at active-site residues (which are typically exposed). Polar and charged residues are sometimes tolerated and also the average mutational tolerance for active-site residues is typically lower than that for buried residues. Mutational tolerance is the fraction of active mutants for each mutant amino acid. This sensitivity to aliphatic substitutions at active-site residues is likely the reason that Ala scanning mutagenesis has been so successful at identifying residues at protein:protein and protein:ligand binding sites (Cunningham and Wells, 1989). Based on the above criteria residues Q2, F3, Y6, S22, I24, N95, W99, G100 and I101 can be identified as putative active-site residues based solely on the mutational data. Similar mutational patterns are seen for two other proteins for which extensive mutational data exist, the PDZ domain (PSD95<sup>pdz3</sup>) (McLaughlin et al, 2012) and the IgG-binding domain of protein G (GB1) (Olson et al., 2014) (unpublished data). In addition to differences in mutational sensitivity patterns, an important difference between active-site and buried-site mutations is that the former typically affect specific activity and not the level of properly folded protein, while the latter primarily affect the level of properly folded protein (Bajaj et al., 2008). Thus measurements of protein levels and possibly sensitivity of mutant activity to chaperone overexpression (Tokuriki and Tawfik, 2009) can also be used to distinguish between active-site and buried-site mutants. The average hydrophobicity and hydrophobic moment (Varadarajan et al., 1996) can also be used as supplementary parameters to distinguish between exposed, active-site and buried-site residues. The above points are included in the subsection &quot;Selection of parent inactive mutant&quot;.</p><p>1.2) Classification of the suppressors as distal or proximal</p><p>In contrast to proximal suppressors, distal suppressors will typically be on the surface of protein (Bank et al., 2015) and hence the individual suppressor mutation is expected to be neutral in the WT background. Further, unlike proximal suppressors no complementarity in amino acid property relative to the parent inactive mutant (PIM) is expected for a distal suppressor. We have shown that the mutational sensitivity measure, RankScore correlates with residue depths derived from the crystal structure of the protein (Figure 4B <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref> of (Adkar et al., 2012)). Residue depth is defined as the distance of any atom/residue to the closest bulk water (Chakravarty and Varadarajan, 1999; Tan et al., 2011). The value for RankScore ranges between 1 to 100. For a given non active-site residue, a higher value of RankScore indicates that the residue is likely to be buried in the protein structure. The plot for variation of RankScore with residue depth is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Author response image 1</xref>. Active-site residues (inferred solely from mutational data) and Gly and Pro residues have been removed. Also, only those residue positions for which data for ≥12 mutants is available are considered.<fig id="fig9" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.09532.029</object-id><label>Author response image 1.</label><caption><title>Plot for variation of RankScore with respect to the residue depth.</title><p>An average depth of ≥ 5.5Å corresponds to an average accessibility of ≤5% (Tan et al., 2014).

Hence, they are likely to be buried in the protein structure and in fact, are buried. It is therefore expected that positions at which local suppressors occur will also have high depth, high RankScores and high average mutational sensitivity in the SSM library (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). From <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Author response image 1</xref>, it is evident that all the positions with low RankScores are exposed on the protein structure. Therefore, all positions with RankScore=1 are very likely to be present on the surface, and hence were classified as distal suppressors. A RankScore of 1 is a conservative cutoff for distal suppressors, probably a cutoff of five or ten would yield similar results. As can be seen from the figure, the RankScore cutoff of 25 which we have chosen for proximal suppressors, clearly identifies only buried residues with depth &gt; 5.5Å. All these residues have accessibility &lt; 1.5%. In the present work we assume that distal suppressors will be global suppressors. Hence, the most reliable way to identify these would be to confirm that the same putative distal suppressor is able to suppress multiple PIMs, preferably PIMs which are not in contact with each other. The latter is likely to be true if neither PIM has a suppressor at the site of the other PIM. Using these criteria we can clearly infer that R10G, E11R, E11K and E11P are likely global suppressors.</p><p>The section in the manuscript on ‘Discrimination between proximal and distal suppressors’ has been modified to include the additional information.</p><p><italic>2) The application of the method to discriminate between different conformations of the DgkA multimers is an interesting one. The authors identify differential contacts between the 2 published conformations and present in <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl2">Table 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>. However, some of the contacts identified as unique to one structure are really not at all far away in the other structure</italic> – <italic>even though closer in the example given. For instance, the M66-A99 minimum atom distance is 6.7 Å and 5.5 Å in the crystal structure 3ZE5 (inter monomers as with the NMR structures) and I67-E34 distance is 5.5 Å in the crystal structure 3ZE5 within the monomers (inter monomers in NMR structures)</italic> – <italic>therefore neither of these contacts is so unique to the NMR structures despite the domain swap, despite the fact they are closer in the crystal. Similarly, though much closer in the crystal, the min atom distance between V62- A41 (between monomers) in one of the NMR structures is 6.3 Å. Therefore, despite the domain swap, many 3D contacts are common to both structures within a looser definition, and therefore it is not clear that one can be sure that the structures are actually discriminated. It would be useful to tabulate the unique contacts with the minimum atom distance in both the structures including the multimeric assemblies.</italic></p><p>It is unclear at this point, what the optimum cutoff distance should be for residue contact identification through suppressor mutagenesis. In the present study, true contacts were identified using a sidechain-sidechain centroid distance ≤7Å as the cutoff, for both X-ray and NMR structures of DgkA (as mentioned in the subsection “ContactScore as a model discriminator”). The NMR structure (2KDC) has co-ordinates for 16 poses. For the figures and distances in the paper we used only the first pose.

So the cases explored here, and especially dgkA, whereby all suppressors were local, may not reflect the difficulty of separating local/global in other proteins (e.g. see PMID: 25455030). Thus, the approach taken here need to be explained and justified with more rigor.</italic></p><p>Section 1.2 above clarifies the basis for the cutoffs used to distinguish between local and global suppressors. We have shown that mutational sensitivity correlates well with residue depths for CcdB (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref> of (Adkar et al., 2012)). We observed a similar high correlation for the PDZ domain (PSD95<sup>pdz3</sup>) (unpublished data). This high correlation of mutational sensitivity with depth would allow distinction of local and global suppressors for other globular proteins as well, as long as the majority of global suppressors lie on the surface. However, little is known about sensitivity to mutation in membrane proteins or natively unfolded proteins. Until such data becomes available we agree that it will be challenging to apply this methodology to these systems.</p><p>In the case of DgkA, we had the much simpler objective of distinguishing between two possible structures. While distinguishing between global and local suppressors maybe more challenging in membrane proteins, given sufficient double mutant data, it should be straightforward because global suppressors should suppress a much larger number of parent inactive mutants (PIMs) than local suppressors. We are currently confirming this by constructing larger double mutant libraries for both CcdB and DgkA. With regard to the relative frequency of global and local suppressors, if a single-site saturation mutagenesis library is enriched for inactive mutants (PIMs), subjected to random mutagenesis and screened for suppressors, the resulting population will be enriched for global suppressors (Bershtein et al., 2008; Bershtein et al., 2006). This is because a global suppressor will suppress multiple PIMs. As described in 1.2 above, this can be used to distinguish between local and global suppressors. However, for a specific PIM, it is not obvious that global suppressors will dominate. A recent study examined a library of the 75 amino acid RRM domain of the yeast poly-A binding protein (Melamed et al., 2013). Functional scores for 1246 single and 39,912 double mutants were obtained. Epistatic interactions were enriched for residue pairs with short sequence spacing (&lt;5) and short distance (10-15Å). Another recent study (Olson et al., 2014) reported exhaustive screening of single and double mutants of GB1 (Olson et al, 2014). The majority of pairs displaying positive epistasis had Cβ-Cβ distances &lt; 8Å. Both of the above studies indicate that local suppressors may occur at higher frequency than global ones with respect to individual PIMs but more data is required to confirm this. This discussion is added to the manuscript in the third paragraph of the Discussion section.</p><p><italic>4) Comparison with other methods: The discussion of computational approaches to predict spatially proximal residues seems somewhat biased. It is not clear why EVFOLD, which is now deemed as the most successful method, was not examined. Further, one would like to see a comparison of the structural models offered by EVFOLD and other methods to both the X-ray and NMR structure. Some of these methods will give predictions that unambiguously coincide with the X-ray structure.</italic></p><p><italic>The result of the first test, i.e. selection of structures from a fold library may be less convincing than what the authors argue. The field of protein structure prediction went very deep into the use of decoy libraries to test prediction methods in the late 90's and early 2000's. It was later clear that discriminating structures in those conditions was a quite easy exercise and almost any simple method (i.e. surface exposition prediction) was able to perform well in that type of test. In other words, to be convincing these experiments will have to show that the discrimination is substantially better than the one provided by simple prediction methods.To summarize the reviewers’ concerns, if the authors decide to include comparisons to other methods, then the comparisons should be done on fair basis. Two examples may be sufficient to illustrate the point. The prediction methods based on multiple sequence alignments are not specific for any of the proteins in the alignments and therefore it does not make sense to evaluate them in terms of distances between sidechains (that are specific to each structure), as the authors do. Second, and very important, since the publications of those prediction methods it was very clear that they can be applied only to rich alignments with thousands of sequences. The current application to small alignments does not demonstrate anything but a known principal limitation of the methods (&quot;350 alignments&quot; as reported in the paper).The authors should decide whether or not to present comparisons to other methods in this paper, and present a judicious discussion of the value of their method.</italic>4.1) EVfold for contact prediction for DgkA</p><p>We thank the reviewers for the suggestion to use EVfold to generate structural models for DgkA.

However, there were other high scoring pairs which were either far apart in the X-ray structure or were in proximity when analyzed with the NMR structure. Overall, as with the other programs tested, the data from EVfold also are clearly more consistent with the X-ray structure. Of the six contacts identified from our suppressor analyses, three (62-41, 67-104 and 68-100) were predicted in the top L/2 co-varying pairs by EVfold (as with GREMLIN and PSICOV).</p><p>The distribution of predicted contact pairs appears better when sidechain-sidechain centroid distances are used (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11">Author response image 3</xref>) rather than when Cα-Cα distances are used (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig12">Author response image 4</xref>) as more number of high scoring pairs are proximal to each other when the sidechain-sidechain centroid distance is computed.

Thus while the EVfold co-variation scores are more consistent with the X-ray structure, the actual 3D structures predicted by EVfold are quite different from both X-ray and NMR structures, possibly because of the complication of modeling a homotrimeric, as opposed to a monomeric structure.<fig id="fig13" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.09532.033</object-id><label>Author response image 5.</label><caption><title>Superimposition of EVfold model onto the (a) X-ray structure (PDB id: 3ZE5) and (b) the NMR structure of DgkA (PDB id: 2KDC).</title><p>EVfold model is shown in tan and the X-ray and NMR structures are shown in light blue.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.09532.033">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.09532.033</ext-link></p></caption><graphic xlink:href="elife-09532-resp-fig5-v2.tif"/></fig></p><p>In accordance with the reviewers’ suggestion we have removed <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref> which shows the co-variation scores for CcdB obtained from a relatively small number of sequences.

R<sub>s</sub> is calculated using the following formula, where ASA<sub>xi</sub> and &lt;ASA<sub>x</sub>&gt; are the accessible surface area values of residue X at position <italic>i</italic> and the average ASA of residue X in a large dataset, respectively (Bahadur and Chakrabarti, 2009).</p><p><inline-formula><mml:math id="inf19"><mml:msub><mml:mi>R</mml:mi><mml:mi>s</mml:mi></mml:msub><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:munderover><mml:mo>∑</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:mi>i</mml:mi><mml:mo> </mml:mo><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mo> </mml:mo><mml:mn>1</mml:mn></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>w</mml:mi><mml:mi>h</mml:mi><mml:mi>o</mml:mi><mml:mi>l</mml:mi><mml:mi>e</mml:mi><mml:mo> </mml:mo><mml:mi>c</mml:mi><mml:mi>h</mml:mi><mml:mi>a</mml:mi><mml:mi>i</mml:mi><mml:mi>n</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:munderover><mml:mfrac><mml:mrow><mml:mo>|</mml:mo><mml:mo/><mml:mi>A</mml:mi><mml:mi>S</mml:mi><mml:msub><mml:mi>A</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mi>x</mml:mi><mml:mi>i</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mo>−</mml:mo><mml:mo>&lt;</mml:mo><mml:mi>A</mml:mi><mml:mi>S</mml:mi><mml:msub><mml:mi>A</mml:mi><mml:mi>x</mml:mi></mml:msub><mml:mo>&gt;</mml:mo><mml:mo>|</mml:mo><mml:mo/></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mo>&lt;</mml:mo><mml:mi>A</mml:mi><mml:mi>S</mml:mi><mml:msub><mml:mi>A</mml:mi><mml:mi>x</mml:mi></mml:msub><mml:mo>&gt;</mml:mo></mml:mrow></mml:mfrac></mml:math></inline-formula>The parameter R<sub>s</sub> was calculated using the above formula for the CcdB decoy set.

The calculations performed using the R<sub>s</sub> parameter have been included in the last paragraph of the subsection “ContactScore as a model discriminator”.</p><p><italic>Other issues to address:</italic></p><p><italic>1) While the rationale of detection of proximal suppressors is clear when it comes to protein stability, the effect on function does not follow this rationale. If you disturb a give side-chain-DNA contact, why would a mutation in an adjacent position compensate for that? Unlike the packing-stability that is accounted for (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>), the mechanistic basis of compensation of functional residues remains therefore unclear. Perhaps the authors should not use &quot;function&quot;, i.e. ligand binding, to illustrate the method (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>) but rather, core-packing compensation.</italic>We chose ‘function’ to illustrate the method in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> because our readout for core packing compensation is a functional readout, i.e., ligand binding for CcdB and cell survival for DgkA. None of our PIMs is at a functional site for precisely the reason mentioned by the reviewers. In the present work we exclude active-site residues when choosing PIMs. The PIMs are present at the protein core and disturb the packing at the core. The resulting decrease in activity is due to a decrease in the amount of properly folded, functional protein in the cell. In the example given by the reviewers, the PIM is at a functional ‘active-site’ residue at a protein:ligand interface. In this situation we would look for a suppressor mutation in the binding partner (DNA in this case) and not an intragenic suppressor. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref> is an overly simplified schematic. To clarify how core residue mutations affect activity we have now included an additional supplementary figure ( <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>).</p><p><italic>2) Introduction, first sentence – “X-Ray crystallography and NMR…”. Cryo-EM is threatening to shadow both.</italic></p><p>We agree and have added an appropriate sentence to the first paragraph of the Introduction. This methodology will be useful for any approach to integrative structure determination, including Cryo-EM.</p><p><italic>3) The Introduction/Discussion overlooks a large body of work that is highly relevant to this one. What the authors dub as systematic suppressor-mutagenesis was done before, often with the aim of unraveling epistatic interactions in proteins in relation to one, or few chosen positions (e.g. PMID: 20975933; 23935519), and sometimes in a systematic manner and in a context that is very similar to the authors (foremost, but not exclusively, PMID: 25455030). We're all prone to cite 'classics' (“Hecht and Sauer, 1985; Machingo et al, 2001; Pakula and Sauer, 1989; Sideraki et al, 2001”) and avoid recent literature that may compromise &quot;novelty&quot; but this does injustice to a lot of very good work, including, eventually, our own. The authors should do a more thorough search and reading, to provide an update picture of experimental explorations of covariance, or epistasis, in individual proteins, and specifically, in support of the claim that: &quot;Though a small number of compensatory mutations were identified, in some cases these were ascertained to be spatially proximal while in others they were distal from the site of the original inactive mutation.&quot;</italic></p><p>We apologize for the omissions and have included additional citations and discussion of other published work, including the references mentioned above. The additional references are cited in the Introduction section and in the Discussion section.</p><p><italic>4) &quot;In contrast to proximal suppressors, distal suppressors will typically be on the surface of protein and hence the individual suppressor mutation is expected to show WT like activity.&quot; This explanation is very confusing, also because the authors do not use &quot;fitness&quot; terms that would be easier to comprehend. What they mean in effect is that the suppressor mutation is expected to be neutral on its own, and beneficial, or compensatory in combination with the deleterious mutation (PIM in their terminology)</italic> – <italic>this would be positive sign epistasis in evolutionary terms. The meaning of the next sentence is completely unclear: &quot;Further, unlike proximal suppressors no complementarity relative to the PIM is expected for a distal suppressor.&quot;</italic></p><p>We have included a sentence along the lines suggested by the reviewers to the subsection “Discrimination between proximal and distal suppressors”. The next sentence has also been modified to “Further, unlike proximal suppressors no complementarity in amino acid property relative to the PIM is expected for a distal suppressor.”</p><p><italic>5) RankScore: 'residue depth'</italic> – <italic>define please, and also 'mutational tolerance'.</italic></p><p>These definitions for ‘residue depth’ and ‘mutational tolerance’ are added in the sixth paragraph of the Introduction and in the Materials and Methods section.</p><p><italic>6) Subsection “Application of suppressor methodology to identify the functional conformation of the membrane protein DgkA in-vivo“: V62Q, M66S, M66L, I67V, V68G and W112V were identified as PIMs from screening of SSM – is this from previous work, or this one? If the latter, data need to be provided, and also the criteria for selecting these mutations for the suppressors screen.</italic></p><p>The residues V62, M66, I67, V68 and W112 all have differential contacts in the X-ray and NMR structure and hence were chosen as sites for introducing PIMs. The details are described in the Methods section in the subsection “Identification of differential contacts”. Briefly, each of the above residues was individually randomized and the resulting small libraries were screened for inactive mutants. Charged and aromatic substitutions were excluded from the finally selected PIMs as we thought they would be highly destabilizing and it might not be possible to obtain suppressors. Phenotypic data for all selected PIMs and their suppressors are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2</xref>. The only exception is the PIM W112V for which no suppressor was obtained.</p><p><italic>7) The Abstract is somewhat misleading as one gets the impression that all possible compensatory pairs in the target proteins were identified. Upon reading further, it becomes clear that half a dozen deleterious mutations were chosen, and suppressors were identified for this small set. This does not make this work less valuable, on the contrary, it demonstrates its power to obtain structural information by exploring a relatively small number of positions. But it would be best to clarify this point.</italic></p><p>The Abstract has been modified to clarify this point.</p><p><italic>8) One 'trick' of identifying global suppressors is that they in most cases comprise 'consensus/ancestral' mutations (see PMID: 18495157). The authors may wish to consider this as another parameter in their algorithm.</italic></p><p>We thank the reviewers for this suggestion and have mentioned this in the Discussion section. The CcdB consensus sequence was obtained from a multiple sequence alignment (MSA) of 350 homologs using MATLAB and the ancestral sequence was obtained using the FastML server (Ashkenazy et al., 2012). The likely global suppressors we obtained in the present study are R10G, E11R and E11K. At R10 the ancestral and consensus amino acids are P and R respectively and at E11 they are A and N respectively. Hence, at least for these two positions, the ancestral/consensus amino acids were different from the experimentally obtained suppressors. Further experiments are required to ascertain whether the ancestral/consensus amino acids will also act as global suppressors.</p><p>References:</p><p>Tan KP, Khare S, Varadarajan R, Madhusudhan MS (2014) TSpred: a web server for the rational design of temperature-sensitive mutants.

We have also included an additional Figure, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref> with representative mutational data at active-site, buried and exposed, non-active site positions. The mutational criteria to distinguish between proximal and distal suppressors work for at least three proteins CcdB, PDZ domain (PSD95<sup>pdz3</sup>) and the IgG-binding domain of protein G (GB1). How well these will work for other proteins remains to be seen. In addition, since it is likely that distal suppressors will be global suppressors, they will suppress parent inactive mutants at multiple residue positions, including ones which are not in contact with each other. Hence putative distal suppressors can be introduced into the background of multiple parent inactive mutants to confirm that these are indeed global (and therefore distal) suppressors. This is mentioned in the aforementioned subsection. We have largely referred to standard methods of analysis wherever possible. The submitted manuscript has been cited as ‘unpublished work’ since we still do not have confirmation on when and where it will eventually be published.</p><p><italic>2) This reviewer is also not convinced that the superiority of this method is clearly demonstrated by the limited set of decoy calculations done and by the one EV-fold comparison that is provided.

All their suggestions, as well as those of the <italic>eLife</italic> reviewers, have been incorporated.</p><p><italic>A) The manuscript is heavy on long run-on paragraphs that introduce multiple ideas, making it difficult for the reader to follow. Break up the flow into separate paragraphs for each idea, concept or result.</italic></p><p>Done.</p><p><italic>B) Ideas are introduced out of order, often with highly specific and cryptic information provided before a more general explanation. For example, CcdB is used without explanation first. Later, concerning CcdB, the incomprehensible statement (to a non-specialist) that &quot;This is &lt;5L&quot; is made. Only later is the biological function explained, and the &quot;&lt;5L&quot; statement is never explained. This is but one of several such instances that make the paper difficult for a general audience.</italic></p><p>Changes have been appropriately made to introduce ideas in their proper context.</p><p><italic>C) Please avoid the use of inessential abbreviations</italic> – <italic>we are not under page limits in an online publication. For example, it is highly recommended that &quot;parent inactivating mutation&quot; be spelt out everywhere</italic> – <italic>the editor sees no reason why this should not be done, and the use of PIM is felt to add to the incomprehensibility of the manuscript. Likewise, why use SSM when it can be spelt out? Why abbreviate yeast surface display with the incomprehensible YSD? The editor asks that you retain only standard abbreviations or gene names.</italic></p><p><italic>D) Please ensure that all metrics are clearly explained to the non-specialist reader. For example, in the subsection “Discrimination between proximal and distal suppressors “&quot;RankScore&quot; is used with no explanation.</italic></p><p>The use of abbreviations has now been minimized except in the case of a few figures where space is limited. Even in those cases, the abbreviation is clearly explained in the figure caption. All metrics are explained and additional sections have been added to the start of the Methods section for this purpose.</p></body></sub-article> </article>
