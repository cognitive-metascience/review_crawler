pro-kinetic and anti-kinetic effects of dopamine and acetylcholine release, respectively. However, the natural, movement-related signals of striatum cholinergic neurons and their relationship to simultaneous variations in dopamine signaling are unknown. Here, functional optical recordings in mice were used to establish rapid cholinergic signals in dorsal striatum during spontaneous movements. Bursts across the cholinergic population occurred at transitions between movement states and were marked by widespread network synchronization which diminished during sustained locomotion. Simultaneous cholinergic and dopaminergic recordings revealed distinct but coordinated sub-second signals, suggesting a new model where cholinergic population synchrony signals rapid changes in movement states while dopamine signals the drive to enact or sustain those states.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>striatum</kwd><kwd>acetylcholine</kwd><kwd>dopamine</kwd><kwd>optical recording</kwd><kwd>in vivo</kwd><kwd>motor control</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01MH110556</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Dombeck</surname><given-names>Daniel A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100005270</institution-id><institution>McKnight Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Dombeck</surname><given-names>Daniel A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>T32 AG20506</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Howe</surname><given-names>Mark</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Optical recordings reveal previously unknown neuromodulator dynamics in the striatum during animal movements that suggest a new interpretation of the underpinnings of bradykinetic movements exhibited in Parkinson's Disease patients.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Striatum cholinergic interneurons (ChIs) have long been recognized as critical for normal functioning of the basal ganglia in the control of movement and in learning and responding to motivational and salient stimuli (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Apicella et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Apicella et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Apicella et al., 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Collins et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Kimura et al., 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Kondabolu et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Schulz et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Kaneko et al., 2000</xref>). Although they comprise a small proportion of the total cell population (~1–3%) in striatum (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Kimura et al., 1980</xref>), they are believed to contribute to debilitating motor and cognitive symptoms in a range of disorders including Parkinson’s Disease (PD) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">McGeer et al., 1961</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Barbeau, 1962</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Tanimura et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Bordia et al., 2016a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Bordia et al., 2016b</xref>). Anti-cholinergic (muscarinic) drugs are recognized as the earliest treatment capable of alleviating some of the debilitating movement deficits characteristic of PD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">McGeer et al., 1961</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Barbeau, 1962</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Tanimura et al., 2018</xref>). This clinical observation led to the hypothesis that loss of dopaminergic (DA) innervation to the dorsal striatum from the substantia nigra pars compacta (SNc) in PD disrupts a dynamic balance between acetylcholine and dopamine signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Barbeau, 1962</xref>). Targeted manipulations of dorsal striatal ChIs in rodents, either pharmacologically or optogenetically, produce changes in behavior roughly consistent with this hypothesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Kondabolu et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Kaneko et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Bordia et al., 2016b</xref>). Unilateral ablation of ChIs results in ipsilateral turning behavior opposite to the effects of unilateral DA terminal lesions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Kaneko et al., 2000</xref>). Bilateral optogenetic stimulation of dorsal striatum ChIs reduces gross spontaneous locomotion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Kondabolu et al., 2016</xref>) (an effect counter to stimulation of DA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Howe and Dombeck, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">da Silva et al., 2018</xref>]), while optogenetic inhibition can alleviate motor deficits of L-DOPA induced dyskinesias in rodent PD models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Bordia et al., 2016b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Maurice et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Ztaou et al., 2016</xref>). These findings suggest that cholinergic signaling opposes the pro-kinetic actions of dopamine in the striatum. However, while naturally occurring signaling patterns of DA input to the striatum during movement have been described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Howe and Dombeck, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Patriarchi et al., 2018</xref>), signaling in cholinergic interneuron networks, and the precise coordination between ChI and DA signaling occurring during movements, remain unclear.</p><p>In behaving rodents and primates, extracellular single-unit recordings of tonically active, putative ChIs (TANs) have revealed rapid (&lt;200 ms latency), synchronized responses to salient, neutral and positive and negative conditioned stimuli and to primary rewards and punishments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Apicella et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Apicella et al., 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Kimura et al., 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Aosaki et al., 1994a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Ravel et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Ravel et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Morris et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Apicella, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Blazquez et al., 2002</xref>), but rarely to spontaneous movements. Stimulus evoked TAN responses often consist of an initial pause in firing rate (occasionally preceded by a short burst of firing) followed by a burst in firing rate. The magnitude and duration of the pause/burst is modulated by learning and depend in some cases on the nigrostriatal dopamine system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Ravel et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Aosaki et al., 1994b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Aosaki et al., 1995</xref>). These findings indicate that striatum ChI signaling may play a role, along with DA, in modulating long term plasticity for goal directed learning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Aosaki et al., 1994b</xref>). Based on recordings and manipulations, TAN bursts and pauses to conditioned and salient sensory stimuli have also been proposed to drive rapid attentional orienting, goal-directed action, and set-shifting (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Collins et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Ding et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Aoki et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Aoki et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Atallah et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Tzavos et al., 2004</xref>). Experimental evidence directly linking cholinergic interneuron signaling to rapid changes in movement has been less common. Two studies in freely moving rodents have described heterogeneous positive and negative responses in dorsal and ventral striatum TANs aligned to movements during a reward-directed instrumental task (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Yarom and Cohen, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Benhamou et al., 2014</xref>). In primates, TANs do not generally respond to simple cued arm movements, but one study described small responses to self-timed movements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Lee et al., 2006</xref>) and another showed a relationship between cue evoked TAN responses and the probability to respond in eye blink conditioning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Blazquez et al., 2002</xref>). Another described TAN modulation that varied with the force required for cued arm movements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Nougaret and Ravel, 2015</xref>). However, it remains unclear whether these movement-related TAN responses reflect instrumental task contingencies, cue responses or changes in movement per se. Moreover, in-vivo extracellular unit studies have been limited in their ability to discriminate true ChI responses from other striatal cell types (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Atallah et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Gage et al., 2010</xref>). Thus, it remains unclear how or whether ChIs participate in spontaneous movement control independently of discrete action-outcome contingencies, outcome predicting cues, or salient external stimuli.</p><p>The effects of ChI signaling on striatal microcircuits and dopaminergic afferents have been investigated intensively in vitro and through manipulations in vivo. From these studies, a complex picture has emerged in which ChIs are capable of bi-directionally influencing cell-type specific excitability of both medium spiny projection neurons (SPNs) and striatal interneurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Goldberg et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Lim et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Oldenburg and Ding, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Higley et al., 2009</xref>) and can directly alter the release probability from dopaminergic terminals on relatively rapid timescales (10 s-100s of ms) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Di Chiara et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Threlfell et al., 2012</xref>). Ach release can also modulate long term pre and post-synaptic plasticity (minutes to days) on SPNs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Wang et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Lee et al., 2016</xref>). In turn, SPNs, interneurons, and DA afferents, along with excitatory glutamatergic inputs from thalamus and cortex provide powerful and rapid modulation of the cholinergic interneurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Aosaki et al., 1994b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Ding et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Di Chiara et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Matsumoto et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Raz et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Straub et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Witten et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Zhang et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Zucca et al., 2018</xref>). These extensive input/output connections provide enormous possibilities for ChIs to exert positive and negative feedback on striatal circuits. Determining the circuit dynamics of ChIs resulting from all of these mechanisms and the relation of the dynamics to movement control and learning will require large-scale measurements of cholinergic interneuron networks and other circuit elements, including DA inputs, which coordinate closely with ChI signaling.</p><p>Electrophysiological measurements of naturally occurring ChI signaling in behaving animals have to date been limited to only a few (typically 2–4) putative ChIs recorded simultaneously and are challenged by difficulties in reliable cell identification. Here, we address this limitation by utilizing 2-photon calcium imaging and fiber photometry in conjunction with genetic cell type specific labeling to measure signaling across the ChI population and from up to 15 identified single ChIs simultaneously in the dorsal striatum in head-fixed, mobile mice. We describe previously unknown rapid, transient signals across the ChI population and in single neurons locked to onsets of spontaneous locomotion, short jerky movements, and to locomotor ‘resets’ in the absence of salient stimuli or reward prediction. We show that movement initiations are marked by highly synchronous transients across the cholinergic interneuron network, but that synchrony (but not single-neuron activity) diminishes significantly as mice transition to continuous locomotion. We then establish a new approach to measure <italic>simultaneous</italic> dynamics in both ChIs and dopaminergic projection axons to the dorsal striatum, which demonstrates precise sub-second coordination of dopaminergic and cholinergic signals in relation to spontaneous movement. This coordination varies dynamically as a function of the animals’ behavioral state, suggesting that dopamine and acetylcholine may act both synergistically and competitively to regulate different aspects of movement. From these results, we propose a new model where cholinergic population synchrony signals rapid changes in movement states while dopamine signaling provides rapid drive to enact and sustain new movement states. These findings provide insight into how spontaneous movement is regulated by neuromodulator dynamics in the striatum and suggest new possibilities for how DA/Ach interactions occur at the circuit level during behavior.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>To determine whether and how populations of dorsal striatum ChIs signal spontaneous changes in movement, independently of task contingencies, we first performed acute fiber photometry in Chat-cre mice (n = 20 mice, 1–3 sessions/mouse) expressing GCaMP6f (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Chen et al., 2013</xref>) specifically in cholinergic interneurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A,B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A–D</xref>). Mice were head-fixed with their limbs resting on a cylindrical treadmill and spontaneously transitioned between periods of movement and rest (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A–B</xref>). Very little change in ChI population signaling was observed when mice were at rest but positive going transients were consistently elevated during spontaneous movement (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B–C</xref>; mean DF/F, p&lt;1e-19 Wilcoxon rank-sum test). ChI population signals increased rapidly and reliably approximately 100 ms prior to spontaneous movement onsets from rest (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E–F</xref>). Very small ‘micro’ movements occurring at velocities and accelerations below our rest threshold did not elicit significant ChI responses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1E</xref>). Broadly, movement onsets from rest could be classified into two types: transitions to continuous locomotion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B,G,K</xref>) and short duration ‘jerks’, consisting of rapidly terminated forward and backward movements (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B,H,L</xref>). Significant elevations in ChI signaling were observed for both of these movement onset types with similar timing and amplitudes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G,H</xref>). A gradual decrease in ChI signal to baseline was observed at locomotion terminations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B,I,M</xref>). During continuous, high velocity locomotion periods, significantly less transient signaling was present relative to movement onset periods (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B,D</xref>; p&lt;0.01 Wilcoxon rank-sum test), though transient signaling during these periods was greater than during rest (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B,D</xref>; p&lt;3e-13, Wilcoxon rank-sum test). The largest ChI transients (top quartile) occurring post-onset were associated with large accelerations at low velocity, corresponding to movement resets in ongoing locomotion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B,J,N</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1F</xref>) where the mouse rapidly transitioned to near rest then re-accelerated to resume locomotion. Less signal change was associated with accelerations occurring during high velocity, continuous locomotion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1F</xref>). ChI movement related signals were observed in the absence of task contingencies, changes in salient sensory stimuli, and before any exposure to rewards (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1G–H</xref>). These results demonstrate that transient dorsal striatum ChI population signals reflect rapid transitions in internally generated spontaneous movement, from rest to movement or during resets in locomotion, independently of changes in reward prediction or experimentally generated salient stimuli.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.44903.002</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Cholinergic interneuron populations are rapidly activated at spontaneous movement onsets.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Schematic of experimental setup.

Delivery of unpredicted water rewards through a spout near the animals’ mouth elicited responses in dorsal striatum ChIs, that on average, consisted of a short latency increase followed by a small decrease aligned to the audible solenoid click associated with water valve opening (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). While reminiscent of the previously reported burst/pause observations, this response was variable and both the increase and decrease were not reliably present across individual trials (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>). In contrast, ventral striatum ChIs exhibited robust and consistent increases on nearly every trial following reward delivery (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D,I</xref>).</p><p>Mice displayed changes in movement at the reward delivery time that varied depending upon the movement state (running or resting) prior to consumption, we therefore examined whether the timing and direction of movement changes could account for the variability in dorsal and ventral striatum ChI responses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F–H,J–L</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1B</xref>). When reward was delivered at rest, mice briefly moved their bodies to initiate consumption from the water spout (brief acceleration; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G,K</xref>). When rewards were delivered during movement, mice rapidly decelerated to initiate consumption (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G,K</xref>). The dorsal striatum ChI response was significantly positively correlated with these changes in velocity at reward delivery (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F–H</xref>, R = 0.48, p&lt;1.7e-8) but the response in ventral striatum was not (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2J–L</xref>, R = −0.17, p=0.06). Consistent with this result, when responses were re-aligned to the time at which consumption began (first detected spout lick after the change in movement), the dorsal striatum ChI response diminished, while the ventral ChI response remained (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1B</xref>). In fact, the ventral ChI response increase on average preceded the first lick, indicating a contribution of reward prediction associated with the solenoid click (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1B</xref>). These data indicate that dorsal and ventral ChIs exhibit different responses to unpredicted rewards and that changes in movement at reward consumption could account for much of the dorsal striatum ChI population response. This differential expression of spontaneous movement and unpredicted reward responses across the dorsal-ventral axis parallels that reported for striatum dopamine signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Howe and Dombeck, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Parker et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>Notably, we did observe a prominent triphasic increase/decrease/increase signal in dorsal striatum ChIs to a conditioned visual stimulus paired with reward similar to those described in recordings of TANs with electrophysiology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Aosaki et al., 1994a</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1C,G</xref>). This response could not be fully explained by changes in movement (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1D,G</xref>), indicating that dorsal striatum ChIs do display a response to conditioned cues that is at least partly independent of movement changes. Ventral ChIs, in contrast, exhibited a sustained increase at the CS onset and a sharp increase at the delivery of the predicted reward (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1E–G</xref>) consistent with other rodent ventral TAN recordings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Atallah et al., 2014</xref>). Moreover, ventral ChIs exhibited a small increase after movement onsets for sessions after experience with unpredicted rewards (but not before, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A</xref>), indicating that ventral ChIs are not sensitive to spontaneous movement per se but may be influenced by changes in reward prediction that coincide with changes in movement, a property also present in ventral striatum dopamine signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Ko and Wanat, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Syed et al., 2016</xref>) and midbrain cell body firing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Coddington and Dudman, 2018</xref>).

These new findings indicate that DA and ChI population transients during locomotion likely reflect general changes in movement state, rather than the kinematics of specific limbs. Moreover, they provided the opportunity to simultaneously compare the relative timing and amplitude of the dorsal striatum DA signals in one hemisphere with the ChI signals in the other by unilaterally expressing GCaMP6f in midbrain DA neurons and in ChIs in the opposite hemisphere (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C,H,I</xref>; DAT/ChAT cre mice, n = 8). Notably, peak cross-correlations between signals from dorsal striatum ChIs and contralateral DA axons was significantly lower than for DA/DA or ChI/ChI bilateral comparisons regardless of which hemispheres the ChI/DA axon signals were recorded (p&lt;1e-10, Wilcoxon rank-sum test; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5J</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1A</xref>). In addition, the peak and trough in the DA/ChI cross correlations were significantly phase offset from 0 in all recordings (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C,H,I,K</xref>; mean peak lag +114 ms, mean trough lag −180 ms), regardless of hemisphere (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1B</xref>). The peak in correlation at positive lag indicates an increase in dopamine lagging an increase in ChI signal. These timing offsets between ChIs and DA axon signals could not be attributed to different calcium dynamics between the subcellular compartments recorded (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5M</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1C–D</xref>). Simultaneous recordings from dopaminergic SNc cell bodies and DA axons from the same hemisphere were correlated at near zero phase lag (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5L,M</xref>) indicating that the DA/ChI timing differences are unlikely to be accounted for by axon transmission delays, which are estimated to be less ~15 ms for DA axons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Pissadaki and Bolam, 2013</xref>). Finally, very little signal and low correlations were detected from the striatum contralateral to the SNc injected hemisphere in DAT-cre mice injected unilaterally (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5N–O</xref>; No Chl labeling), indicating little contribution from contralateral SNc projections or from other sources such as intrinsic fluorescence. These results establish a new approach for simultaneously monitoring DA and ChI signaling in striatum on sub-second timescales during behavior and indicate that DA axon terminals and ChIs exhibit different relative timing and amplitude variations relative to spontaneous movement.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig5" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.44903.010</object-id><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><title>Cross-hemisphere synchrony permits simultaneous comparison of DA and ChI signals during spontaneous movement.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Representative z-score normalized population signals from GCaMP6f expressing DA axons recorded in the left and right hemispheres in the dorsal striatum of a DAT-cre mouse.

Both signals were correlated similarly to rapid changes in acceleration during locomotion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D</xref>, indicating a slight lag between rapid acceleration and increases in ChI or DA signal). However, DA and ChI populations were correlated very differently with velocity: DA signaling showed a positive peak correlation with velocity at near zero phase lag, while ChI signals showed a negative trough in the correlation at positive lags (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7E</xref>). These findings indicate that velocity increases during continuous locomotion were associated with a coordinated increase in DA signal followed by a decrease in ChI population synchrony (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figures 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">7F–G</xref>). Conversely, decreases in velocity were associated with decreases in DA signal, followed by increases in ChI synchrony (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7F,H</xref>).

These data indicate that fluctuations in running speed during continuous locomotion are associated with divergent patterns of dorsal striatum ChI and DA network activity. Increases in the speed or vigor of ongoing locomotion were associated with increases in DA population signals followed by drops in ChI population synchrony associated with movement state transitions. Velocity decreases, in contrast, were marked by coincident decreases in DA population signal, followed by increases in ChI synchrony as movement state transitions became more likely (locomotion resets and terminations).

This regulation is believed to occur through the complex action of acetylcholine on striatal projection neurons and via direct and indirect interactions with the nigrostriatal dopamine system. Despite the clear importance of striatal cholinergic and dopaminergic signaling for normal movement, the naturally occurring signaling patterns of cholinergic interneurons and their relationship to dopaminergic signals during ongoing behavior have remained unclear. Using a combination of cellular resolution imaging and population recording approaches with genetically encoded calcium indicators in behaving mice, we have shown that dorsal, but not ventral, striatum cholinergic interneuron populations exhibit rapid, transient signaling locked to transitions in spontaneous movement. These population signals were the result of widespread transient synchronization of ChIs across large regions of the dorsal striatum, which dropped off independently of single cell activity after successful transitions to continuous locomotion. By measuring cholinergic and dopaminergic signals simultaneously, we established that these neuromodulator systems, while both related at a gross level to rapid movement changes, displayed both coordinated and divergent signals depending on the nature of the movement. This data supports a model in which dopamine and acetylcholine are not purely competitive, but can participate both independently and cooperatively in ongoing movement control, with cholinergic population synchrony signaling rapid changes in movement states and dopamine signaling providing rapid drive to enact and sustain new movement states (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1F</xref>).</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>Transient cholinergic interneuron population synchrony marks movement state transitions</title><p>Transient increases in ChI population synchrony were associated with transitions from rest to movement and ‘resets’ in ongoing locomotion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>).

In further support of this idea is the observation that transient synchrony dropped off dramatically as mice ran at higher velocities, despite similar limb recruitment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">4</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">7</xref>). Movements requiring lateralized body part activation (such as turns) may recruit asymmetric patterns of cross hemisphere activation, as for striatal principle neurons ( <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Cui et al., 2013</xref>), but the movements tested here likely involved similar bi-lateral limb recruitment. ChI responses to movements were expressed in the absence of experimentally generated salient or reward predictive cues, rewards, or task contingencies, establishing them as uniquely related to changes in internally triggered spontaneous movement. Prior studies in primates have described very little response in TANs to movements per se (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Apicella et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Apicella et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Apicella et al., 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Kimura et al., 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Ravel et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Ravel et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Morris et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Aosaki et al., 1994b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Nougaret and Ravel, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Matsumoto et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Apicella, 2002</xref>), while studies in rodents described some TAN responses to task-related movements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Yarom and Cohen, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Benhamou et al., 2014</xref>). One possibility for this species discrepancy is the nature of the movement types being performed (cue triggered single arm or eye movements vs internally triggered whole body locomotor movements). Also, movement responses may be less apparent in firing rate changes of single cells relative to across large synchronous populations. We hypothesize that synchronous ChI network activations support rapid changes or reconfigurations in the striatum network that can facilitate general, internally triggered changes in movement state (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1F</xref>).

In dorsal striatum ChI populations, we report the presence of a short latency increase, followed by a decrease to unpredicted water rewards (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>), which was even more pronounced to reward predictive stimuli (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1C,D,G</xref>).

However, we were able to detect rapid decreases below baseline in dorsal ChI populations to conditioned cues (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1C,D,G</xref>). The dorsal-ventral gradient in unpredicted reward and spontaneous movement signaling in ChIs resembled that previously reported for dopamine axons in the striatum (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Howe and Dombeck, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Parker et al., 2016</xref>). Thus, neuromodulator systems exhibit parallel functional differences across the dorsal ventral striatum axis, in line with proposed functional roles of the dorsal and ventral striatum in movement control and reward-learning respectively.</p></sec><sec id="s3-4"><title>Synchrony across ChIs determines the population signal and varies with behavior</title><p>Two-photon imaging of populations of dorsal striatum ChIs was performed to determine how movement related signals were expressed across networks of single neurons. ChIs exhibited widespread, highly synchronous transients at movement onsets involving neurons separated by 100 s of microns (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). This high degree of network synchrony dropped off with distance between cells and is consistent with recordings from pairs of TANs showing synchronous pauses to stimuli (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Morris et al., 2004</xref>). Interestingly, synchrony across ChIs decreased significantly below baseline resting levels following transitions to ongoing locomotion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4H,I</xref>), while single cell transient amplitude and frequency did not significantly decrease (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref>). Thus, synchrony is not a fixed property of cholinergic networks but varies dynamically with respect to ongoing behavior. The degree of synchrony, but not the magnitude of signals from individual cells, corresponds with the prominent transients measured by photometry, an observation that may apply generally to bulk photometry recordings (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). In this case, summation of asynchronous transients from single ChIs during continuous locomotion would not result in detectable transient changes in population photometry measures. Widespread synchrony in ChI networks is an important determinant of nicotinic receptor mediated pre-synaptic dopamine release from axon terminals and could impact oscillatory network dynamics and enhance the strength of post-synaptic cholinergic modulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Kondabolu et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Lim et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Threlfell et al., 2012</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3-5"><title>Coordinated and divergent cholinergic and dopaminergic movement signaling in dorsal striatum</title><p>Interplay between dopaminergic input from SNc and local cholinergic modulation in striatum has long been hypothesized to play a role in the proper control of movement drive. A leading model is that dopamine and acetylcholine compete for ongoing movement control, where dopamine is pro-kinetic and acetylcholine is anti-kinetic. Disruption of this balance in favor of acetylcholine is believed to contribute to akinesias observed in Parkinson’s Disease, a hypothesis consistent with clinical and behavioral studies. Mechanistic studies have provided a more complex, often contradictory, view of cholinergic circuit effects on multiple time-courses and spatial scales (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Lim et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Oldenburg and Ding, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Threlfell et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Thorn and Graybiel, 2010</xref>) which does not strictly support a purely anti-kinetic, dopamine competition model. To clarify how dynamic DA and Ach interactions contribute to movement drive, we measured simultaneous calcium transients from ChI populations and dopaminergic axons in the striatum during spontaneous, unrewarded locomotor movements (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figures 5</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">7</xref>). We found that, while both displayed rapid signaling during changes in movement, DA and ChI population signaling deviated significantly during certain movement phases, but were coordinated during others. These results suggest a new model in which DA and ChI signals are associated with different aspects of movement and may act both cooperatively and competitively depending on when signals are expressed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7F</xref>).</p><p>Recent studies on the activation of DA neurons and terminals, have provided evidence for movement related activation and inhibition under different task conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Howe and Dombeck, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">da Silva et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Coddington and Dudman, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Dodson et al., 2016</xref>). Our results suggest that these seemingly conflicting findings may be partly explained by differences in the types of movements examined. Here we show that dorsal striatum DA terminal signals, in the absence of learned reward contingencies, increased at transitions to locomotion but decreased below rest levels at the onset of short, rapidly terminated movements (jerks; similar to many of the short movements examined recently (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Coddington and Dudman, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Dodson et al., 2016</xref>); <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). This pattern contrasted with ChI populations, which increased synchronous signaling just prior to any transition to whole-body treadmill movement, regardless of whether locomotion was initiated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). Because of this bi-directional DA activation and the presence of spontaneous DA transients during rest, DA signals were less predictive (though still predictive) of general movement onsets than the ChI population synchrony transients (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E–F,I–M</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1A–B</xref>). Thus, although optogenetic stimulation of DA projections to dorsal striatum can promote movement initiations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Howe and Dombeck, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">da Silva et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Barter et al., 2015</xref>), DA transients <italic>alone</italic> are likely not sufficient to trigger movement initiations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Howe and Dombeck, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Coddington and Dudman, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Saunders et al., 2018</xref>). DA driven invigoration of locomotion likely occurs when the DA stimulation is properly timed with other striatal signals, such as synchronous ChI transients or activation of projection neurons, which directly promote changes in movement state. Such an interpretation is consistent with the on-average increase in rapid locomotion initiation probability we observed previously in response to DA stimulation, and also consistent with the trial-by-trial and session-by-session variability in the effectiveness of the stimulation to promote locomotion observed in the same study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Howe and Dombeck, 2016</xref>).</p><p>We propose that rapid DA signals at movement onsets signal the drive to enact or invigorate a triggered movement (movement initiation → locomotion) or to increase or decrease the vigor of that movement once initiated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1F</xref>). Synchronous ChI network transients at rest, on the other hand, signal rapid changes in the current movement state (rest → movement initiation) and transients after initiation signal resets in ongoing locomotion or termination (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1F</xref>). Similar to dopamine, the causal impact of synchronous ChI signals on behavior is likely not purely deterministic in isolation, but could participate in conjunction with coincident dopaminergic, glutamatergic, and local GABAergic inputs to modulate the final output from SPN populations to facilitate movement transitions. While these DA terminal and ChI population signals are clearly subject to independent modulation in part, perhaps through different sets of inputs, the close correspondence of ChI and DA terminal increases at locomotion initiations suggest the possibility for direct feedforward amplification of DA terminal signals by synchronous ChI networks, as described in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Threlfell et al., 2012</xref>). An alternative hypothesis is that transient ChI signals are anti-kinetic and compete with pro-kinetic DA signals for movement control. However, this is not consistent with our observation of large ChI signals associated with locomotion onsets (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). Future targeted manipulation studies and simultaneous recordings will be required to elucidate the causal mechanisms responsible for the observed dynamics and their impact on striatal circuitry and behavioral output.</p><p>This framework of DA and ChI signaling during movement provides a dynamic foundation for interpreting studies implicating dorsal striatum acetylcholine in set switching and orienting to cues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Apicella et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Kimura et al., 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Ding et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Aoki et al., 2015</xref>) and with dopamine in regulating movement vigor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">da Silva et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Panigrahi et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Niv et al., 2007</xref>). However, it is seemingly at odds with studies showing pro-kinetic effects of cholinergic block on Parkinson’s symptoms and the anti-kinetic effects of cholinergic neuron stimulation on gross locomotion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Kondabolu et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Barbeau, 1962</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Bordia et al., 2016b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Maurice et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Ztaou et al., 2016</xref>). One possibility is that synchronous ChI signaling in the absence of DA signaling becomes anti-kinetic because it promotes movement state changes without the accompanying movement drive. DA signaling following movement initiations may facilitate smooth transitions to locomotion, in part, by desynchronizing the ChI networks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Raz et al., 1996</xref>), reducing the probability of changing or terminating movement after initiation. Without ChI desynchronization and the drive to invigorate the new movement state provided by DA, artificial stimulation of ChI cells (with optogenetics) may induce continuous state changes such as slow, jerky movements if the stimulation is delivered at rest or stopping if delivered during locomotion. Similarly, Parkinson’s patients may exhibit jerky, bradykinetic locomotor patterns in part because synchronized ChI signaling is not accompanied by DA signals which desynchronize (change promoting) ChI networks and enable transitions to stable continuous movement.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Stereotaxic virus injections</title><p>All experiments were approved by the Northwestern University Animal Care and Use Committee.

Rotational velocity of the treadmill was sampled at 1000 Hz by a rotary encoder (E2-5000 US Digital) attached to the axel. All mice were acclimated to the treadmill for 2–4 days until they exhibited consistent, spontaneous transitions between movement (jerks or continuous locomotion) and rest.

On the day of recording, the Kwik-Sil was removed and 200 µm diameter optical fibers (two fibers for bilateral recordings, Doric) were slowly lowered into the dorsal striatum (+0.5 mm rostral,±1.8 mm lateral from bregma) using a table mounted micro-manipulator (Sutter) while mice were head-fixed on the treadmill. The custom designed fiber photometry system was previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Howe and Dombeck, 2016</xref>). Briefly, excitation light (488 nm diode laser, 0.6–0.8 mW power at the fiber tip) was delivered continuously and emitted population GCaMP6f fluorescence was filtered and measured with a GaAsP PMT (H10770PA-40, Hamamatsu). The PMT output was sampled at 1 kHz and synchronized with the velocity output from the rotary encoder using an oscilloscope and associated software (Picoscope 4824). Continuous recordings in the dorsal (1.7–2.1 mm depth from surface) or ventral striatum (3.8–4.4 mm depth) were carried out over multiple depths (1-3) in a given day (1–3 days/mouse) and each comprised a 3–6 min behavior period. Not all recordings met behavior criteria to be included in all analyses (see Data Analysis).

After recovery from surgery, mice were water scheduled and acclimated to the treadmill. Imaging began after the window surface had cleared of any blood and cellular debris (typically 5–7 days post-surgery). Imaging was performed by a custom, table-mounted two photon microscope (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Heys et al., 2014</xref>). Laser power after the objective (Olympus LUMPlanFL N, 40X, 0.8 NA and UMPLFLN, 20X, 0.5 NA) ranged between 50 and 150 mW (920 nm or 800 nm for control <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1G</xref>), but this was likely significantly lower at the sample because of clipping of the excitation light by the cannula. A Digidata1440A (Molecular Devices) data acquisition system was used to record (Clampex 10.3) and synchronize reward timing, licking, wheel velocity, and two-photon image frame timing. Time series movies (5,000–15,000 frames) were acquired at 30 Hz (1024 or 512 × 512 pixels) and field sizes ranged from 100 to 700 µm in diameter.

Fluorescence time series from fiber photometry were binned into 10 ms bins (100 Hz sampling) and raw fluorescence was converted to DF/Baseline F. A baseline for each bin was initially calculated as the 8<sup>th</sup> percentile fluorescence over a 16 s sliding window around the bin, excluding fluorescence values above a threshold visually determined for each session to include significant positive-going transients. Each baseline value was then corrected to account for the fiber and tissue autofluorescence measured from the cortex in that same session (BaselineF - F from autofluorescence). Significant positive-going transients were identified by calculating the minimum duration for positive events of varying standard deviation magnitudes (1–6 + SD above mean) at which the fraction of positive to negative events exceeded 0.99 (p&lt;0.01 probability of event resulting from random noise fluctuations or movement artifact induced false transient). These duration thresholds were calculated across all photometry recordings, then applied individually to each session. The same procedure was used to identify significant positive-going transients for each single-cell ROI in our 2-photon datasets. Z-score normalization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figures 6I–J</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">7G–H,K</xref>) was calculated relative to the mean and standard deviation across all rest bins (see below) for each session.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Classification of spontaneous treadmill behavior</title><p>All sessions and mice were included in behavioral analyses unless they did not contain treadmill movements meeting the criteria described here.

To reduce the possibility of small movements preceding the onset, no absolute velocities exceeding 0.2 cm/s could be present within a 0.5 s period prior to the movement onset. Micro-movements falling below this threshold did not elicit detectable changes in the ChI signal and likely fell in the noise range of our rotary encoder (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1E</xref>).

Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Laura Colgin as the Senior Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>Previous studies have indicated critical roles of cholinergic interneurons (ChIs) in the striatum in movement and learning. However, how ChIs regulate movement remain elusive. To address this issue, Howe and colleagues examined the activity of ChIs in the striatum during spontaneous movements. The authors used fiber photometry and single cell 2-photon calcium imaging to monitor the activity of ChIs. The authors show that ChIs exhibit synchronous activation at the onset of locomotor activity while the activity decreased during continuous movements. Interestingly, the movement-onset related signals were more prominent in the dorsal, compared to the ventral, striatum, whereas the ventral striatum contained more reliable signals for reward-related events than the dorsal striatum. In addition, the authors compared the simultaneously recorded activity of ChIs and dopaminergic inputs using bilateral fiber photometry from the dorsal striatum. The results indicated that the activity of ChIs is correlated with a rapid change in movement (movement state transitions) regardless of whether it is associated with continuous movement. By contrast, dopamine transients occurred predominantly at transitions to locomotion while rapidly-terminated short movements ('jerks') were associated with a decrease in activity. From these results, the authors propose a new model in which ChIs marks movement state transitions while dopamine signals the drive to enact or invigorate a triggered movement.</p><p>The reviewers thought that this study provides the most comprehensive and interesting assessment to date of cholinergic interneuron activity and its relationship to dopamine signaling and movement. All the reviewers thought that this study provides novel and important insights into the role of ChIs in movement controls. The manuscript is comprehensive and well written. There was, however, some disagreement among the reviewers as to the overall impact of the work. For instance, one reviewer thought that the conclusion is weak because the literature points to more roles of ChIs in learning than in movements, and the temporal resolution of the calcium indictor (GCaMP) limits mechanistic conclusions about the how these signals come about and how they interact. During discussion, it was pointed out that the authors discuss previous literature on the role of ChIs in movement, and the author's observation of tri-phasic signals in response to salient events which are consistent with single-unit recording provides some assurance of the resolution of the present method. Other reviewers also raised some interpretational concerns that need to be addressed. We would like to see the authors’ response to these issues before publication of this work at <italic>eLife</italic>.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Detailed histology is needed. We would like to see histology to know where the fibers or cannulae implanted in the dorsal and ventral recording sites were (those are huge targets!). In addition, while we appreciate the example images demonstrating overlap between ChAT immunofluorescence and GCaMP fluorescence in dorsal and ventral striatum, example images are not sufficient – the specificity (and penetrance) of GCaMP expression for ChAT+ neurons should be quantified within each area in multiple brain slices/animals.</p><p>2) The last sentence of the Abstract states that transient cholinergic signaling without dopamine input may lead to bradykinetic movements. This is an interesting and easily testable hypothesis. A few sentences later in the Introduction, the authors mention that bilateral optogenetic stimulation of ChIs reduces spontaneous locomotion, which seems quite at odds with the statement from the Abstract. It appears odd that the authors finish the Abstract with a statement that seems to be contradicted several sentences later by previous data.</p><p>3) Given the previous literature on the cholinergic pause and its potential role in attention, and the remarkable pause observed during &quot;resets&quot; which could correspond to periods in which the animal may be pausing to assess some kind of internal or external state change, it would be useful to have a bit more discussion about pauses.</p><p>4) Given the authors previous work (Howe and Dombeck, 2016) in which optogenetic activation of dopamine neurons leads to short latency onset of locomotion (within 100-200ms), it was intriguing to see here that dopamine transients occurring with low ACh did not elicit locomotion (Figure 6L). It would be useful for the authors to at least comment on this, particularly with regard to their previous data (e.g. did the authors find previously that optogenetic activation of dopamine axons only led to locomotion on some trials?).</p><p>5) One reviewer provided a more critical overall evaluation on this work than the other reviewers: &quot;The temporal resolution of GCaMP6f, as used here, is too limited to draw clear mechanistic conclusions about how these signals come about and how they interact. The lack of any behavioral task makes it very hard to infer the functional significance of the signals they observe. The conceptual model they propose is not very conceptual, but more like a descriptive re-statement of the correlations they observed. For these reasons I did not feel that the work provides a substantial advance in our understanding of this circuitry.&quot; Please provide your response to these criticisms.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.44903.021</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Detailed histology is needed.

Expression was widespread and only a very small number of false positives were found across three animals and multiple slices quantified (Figure 1—figure supplement 1, mean 2.7% false positives in dorsal and 1.7% in ventral). This small proportion is likely to be an overestimate as strict criteria were applied to identify ChAT/GCaMP+ cells. We have also added a representative coronal brain section showing the track of the optical fiber (Figure 1—figure supplement 1B and additional schematic sections highlighting the range of cholinergic interneuron and dopamine terminal recording locations within the striatum (all photometry recordings were performed within the highlighted regions; Figure 1—figure supplement 1A). The cannulae location and size used here was the same as in Howe and Dombeck, 2016 (Extended Data Figure 2I).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) The last sentence of the Abstract states that transient cholinergic signaling without dopamine input may lead to bradykinetic movements.

Synchronous ChI population transients were most prominent around the onsets of movement and at locomotion ‘resets’, regardless of whether locomotion was successfully initiated and maintained (Figure 1G, H and Figure 6I, J). ChI transients were highly predictive of rest to movement transitions (more so than DA, Figure 6—figure supplement 1A, B). Synchrony and large population transients in ChIs were diminished during transitions to stable, continuous locomotion, as DA signals increased (Figures 1 and 4H). Based on these findings, we hypothesize that synchronous ChI transients may drive changes in movement state, while DA signaling and the accompanying desynchronization of ChI populations serves to enact or maintain those states (i.e. locomotion, Figure 7—figure supplement 1). Artificial synchronous stimulation of ChIs would thus be predicted to generate a state of constant ‘state’ transitions which would prohibit sustained locomotion and perhaps lead to slow, jerky movements from rest. Alternatively, ChI signals at movement onsets may compete with pro-kinetic movement signals (though this possibility is not well supported by our data, Figure 6). Previous studies were limited to coarse assessments of locomotion (Kondabolu et al., 2016) so may not have been sensitive to rapid state dependent alterations in movement patterns, such as the jerks described here. Future manipulation experiments with careful behavioral analyses will be needed to conclusively test these alternatives. Because of the detail required to explain our hypothesis, and the differences compared to the previous optogenetic studies, we have deleted the statement in the Abstract and instead present our hypotheses (with added clarification) in the Discussion section (subsection “Coordinated and divergent cholinergic and dopaminergic movement signaling in dorsal striatum”).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Given the previous literature on the cholinergic pause and its potential role in attention, and the remarkable pause observed during &quot;resets&quot; which could correspond to periods in which the animal may be pausing to assess some kind of internal or external state change, it would be useful to have a bit more discussion about pauses.</p></disp-quote><p>We have added additional discussion and references about pauses to the Discussion section (subsection “Transient cholinergic interneuron population synchrony marks movement state transitions”). However, the pause cited by the reviewers at resets (we assumed they are referring to Figure 1J) may partly be a result of our selection criteria for significant transient onset alignment (the signaling by definition must be near baseline prior to a transient onset); though we agree that there does appear to be a slight dip just prior to the transient increases in some cases (see example in Figure 1B and Figure 1—figure supplement 1F). Moreover, the reviewers’ idea that brief ChI pauses (followed by rebound bursts) during ongoing behavior may trigger internal behavioral resets, similarly to how (pause/burst) responses to external sensory stimuli may elicit behavioral state changes, is an interesting possibility.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) Given the authors previous work (Howe and Dombeck, 2016) in which optogenetic activation of dopamine neurons leads to short latency onset of locomotion (within 100-200ms), it was intriguing to see here that dopamine transients occurring with low ACh did not elicit locomotion (Figure 6L). It would be useful for the authors to at least comment on this, particularly with regard to their previous data (e.g. did the authors find previously that optogenetic activation of dopamine axons only led to locomotion on some trials?).</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate the opportunity to address this important point. Our previous work (Howe and Dombeck, 2016) found that stimulation of dopaminergic terminals in the dorsal striatum could rapidly (~200ms) increase the probability of mice initiating locomotion from rest. However, while this was significant on average and often on the individual stimulations within a session, the effectiveness of the stimulation to promote locomotion varied significantly across mice, sessions, and trials (i.e. not every stimulation led to locomotion initiation, see for example the lack of locomotion initiation in a few of the stimulations in Figure 3D of Howe and Dombeck, 2016, and locomotion was not induced with stimulation in every session, see for example the lack of locomotion initiation in some sessions in Figure 3E of Howe and Dombeck, 2016). Moreover, the stimulations were conducted in mice which had been pre-exposed to the treadmill and exhibited regular transitions between locomotion and rest (Howe and Dombeck, 2016, Methods). Thus, it seems likely given our current findings on the involvement of Chls, that dopamine terminal stimulations were most effective in promoting transitions to locomotion when they happened to coincide with spontaneous elevations in ChI signaling (and likely other cell types). By this view, our stimulation of dopamine terminals actually served to boost drive or enact a spontaneous change in movement, rather than triggering the movement per se. We have added discussion in the main text to clarify this important issue (subsection “Coordinated and divergent cholinergic and dopaminergic movement signaling in dorsal striatum”, second paragraph).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) One reviewer provided a more critical overall evaluation on this work than the other reviewers: &quot;The temporal resolution of GCaMP6f, as used here, is too limited to draw clear mechanistic conclusions about how these signals come about and how they interact.”</p></disp-quote><p>We presume that the reviewer is pointing out that we cannot say conclusively with calcium imaging whether there is a direct interaction between the measured DA terminal and ChI signals which generates the behavioral dynamics we describe. Indeed we are careful not to make any firm claims about direct interactions or cellular mechanisms. We agree that GCaMP6f signaling alone cannot establish mechanistic causality in the same way that electrophysiological work in vitro can. However, the point of the study and the value of the calcium imaging approaches we have utilized is to establish the natural fluctuations of DA and ChI signaling on the &lt;~100s of ms timescale during behavior, which is currently unknown and may contribute to the ongoing regulation of movement. This is an essential step towards establishing the dynamic roles of these neurotransmitter systems and constrains the range of mechanisms (described in vitro) which may be responsible for generating these dynamics. The &lt;~100ms temporal resolution provided by GCaMP6f (see Chen et al., 2013) is more than adequate to provide insight into the co-regulation of DA terminal and ChI activity in dorsal striatum. For example, we find that ChI signals at movement initiations are followed (within &lt;100ms) by elevations in DA terminal signaling at locomotion onsets. This is consistent with the possibility of synchronous ChI signals positively modulating DA terminal activity (as described in vitro e.g. Threlfell et al., 2012). However, this modulation does not appear to be deterministic (i.e. every synchronous ChI event leads to elevated DA signaling) during behavior because ChI signals at the onsets of rapidly terminated jerks are associated with decreases in DA terminal signaling (Figure 6J), indicating partially independent control of ChI and DA terminal signaling. This was unknown before our GCaMP6f study. Of course, future work, possibly using targeted manipulations and neuromodulator specific sensors to directly measure release (e.g. Patriarchi et al., 2018), will be necessary to establish the precise mechanisms responsible for the dynamics we observe.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>“The lack of any behavioral task makes it very hard to infer the functional significance of the signals they observe.”</p></disp-quote><p>We chose to study ChI and DA terminal signaling during spontaneous movement because both of these neurotransmitters have been shown in animals and in humans with clinical disorders to be involved in the non-task dependent modulation of movement drive. This involvement is not explicitly dependent on instrumental aspects of goal-directed behavior or on Pavlovian cues (the most common types of task historically used to study these systems). Humans with dysfunction of dorsal striatum neuromodulator signaling (such as in Parkinson’s Disease) exhibit general (non task-specific) movement deficits. Experimental manipulations (lesions, pharmacology, optogenetics) of DA and ChI signaling in animal models likewise alter basic aspects of movement drive such as the probability of initiation and ongoing movement vigor. Finally, a number of recent in vivo recording studies have also provided support for the role of dorsal striatum ChI and DA signaling in the ongoing control of (internally generated) spontaneous movement (e.g. Howe and Dombeck, 2016, Dodson et al., 2016, DaSilva et al., 2018). Our work has addressed the critical, unresolved question of how naturally occurring neuromodulator dynamics in the striatum contribute to general aspects of ongoing movement drive. We avoided an instrumental or Pavlovian task design to isolate signaling related to the initiation and maintenance of spontaneous movement from potentially confounding variables such as sensory cues or internally generated reward predictions. However, we note that we did employ a behavioral task (classical conditioning paradigm) to confirm the existence of previously described signaling in ChIs related to reward predictive cues (Figure 2—figure supplement 1). Further studies will be required to determine how the signals we have described are modulated during goal-directed instrumental tasks.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>“The conceptual model they propose is not very conceptual, but more like a descriptive re-statement of the correlations they observed.”</p></disp-quote><p>We included the schematics in Figure 7—figure supplement 1 to visually summarize the results and hypotheses outlined in the Discussion.
