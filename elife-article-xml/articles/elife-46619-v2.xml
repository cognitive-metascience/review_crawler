Does the brain achieve this understanding by running simulations in a mental physics engine, which represents variables such as force and mass, or by analyzing patterns of motion without encoding underlying physical quantities? To investigate, we scanned participants with fMRI while they viewed videos of objects interacting in scenarios indicating their mass. Decoding analyses in brain regions previously implicated in intuitive physical inference revealed mass representations that generalized across variations in scenario, material, friction, and motion energy. These invariant representations were found during tasks without action planning, and tasks focusing on an orthogonal dimension (object color).

This intuitive understanding of physics develops early and in a consistent order in childhood; infants can differentiate liquids from solids by 5 months of age (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Hespos et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Hespos et al., 2016</xref>), infer an object’s weight from its compression of a soft material by 11 months (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Hauf et al., 2012</xref>), and use an object’s center of mass to judge its stability on the edge of a surface by 12 months (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Baillargeon, 1998</xref>). By adulthood, human physical reasoning is fast and rich, and it generalizes across diverse real-world scenarios. Yet little is known about the brain basis of intuitive physics, which could enable direct tests of computational models by revealing the relevant neural representations and their invariances and automaticity.</p><p>A key distinction between computational models of intuitive physics is whether they use model-free pattern recognition (such as deep neural networks) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Lerer et al., 2016</xref>), or causal generative models of physical object representations and their dynamics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Battaglia et al., 2013</xref>). The generative approach models physical reasoning as approximate probabilistic inference over simulations in a physics engine, an architecture with two core parts: an object-based representation of a 3D scene (which encodes many static variables, such as the size and mass of each object), and a model of physical forces that govern the scene’s dynamics. These models may make use of deep neural networks, but also contain additional structured information about the world. Unlike the pattern recognition approach, the generative framework entails extraction of abstract representations of physical concepts and laws that support generalization, mirroring the human capacity to reason about novel physical scenarios without training. Within this framework, simulation-based models can make robust inferences with accuracy comparable to human performance across many areas of physics, including collisions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Smith et al., 2013a</xref>), (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Smith et al., 2013b</xref>), fluid dynamics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bates et al., 2015</xref>), the motion of granular materials (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Kubricht et al., 2016</xref>), and predictions about the outcome of applied forces (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Ullman et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Hamrick et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>A recent fMRI study has implicated specific regions in the parietal and frontal lobes in intuitive physical inference in humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Fischer et al., 2016</xref>). These regions responded more strongly during a physical reasoning task (which direction a tower of blocks will fall) than a difficulty-matched non-physical discrimination performed on the same stimuli, and more strongly during viewing of animated shapes depicting physical interactions of inanimate objects than social interactions of agents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Fischer et al., 2016</xref>). The candidate regions for intuitive physical inference found in this study resemble regions previously implicated in action planning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Johansson and Flanagan, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Gallivan et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Evarts and Thach, 1969</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Loh et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chouinard et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">van Nuenen et al., 2012</xref>) and tool use (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Gallivan et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Brandi et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Valyear et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Goldenberg and Hagmann, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Goldenberg and Spatt, 2009</xref>), consistent with the importance of physical understanding for these functions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Cant and Xu, 2012</xref>). However, crucially, it is unknown what these regions represent about physical events. A pattern recognition approach to physical reasoning might predict that the neural representations in these regions would hold information about low-level visual features or situation-specific representations of physical variables. In contrast, if these regions support a generalized engine for physical simulation, we would expect to find that they hold representations of abstract physical dimensions that generalize across scenario and other physical dimensions.</p><p>To answer this question, we conducted three experiments using fMRI to test the generalizability and automaticity of neural representations of a key variable underlying physical reasoning: mass. Mass is not the only physical variable of interest, but it is the most basic scalar quantity that captures a property of all objects and that governs motion in every physical interaction, via Newton’s second law. Hence it is a natural first candidate to probe representationally in neural circuitry putatively instantiating a mental physics engine. Participants were scanned with fMRI while performing physical inference, prediction, and orthogonal tasks on visually-presented stimuli. Each scanning session began with two runs of a previously developed ‘localizer’ task (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref>) to identify in each subject individually candidate regions engaged in physical reasoning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Fischer et al., 2016</xref>). We then we applied pattern classification methods to fMRI data obtained from subjects viewing videos of dynamic objects, to test for invariant representations of mass in these regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Fischer et al., 2016</xref>), as predicted if they implement a causal generative model of the physical world.</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Stimuli and tasks from Experiments 1 and 2.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) Toppling tower task (adapted from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Fischer et al., 2016</xref>) used as a localizer for all experiments. Still frames show an example tower from two different viewpoints during the 360° pan video. Participants were asked in different blocks to determine which side the tower would fall toward (red versus green), or whether the stimulus contained more blue or yellow blocks. (<bold>b</bold>) Stills extracted from example mass inference videos used Experiments 1 and 2 (top is extracted from early in video, bottom from later).

Each run (4 per subject) presented 36 videos in randomized order (144 total trials with each video presented 4 times), each followed by a 1 s response period (‘Light or Heavy?”) then a rest period of variable duration (mean 6 s). (<bold>d</bold>) Experiment 2 used a block design to compare decoding during physics and color blocks. Each run (6 per subject) consisted of 5 color blocks, 5 physics blocks, and 4 (12s) rest blocks. 6 videos were shown in each block (360 total trials with each video presented 5 times in a physics block and 5 times in a color block).</p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-46619-fig1-v2.tif"/></fig></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Experiment 1: mass inference</title><p>We began by asking whether object mass could be decoded from neural activity in previously-described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Fischer et al., 2016</xref>) candidate physics regions while participants performed a mass inference task. Six subjects were scanned using fMRI while viewing 3 s movies of real objects interacting in various physical scenarios: splashing into a container of water, being blown across a flat surface by a hairdryer, and falling onto the soft surface of a pillow (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1b</xref>). Three rigid 3D shapes of equal volume were used (a rectangular prism, a cone, and a half-sphere), and movies were filmed for two different colors and two different masses (45 g, 90 g) of each shape (36 total movies). Visual cues from the scene could be used to infer the mass of each object, which was never explicitly stated. After each movie, subjects responded to a text prompt (‘Light or Heavy?”) with a button press indicating their inferred mass (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1c</xref>). Accuracy on this task was 88% (i.e., percentage of responses matching the ground truth outcome) across six subjects.</p><p>We first identified the set of parietal and frontal voxels implicated in physical inference in each subject individually using the localizer task (see Materials and methods). We then applied multivariate decoding analyses to fMRI responses in the main experiment to each stimulus of each voxel in that set. To test for situation-invariant mass decoding, linear SVMs were trained on the responses to two of the scenarios (e.g., ‘splash’ and ‘blow’), and tested on the third (‘pillow’). This situation-invariant decoding was significant in the candidate physics system, with a group mean accuracy of 0.64 (p=0.0304, two-sided t-test, t-statistic = 2.9913, df = 5, significance threshold = 0.05). Critically, this representation of object mass does not depend on whether the object is splashing into water, being blown by a hair dryer, or being dropped onto a pillow. Mean classification accuracies across all three scenarios as well as classification accuracies for each left out scenario individually were greater than 50% in each subject. Further, mass representations are not confounded with shape or color, as colors and shapes were represented in equal proportions for both masses in the training and testing data. Decoding could also not be based on the amount of motion in the videos, as heavy objects caused more motion in two of the conditions (splash, pillow), but did not move at all in the third (blow; see Materials and methods). Finally, decoding could not be based on specific motor responses, because the assignment of buttons to responses was switched halfway through the experiment, with equal an equal number of trials per button-press-to-response assignment represented in training and testing data.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Experiment 2: mass decoding during color judgment</title><p>Experiment 1 suggests we can decode an abstract, generalizable representation of mass from candidate physics regions, but two questions remain. First, does mass encoding occur even if not required by the task? Second, an alternative account of our apparent ability to decode object mass is that we may be decoding instead a prepared response to the explicit mass task (‘Light or Heavy?”), which is constant across scenarios. Note that our mass decoding could not simply reflect decoding of a literal motor plan, as the assignment of response meanings to button presses was switched halfway through the experiment, but the hypothesis remains that in Experiment 1 we were decoding an abstract response code invariant to the specific motor plan it would later be translated into. To test this hypothesis, as well as the automaticity of the mass representation, we used a design that interleaves blocks of the mass task and a color task on the same stimuli. This design enabled us to ask whether a situation-invariant mass representation can also be decoded from multivoxel activity during blocks where subjects perform the orthogonal color task where mass was not relevant. Subjects viewed the same stimuli used in Experiment 1, and were prompted both at the beginning of each block and after each video to respond whether the object was ‘Light or Heavy?’ or ‘Red or Orange?’ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1d</xref>).</p><p>In six new subjects, we replicated the findings of Experiment 1: mean situation-invariant decoding accuracy of 0.63 (across scenarios) was significantly above chance (p=0.0357, two-sided t-test, t-statistic = 2.853, df = <italic>5</italic>), and decoding was found in 6 out of 6 subjects individually during the mass task (task accuracy 87%). More importantly, mass decoding was also significantly above chance (mean = 0.61, p=0.0033, two-sided t-test, t-statistic = 5.2576, df = <italic>5</italic>), and present in each subject individually, during the color task. This result shows that mass is represented even when the task does not require it, and further that the decoding of mass we observe cannot be explained as an abstract response code. Further evidence against the idea that the mass representations reflect response codes comes from the fact that color decoding from the same voxel activity during the color task was at chance in all subjects. Thus the candidate physics engine does not represent all task-relevant dimensions and may be more specific to physical variables.</p><p>However, the results of Experiment 2 do leave open the possibility that a context effect from the mass blocks carried over to and created biases on color blocks, contributing to mass decoding during the color task. This motivated our design of a third experiment to test mass decoding in an experiment where subjects were never asked about mass.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Experiment 3: physical prediction in a collision task</title><p>We asked in Experiment 3 whether mass could be decoded from candidate physics brain regions during a physical prediction task that requires mass knowledge but never explicitly interrogates it. We created 48 real-world movies. Each 6 s video shows an object (made of aluminum, cardboard, lego, or cork) sliding down a ramp and colliding with a puck (half-ping-pong ball), whose initial location is consistent between videos (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2b</xref>). In the task, subjects answer (as immediately as possible) whether they predict the sliding object will launch the puck across a black line, which can lie in three different locations. The mass of the object and its coefficient of friction determine how far it will launch the puck. Importantly, these stimuli were designed in a way that orthogonalizes mass, friction, and motion in the videos (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2a</xref>), allowing us to test whether it is possible to decode a generalized representation of mass invariant to friction and motion. Each of the four different materials was used to make two objects, a 2.5” cube and a 2.5”x 2.5”x1.25” object with half of the volume of the cube and the same surface area in contact with the ramp. Materials were chosen with densities such that same-volume objects made out of aluminum and cardboard have the same mass (15 g for the small volume 30 g for the large volume), and same-volume objects made from lego and cork have the same mass (45 g or 90 g), while pairs along the other invariance dimension (aluminum and legos, cardboard and cork) share similar coefficients of friction with the ramp (aluminum: <italic>μ<sub>k</sub></italic>=0.21, lego: <italic>μ<sub>k</sub></italic>=0.22; cardboard: <italic>μ<sub>k</sub></italic>=0.40, cork: <italic>μ<sub>k</sub></italic>=0.46). Accuracy in the prediction task was 71% across 20 subjects.</p><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Experiment 3 design.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) Schematic of stimulus design and ramp scenario.

Further, this experiment demonstrates an important new invariance of these mass representations beyond those already found in Experiments 1 and 2: the mass decoding in Experiment 3 required generalization across the friction and material of the object shown (lego to cork for heavy, and cardboard to aluminum for light), as well as generalization across the amount of motion in the videos (calculated by measuring the amount of optical flow; see Materials and methods). To minimize the difference in eye movements across trials, participants were instructed to fixate on a black cross in the center of the screen during each video. Eye movements were recorded for 6 subjects, to verify that subjects were fixating and to ensure that mass decoding was independent of eye movement (see Materials and methods). A two-way ANOVA with mass and friction as repeated-measures factors revealed no significant effects at the .05 significance level of mass or friction on mean eye position (mass: F<sub>1,3</sub> = 0.084, p=0.79; friction: F<sub>1,3</sub> = 0.31, p=0.62) or mean saccade amplitude (mass: F<sub>1,3</sub> = 0.28, p=0.63; friction: F<sub>1,3</sub> = 0.46, p=0.55), so it is unlikely that eye movements could explain our decoding results.</p><p>We next tested whether object mass could be decoded from regions beyond candidate physics fROIs, namely, regions in the ventral visual pathway outside traditional motor and premotor areas shown to represent object weight during action planning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Gallivan et al., 2014</xref>). Following Gallivan et al., we used a localizer task (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Cant and Xu, 2012</xref>) based on the contrast of object textures and ensembles versus their scrambled counterparts, to identify LO and texture-sensitive regions of OTC in six participants completing the ramp task in the same session. Although these subjects showed reliable decoding of a mass representation invariant to friction, material, and motion in candidate physics regions during the physical prediction task (Experiment 3), this invariant decoding did not reach significance in LO (p<italic>=</italic>0.39) or in OTC (p<italic>=</italic>0.67) during the same task. While the parietal and frontal regions previously implicated in intuitive physics are recruited to compute an abstract representation of mass useful in a generalized model of physics, regions in the ventral stream, canonically associated with visual pattern recognition, may be recruited to infer object mass tied to scene- and task-specific cues such as the visual appearance of object material.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>Analyses across all experiments</title><p>We used all data (two runs per subject) from the toppling towers localizer to perform a whole-brain random-effects group analysis for the physics &gt;color contrast (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>).

In everyday physical reasoning, humans are able to use visual cues in a single scene to infer physical properties of an object that can be generalized to predict the object’s dynamics in novel scenes, plan actions upon the object, and make inferences about similar but unfamiliar objects. Here we present the first neural evidence of a mass representation underlying physical reasoning with invariance that supports this kind of flexible, generalizable navigation of the physical world. Among current computational models, those that best exhibit this capacity for generalization are structured generative models such as physics engines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Battaglia et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Yildirim et al., 2019</xref>), supporting the hypothesis that the network of frontal and parietal fROIs we identify implements in some form a causal generative model of physical objects and their dynamics.</p><p>To date, neural representations underlying physical reasoning have only been studied in action planning tasks. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Gallivan et al. (2014)</xref>. used multivariate decoding methods to find, in multivoxel activity patterns during action planning, representations of object mass in ventral visual pathway areas, specifically the lateral occipital complex (LO), posterior fusiform sulcus (pFs), and texture-sensitive regions of occipitotemporal cortex (OTC), in addition to motor cortex (M1) and dorsal premotor cortex (PMd), where mass information for action planning is known to be represented (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Johansson and Flanagan, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Evarts and Thach, 1969</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Loh et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chouinard et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">van Nuenen et al., 2012</xref>). Our work goes beyond prior studies reporting neural decoding of mass in two key respects. First, prior studies have provided evidence for representations of mass (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Johansson and Flanagan, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Gallivan et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Evarts and Thach, 1969</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Loh et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chouinard et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">van Nuenen et al., 2012</xref>) only when participants are performing action planning tasks. In contrast, we show that these representations are available when subjects are not asked about mass per se, for instance in the ramp task where mass is relevant to the task but not explicitly reported, and in the color task where mass is not relevant at all. Second, and more importantly, prior studies have decoded representations of mass only within a particular stimulus or scenario, whereas our study finds abstract representations of mass that generalize across scenarios and are invariant to friction, material, and motion. It is the abstractness and invariance of the mass representations reported here that suggests they reflect not just another dimension of visual pattern classification, but the generalizability expected of inputs to a physics engine in the brain.</p><p>These invariant representations of mass are found in a network of frontal and parietal regions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>) that we suggest support machinery for a neural physics engine. Similar frontal and parietal regions have been implicated in thinking about physical concepts presented as words (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Mason and Just, 2016</xref>), supporting the hypothesis that this network represents abstract, generalizable physical concepts rather than low-level visual features or situation-specific representations of physical variables. We did not find invariant mass representations in ventral visual pathway areas such as LOC and OTC (in tasks not requiring action planning), suggesting that LOC may not play a causal role in computing object weight. This supports previous findings by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Buckingham et al. (2018)</xref>, which showed that a patient with bilateral lesions including LOC had a preserved ability to judge object weight (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Buckingham et al., 2018</xref>). This overarching pattern of results suggests that when ventral visual areas do represent motor-relevant object properties (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Gallivan et al., 2014</xref>), it may be a top-down effect driven by the motor planning process where representations are tied to specific tasks.</p><p>It remains unknown how the brain estimates generalizable physical properties of objects from visual inputs. It could be that feed-forward inference methods, akin to deep-learning based recognition models, are integrated with generative models and provide an efficient means of inference of physical properties that then serve as inputs to physics engines. This account has been explored computationally and has received behavioral support (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Yildirim et al., 2019</xref>), but how such a model may be instantiated between frontal and parietal regions underlying generalized physical reasoning and traditional object-driven cortex is an open area of investigation. Our results show that at the level of prediction and inference, intuitive physics recruits brain regions and representations outside the ventral stream, the canonical locus of visual pattern recognition.</p><p>Our findings open up numerous avenues for further investigation. Mass is just one of the properties underlying intuitive physical reasoning. Future investigations can test whether the same or other brain regions represent other physical dimensions, types of physical forces and events, and domains outside of rigid body physics (e.g. the viscosity of liquids and the restitution of materials). How fine-grained is the neural representation of mass? Future work should also test the relationship between the amount of variance in real world physical properties, and the fine-grainedness of their neural representations. Do the same neural representations that underlie physical inference also underlie action planning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Johansson and Flanagan, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Loh et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chouinard et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">van Nuenen et al., 2012</xref>)? A model-based account of physics in the brain could support both physical inference and action planning in the same underlying brain regions, which may serve as the seat of a neural physics engine. These studies and others can be expected to shed more light on how the frontal and parietal physics network examined here implements a causal generative model of objects and their dynamics.</p><p>We have shown evidence that object mass invariant to physical scenario, friction, object material, and motion, is represented in premotor and parietal brain regions during physical inference and prediction tasks not requiring action. The invariant representation in areas traditionally associated with action during a perceptual judgment suggests that these regions support the type of representation that would serve as the input to a generalized physics engine, useful in understanding forces, dynamics, and even planning actions.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Participants</title><p>Six subjects (ages 21–26; 3 male, 3 female) participated in Experiment 1, six (ages 21–40; 3 male, 3 female) in Experiment 2, and twenty (ages 20–32; 9 male, 11 female) in Experiment 3.

(2016)</xref>, in which subjects viewed 6 s movies depicting stacks (‘towers’) of yellow, blue, and white blocks created in Blender 2.70 (Blender Foundation). The block towers were constructed to be unstable such that they would topple if gravity were to take effect. Each tower was positioned in the center of a floor where half of the floor was colored green, and the other half red. In each movie the tower itself remained stationary while the camera viewpoint completed one 360° pan, providing a range of vantage points of the tower. While viewing each movie, subjects were instructed to perform one of two tasks: imagine how the blocks would fall and report whether more blocks would come to rest on the red or green side of the floor (physics task), or report whether there are more blue or yellow blocks in the tower (color task). A physics &gt; color contrast was used to identify candidate physics functional ROIs (fROIs) in each subject individually (see below) within which decoding analyses were subsequently performed.</p><p>Each scanning run for this localizer task (2 per subject) consisted of 23 18 s blocks: 10 blocks of the physical task, 10 blocks of the color task, and 3 rest blocks, which consisted of a black screen with a fixation cross. Each nonrest block began with a text cue, displayed for 1 s, which read either ‘more blue or yellow?’ (color task) or ‘where will it fall?’ (physics task). The text cue was followed by the presentation of a tower movie (6 s) and then a black screen during a 2 s response period. This sequence was repeated twice within a block, with the same task being cued for both movie presentations within a block.</p><p>In the same scanning session, participants performed 4 to 6 runs of the main experimental paradigm, which was different for each experiment, as described below. Each scanning session lasted 2 hr.</p></sec><sec id="s4-3"><title>Experiment 1: mass inference</title><p>Subjects viewed 3 s video stimuli (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>) of three different geometric solids interacting in various visual scenes (splashing into water, falling onto a pillow, being blown across a flat surface) that indicated their mass. In an event-related design, each run (four per subject) presented 36 videos in randomized order, each followed by a 1 s response period, then a rest period of variable duration (mean 6 s). During the response period, subjects were instructed to press a button indicating whether the object they saw was light or heavy. After the button press, no feedback was given to participants on correctness. In all three experiments, the assignment of buttons to responses was switched halfway through the experiment, with an equal number of trials per button-press-to-response assignment represented in training and testing data, to ensure mass decoding could not be based on specific motor responses.</p><p>Objects were constructed by hand from Learning Resources ‘View-Thru Geometric Solids.’ Three shapes of equal volume were selected as stimuli: a cone, half-sphere, and rectangular prism. Two different masses were created for each object: the ‘light’ objects were left empty (45 g), and the ‘heavy’ objects were filled with a mixture of lead pellets and flour (90 g), and painted the same color. The visual appearance of the objects was identical across masses, only the object’s physical behavior could be used to infer its mass. To create objects of different colors, Adobe Premiere Pro software (Adobe Systems) was used to color-shift the object surface from red to orange, for a total of 36 video stimuli. Decoding analyses in Experiment 1 collapsed across color.</p><p>The objects were filmed interacting in three different visual scenarios. Physical parameters of the scene besides object identity and mass were held constant across videos; that is the height from which objects were dropped (splashing, dropping scenarios), the volume of water into which they fell (splashing scenario), or the distance from the hairdryer (air source) at which they were placed (blowing scenario). While the 3D shapes of the objects represented familiar visual forms, the scenarios were selected as novel domains for mass inference. Subjects did not interact physically with the objects before the scan.</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>Experiment 2: mass decoding during color judgment</title><p>The same stimuli from Experiment 1 were used in Experiment 2. However, in Experiment 2, participants performed a color task in addition to the mass task on the same objects. The two judgment types were matched for difficulty using data collected from 50 workers with normal color vision on Amazon Mechanical Turk. Each worker performed the light/heavy mass task as well as the red/orange color task for all 36 movies. Mean accuracy on the mass task was 86.2% (±2.4 SD), mean accuracy on the color task was 89% (±3.6 SD). During the scanning session, mass and color trials were presented in blocks of 6 trials each. After each video, participants were asked to press a button indicating whether the object was ‘Light or Heavy?’ (mass task), or ‘Red or Orange?’ (color task). Each run (6 per subject) consisted of 5 color blocks, 5 physics blocks, and 4 (12s) rest blocks.

In an event-related design, each run (4 per subject) presented 24 of the 48 videos in randomized order (subjects saw every video twice in total), each followed by a rest period of variable duration (mean 6 s). Before the experiment, subjects were instructed to respond with a button press, as early as they could within each video, whether they predicted the sliding object would launch the puck across a black line. In each video the line could lie in one of 3 different locations, to discourage memorization of outcome by object. Each run contained equal numbers of each line position (8 trials). After the button press, no feedback was given to participants on correctness. To ensure familiarity with the visual appearance of the objects in the videos and their material properties, subjects were exposed to the physical objects before the scan. All objects were placed on a flat surface and subjects were instructed to ‘interact’ with each for 5 s. This instruction was chosen instead of ‘lift’ or ‘pick up’ to avoid priming attention to mass.</p><p>Object materials were selected to orthogonalize mass and friction, object material, and motion. Coefficients of friction were found by taking of the tangent of the angle of incline at which the object starts to slide down the ramp at constant speed, after being tapped. Motion in the videos was calculated using the Optical Flow package in Matlab 2016. Optical Flow identifies moving objects and calculates the amount of motion between video frames to determine the overall amount of motion in x and y dimensions in each video. The most motion was found in the movies with lego blocks (x = 1.1848 e+04, y = 1.8065e+04), followed by aluminum (x = 1.0781e+04, y = 1.767e+04), cardboard (x = 9.6789e+03, y = 1.4150e+04), and cork (x = 9.0324e+03, y = 1.4126e+04).</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Data Acquisition</title><p>Imaging was performed at the Athinoula A.

For each trial, the entire duration of the video (6 s) was used for analysis. Mean eye position (deviation from center of the screen) and mean saccade amplitude (averaging over all saccades that occurred in that trial were calculated.

Preprocessing consisted of 3D motion correction, slice scan time correction, high-pass filtering via a general linear model with a Fourier basis set (cutoff of two cycles per run, which also achieved linear trend removal), and spatial smoothing with a 4 mm FWHM Gaussian kernel.

Following <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Fischer et al. (2016)</xref>, we used the towers localizer to identify brain regions in each subject that displayed a stronger response to the physics task than to the color task. These individual subject maps were then intersected with group-level physics parcels identified in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Fischer et al. (2016)</xref> that were shown to be preferentially engaged in physical reasoning. Specifically, Fischer first identified 11 group-level parcels from the physics &gt;color contrast on toppling tower stimuli (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3b</xref>). Fischer et al. suggest that the spatial content of the physics task (not present in the color task, as individual block positions were irrelevant) may have contributed to responses in candidate physics regions. A second experiment was used to control for task differences, where physical and social prediction tasks were contrasted on the same set of moving dot stimuli. In this experiment, subjects watched pairs of moving dots with motion implying social interaction (like classic Heider and Simmel animations) or physical interaction (like billiard balls). In each video, one of the dots disappeared and subjects were asked to predict its trajectory. Both conditions required mental simulation of spatial paths, but one implicitly invoked physical prediction and the other implicitly invoked social prediction. Only a subset of the parcels showed a significantly greater response to physical vs. social interactions: P1L and P1R (bilateral parcels in dorsal premotor cortex and supplementary motor area), P3L and P3R (bilateral parcels in parietal cortex situated in somatosensory association cortex and the superior parietal lobule, and P4L (the left supramarginal gyrus). We found individual subject fROIs by intersecting subject data from the physics &gt;color contrast with these five parcels (in volumetric space for each subject), retaining only the voxels that fell within the intersection. In this way, fROI locations were allowed to vary across individuals but required to fall within the same parcel to be labeled as a common ROI across subjects. Subsequent decoding analyses were performed in individual subject fROIs.</p></sec><sec id="s4-11"><title>Decoding analysis</title><p>To test the representational content of multivoxel activity from candidate physics regions, decoding analyses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Naselaris et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Haxby et al., 2014</xref>) were run on multivoxel activity across voxels in these fROIs. An SVM was used for classification, restricted to linearly decodable signal under the assumption that a linear kernel implements a plausible readout mechanism for downstream neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Shamir and Sompolinsky, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">DiCarlo and Cox, 2007</xref>). In each of 3 experiments we tested the invariance of physical representations by testing the classifier on data from conditions that differed from those in the data used for training along a key dimension. Trials were classified for decoding based on actual trial identity (whether the object was light or heavy). Only the data from the 3 s video was included in the decoding analysis, the 1 s response period (Experiments 1 and 2) was not used for decoding. A canonical HRF response was assumed, with the HRF aligned to the start of the video. To decode mass in Experiment 1, an SVM was trained on beta values (from all voxels within individually-defined fROIs) classified as corresponding to either ‘heavy’ or ‘light’ conditions, collapsing across shape and color. We used two of the three scenario types (splash, blow, pillow) to train the classifier and tested on the third, left-out scenario, forcing the classifier to generalize across physical scenarios and iterating over left-out conditions to obtain a mean classification accuracy for each subject. Correction for multiple comparisons was not performed, given independent data for each subject and repeated replication in multiple individual subjects. In Experiment 2, the same procedure was used to decode mass during both mass and color tasks in the interleaved block design, thus testing (i) whether Experiment 1 replicates and mass can be decoded during the mass task, and (ii) whether mass representations can be decoded from candidate physics regions during an irrelevant (color) task.</p><p>We used similar multivariate analyses to test whether we could decode mass from candidate physics fROIs during the physical prediction task in Experiment 3. Experiment 3 used an event-related design where trials were 6 s videos of objects sliding down a ramp. Decoding analyses were done on data from the entire video, with HRFs aligned to video onset. To test decoding of mass invariant to friction and motion, we trained an SVM on beta values from two conditions that differ in the mass dimension but not in friction or size (e.g. light, low friction versus heavy, low friction), and tested on the left out conditions (e.g. light, high friction versus heavy, high friction) thus forcing the classifier to generalize across coefficients of friction. This procedure was iterated over left-out conditions to obtain a mean classification accuracy. This decoding of mass is also invariant to material, as objects in the training conditions (e.g. aluminum, legos) have different material composition than objects in the testing conditions (e.g. cardboard, cork).</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We thank J Fischer for helpful discussion around experimental design and analysis, L Isik for helpful discussion around MVPA decoding, and A Takahashi and S Shannon for assistance with fMRI scanning at the Athinoula A Martinos Imaging Center at MIT.

The reviewers and editors felt that the study was interesting and novel. That said, there are significant concerns about several technical and interpretation issues that need to be addressed before the paper can be published. The following comments highlight the &quot;essential revisions&quot; (which the authors must address in the revised manuscript and response letter).</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) In general, the description of the decoding analyses did not contain sufficient details for the study to be replicated. The following points should be clarified in the revised manuscript.</p><p>A) What cross-validation procedure was used for the analyses: leave-one-run-out or something else? One gets the sense that trial types were reserved for classifier testing, but that these trials would have also appeared in the same experimental run as the testing trials (e.g., In the Experiment 1 decoding). This could inflate the decoding results.</p><p>B) It was also not fully clear how decoding was setup for Experiment 1, and how trials were grouped for leave-one-trial-out classification analysis. Were trials labelled as heavy vs. light in the splash and blow conditions and then tested on pillow trials? This should be clarified.</p><p>C) Also, in the Materials and methods, the authors mention that beta values were used on trials 'classified' as… – do you mean based on the subject's behavioral responses or the actual trial identity? For example, in Experiment 1 (and other experiments), what were the regressors used? Was the whole 3 seconds modeled as a box? What about the 1s response period? Was reaction time, etc taken into account? Which betas were then used for classification? Was beta estimated for each trial, so classification was done per trial (that would make sense, but just clarifying). We assume a canonical HRF response was assumed? What HRF parameters? Since this is event related design, the hemodynamic response might leak across trials, which might inflate accuracies (e.g., two adjacent trials might be in the training and test sets respectively resulting in information leak). How was this handled in the decoding?</p><p>D) We are not sure what's the dimensionality of the input to the SVM. Were the input beta coefficients from all voxels (which would be thousands of voxels) or was it an 11-dimensional vector, corresponding to the beta coefficients of the 11 functional ROIs? If the latter, was the GLM performed for average time courses within each of 11 ROIs?

In contrast, if these regions support a generalized engine for physical simulation, we would expect to find that they hold representations of abstract physical dimensions that generalize across scenario and other physical dimensions.&quot; – We are a bit unconvinced about the logic. Isn't it possible for a pattern recognition technique to implicitly encode these abstract physical dimensions, which are then detected by your decoding approach? For example, suppose we train a reinforcement learning (RL) algorithm in a virtual environment to perform certain tasks. Isn't it possible that physical dimensions are implicitly encoded by the RL algorithm even though the RL algorithm does not utilize an explicit physical generative model? In fact, one might argue that the use of MVPA (linear SVM) in Experiment 1 suggests that the physical representation is implicit, so the authors might simply be decoding the pattern recognition approach's implicit representation of mass (or some other physical attribute) in the brain?</p><p>7) I understand that the authors relied on a network of brain areas that had been identified in a previous study by Fischer et al., 2016, which were shown to be engaged in a physical reasoning paradigm. It does seem, however, from the description of the localizer task, that the contrast of falling direction (i.e., the 'physics' task) vs. color task, would identify a number of different brain areas, not all of which would have similar functions. As one example, intuitively, it seems that the physics task that involved estimating where the leaning tower of blocks would fall would preferentially activate motion-selective areas (i.e., hV5/MT+) – which have been shown in previous fMRI studies to be activated when observers anticipate motion. The group maps illustrated in Figure 3A do indeed suggest an involvement of such motion-selective cortex, especially in the RH. As such, I wondered how meaningful the results are given that there is such a broad network of areas that is being sampled in the analyses. Is the claim that the network as a whole is operating as a 'physics engine', or are more localized regions within the network accounting for this function more so than others? It is also possible that different regions within the network may be more or less likely to show invariance – for example in real-world scenarios when, presumably, more specific rather than invariant representations would be beneficial to support possible actions? Perhaps identifying the areas that were part of this 'network' (either in the figure or a new table) would help readers to make their own assessment.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.46619.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) In general, the description of the decoding analyses did not contain sufficient details for the study to be replicated. The following points should be clarified in the revised manuscript.</p><p>A) What cross-validation procedure was used for the analyses: leave-one-run-out or something else? One gets the sense that trial types were reserved for classifier testing, but that these trials would have also appeared in the same experimental run as the testing trials (e.g., In the Experiment 1 decoding). This could inflate the decoding results.</p></disp-quote><p>The SVM decoder was trained on two scenarios and tested on one left-out scenario. To minimize information bleed due to the HRF, we used Optseq to randomize both the trial order and ISI, the latter by adding a jitter (mean duration 6s). Even with the jitter, we appreciate the reminder that the trials may still not be completely independent in the long tail of the HRF. To test the effect on decoding accuracy, we ran the decoding analyses again on half the data: training on trials in one half of the runs in each experiment, and testing on left-out trials in the other half of the runs (so trials in the training and testing data could not possibly be adjacent in the experiment). We saw only a minimal decrease in decoding accuracy, to be expected with a decrease in the amount of data, and results remained significant.</p><fig id="respfig1"><label>Author response image 1.</label><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-46619-resp-fig1-v2.tif"/></fig><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>B) It was also not fully clear how decoding was setup for Experiment 1, and how trials were grouped for leave-one-trial-out classification analysis. Were trials labelled as heavy vs. light in the splash and blow conditions and then tested on pillow trials? This should be clarified.</p></disp-quote><p>In Experiment 1 analyses, a linear SVM decoder was trained on data from labeled heavy and light trials in two scenarios (e.g. splash<italic>, S</italic> and blow, <italic>B</italic>) then tested on data from a third, left out scenario (e.g. pillow, <italic>P</italic>). We iterated over groupings (train <italic>S,B</italic>test <italic>P</italic>; train <italic>S,P</italic> test <italic>B;</italic> train <italic>P,B</italic> test <italic>S</italic>) to obtain three classification accuracies corresponding to each of the scenarios being left out. We report the mean of those classification accuracies in the paper. We are happy to note that the decoding is above chance in each subject in each separate grouping; in other words, it is not that one train/test direction is carrying the result. This result is now reported in the paper.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>C) Also, in the Materials and methods, the authors mention that beta values were used on trials 'classified' as… – do you mean based on the subject's behavioral responses or the actual trial identity? For example, in Experiment 1 (and other experiments), what were the regressors used? Was the whole 3 seconds modeled as a box? What about the 1s response period? Was reaction time, etc taken into account? Which betas were then used for classification? Was beta estimated for each trial, so classification was done per trial (that would make sense, but just clarifying). We assume a canonical HRF response was assumed? What HRF parameters? Since this is event related design, the hemodynamic response might leak across trials, which might inflate accuracies (e.g., two adjacent trials might be in the training and test sets respectively resulting in information leak). How was this handled in the decoding?</p></disp-quote><p>Trials were classified for decoding based on actual trial identity (whether the actual object filmed was light or heavy). Only the data from the 3s video was included in the decoding analysis, the 1s response period (Experiments 1 and 2) was not used for decoding. A canonical HRF response was assumed, with the HRF aligned to the start of the video. GLMs included one regressor per stimulus condition, as well as nuisance regressors for motion correction (<italic>x, y, z</italic>), and the approximated first derivatives of each of these motion estimates. The response periods were modeled with their own regressors, but we did not include those betas in the analysis. These points are now clarified in the Materials and methods section.</p><p>We recognize that the hemodynamic response leak may have inflated decoding accuracy in an event-related design where training and testing data may have come from adjacent trials in the same run (though trial order was randomized in each run for each subject). This concern is addressed in Essential revision 1A.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>D) We are not sure what's the dimensionality of the input to the SVM. Were the input beta coefficients from all voxels (which would be thousands of voxels) or was it an 11-dimensional vector, corresponding to the beta coefficients of the 11 functional ROIs? If the latter, was the GLM performed for average time courses within each of 11 ROIs? Or GLM was performed for all vertices and then the betas were averaged within each ROI?</p></disp-quote><p>We used beta values from all voxels within individually-defined fROIs as inputs to a linear SVM.

Also, how did subjects report this?</p></disp-quote><p>Experiment 3 used an event-related design where trials were 6s videos of objects sliding down a ramp. Subjects predicted whether the puck would cross a black line and reported their judgment with a button press during each video. We asked subjects to make their predictions as soon as they could within each video because we wanted their judgments to be made before the object came to rest (revealing whether it crossed the line or not), but we also wanted to show each video in its entirety to provide maximal visual cues about the mass of the object (to be decoded). Decoding analyses were done on data from the entire video, with HRFs aligned to video onset.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>G) Please provide more details on how LO/pF/OTC texture areas were defined.</p></disp-quote><p>LO, pFs, and texture-sensitive regions of OTC were identified in each subject following Gallivan et al., 2014, using localizer tasks from Cant and Xu, 2012. Two runs of the localizers were performed in the same testing session as the prediction task in Experiment 3 of the present study. The stimuli consisted of full-color objects, object ensembles, and surface textures as well as their phase-scrambled counterparts, with each category containing equal numbers of living and non-living stimuli. In each localizer, a run consisted of four blocks each of intact and scrambled objects, or intact and scrambled object ensembles and textures. Subjects fixated on a cross at the center and pressed a button if they detected a slight spatial jitter, which occurred randomly in 1 out of every 10 images. Object-sensitive ROIs (LO and pFs) were defined by the contrast of Objects &gt; Scrambled Objects, and texture-sensitive regions were defined by the conjunction of the contrasts of Textures &gt; Scrambled and Object Ensembles &gt; Scrambled.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Why not perform the analysis in each functional ROI separately?

The classification accuracy for each sphere was assigned to its central voxel, yielding a single accuracy map in each subject’s native space. We then transformed individual subject maps to a group space (CVS space) and projected data from the volume to the surface. Finally we conducted a one-sample t test over individual subjects’ accuracy maps, comparing accuracy in each voxel to chance. This yielded a group map (shown here) which was assessed at p &lt;0.05 and FWE corrected.</p><p>A similar procedure was used in the second searchlight analysis, with scenario decoding tested instead of mass. fROI-based decoding analyses in Experiments 1 and 2 tested the generalization of a neural representation of object mass across multiple physical scenarios: splashing into water, blowing across a flat surface, and falling onto the surface of a pillow. Here we tested where in the brain we see the effects of physical scenario.</p><p>As expected, there is a difference between where we see decoding that depends on analyzing patterns of visual information and where we see decoding of underlying physical quantities. The ROI analyses indicate there is decoding in the physics ROIs but the searchlight suggests there is also decoding in adjacent areas in or near motor cortex. Sensitivity to mass in motor regions was not our focus in this work, but it is potentially an interesting finding that would be consistent with physics-based models of motor cortex coding. For instance, the model of Todorov (2000, Nature Neuroscience) posits that central control of the motor periphery is based in part on specifying the forces that must be produced in muscles to achieve voluntary action goals, given properties of muscle physiology and multi-joint mechanics. In general, for any object manipulation task, this will depend on the weight of objects, and so it would not be surprising to see some encoding of object mass in M1. We hope to explore this possibility further in future work.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Based on the Experiment 2 design, we are not sure you can make any claims about the automaticity of mass encoding. The study interspersed color and mass blocks, and it is difficult to rule out that the context effect on mass blocks carried over to (and created biases on) color blocks. Moreover, we think it would have strengthened their observations to show that a classifier trained on mass blocks can cross-decode mass on color blocks, rather than just decode mass from the color blocks independently (as was done).</p></disp-quote><p>While we did set out with questions about the automaticity of mass encoding, we do agree that we can’t make strong claims about automaticity from the results of Experiment 2 alone, due to the potential of a context effect from the mass task being carried over to the color task. This was, in part, our motivation for designing Experiment 3: to test decoding in an experiment with a physical reasoning task that required implicit understanding of mass, but never explicitly asked about it. From successful decoding during the prediction task in Experiment 3, we conclude that we are not simply decoding a prepared response to the question: “is this object heavy or light,” but an abstract, generalizable representation of mass useful in understanding forces and dynamics and predicting outcomes of physical events. We agree that this result leaves open broader questions of the automaticity of physical representations, e.g., to what extent is the brain’s machinery for physical reasoning running constantly? Which physical dimensions are represented even when they are not useful in a particular task? To what extent is physical reasoning modulated by task and attention? These are fruitful avenues of future work that we now mention in the Discussion section of the paper. Language has been adjusted in the paper to more accurately characterize conclusions and open questions around automaticity.</p><p>We did train a classifier on mass blocks and test cross-decoding of mass during the color blocks, and cross-decoding accuracy was not above chance. This suggests that the representation of mass we find is not completely abstract; it generalizes with respect to scenario but not with respect to task, as least in this case where one task does not require physical reasoning. This result is a limit on the automaticity of the mass representation, opening up further questions regarding the degree of abstraction of physical representations, and the types of tasks to which they generalize. We begin to address the automaticity question in Experiment 3: Can a generalizable mass representation be decoded during a physical task that does not ask subjects about mass? This motivation is now clarified at the end of the discussion of Experiment 2. We also note the outstanding questions in the Discussion.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) The authors said that &quot;A power analysis was used to calculate the appropriate number of subjects for each experiment.&quot; We assumed this meant that the authors determine a sample size of 20 was necessary for Experiment 3.

Thus, we began by running 6 subjects in Experiment 3, and significance was obtained. We tested mass decoding in LO/pF/OTC in these initial 6 subjects. It was after these initial 6 subjects that we decided to use eye tracking to ensure subjects were fixating at the center of the screen and to confirm our decoding result was not due to eye movement. We intended to scan 6 subjects with eye tracking to demonstrate equivalent power, but we were required to recruit 2 additional eye tracking subjects as two of the original subjects had eye colors that were too dark for the EyeLink system to successfully track (their brain data was still included in the decoding analysis). Finally, we tested 6 more subjects in a paradigm which included, in addition to the stimuli we describe, additional conditions that tested a different hypothesis. The presentation of the original stimuli remained identical to their presentation to the first 14 subjects. (Specifically, we included additional trials with real-world objects (a cookie, a sock, a key ring, and PVC pipe) with similar masses and coefficients of friction to the cardboard, cork, aluminum and lego cubes in the orthogonalized design. We attempted to cross-decode mass of the cubes on trials with real-world objects, but cross-decoding was not above chance. This may be due to similar limits on generalizability described in Essential revision 3.) In the data reported for Experiment 3 we therefore included all 20 of the subjects run on this experiment, since we had the data, not just the original 6 we planned.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) Eye Movement Control analysis.

Trials were labeled as light or heavy and low or high friction according to real-world video identity. For each trial, the entire duration of the video (6s) was used for analysis. Mean eye position (deviation from center of the screen) and mean saccade amplitude (averaging over all saccades that occurred in that trial) were calculated for each trial using EyeLink Data Viewer software and MATLAB R2016B. We then used a two-way ANOVA to analyze the interaction between mass and friction and mean eye position and saccade amplitude during the fixation condition and found no significant effects.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) &quot;A pattern recognition approach to physical reasoning might predict that the neural representations in these regions would hold information about low-level visual features or situation-specific representations of physical variables.

A pattern recognition approach or model-free RL algorithm, if built on an object-centric representation, could develop an implicit representation of some aspects of unobservable, dynamically relevant physical object properties, such as mass. But, it would only develop representations that approximate the aspects of that physical parameter that are relevant to the particular tasks and physical contexts the algorithm is trained on. It would not be expected to generalize to tasks or contexts different from those in its training. We designed the stimuli in our experiments to test generalization across novel scenarios unseen during training, and find mass representations with meaningful generalization across orthogonal physical dimensions such as friction and motion.</p><p>An interesting point of contrast is the paper, “Unsupervised Learning of Latent Physical Properties Using Perception-Prediction Networks” (Zheng et al., 2018), co-authored by one of us (JBT). This paper takes a “pattern recognition”-style approach (i.e., gradient descent in a neural net trained from a million training examples all generated by a conventional physics engine) to learning a dynamics model in the form of an object-centric neural physics engine (defined on a graph-structured neural network). The authors show that they can decode an invariant notion of mass which generalizes to a limited extent: e.g., trained on 6 balls bouncing elastically, it can generalize a decodable mass concept to 3 or 9 balls bouncing elastically. The graph neural net is effectively learning a simulator, at least for these limited cases of balls bouncing: it learns a function that infers the latent physical state of a dynamic scene from past motion history and predicts the next state in time. Thus to the extent that it has a limited mass concept, it does so by virtue of having learned a limited physics engine. Neither the simulator nor the mass concept have been shown to generalize very far beyond the training regimes. But it does show as an existence proof that the concepts of pattern recognition, generative models, physics engines, and simulators are not simple categories that are simply distinct, in the sense that generative models, simulators, and physics engines can in part be learned, and approximations to physically accurate simulators that hold in a limited regime similar to training can be learned by pattern recognition-style training methods. We expect these kinds of models will be interesting to pursue in future work, to see if they can learn more abstract, veridical, invariant notions of physics, but to do that they will likely have to incorporate even more explicit representations of objects and their dynamics.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7) I understand that the authors relied on a network of brain areas that had been identified in a previous study by Fischer et al., 2016, which were shown to be engaged in a physical reasoning paradigm.

The original experiments by Fischer et al., 2016, also found activation of a broad network, including motion-selective areas (MT+), in the physics &gt; color contrast in the same towers localizer used in this study (see Figure 2, Fischer et al., 2016). However, Experiment 2 in Fischer et al. narrowed down the set of fROIs considered candidates for a ‘physics engine’ to a set of bilateral parcels in dorsal premotor cortex and supplementary motor area (Figure 3, Fischer et al., 2016), and bilateral parcels in parietal cortex, which were specifically selective to intuitive physical reasoning. The stimuli in that experiment were pairs of moving dots with motion that implied either social interaction (chasing one another, like in classic animations by Heider and Simmel) or physical interaction (bouncing like billiard balls). After 8s in each video, one of the dots disappeared, and subjects were asked to predict the continuing trajectory of the invisible dot. In the final video frame, the missing dot reappeared, and subjects reported whether it reappeared in the correct location. Both conditions used the same task, requiring mental simulation of spatial paths, but one condition implicitly invoked physical prediction and the other invoked social prediction. The premotor and parietal parcels described above showed significantly greater activation during the physical condition than the social condition, implicating them in the processing of physical information. The remaining fROIs in the broader network showed robust responses to both conditions. We therefore carried out decoding analyses in the set of parcels preferential to physical reasoning in the present study. The role of MT in intuitive physics is an interesting question we are currently investigating in a different study. These points are now discussed in greater detail in the paper.</p></body></sub-article></article>
