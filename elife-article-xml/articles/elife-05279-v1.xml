Migrating cells typically form filopodia that extend from the cell surface, but the precise function of these structures in cell polarization and guided migration is poorly understood. Using the in vivo model of zebrafish primordial germ cells for studying chemokine-directed single cell migration, we show that filopodia distribution and their dynamics are dictated by the gradient of the chemokine Cxcl12a. By specifically interfering with filopodia formation, we demonstrate for the first time that these protrusions play an important role in cell polarization by Cxcl12a, as manifested by elevation of intracellular pH and Rac1 activity at the cell front. The establishment of this polarity is at the basis of effective cell migration towards the target. Together, we show that filopodia allow the interpretation of the chemotactic gradient in vivo by directing single-cell polarization in response to the guidance cue.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.05279.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.05279.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.05279.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Some of the cells in an animal embryo have to migrate long distances to reach their final positions; that is to say, to reach the locations where they will participate in the formation of tissues and organs. The migration of cells is also important throughout the entire lifespan of an animal. White blood cells, for example, must be able to move within tissues to search for and fight infections as well as to detect and remove abnormal cells.</p><p>The front end of a migrating cell typically protrudes. The back of the cell is then pulled and detaches, which allows the whole cell to move forward. Migrating cells generate thin finger-like projections known as filopodia that have been suggested to help the cell sense their external environments and follow chemical cues. It is not clear what happens to a migrating cell in a living organism if the formation of its filopodia is impaired, or even how filipodia help the normal migration of cells in animals.</p><p>To define how filopodia help to guide migrating cells in an animal, Meyen et al. analyzed the migration of cells called ‘primordial germ cells’ (or PGCs) in zebrafish. These cells form very early on in development of a zebrafish embryo at a position that is far away from their final location (in the testes or ovaries where they will go on to form sperm or egg cells respectively). Meyen et al. revealed that cells that are exposed to the guidance cue (a protein called a chemokine) form more filopodia at their front compared to their rear. The filopodia formed at the cell front also extend and retract more frequently.</p><p>Meyen et al. further observed that the specific chemokine that guides the cells can bind to the filopodia and enter the cell. This leads to a signal inside the cell that tells the cell to move in the direction where more of the chemokine is found. Indeed, altering the distribution and number of filopodia around the cell's edge decreases the ability of the primordial germ cells to reach their targets. Together, this work shows that the filopodia at the front end of cells are required for sensing the chemokines that guide cell movement.</p><p>Further work is required to understand the mechanism that determines the distribution of filopodia on the surface of migrating cells, and the role of chemokines in the process. Moreover, this work may also be relevant for understanding the migration of cancer cells, because several types of cancer can invade new tissues by following directional cues including chemokines.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.05279.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.05279.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author keywords</title><kwd>chemotaxis</kwd><kwd>cell migration</kwd><kwd>chemokine</kwd><kwd>germ cell</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Zebrafish</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001659</institution-id><institution>Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Meyen</surname><given-names>Dana</given-names></name><name><surname>Wittwer</surname><given-names>Carolina</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004869</institution-id><institution>Westfälische Wilhelms-Universität Münster</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Cells in Motion (CIM) excellence cluster</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Banisch</surname><given-names>Torsten U</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000781</institution-id><institution>European Research Council (ERC)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Tarbashevich</surname><given-names>Katsiaryna</given-names></name><name><surname>Maugis</surname><given-names>Benoît</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.3</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Functional analysis of filopodia by specific interference with their formation and distribution reveals a critical role in conferring intracellular polarity and in controlling the dynamic properties of chemokine-guided cell migration in vivo.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Cell migration is essential for tissue and organ development, for tissue homeostasis and function. The process of migration is also at the basis of pathological conditions such as inflammation and cancer metastasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Friedl and Gilmour, 2009</xref>). Migrating cells generate finger-like cellular extensions that contain parallel actin-bundles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Mallavarapu and Mitchison, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Yang et al., 2009</xref>), termed filopodia, that constitute a characteristic feature of metastasizing cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Machesky, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Arjonen et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Pan et al., 2011</xref>). It has been proposed that filopodia transport signalling molecules to neighbouring cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Sanders et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Roy et al., 2014</xref>), promote adhesion and are therefore important for generation of traction forces (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Albuschies and Vogel, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Fierro-González et al., 2013</xref>) and serve as a sensing organelle (reviewed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Wood and Martin, 2002</xref>]). The latter notion arose from functional studies that were carried out in vitro and involved manipulations that could have affected different processes in addition to filopodia formation in chemotrophic growth cones (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Zheng et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Rajnicek et al., 2006</xref>). Other studies demonstrated an EGF retrograde transport on protrusions of epidermoid carcinoma cells in culture (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Lidke et al., 2005</xref>), although the functional significance of the findings was not explored. Consistent with a role in sensing, filopodia formation was observed in response to VEGF that directs angiogenic sprouting (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Gerhardt et al., 2003</xref>), to FGF that instructs branching morphogenesis in the tracheal system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Ribeiro et al., 2002</xref>), as well as in response to morphogen signals in <italic>Drosophila</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Roy et al., 2011</xref>). In the context of group cell migration, inhibiting filopodia formation decreased the migration velocity, yet the cellular basis for this effect has not been further investigated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Phng et al., 2013</xref>). Similarly, it was suggested that the migration of neural crest cells as streams require filopodia function, since a neuronal crest subset failed to migrate properly in zebrafish mutants that lacked the <italic>fascin1a</italic> gene whose actin bundling function is required for filopodia formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Boer et al., 2015</xref>). Nevertheless, the precise consequence of impaired filopodia formation in migrating single cells in vivo and the mechanism underlying their action during normal migration in the context of the intact tissue have thus far not been reported. As a useful in vivo model for exploring the regulation and function of filopodia in cell migration, we employed zebrafish Primordial germ cells (PGCs). These cells perform long-range migration as single cells within a complex environment from the position where they are specified towards their target (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Richardson and Lehmann, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Tarbashevich and Raz, 2010</xref>). PGC migration is guided by the chemokine Cxcl12a that binds Cxcr4b, which is expressed on the surface of these cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Doitsidou et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Knaut et al., 2003</xref>). This specific receptor-ligand pair has been shown to control among other processes, stem-cell homing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chute, 2006</xref>), cancer metastasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Zlotnik, 2008</xref>) and inflammation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Werner et al., 2013</xref>). Interestingly, similar to other migrating cells types in normal and disease contexts, zebrafish PGCs form filopodia, protrusions whose precise function in guided migration has thus far not been characterized.</p><p>We show here that in response to Cxcl12a gradients in the environment, filopodia exhibit polar distribution around the cell perimeter and alter their structural and dynamic characteristics. We demonstrate that PGCs guided by Cxcl12a form more filopodia at the cell front, filopodia that exhibit higher dynamics and play a critical role in receiving and transmitting the polarized signal. Specifically, we show that the short-lived actin-rich filopodia formed at the front of cells migrating within a Cxcl12a gradient are essential for conferring polar pH distribution and Rac1 activity in response to the guidance cue, thus facilitating effective cell polarization and advance in the correct direction. Together, these results provide novel insights into the role of filopodia in chemokine-guided single cell migration, underlining their function in orienting cell migration.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>The chemokine receptor Cxcr4b is uniformly distributed around the surface of PGCs</title><p>Guided towards their target by the chemokine Cxcl12a, zebrafish PGCs generate blebs primarily at the cell aspect facing the migration direction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Reichman-Fried et al., 2004</xref>). To define the mechanisms that could contribute to the apparent polarity of migrating PGCs, we first measured the distribution of Cxcr4b on the cell membrane around the cell perimeter. Similar to findings in <italic>Dictyostelium discoideum</italic> cells, in which the guidance receptor is evenly distributed around the cell membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Ueda et al., 2001</xref>) and consistent with our previous results (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Minina et al., 2007</xref>), the level of a GFP-tagged Cxcr4b (expressed at low amounts that do not affect the migration) measured at the cell front and its back was similar (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Furthermore, the receptor turnover on the plasma membrane, as visualized by a Cxcr4b tandem fluorescent timer (tft) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Khmelinskii et al., 2012</xref>) expressed in PGCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A–E</xref>), which are directed by the endogenous Cxcl12a gradient (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>), did not reveal a significant difference between the front and the back of the cell. Together, employing the tools described above, we could not detect an asymmetric receptor distribution or differential turnover around the cell perimeter of PGCs in the wild type situation. These findings prompted us to explore qualitative and quantitative differences between the cell front and back, specifically by examining cellular structures that could contribute to the polarity of Cxcr4b signalling.<fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.05279.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>In wild type embryos the Cxcr4b receptor is uniformly distributed on the migrating PGC membrane, and its turnover is uniform around the cell circumference.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) A graph showing the Cxcr4b-GFP protein level measured at the front and the back (normalized to the mCherry-F') of individual migrating PGCs under conditions of endogenous Cxcl12a distribution in the embryo (<bold>A</bold>, n = 18).

Similar results were obtained upon disruption of the Cxcl12a/Cxcr4b signalling pathway by morpholino-mediated Cxcr4b knockdown (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s4">Figure 2—figure supplement 4A,B</xref>). Strikingly, irrespective of their position around the cell perimeter, filopodia of PGCs in <italic>med</italic><sup><italic>NY054</italic></sup> embryos revealed average persistence (51 ± 3.1 s, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>, whole cell) and maximum lengths (3.9 ± 0.1 µm <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>, whole cell) similar to filopodia located at the back of wild type PGCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A,B</xref>, wild type).

Next, we examined the effect of a uniform Cxcl12a distribution on filopodia formation. Here, we injected <italic>cxcl12a</italic> RNA into <italic>med</italic><sup><italic>NY054</italic></sup> embryos at a concentration, which is sufficient to interfere with PGC arrival at their target region in wild type embryos, but does not immobilize them (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2A,B</xref> and <xref ref-type="other" rid="media4">Video 4</xref>). In these experiments we co-injected morpholino against <italic>cxcr7b</italic>, the somatic decoy receptor for Cxcl12a (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Boldajipour et al., 2008</xref>), to avoid any local decrease in Cxcl12 levels that would result in gradient formation.

Interestingly, cells migrating within an unmodified environment behaved similarly to those responding to artificial gradients. Specifically, in cases where migrating PGCs performed sharp turns, polarized filopodia formation preceded the change in migration direction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="other" rid="media7">Video 7</xref>). Taken together, the observed PGC response to an artificial and endogenous chemokine gradient is consistent with the idea that filopodia formation constitutes an early response to distribution of Cxcl12 that is followed by cell polarization and directed migration.<media content-type="glencoe play-in-place height-250 width-310" id="media7" mime-subtype="mov" mimetype="video" xlink:href="elife-05279-media7.mov"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.05279.022</object-id><label>Video 7.</label><caption><title>PGCs extend filopodia in the direction of migration, prior to polarization and actual onset of migration.</title><p>10 min time-lapse videos of PGCs in wild type embryos were captured using a 63× objective on a Zeiss AxioImager.M2 microscope equipped with a Photometrics camera (Cascade II) and VS-Laser Control.

This observation may imply that filopodia could play a role in the transmission of the Cxcl12a signal into the leading edge of the cell by locally increasing the surface area for ligand binding. To address this notion, we overexpressed fluorescently labelled Cxcl12a in cell clones within the embryo (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>) and followed its distribution relative to the cells and particularly, to the filopodia. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref> and <xref ref-type="other" rid="media8">Video 8</xref>, Cxcl12a-Venus foci that were initially detected on the cell surface were subsequently internalized into the cell. Strikingly, a similar interaction between Cxcl12 foci and PGCs was observed on the surface of filopodia (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref> and <xref ref-type="other" rid="media9">Video 9</xref>). Binding of Cxcl12 was observed at the tip of a filopodium (red arrowhead in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>) that extended about 12 µm away from the cell body, as well as closer to the cell body (yellow arrowhead in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>). Retraction of the filopodium resulted in dragging of the distant Cxcl12 focus to the cell body and a bleb forming at this location engulfs the closer Cxcl12 focus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>). The internalization of Cxcl12a-Venus (yellow arrowhead in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>) is consistent with the idea that the ligand interacts with its receptor Cxcr4b on the filopodia membrane and elicits a signal directing cell polarization relevant for cell migration in the direction dictated by the chemotactic gradient. Whereas the filopodia at the cell front are more dynamic and higher in number, consistent with the uniform distribution of Cxcr4b on the cell membrane (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>), we could detect interaction of overexpressed Venus-labelled Cxcl12 with filopodia at the back of the cell as well (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1A–A<bold>″</bold></xref>).<fig-group><fig id="fig5" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.05279.023</object-id><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><title>Cxcl12a internalization and interaction with filopodia.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Schematic experimental setup.

The dominant-negative form of the protein harbours mutations in the four actin-bundling sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Millard et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Lim et al., 2008</xref>) within the I-BAR domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>). A DN Irsp53-mCherry protein version expressed in PGCs was present primarily in the cell body, rather than in filopodia (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>, lower panel, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>). Moreover, expression of the DN Irsp53 version in PGCs resulted in a significant decrease in filopodia number at the cell front (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D,E</xref>). However, inhibition of Irsp53 function had no effect on filopodia formation in <italic>med</italic><sup><italic>NY054</italic></sup> embryos (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6F,G</xref>), in which the filopodia exhibit posterior characteristics (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). The inhibition of Irsp53 function specifically affected filopodia formation rather than influencing cell migration in general, as this treatment had no effect on the formation of blebs at the PGC front in embryos lacking the guidance cue (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2A</xref>). These results provide evidence that Irsp53 is required for filopodia formation in response to Cxcl12a gradient and can serve as a specific reagent for interfering with their formation.</p><p>In a second line of experiments attempting to affect filopodia formation we employed the actin filament associated protein 1L1 (AFAP1L1). AFAP1L1 was shown to play a role in tumour metastasis and to constitute a cancer prognostic marker (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Furu et al., 2011</xref>), to be localised to invadosomes and along with cortactin, to podosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Snyder et al., 2011</xref>). AFAP1L1 contains two PH domains that serve as a link to the membrane, a serine-threonin-rich substrate domain (SD) in between, a leucine zipper (Lzip), an actin-binding domain (ABD) at the C- terminus, as well as one SH3 and two SH2 domains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Snyder et al., 2011</xref>). While AFAP1L1 had not been previously implicated in filopodia formation, its subcellular localization in PGCs was intriguing and prompted our following investigation. Namely, when an mCherry-tagged version of Afap1L1a (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>) was expressed in PGCs, it was found to be specifically enriched at the base of most filopodia (84 ± 9.7%) at the level of the cell cortex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref>), suggesting a function for the protein in filopodia formation or maintenance. We subsequently ascertained that <italic>afap1l1a</italic> RNA is expressed at the time at which PGCs migrate towards their target and showed that <italic>afap1l1a</italic> RNA is maternally provided and is uniformly expressed during early embryonic development (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>).<fig-group><fig id="fig7" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.05279.030</object-id><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><title><italic>afap1l1a</italic> RNA expression, Afap1L1a protein localization and the role of the protein in filopodia formation.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Schematic structure of the Afap1L1a protein domains including a serine-threonine-rich substrate domain (SD) flanked by two PH domains, a leucine zipper (Lzip), an actin-binding domain (ABD), two SH2 and one SH3 domains. mCherry fluorophore was fused to the N-terminus of Afap1L1a to determine the subcellular localization of the protein.

Remarkably, overexpression of the protein resulted in a significant increase in filopodia number as compared to control cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D</xref>, whole cell). Furthermore, this treatment changed the distribution of the filopodia significantly, resulting in a decrease in filopodia number at the cell front and an increase in number at the sides and back of the cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D,E</xref>), effectively reversing the normal distribution of filopodia in the cell. Based on their increased persistence and length (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1A,B</xref>), the filopodia formed by cells overexpressing Afap1L1a were of the type generated at the back of PGCs. Similar to the Irsp53 effect, overexpression of Afap1L1a did not significantly alter bleb formation at the PGC front in embryos lacking the guidance cue (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s2">Figure 7—figure supplement 2A</xref>). Taken together, these findings suggest that Afap1L1 could serve as a specific tool for manipulating the formation of filopodia in PGCs.</p><p>Since manipulating Irsp53 and Afap1L1a function in PGCs altered filopodia distribution and number, we were in a position to probe into the functional significance of the polar formation of filopodia as potential sensors of the guidance cue. To this end, we made use of our recent findings showing that in response to a graded Cxcl12a concentration in the environment, zebrafish PGCs exhibit increased pH at the cell front (7% higher on the logarithmic pH scale, reflecting difference of 15% at the level of H<sup>+</sup> concentration). This polar pH elevation could control the activity of various proteins important for cell motility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Stock and Schwab, 2009</xref>) and in the case of PGCs, was shown to be essential for a local increase in the activity of the small GTPase Rac1 and thus, for directing actin polymerization to the cell front (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Tarbashevich et al., 2015</xref>). The loss of the Cxcl12a gradient leads the loss of the difference in pH between the cell front and its rear (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Tarbashevich et al., 2015</xref>). We reasoned that if filopodia were indeed important for Cxcl12 sensing, they should be functionally linked to pH elevation and Rac1 activity at the front of PGCs. To test this possibility, we first performed FRET-based pH measurements in cells in which filopodia formation was manipulated as described above. Strikingly, the reduction of filopodia formation at the cell front reduced (in the case of Irsp53), or abolished (in the case of the Afap1L1a) the increased pH at the leading edge (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8A</xref>). Conversely, inhibiting the relative elevation of pH at the cell front by inhibiting the translation of the Carbonic anhydrase 15b (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Tarbashevich et al., 2015</xref>) had no effect on filopodia formation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s1">Figure 8—figure supplement 1A,B</xref>). To determine whether the reduction of filopodia formation at the cell front had any effect on Rac1 activity, we expressed a FRET-based Rac1 activity reporter in cells overexpressing Afap1L1a. Importantly, as compared with control cells, Rac1 activity was significantly reduced in these cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8B</xref>). A milder effect on the difference between the front and rear pH, as induced by DN Irsp53 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8A</xref>) could affect different proteins important for cell motility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Stock and Schwab, 2009</xref>), but was not associated with a significant reduction in Rac1 activity as judged by the FRET level. Consistent with the idea that filopodia function upstream of the Cxcl12a signalling cascade, expression of a constitutively activated version of Rac1 (Rac1<sup>V12</sup>) in germ cells (that stop migrating as a result) had no effect on filopodia formation beyond the increase in their numbers observed in cells rendered immotile (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s1">Figure 8—figure supplement 1C,D</xref>). These results suggest that when filopodia function at the cell front is hindered, the ability of the PGCs to effectively sense the chemokine gradient is impaired, as reflected by the lack of elevated pH and by the reduced Rac1 activity at the leading edge. These results are also consistent with the idea that as a cellular structure, filopodia function in controlling intracellular pH at the cell front and are formed independent of it.<fig-group><fig id="fig8" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.05279.033</object-id><label>Figure 8.</label><caption><title>Filopodia are required for cellular response to polarized Cxcl12a distribution.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) 6–7 hpf control PGCs exhibit polarized distribution of intracellular pH as determined by the FRET efficiency of the pH sensor pH-lameleon5 protein in the cells (left).

Specifically, overexpression of the Afap1L1a that led to a reversal of filopodia distribution with predominance of filopodia in the back, also led to a reduction in cell displacement, track straightness and speed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9C,D</xref>).</p><p>We conclude therefore, that tight regulation of filopodia formation and distribution around the cell surface is essential for effective guided PGC migration. The defects in the dynamic characteristics of cell migration manifested in the cell tracks of manipulated PGCs resulted in an increased proportion of chemokine-guided cells that failed to reach their target at 24 hpf (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9E–H</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>In this work we provide evidence that filopodia are asymmetrically formed in response to a chemokine gradient and in turn, play a critical role in polarization of cells and their response to directional cues.</p><p>We found that filopodia properties differ in the front from the back of the cell, such that front filopodia are larger in number, turn over more rapidly, are shorter and contain more F-actin. These differences in filopodia distribution and dynamics are governed by the graded distribution of the chemokine in the environment. The basis for this notion is the finding that filopodia formation in PGCs migrating within embryos lacking Cxcl12a was altered in a similar manner to that observed under conditions where the chemokine is uniformly expressed.</p><p>The precise function of the front filopodia emerges when PGCs are experimentally exposed to a focused Cxcl12a source: there, filopodia formation appears to constitute an early response of the cells to the graded distribution of the chemokine. The formation of filopodia precedes further polarization such as directed bleb formation and onset of migration towards the chemoattractant source. A similar phenomenon was observed in neuronal growth cones, which respond to a glutamate gradient by an asymmetric distribution of filopodia prior to turning, in an in vitro setting (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Zheng et al., 1996</xref>). Similarly, endothelial tip cells of the early postnatal retina in mice respond to a source of VEGF by filopodia formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Gerhardt et al., 2003</xref>) and RhoD-activated fibroblasts extend cytoneme-like protrusions towards an FGF source in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Koizumi et al., 2012</xref>). Whereas these observations were consistent with the idea that polarized filopodia formation constitutes a response to a guidance cue, the relevance for directed cell migration was not known. Our finding that the chemokine appears to bind and be transported on the filopodium, followed by internalization, is consistent with the idea that filopodia function in Cxcl12a uptake and in increasing the surface relevant for this action at the cell front. In this study, we carried out specific manipulations affecting filopodia formation and show an adverse effect on the ability of migrating single cells to respond to Cxcl12a by directional migration. The effect of specifically decreasing filopodia formation at the cell front (by inhibiting Irsp53 function) resulted in inefficient propagation of the external signal into the cell as evidenced by the strong reduction in the difference between the pH at the cell front and its back. In the same direction, overexpression of the Afap1L1 protein erased the normal front-back polarity with respect to filopodia distribution. In the absence of polar distribution of filopodia in the direction of the attractive cue, the cells could not effectively detect the graded chemokine cue, establish a stable front and thus, did not elevate the pH and Rac1 activity at the leading edge. These effects on the characteristic front-back cell polarity impaired the directional migration in response to a guidance cue, culminating in ectopic localization of the cells at the end of the migration process.</p><p>Taken together, this work presents important insights into the mechanism by which dynamic filopodia located at the front of migrating cells participate in the transmission of the guidance cue to allow directional migration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10</xref>)<italic>.</italic> We suggest that following the activation of Cxcr4b by Cxcl12a, the scaffold protein Irsp53 is activated to promote the formation of dynamic filopodia at the cell front. These filopodia extend in the direction of higher chemokine concentration and expand the surface for Cxcl12a binding, thereby further enhancing Cxcr4b signalling at the cell front and effectively enhancing the absolute differences in ligand levels detected along the front-back axis of the cell. We suggest that the positive feedback loop presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10</xref> allows the PGCs to interpret shallow gradients by forming a front that is more sensitive to the guidance cue. The uneven receptor activation along the back–front axis of the cell that includes the filopodia is a prerequisite for the establishment of the intracellular elevated pH at the cell front that facilitates actin polymerization at this location (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Tarbashevich et al., 2015</xref>) leading to functional polarization of the cell. Under conditions of no, or uniform activation of Cxcr4b a cell front is not established. In such cases, the positive feedback loop that normally stabilizes the front in one aspect of the migrating cell is not present, affecting cell polarity and the features of migration in the direction of the chemokine source.<fig id="fig10" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.05279.037</object-id><label>Figure 10.</label><caption><title>Regulation of dynamic filopodia at the cell front and their role in cell polarization and directed cell migration.</title><p>Following the activation of Cxcr4b by Cxcl12a (1), the scaffold protein Irsp53 is activated (2) and promotes the formation of dynamic filopodia at the cell front (3). The dynamic filopodia that extend in the direction of higher Cxcl12a concentration increase the surface for chemokine binding (4), thereby enhancing signalling. The enhanced signalling at the cell front results in further Irsp53 activation (5) and an elevation of pH (6). The increase in pH in turn, leads to an elevation in Rac1 activity at this aspect of the cell (7). Once established, the front inhibits other parts of the cell from assuming front characteristics including dynamic filopodia formation, elevated pH and Rac1 activation (8). Lower panels—Irsp53 inhibition or Afap1L1a overexpression result in loss of dynamic filopodia at the cell front, abrogating the local increase in pH. As a consequence, PGCs migrate less directionally. Lack of a Cxcl12a gradient leads to the formation of numerous, evenly distributed, long and persistent filopodia in cells that migrate in random directions.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.05279.037">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.05279.037</ext-link></p></caption><graphic xlink:href="elife-05279-fig10-v1.tif"/></fig></p><p>An important question that remains to be elucidated is the mechanism by which Cxcl12/Cxcr4b signalling activates Irsp53 function, leading to formation of the Irsp53-dependent filopodia at the cell front.

Your article has been favorably evaluated by K VijayRaghavan (Senior editor), Marianne Bronner (Reviewing editor), and 3 reviewers.</p><p>The Reviewing editor and the reviewers discussed their comments before we reached this decision, and the Reviewing editor has assembled the following comments to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Meyen et al. examine migration of PGCs in zebrafish to unravel the question of how migration induced by Cxcl signaling is controlled by filopodia. The main conclusion of the manuscript is that filopodia distribution and their dynamics are dictated by a gradient of the chemokine Cxcl12a. Anterior filopodia, in turn are required for receiving the cxcl12a signal that then polarizes the cell. They also conclude that there are two kinds of filopodia: some that are chemokine dependent and others that are not. This manuscript focuses on an interesting topic and up to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>, the experiments are clear and the interpretation of the results is sounds. The work is potentially appropriate for <italic>eLife</italic> after the following issues have been addressed:</p><p>1) The authors find a correlation between how dynamic a filopodia is and the presence of the chemokine CXCL12. The authors suggest that CXCL12 influence filopodia dynamic; however CXCL12 controls directional migration as well; therefore it is possible that directional migration could affect filopodia dynamics. In other words if a cell is moving in a particular directions the filopodia formed in that direction (front) will be short lived because they will be engulfed by the cell or cell protrusions (blebs in this case, example in <xref ref-type="other" rid="media8">Movie 8</xref>). Are the front filopodia more dynamic because they disappear as they are engulfed by blebs during migration? Or do they maintain the length at the front in spite the cells is moving in the direction of the filopodia? This issue can be easily addressed analyzing filopodia dynamics in non-motile cells exposed to CXCL12.</p><p>2) The authors claim: “These findings are consistent with the idea that filopodia formation constitutes an early response to distribution of Cxcl12 that is followed by cell polarization and directed migration”. To support this claim the authors need to analyze the sequence of events in wild type PGC: are the filopodia really appearing earlier than polarization and directed migration? (This is not obvious in <xref ref-type="other" rid="media6">Movie 6</xref>).</p><p>3) The authors show no correlation between the presence of filopodia and the formation of blebs in control cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2–figure supplement 3</xref>). A similar analysis should be performed for the cells in which filopodia has been affected (DN Irsp53 and Afap1L1a-overexpressing cells). This analysis is important to support their conclusion that filopodia affect CXCL12 sensing, as they need to rule out the alternative explanation that filopodia interfering is affecting directional migration by disturbing bleb formation.</p><p>4) Increased Cxcl12a leads to increased pH at the cell front. Expression of DN-Irsp53 or AFAP1L1 blocked the increased pH. Why did the AFAP1L1 not lead to increased pH at the back? Given their model, shouldn't this predict increased filopodia at the back?</p><p>5) The authors suggest filopodia function in controlling intracellular pH at the front, and are formed independent of pH. Based on their model, increased filopodia leading to increasing sensitivity to Cxcl12a, would predict that increased filopodia in AFAP1L overexpression might make cells more sensitive to a Cxcl12 gradient. Can this be quantitated?</p><p>6) One of the main conclusions of the paper is the existence of different types of filopodia. This should not only be discussed in the Discussion section but already in the Abstract or Introduction and Results sections.</p><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>: Is Irsp53 expressed in all filopodia? Expression of DN Irsp53 only affects front and side filopodia (5D). Surprisingly, the overexpression of DN Irsp53 in <italic>medea</italic> mutant embryos has no effect on filopodia arguing that <italic>medea</italic> only has filopodia of the posterior/chemokine-independent type. This should be mentioned in the Results section and also further tested (see below).</p><p>Do the authors believe that the filopodia that form in <italic>medea</italic> after cxcl12a overexpression now possess an anterior character? The subsection headed “Filopodia formation and dynamics are regulated by the chemokine Cxcl12” seems to suggest that they still look like the typical posterior type <italic>medea</italic> filopodia. However, if the authors' claim is correct that anterior filopodia form because of exposure to Cxl12a and subsequent activation of lrsp53, filopodia in medea embryos that overexpress Cxl12a should now all look like anterior filopodia. This should be tested. Likewise, the overexpressing dnLrsp53 should be able to deplete filopodia in Cxcl12a mRNA injected <italic>medea</italic> mutant embryos. Also, how does manipulation of Afap1L1 affect filopodia in <italic>medea</italic> mutant embryos?</p><p>7) The authors describe that 50% of posterior filopodia do not contain actin (in the subsection headed “Migrating PGCs extend specialized filopodia in the direction of migration”). They do not describe how they interpret this finding. Does this argue for the presence of two different types of filopodia? But then there are still 50% of filopodia with a front phenotype expressed in the back. What does that imply? Are the actin-less filopodia responsive to Cxcl12a? Do filopodia in <italic>medea</italic> mutants all possess actin? Does the absence or presence of actin have anything to do with chemokine signaling?</p><p>8) The authors propose that filopodia increase the Cxcl12a signal by increasing the surface area for ligand binding at the front. This is an interesting idea, but difficult to prove. Is Cxcl12 binding preferentially to the filopodia at the front and not to those formed at the back? This could be easily analysed by repeating the analysis performed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>, but now in filopodia formed at the back, or in those conditions where the type of filopodia (back or front) has been altered.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.05279.041</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>1) The authors find a correlation between how dynamic a filopodia is and the presence of the chemokine CXCL12.

This issue can be easily addressed analyzing filopodia dynamics in non-motile cells exposed to CXCL12</italic>.</p><p>We thank the referees for raising this point, which we addressed by examining the fate of filopodia in non-manipulated cells. We wished to avoid possible side effects caused by rendering the cells immotile since for example, inhibiting motility of germ cells may interfere with cellular responses that in turn may impinge on filopodia dynamics. To this end, we examined the persistence of individual filopodia in 10-minute time-lapse movies, while monitoring for engulfment of filopodia by advancing blebs. First, only a third of the filopodia that extended at the cell front, are engulfed by inflating blebs. Still, the persistence of the remaining front filopodia in cells guided by physiological Cxcl12 gradients is lower than that of filopodia at the back of the cell. Those results are now presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3–figure supplement 1</xref> and are described in the text. Thus, whereas blebs can indeed engulf filopodia thereby affecting their persistence, the rest of the filopodia at the cell front exhibit shorter life span relative to those at the cell rear.</p><p><italic>2) The authors claim:</italic> “<italic>These findings are consistent with the idea that filopodia formation constitutes an early response to distribution of Cxcl12 that is followed by cell polarization and directed migration</italic>”<italic>.

To make this point crystal clear, we made use of the golgi as a directional marker since in migrating germ cells, the golgi resides behind the nucleus and thus marks the back of the cell. We now present the region of the golgi by using farnesylated –EGFP (red asterisk in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4–figure supplement 1A</xref>) in the movie (red asterisk in current <xref ref-type="other" rid="media6">Video 6</xref>, Cxcl12a transplant) and in the presented snapshots based on individual confocal planes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). This sequence of events is observed in the vast majority of cells responding to a “simple” artificial gradient introduced into the embryonic environment lacking Cxcl12 (15 times of 17 cases examined) and this point is mentioned in the text.</p><p>Cells in non-manipulated embryos experience a more complex set of instructions, as the endogenous gradients are shallow and not as focused. Nevertheless, as requested we now present the sequence of events as recorded in cells performing sharp turns in the context of a non-manipulated embryo (<xref ref-type="other" rid="media7">Video 7</xref> and snapshots presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4–figure supplement 2</xref>). Those new results are now described in the text.</p><p><italic>3) The authors show no correlation between the presence of filopodia and the formation of blebs in control cells (</italic><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3"><italic>Figure 2–figure supplement 3</italic></xref><italic>). A similar analysis should be performed for the cells in which filopodia has been affected (DN Irsp53 and Afap1L1a-overexpressing cells). This analysis is important to support their conclusion that filopodia affect CXCL12 sensing, as they need to rule out the alternative explanation that filopodia interfering is affecting directional migration by disturbing bleb formation</italic>.</p><p>In the data we provide in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2–figure supplement 3</xref>, we show that the formation of the blebs and filopodia is not coupled when employing tighter temporal and spatial criteria, suggesting that filopodia are not required at the actual time and place of bleb formation. To address the referee comment, we further show now that the manipulations aimed at specifically altering the distribution of the filopodia do not affect other relevant cellular features such as bleb formation. We monitored this parameter in DN Irsp53 and Afap1L1a-overexpressing cells. Our findings now are presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6–figure supplement 2</xref> (DN Irsp53) and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s2">Figure 7–figure supplement 2</xref> (Afap1L1a overexpression) and show no significant effect on the frequency of bleb formation in the cells in which filopodia formation is impaired.</p><p><italic>4) Increased Cxcl12a leads to increased pH at the cell front. Expression of DN-Irsp53 or AFAP1L1 blocked the increased pH</italic>. <italic>Why did the AFAP1L1 not lead to increased pH at the back? Given their model, shouldn't this predict increased filopodia at the back?</italic></p><p>We would like to explain why our model does not predict elevation of pH or increased dynamic filopodia formation at the back of germ cell upon increase of filopodia at the site. Wild type PGCs that sense a gradient of Cxcl12a respond by elevation of the pH at the cell front, which leads to an increase in Rac1 activity at this location. Manipulating the distribution of the filopodia, such that their number at the cell front is reduced, adversely affects the efficiency with which the PGCs can perceive the chemokine signal and interpret it as a graded one. As a consequence, the establishment of higher pH at the cell front is hindered. Afap1L1 overexpression leads to a relative increase in filopodia number at the back of cells. Those cells encounter higher levels of the chemokine at their front, but are defective in perceiving the signal. The back aspect of the cell, while possessing more filopodia encounters less of the chemokine. We thus interpret the results such that Afap1L1 overexpressing cells with “less efficient front-more efficient back” simply fails to form the Cxcl12a-dependent intracellular polarization in the distribution of the pH. The increase in filopodia in the back did not win over the front but rather cancelled out the cell polarity that is normally induced by the chemotactic signal in the front.</p><p><italic>5) The authors suggest filopodia function in controlling intracellular pH at the front, and are formed independent of pH. Based on their model, increased filopodia leading to increasing sensitivity to Cxcl12a, would predict that increased filopodia in AFAP1L overexpression might make cells more sensitive to a Cxcl12 gradient. Can this be quantitated?</italic></p><p>As described in our response to the previous point, cells overexpressing AfapL1a do not simply possess more filopodia, but actually loose the normal polarity where more dynamic filopodia form at the cell front. The loss of the normal arrangement/specific features of the filopodia interferes with the ability of the cell to interpret the Cxcl12a gradient, which is the basis for the miss-migration phenotype we observe under these conditions.</p><p><italic>6) One of the main conclusions of the paper is the existence of different types of filopodia. This should not only be discussed in the Discussion section but already in the Abstract or Introduction and Results sections</italic>.</p><p>In the current version of the paper this point i.e., the fact that actin-rich filopodia that show higher dynamics and higher actin content are formed at the front of cells migrating within a Cxcl12a gradient, is now mentioned at the end of the Introduction.</p><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5"><italic>Figure 5</italic></xref><italic>: Is Irsp53 expressed in all filopodia?

This should be mentioned in the Results section and also further tested (see below)</italic>.</p><p>Based on the detection of an Irsp53-mCherry fusion protein, about 40% of the filopodia at the cell front contain Irsp53, while a lower proportion of filopodia in other regions of the cell contain the protein. We present these new quantitative data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6–figure supplement 1</xref>. In contrast, the dominant-negative version of the protein is found primarily in the cell body rather than in the filopodia (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6–figure supplement 1</xref>). This issue is now mentioned in the Results section.</p><p>Indeed, the filopodia formed in the Cxcl12 mutant <italic>medusa</italic> are chemokine independent (by definition) and appear “back-like” and show “back-like” characteristics including dynamics and length properties, similar to those of back filopodia in wild type cells. Consistently, expressing the dominant-negative Irsp53 in PGCs of <italic>medusa</italic> embryos does not affect the filopodia, since Irsp53 is expressed primarily within and is required for front filopodia formation.

Also, how does manipulation of Afap1L1 affect filopodia in</italic> medea <italic>mutant embryos?</italic></p><p>We find polarization in the filopodia types formed by cells only when the cells are presented with graded Cxcl12a in the environment. Simply exposing cells to uniform Cxcl12a, or having no Cxcl12a in the environment leads to the formation of filopodia that are less dynamic, despite the fact that cells do migrated albeit non-directionally under these conditions. This conclusion is based on our experiments, where we follow filopodia formation in <italic>medusa</italic> embryos, as well as in embryos in which Cxcl12a was introduced globally by RNA injection into early embryos (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C, D</xref>). In this experimental set up the forming filopodia exhibited uniform “back” properties regardless of the region of the cells where they arose. Since in the absence of a Cxcl12a gradient anterior-type filopodia do not form, DN Irsp53 is not expected to affect them under these conditions. Indeed, expression of DN Irsp53 in germ cells in <italic>medusa</italic> embryos overexpressing Cxcl12a did not result in reduction of filopodia number, the effect that is normally observed in wild type cells.

They do not describe how they interpret this finding. Does this argue for the presence of two different types of filopodia? But then there are still 50% of filopodia with a front phenotype expressed in the back. What does that imply? Are the actin-less filopodia responsive to Cxcl12a? Do filopodia in</italic> medea <italic>mutants all possess actin? Does the absence or presence of actin have anything to do with chemokine signaling?</italic></p><p>In a significant fraction of the posterior filopodia we failed to detect lifeact signal. We believe that some back filopodia contain lower concentration of actin rather than completely devoid of it. We have reviewed all sites in the text where we mention these structures and made sure the point is understood in this way. We interpret the results to indicate that front filopodia contain a higher concentration of actin, such that it is always detected but have no information concerning an actual functional significance of the difference. We consider however low-actin filopodia a characteristic of back filopodia. As expected from the more posterior nature of filopodia formed in <italic>medusa</italic> mutants, the fraction of filopodia in which no lifeact could be detected is indeed elevated (now presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2–figure supplement 1B</xref>).</p><p><italic>8) The authors propose that filopodia increase the Cxcl12a signal by increasing the surface area for ligand binding at the front. This is an interesting idea, but difficult to prove. Is Cxcl12 binding preferentially to the filopodia at the front and not to those formed at the back? This could be easily analysed by repeating the analysis performed in</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4"><italic>Figure 4</italic></xref><italic>, but now in filopodia formed at the back, or in those conditions where the type of filopodia (back or front) has been altered</italic>.</p><p>We indeed believe that the increased number of filopodia at the cell front plays a role in polarizing the cell in response to the ligand, by increasing the chance Cxcl12a interacts with the cell at the front. In the experiments aimed at demonstrating the function of filopodia we detect small aggregates of Venus-labeled ligand interacting with filopodia and getting internalized (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). We do not believe the back filopodia cannot function in Cxcl12a-binding, since the receptor Cxcr4b is uniformly expressed around the cell circumference. Indeed, in data we provide in the revised version of the work (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5–figure supplement 1A'-A''</xref>) ligand binding to back filopodia can be observed as well. This finding is now mentioned in the Results section.</p></body></sub-article></article>
