While mammalian body temperature fluctuates throughout the day, small ectotherms, such as <italic>Drosophila</italic> achieve a body temperature rhythm (BTR) through their preference of environmental temperature. Here, we demonstrate that pigment dispersing factor (PDF) neurons play an important role in setting preferred temperature before dawn. We show that small lateral ventral neurons (sLNvs), a subset of PDF neurons, activate the dorsal neurons 2 (DN2s), the main circadian clock cells that regulate temperature preference rhythm (TPR). The number of temporal contacts between sLNvs and DN2s peak before dawn. Our data suggest that the thermosensory anterior cells (ACs) likely contact sLNvs via serotonin signaling. Together, the ACs-sLNs-DN2s neural circuit regulates the proper setting of temperature preference before dawn. Given that sLNvs are important for sleep and that BTR and sleep have a close temporal relationship, our data highlight a possible neuronal interaction between body temperature and sleep regulation.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.23206.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.23206.001</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>circadian rhythms</kwd><kwd>body temperature</kwd><kwd>temperature preference behavior</kwd><kwd>PDF neurons</kwd><kwd>DN2 neurons</kwd><kwd>thermosensory neurons</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd><italic>D. melanogaster</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100002241</institution-id><institution>Japan Science and Technology Agency</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>PRESTO</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Tanaka</surname><given-names>Nobuaki K</given-names></name><name><surname>Hamada</surname><given-names>Fumika N</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000268</institution-id><institution>Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Stanewsky</surname><given-names>Ralf</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004963</institution-id><institution>Seventh Framework Programme</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Stanewsky</surname><given-names>Ralf</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01 grant GM107582</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Hamada</surname><given-names>Fumika N</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000912</institution-id><institution>March of Dimes Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Basil O'Connor Starter Scholar Research Award</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Hamada</surname><given-names>Fumika N</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>In <italic>Drosophila</italic>, key neurons controlling sleep play an important role in adjusting the temperature set-point before dawn via time-dependent neuronal plasticity within the clock circuits.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>In humans, the phenomenon by which body temperature fluctuates by about one degree over a span of 24 hr is called body temperature rhythm (BTR). From a physiological perspective, this body temperature rhythm is related to sleep. For example, when body temperature decreases at the transition from day to night, sleep latency increases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Refinetti and Menaker, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Aschoff, 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Kräuchi, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Weinert, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Gerhart-Hines et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Kräuchi, 2007a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">2007b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Gilbert et al., 2004</xref>). Little is known, however, about the underlying relationships between sleep and body temperature in terms of neural regulation.</p><p>We have previously shown that <italic>Drosophila</italic> exhibit a daily temperature preference rhythm (TPR), in which their preferred temperatures increase during the daytime and then decrease at the transition from day to night (night-onset) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Kaneko et al., 2012</xref>). Because <italic>Drosophila</italic> are small ectotherms, they achieve a BTR through their choice of environmental temperature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Stevenson, 1985</xref>). Therefore, the concept of BTR is not restricted to mammals, and it is likely that BTR is evolutionarily conserved in mammals and <italic>Drosophila</italic>. Interestingly, our data suggest that TPR is regulated independently from locomotor activity rhythms because, while the dorsal neurons 2 (DN2s) function as a main clock to set the rhythmicity of TPR, PDF expressing lateral ventral neurons (LNvs) are not required for TPR during the daytime (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Kaneko et al., 2012</xref>). On the other hand, LNvs are important for locomotor activity, but DN2s are not. Similarly, in mammals, BTR and locomotor activity rhythms are regulated by different subsets of subparaventricular zone (SPZ) neurons, suggesting that these rhythms are controlled independently as well (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Saper et al., 2005a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">2005b</xref>). Therefore, the mechanisms of TPR appear to be distinct from locomotor activity mechanisms and resemble mammalian BTR.</p><p>Sleep and BTR have a close temporal relationship in mammals and the mechanisms controlling sleep in flies are analogous to those in mammals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Crocker and Sehgal, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Hendricks et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Shaw et al., 2000</xref>). In <italic>Drosophila</italic>, pigment dispersing factor (PDF)-expressing small and large lateral ventral neurons (LNvs) play an important role in modulating sleep and arousal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Sheeba et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Parisky et al., 2008</xref>) and morning anticipation in circadian locomotor activity rhythms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Allada and Chung, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Grima et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Stoleru et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Yao and Shafer, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Stoleru et al., 2005</xref>). Therefore, we first asked whether PDF neurons are involved in regulating TPR. We previously showed that <italic>period</italic> mutants (<italic>per<sup>01</sup></italic>) exhibit abnormal TPR during the daytime and that PERIOD expression in the PDF neurons did not restore normal TPR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Kaneko et al., 2012</xref>). Also, we recently showed that <italic>Pdf <sup>01</sup></italic> mutants exhibit normal preferred temperature during the daytime (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Goda et al., 2016</xref>), suggesting that neither PDF nor PDF neurons are required for regulating the rhythmicity of TPR. However, unexpectedly, we observed that <italic>Pdf <sup>01</sup></italic> mutants prefer a much lower temperature late at night before dawn (ZT16-24) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Goda et al., 2016</xref>). Therefore, we hypothesized that PDF neurons may be involved in regulating preferred temperature before dawn.</p><p>We reveal here that sLNvs, a subset of PDF neurons, are important for pre-dawn temperature preference at ZT22-24. It has been shown that the morphology of sLNvs’ projections varies across the day (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Fernández et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Sivachenko et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Petsakou et al., 2015</xref>), leading to a temporal change in synaptic contacts with other neurons, which is controlled by the circadian clock (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Gorostiza et al., 2014</xref>). Our data suggest that sLNvs contact and activate DN2s, the main clock cells for TPR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Kaneko et al., 2012</xref>), and that these sLNvs-DN2s contacts dramatically fluctuate during the day and peak before dawn (ZT22-24). Interestingly, our data suggest that sLNvs contact thermal sensors, anterior cells (ACs), which express Transient receptor potential (Trp) A1 and regulate temperature preference behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Hamada et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Tang et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Galili et al., 2014</xref>). Therefore, ACs-sLNvs-DN2s neural circuits play important roles in the regulation of pre-dawn temperature preference. Our data show a new role of sLNvs in setting the preferred temperature before dawn, suggesting a possible interaction between sleep-wake cycles and TPR at the neural level.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>PDF neurons are important for temperature preference before dawn</title><p>PDF expressing lateral ventral neurons (LNvs) play an important role in modulating sleep and arousal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Sheeba et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Parisky et al., 2008</xref>) and morning anticipation in circadian locomotor activity rhythms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Allada and Chung, 2010</xref>). Based on this knowledge and our recent finding regarding the much lower temperature preference of <italic>Pdf <sup>01</sup></italic> mutants before dawn (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Goda et al., 2016</xref>), we hypothesized that PDF neurons might be involved in regulating temperature preference before dawn.</p><p>To examine the role of PDF neurons in pre-dawn temperature preference, we used flies in which PDF neurons were constitutively inhibited by overexpression of the mammalian inward rectifier K<sup>+</sup> channel <italic>Kir2.1</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Baines et al., 2001</xref>).

We used flies with impaired clock function by expressing a dominant negative form of <italic>Clock</italic> in the PDF neurons which were previously shown to produce arrhythmic locomotor behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Tanoue et al., 2004</xref>). An impaired endogenous clock in PDF neurons caused lower temperature preferences at ZT19-24 but similar temperature preferences to controls most other times of the day (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). Since these pre-dawn data are consistent with the phenotype of inactivation of PDF neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>), we conclude that the circadian clock in PDF neurons is involved in regulating temperature preference before dawn. Importantly, neither inhibition of PDF neurons, nor impairment of clock function in these cells disrupts temperature preference during the daytime (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3-data">Supplementary file 3</xref>), which is consistent with previous findings that PDF neurons (LNvs) are not required for TPR during the daytime (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Kaneko et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Goda et al., 2016</xref>). Thus, we focused on the role of PDF neurons for temperature preference only before dawn but not during the daytime.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>sLNvs physically contact DN2s</title><p>It has been shown that sLNvs and DN2s contact each other in the larval brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Picot et al., 2009</xref>) and that sLNvs project near DN2s in the adult brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Helfrich-Förster, 2003</xref>). This raises the possibility that sLNvs and DN2s are directly connected in the adult as well. To test this, we performed a GFP Reconstitution Across Synaptic Partners (GRASP) experiment, which has been used to study synaptic connections in several animal models including <italic>Drosophila</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Feinberg et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Gordon and Scott, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Kim et al., 2011</xref>). While neither split-GFP fragment fluoresces individually, split-GFP fragments can reconstitute fluorescence upon cell-cell contact (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Gordon and Scott, 2009</xref>). We used <italic>Clk9M-Gal4; Pdf-Gal80</italic> (DN2 driver) and <italic>Pdf-LexA</italic> (LNvs driver) to express the split-GFP fragments, with <italic>UAS-CD4:spGFP1-10</italic> in DN2s and <italic>LexAop-CD4:spGFP11</italic> in LNvs, respectively.

Since PDF neurons are important for pre-dawn temperature preference (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A and B</xref>), it is possible that morphological changes in sLNv projections may influence pre-dawn temperature preference. In fact, we observed that clock disruption in PDF neurons caused abnormal preferred temperature before dawn (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>), which also supported the possibility that the clock in PDF neurons contributes to this time-dependent plasticity. Therefore, we examined the extent of contacts between sLNvs and DN2s (sLNvs-DN2s) through GRASP analysis over a 24 hr period in an 12 hr: 12 hr light:dark cycle. Strikingly, while the number of sLNvs-DN2s contacts decreased during the daytime (ZT1-12), they dramatically increased during the night (ZT13-24) and peaked at ZT22-24 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D, E and F</xref>). These data are consistent with the recent finding that maximal axonal volume and spread of sLNvs projection are observed at ZT24 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Petsakou et al., 2015</xref>). In summary, our data show that the sLNvs contact the DN2s and that the number of contacts specifically peaks before dawn.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>A functional connection between sLNvs and DN2s</title><p>To examine the functional relationship of the temporally dynamic neuronal connectivity between sLNvs and DN2s, we used the mammalian ATP-gated ionotropic P2X2 receptor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Yao et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Barber et al., 2016</xref>).

The average increase over the baseline (∆F/F) in both sLNvs and DN2s in response to ATP was significant compared to the vehicle controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A2 and B2</xref>). To confirm that the increases of the GCaMP fluorescence were specific to the P2X2 expression in sLNvs, we used flies without P2X2 expression in sLNvs and found that the fluorescence in sLNvs and DN2s did not change in response to ATP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>). The data suggest that the excitation of sLNvs via P2X2 and the subsequent depolarization of sLNvs leads to a cytoplasmic calcium increase in DN2s. Given that the GRASP experiments showed dynamic contacts between sLNvs and DN2s (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>), the data suggest that sLNvs can contact and activate DN2s in a time-dependent manner.<fig-group><fig id="fig3" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.23206.005</object-id><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>sLNvs activate DN2s, and the loss of DN2 activation results in a lower temperature preference.</title><p>(<bold>A1</bold>) A representative graph of sLNv activation via P2X2 expression in sLNvs. Both P2X2 and GCaMP3.0 were expressed in sLNvs by using <italic>Clk9M-Gal4::UAS-GCaMP3.0 / Pdf-LexA:: LexAop-P2X2</italic> flies.

After the TC, flies were released to constant conditions (DD and 20°C) for another 5–6 days (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2B</xref>). After the temperature shift, wild type and control flies rapidly advanced their morning and evening activity peaks established during the LD entrainment.

Although sLNvs are the critical neurons for regulating the rhythmicity of the locomotor activity rhythm as well as sleep, they are not required for the rhythmicity of TPR. Instead, we found that the contribution of sLNvs in temperature preference appears to be only before dawn when animals are waking up, suggesting that sLNvs contribute to both sleep and temperature preference before dawn. Although there is a temporal relationship between BTR and sleep-wake regulation in mammals, the underlying molecular and cellular mechanisms are largely unclear. Our data raise a possible scenario in which there are some neuronal interactions between BTR and sleep-wake regulation.</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>There may be a ‘basal state’ in temperature preference rhythm</title><p>We showed that inhibition, molecular clock disruption and 5HT1B-knockdown in PDF neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1A–B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">4E–F</xref>), ACs’ inhibition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>), and DN2s’ inhibition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C and D</xref>) caused a lower temperature preference. However, it is unclear why these genetically manipulated flies displayed lower rather than higher temperature preference. We suspect that there may be a ‘basal state’ of temperature preference in flies, which could be just above that of noxious cold temperatures to avoid activation of the cold sensors. This is conceivable, given that flies shy away from noxious warm and cold temperatures to congregate at a preferred temperature. Activation of ACs-sLNvs-DN2s neural circuits before dawn may cause divergence from the basal state, while loss of ACs-sLNvs-DN2s stimulation will result in staying in the basal state with a lower temperature preference. Therefore, the clock and normal neuronal activities in sLNvs may function as a cue to prompt the flies to prefer and seek out a warmer (normal) temperature before the daytime begins.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>The neuronal plasticity of sLNvs and DN2s correlates with temperature preference behavior</title><p>We showed that the extent of sLNv-DN2 contacts fluctuate during the day (24 hr) and peaks before dawn (ZT22-24) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). Therefore, the temporal dynamics of sLNvs-DN2s connections seems to correlate with pre-dawn temperature preference behavior. Because sLNvs activate DN2s (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A and B</xref>) and DN2s inhibition causes a lower temperature preference (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C and D</xref>), a higher number of sLNv-DN2 contacts can lead to higher DN2s activation which can cause the flies to prefer a normal (warmer) temperature (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). On the other hand, there are fewer sLNvs-DN2s contacts during ZT4-15, which results in less DN2s modulation by sLNvs. Therefore, the temperature preference may be mainly influenced by sLNvs-DN2s before dawn. Because daily fluctuations of sLNv-DN2 contacts appear to correlate with the behavioral phenotype, sLNv-DN2 neural plasticity seems important in controlling temperature preference before dawn.

Notably, <italic>TrpA1<sup>SH</sup>-Gal4&gt;Kir2.1</italic> flies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>) displayed a more severe phenotype than <italic>TrpA1<sup>SH</sup>-Gal4&gt;TrpA1-RNAi</italic> or <italic>NP0002-Gal4&gt;TrpA1-RNAi</italic> flies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1C–D</xref>). Although there are many potential causes, two are particularly likely. First, it is possible that Kir2.1 has a stronger effect on AC neurons than does the TRPA1 knockdown. Second, we previously showed that AC neurons receive inputs from the TRPA channel PYREXIA (PYX) expressed in the second antennal segment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Tang et al., 2013</xref>). Given that ACs are activated by TRPA1 as well as by PYX (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Tang et al., 2013</xref>), this temperature integration in ACs may contribute to the robust phenotypes of <italic>TrpA1<sup>SH</sup>-Gal4&gt;Kir2.1</italic> flies and may explain the severe phenotype of neuronal silencing compared with TRPA1 knock down in the AC neurons.</p><p>Circadian clock genes are expressed throughout the body in both vertebrates and invertebrates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Plautz et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Green and Besharse, 2004</xref>). The firing rates of sensory neurons, such as olfactory or photoreceptor neurons, are influenced by the autonomous circadian clock within those neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Tanoue et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Green and Besharse, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Granados-Fuentes et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Krishnan et al., 1999</xref>). Therefore, we asked whether clock genes expressed in ACs modulate the AC neurons’ activity. To examine this possibility, we performed immunostaining against the core clock protein Timeless (TIM) in AC neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2</xref>). We found that TIM was not expressed in the AC neurons, suggesting that AC neurons do not contain functional endogenous clocks. Thus, the pre-dawn temperature preference might be caused by modulation of circuits downstream of the AC neurons. If so, the ACs could transmit temperature information to the sLNvs, where the integration and modulation by the circadian clock might occur. However, we have not successfully detected any GCaMP3.0 fluorescence changes at the synaptic contacts between ACs and sLNvs or in the somas of sLNvs so far. Because ACs are serotonergic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Shih and Chiang, 2011</xref>) and sLNvs express the serotonin receptor 5HT1B (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Yuan et al., 2005</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F and G</xref>), driving the Epac-cAMP sensor in sLNvs may be an alternative option for detecting a functional connectivity between sLNvs and ACs. Additionally, Arclight or GCaMP6.0 might be other options. Thus, further studies are necessary for investigating the detailed properties of the functional connection between sLNvs and ACs.</p><p>Another possibility regarding ACs’ involvement in the pre-dawn temperature preference is that ACs may also project to the dorsal protocerebrum where DN2s are located (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4-Figure Supplement 2C4–6</xref>). It is also possible that ACs may directly contact DN2s and modulate the activity of DN2s. Notably, DN2s project to the Pars Intercerebralis (PI) region, which is similar to the mammalian hypothalamus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">de Velasco et al., 2007</xref>) and is involved in metabolism, sleep, and locomotion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Cavanaugh et al., 2014</xref>). Therefore, ambient temperature information provided via ACs may be an important cue for a variety of clock- dependent behaviors or other physiological functions influenced by temperature. Thus, although our data suggest that the neural circuits (ACs-sLNvs-DN2s) regulate temperature preference before dawn, further studies will be needed to understand how the circuits regulate temperature preference in a time-dependent manner.</p></sec><sec id="s3-4"><title>ACs-sLNvs circuits are not required for temperature entrainment</title><p>Our data suggest that ACs-sLNvs circuits are important for pre-dawn temperature preference (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>), raising the question of whether temperature information is being incorporated into circadian circuits.

The weighted mean preferred temperature was calculated by summing the products of the percentage of flies within a one-degree temperature interval and the corresponding temperature (e.g., fractional number of flies X 18.5°C + fractional number of flies X 19.5°C + ........ fractional number of flies X 32.5°C). We tested the temperature preference behavioral assay at least five times in each time zone (ZT1-3, 4–6, 7–9, 10–12, 13–15, 16–18, 19–21 and 22–24). If the SEM of averaged preferred temperatures was not &lt;0.3 after the five trials, we performed more trials until SEM reached &lt;0.3. In order to have a full curve of 24 hr, at least 40 experiments were necessary. In each time zone, the weighted mean preferred temperatures from each trial were averaged together, and the SEM was calculated.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Temperature entrainment assay</title><p>The locomotor activity of 2–3 day old individual adult males was recorded by an automated infrared beam monitoring system (Trikinetics, Waltham USA) as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Sehadova et al., 2009</xref>). Males were initially synchronized to 2–5 LD cycles at 20°C. After the last dark period of the final day in LD, lights were left off (DD) for the rest of the experiment. For the 20°C: 25°C TC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>), the temperature remained at 20°C (LD entrainment temperature) for 6 hr before being increased to 25°C (effectively inducing a 6 hr delay compared with the previous LD cycle). The initial TC continued for 5 days and was then shifted by delaying the temperature increase by 6 hr, and flies were tested for resynchronization to this shifted TC for another 5 days before being released to constant conditions (DD and 20°C). For the 25°C: 29°C TC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2A</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>) the regime was identical except all 20°C periods were 25°C and all 25°C periods were 29°C. For the 20°C: 29°C TC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2B</xref>), the temperature was raised from 20°C (LD entrainment) to 29°C 4 hr after the lights went off in the last LD cycle (effectively inducing an 8 hr advance compared with the previous LD cycle), and kept in 12 hr:12 hr 20°C: 29°C TC for 5 days before being released to constant conditions (DD and 20°C). Daily average histograms were generated in Excel and actograms were plotted using the fly toolbox and MATLab software (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Levine et al., 2002a</xref>). For the daily average histograms showing behavior during TC only, the last 3 days of each TC were averaged to avoid inclusion of transient behavior.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Temperature compensation assay</title><p>For temperature compensation experiments (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl2">Table 2</xref>), <italic>y w; ls-tim</italic> flies were used as control flies. <italic>trpA1<sup>1</sup></italic> carries a deletion of the sixth transmembrane domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Kwon et al., 2008</xref>). <italic>trpA1<sup>W903*</sup></italic> carries a point mutation that encodes a stop codon in the fourth transmembrane domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Zhong et al., 2012</xref>).

Your article has been reviewed by two peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by K VijayRaghavan as the Senior Editor and Reviewing Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal his identity: Todd Holmes (Reviewer #2).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>This works follows excellent work from the same lab on <italic>Drosophila</italic>'s temperature preference rhythm (TPR), which produces a daily rhythm in body temperature. The fact that ectotherms behaviorally produce such daily rhythms in body temperature suggest that such rhythms are a fundamental adaptation among animals to a rhythmic environment. Previous work had identified the DN2 class of clock neurons as the critical clock node for TPR and implicated DH31 modulation of these neurons through the Pigment Dispersing Factor Receptor PDFR as an important signaling mechanism for the normal switch to cooler preferred temperatures at night. Remarkably, the PDF peptide did not appear to be necessary for this switch but mutants lacking PDF preferred significantly lower temperatures than wild-type flies late at night. The manuscript under consideration investigates the network mechanisms by which PDF sets late night temperature preference. The manuscript provides evidence for a network, consisting of heat sensitive AC neurons modulating the s-LNvs, which form excitatory synapses on the DN2s, that governs late night temperature preference. Establishment of such a network would be a significant contribution to the field.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>There are several technical issues that dampen our enthusiasm for this study as currently presented. Yet, addressing these concerns would significantly increase the confidence with which several central results could be interpreted and these concerns are addressable.</p><p>One major technical concern is the genetic drivers used to differentially express transgenes within the DN2s and s-LNvs for the GRASP and <italic>Kir2.1</italic> experiments. Ideally these experiments would employ completely independent GAL4 and LexA drivers, one expressing strongly in the DN2s and the other in the LNvs. Of course, life is never this easy. The GAL4 driver used here for the DN2s (<italic>Clk9M-Gal4</italic>) is also, unfortunately, expressed in the s-LNvs, thus requiring the need for <italic>Pdf-GAL80</italic> to turn-off GAL4/UAS-mediated expression in the s-LNvs. As designed, the experiments in the study essentially require <italic>Pdf-GAL80</italic> silencing of UAS expression to be perfectly complete. Unfortunately, there is no evidence that this is true. This leads to serious concerns about the GRASP signal seen this study and the effects of <italic>Kir2.1</italic> expression driven by <italic>Clk9M-Gal4/Pdf-GAL80</italic>, both of which may simply reflect persistent GAL4 expression in the s-LNvs.</p><p>DN2/s-LNv GRASP: The authors describe GRASP located in the dorsal protocerebrum that is with a synaptic connection between the s-LNvs and the DN2s. Maximal putative GRASP signal between s-LNvs and DN2s corresponded exactly to the previously established time of maximal spread of the s-LNv dorsal projection. Given the possibility of some GAL4 driven expression in the s-LNvs (i.e., incomplete silencing by <italic>Pdf-GAL80</italic>), we are worried that the authors are simply visualizing GFP reconstitution in the axoplasm of s-LNvs. How sure are they that <italic>Pdf-GAL80</italic> has completely silenced UAS driven spGFP1-10 expression in the s-LNvs? One way to reassure the reader (and the authors) that this isn't the case, is to show a complete lack of GRASP signal outside of the dorsal protocerebrum. It would be very reassuring, for example, to see no GFP fluorescence in the s-LNv cell bodies or the first 1/2 of their dorsal projections. We did not see this possibility addressed clearly in the Results section or the figures.</p><p>P2X2: Though the data presented for a physiological connection between s-LNvs and DN2s does support the presence of such a connection, critical negative controls for this experiment are not shown. Though the authors state that preparations in which P2X2 was not driven in the s-LNvs, displayed no responses to ATP, the details of this control were not described and data are not shown. It is critical to show the ATP responses of <italic>Clk9M-Gal4</italic>/UAS-GCaMP/LexAop-P2X2 flies, using the same LexAop-P2X2 element used in the experimental fly. Unfortunately, leaky P2X2 expression is always a possibility and must be controlled for. We think the authors should show these control experiments to fully control for this important observation.</p><p><italic>Kir2.1</italic> inhibition of DN2s: Isn't it possible, given the concern about incomplete silencing of UAS expression by <italic>Pdf-GAL80</italic>, that this is simply phenocopying Pdf-GAL4/UAS-<italic>Kir2.1</italic> because there is enough <italic>Kir2.1</italic> expression in the s-LNvs to result in inhibition? This is especially worrisome in this case, as it appears that there are two copies of the <italic>Clk9M-Gal4</italic> present in these experimental flies.</p><p>AC/s-LNv connection. This would be a major finding with big implications for how temperature input makes its way into the circadian system. It is very nice to see that the GRASP signal between these two neuron types persists even when the more specific AC driver (<italic>NP0002-Gal4</italic>) is used. GRASP alone is not compelling evidence that the AC neurons form synapses on or modulatory connections with the s-LNvs. The two neurons may simply rest in close apposition (the dorsal protocerebrum is a busy place) or, if there is a connection, the PDF neurons could be modulating the AC neurons. Without evidence for a physiological connection between AC neurons and s-LNvs it is impossible to interpret the GRASP results. We are curious why the authors did not try to confirm the presence of a connection with P2X2, as this technique is used to make the case for the s-LNv to DN2 connection earlier in the paper. Existing sensors are quite likely to be sensitive enough to detect even an inhibitory or modulatory connection between the AC neurons and the s-LNvs.</p><p>In summary this is a promising and interesting study that would be significantly strengthened by an increase in technical rigor. Further, we recommend they add citation of a recent publication Barber et al., 2016, Genes &amp; Dev, that supports their use of the pre-synaptic P2X2/post-synaptic GCaMP assay for functional connectivity.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were requested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for resubmitting your work entitled &quot;The role of PDF neurons in setting preferred temperature before dawn in <italic>Drosophila</italic>&quot; for further consideration at <italic>eLife</italic>. Your revised article has been favorably evaluated by K VijayRaghavan as the Senior Editor and Reviewing Editor, and two reviewers.</p><p>The manuscript has been improved but there are some remaining issues that need to be addressed before acceptance, as outlined below:</p><p>In particular, please see the concerns of reviewer 2, which needs to be well-addressed.

It's unfortunate that the authors did not push this further (they outline a reasonable set of experiments to do so in their response to the review) as it would have made this very nice study even stronger.</p><p>This is a solid contribution to the field that sheds light on the connections mediating temperature preference rhythms in <italic>Drosophila</italic>, a unique area of field in which the PI continues to make excellent progress.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic> </p><p>Overall, I am satisfied with the revised manuscript. However, the authors have not entirely addressed the concern of one of the reviewers about the physiological certainty of the functional connections between the AC neurons and the sLNv. Thus, I think it is in everyone's best interest if the authors revise the tone of their claims to reflect this significant qualification. At present, the language in the text is too assertive in my opinion.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.23206.021</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>Essential revisions:</italic> </p><p><italic>There are several technical issues that dampen our enthusiasm for this study as currently presented.

We conclude that Pdf-GAL80 can silence the Clk9M-Gal4 expression in sLNvs and added this information in the Materials and methods.</p><p><italic>DN2/s-LNv GRASP: The authors describe GRASP located in the dorsal protocerebrum that is with a synaptic connection between the s-LNvs and the DN2s.

The GRASP signals were clearly visible in the dorsal protocerebrum, but not in the s-LNv cell bodies or the first half of their dorsal projections. We also confirm it using PDF antibody to label LNvs in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>.</p><p><italic>P2X2: Though the data presented for a physiological connection between s-LNvs and DN2s does support the presence of such a connection, critical negative controls for this experiment are not shown.

Unfortunately, leaky P2X2 expression is always a possibility and must be controlled for. We think the authors should show these control experiments to fully control for this important observation.</italic> </p><p>As the reviewer suggested, we performed the additional negative control in the P2X2 experiment using <italic>Clk9M-Gal4::UAS-GCaMP x LexAop-P2X2</italic> flies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>). The fluorescence in sLNvs and DN2s did not increase upon the ATP application. On the other hand, we also performed the same experiment in Figure 3AB as a positive control and reached the same conclusion. Thus, the data indicates that the responses in Figure 3AB were specific due to P2X2 activation in sLNvs by ATP.</p><p><italic>Kir2.1 inhibition of DN2s: Isn't it possible, given the concern about incomplete silencing of UAS expression by Pdf-GAL80, that this is simply phenocopying Pdf-GAL4/UAS-Kir2.1 because there is enough Kir2.1 expression in the s-LNvs to result in inhibition? This is especially worrisome in this case, as it appears that there are two copies of the Clk9M-Gal4 present in these experimental flies.</italic></p><p>We would like to point out that only one copy of the <italic>Clk9M-Gal4</italic> was used in the <italic>Kir2.1</italic> inhibition of DN2s (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). Because some of the genotypes of fly lines were not clearly written in the previous manuscript, we have revised them.</p><p>As mentioned above, we showed that <italic>Clk9M-Gal4; Pdf-GAL80</italic> does not drive sLNvs and that sLNvs-DN2s GRASP signals were not visible in the sLNvs’ somas. The data suggest that <italic>Pdf-GAL80</italic> is sufficient to block the expression of <italic>Clk9M-Gal4</italic> in sLNvs. Therefore, we conclude that DN2 inhibition causes the phenotype of the lower temperature preference of <italic>Clk9M-Gal4/UAS-Kir2.1; Pdf-GAL80/+</italic> flies.</p><p><italic>AC/s-LNv connection. This would be a major finding with big implications for how temperature input makes its way into the circadian system. It is very nice to see that the GRASP signal between these two neuron types persists even when the more specific AC driver (NP0002-Gal4) is used. GRASP alone is not compelling evidence that the AC neurons form synapses on or modulatory connections with the s-LNvs. The two neurons may simply rest in close apposition (the dorsal protocerebrum is a busy place) or, if there is a connection, the PDF neurons could be modulating the AC neurons. Without evidence for a physiological connection between AC neurons and s-LNvs it is impossible to interpret the GRASP results. We are curious why the authors did not try to confirm the presence of a connection with P2X2, as this technique is used to make the case for the s-LNv to DN2 connection earlier in the paper. Existing sensors are quite likely to be sensitive enough to detect even an inhibitory or modulatory connection between the AC neurons and the s-LNvs.</italic> </p><p>We have tried to obtain evidence for a physiological connection between ACs and sLNvs. We focused on both the synaptic locus of sLNvs-ACs and the somas of sLNvs using a normal upright microscope. While GCaMP3.0 was expressed in sLNvs, P2X2 was expressed in ACs. We activated ACs by ATP or alternatively by warm temperature. However, we have not successfully detected any GCaMP fluorescence change in sLNvs.</p><p>The most challenging aspect was to find an optimal depth or location at the synaptic locus of sLNvs-ACs because there was no marker at the sLNvs-ACs synaptic locus. The sLNVs-ACs contacts were fewer and weaker than that of sLNvs-DN2s based on experiments relying on GRASP signals. Therefore, the G- CaMP3.0 fluorescence changes in the synaptic regions of sLNvs-ACs might be difficult to capture. We are currently setting up confocal microscopy with GaAsP which should allow us to capture weaker signals located at the deeper brain regions.</p><p>Given that serotonin signaling is important for the ACs-sLNvs communication (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figures 4E and F</xref>), driving the Epac-cAMP sensor in sLNvs might be an option for detecting a functional connectivity within the sLNvs-ACs synaptic locus.</p><p>Furthermore, to obtain a robust fluorescence change in both terminal regions and somas of sLNvs, other reporters such as Arclight or G-CaMP6.0 might be useful. Thus, further studies will be necessary for investigating the detailed properties of the functional connection between sLNvs and ACs.</p><p>Due to the lack of physiological evidence, the functional basis between ACs and sLNvs is still not clear. It is possible that information could be modified in both direction of the AC-sLNv connection and we do not exclude the possibility that sLNvs could modulate ACs' activity. That said, it is known that ACs are serotonergic and do not have dendrite projections in the dorsal protocerebrum. Given that 5HT1B-RNAI in sLNvs caused abnormal temperature preference before dawn, we prefer a model in which the information flows from ACs to sLNvs at this point.</p><p><italic>In summary this is a promising and interesting study that would be significantly strengthened by an increase in technical rigor. Further, we recommend they add citation of a recent publication Barber et al., 2016, Genes &amp; Dev, that supports their use of the pre-synaptic P2X2/post-synaptic GCaMP assay for functional connectivity.</italic> </p><p>We added the reference.
