difficult to investigate in vivo, partially due to lack of suitable tools. Here, we present the GrabFP system, a collection of four nanobody-based GFP-traps that localize to defined positions along the apical-basal axis. We show that the localization preference of the GrabFP traps can impose a novel localization on GFP-tagged target proteins and results in their controlled mislocalization. These new tools were used to mislocalize transmembrane and cytoplasmic GFP fusion proteins in the <italic>Drosophila</italic> wing disc epithelium and to investigate the effect of protein mislocalization. Furthermore, we used the GrabFP system as a tool to study the extracellular dispersal of the Decapentaplegic (Dpp) protein and show that the Dpp gradient forming in the lateral plane of the <italic>Drosophila</italic> wing disc epithelium is essential for patterning of the wing imaginal disc.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.22549.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.22549.001</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>nanobody</kwd><kwd>morphogen</kwd><kwd>Dpp</kwd><kwd>protein localization</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd><italic>D. melanogaster</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>SystemsX.ch Initiative (MorphogenetiX)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Affolter</surname><given-names>Markus</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Schweizerischer Nationalfonds zur Förderung der Wissenschaftlichen Forschung</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Affolter</surname><given-names>Markus</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Grants from cantons Basel-Stadt and Basel-Land</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Affolter</surname><given-names>Markus</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>University of Basel</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>'Fellowships for Excellence' PhD Program of the Biozentrum</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Harmansa</surname><given-names>Stefan</given-names></name><name><surname>Alborelli</surname><given-names>Ilaria</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Functionalized protein binders, anchored to specific regions along the cell cortex, provide a novel approach to directly modify protein localization and dispersal in vivo.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Despite of its importance, the role of protein localization and the effects of forced protein mislocalization have not been studied extensively and hence remain in many cases not well understood. Over the last few years, genetically encoded protein binders have been introduced to basic biological research and provide novel means for protein manipulation in vivo. While protein function was largely studied by genetic manipulation at the DNA or RNA levels in the past, protein binders allow direct, specific and acute modification and interference of protein function in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Kaiser et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bieli et al., 2016</xref>) and might therefore represent valid tools to study protein localization.</p><p>Several types of protein binders exist (for recent reviews see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Helma et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Plückthun, 2015</xref>). One class of widely applied protein binders are the so-called nanobodies, which are derived from single chain antibodies found in members of the Camelid family. A nanobody specifically recognizing GFP (vhhGFP4, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Saerens et al., 2005</xref>) has been extensively used for cell and developmental biology applications. Importantly, vhhGFP4 functions in the intracellular environment and can be fused to other proteins without losing its activity and specificity in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Rothbauer et al., 2008</xref>). As a consequence, vhhGFP4 has been functionalized by fusing it to different protein domains in order to visualize (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Rothbauer et al., 2006</xref>), relocalize (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Berry et al., 2016</xref>) and degrade (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Caussinus et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Shin et al., 2015</xref>) GFP-tagged proteins of interest. More recently, GFP nanobodies were used to generate inducible tools that allow controlled transcription (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Tang et al., 2013</xref>) and enzyme activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Tang et al., 2015</xref>), and to generate synthetic receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Harmansa et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Morsut et al., 2016</xref>), to mention only a few examples.</p><p>Recently, we utilized vhhGFP4 to create a synthetic receptor for GFP-tagged signaling molecules and termed it morphotrap (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Harmansa et al., 2015</xref>). Morphotrap consists of a fusion protein between vhhGFP4 and the mouse CD8 transmembrane protein, designed such that the nanobody is presented extracellularly along the surface of cells. In combination with a GFP-tagged version of the Decapentaplegic (eGFP-Dpp) morphogen, morphotrap proved to be a powerful tool to modify and study secretion and extracellular dispersal of eGFP-Dpp in the <italic>Drosophila</italic> wing disc tissue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Harmansa et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>Here, we introduce the GrabFP (grab Green Fluorescent Protein) toolbox, consisting of morphotrap and five novel synthetic GFP-traps that either localize to both the apical and basolateral compartment (morphotrap) or preferentially to one compartment: apical (GrabFP-A) or basolateral (GrabFP-B, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). For each of these three localizations, two versions were constructed in which the vhhGFP4 domain either faces the extracellular space (GrabFP<sub>Ext</sub>) or the intracellular milieu (GrabFP<sub>Int</sub>). Consequently, the GrabFP system can be used to interfere with target proteins in the extracellular and the intracellular space (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>).<fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.22549.002</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>The GrabFP constructs localize to distinct regions along the apical-basal axis.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Linear representation of the six different versions of the GrabFP system; the constructs exist in two topologies with the GFP-nanobody (vhhGFP4) either facing extracellular (Ext) or intracellular (Int).

As a proof of principle experiment, we characterized the phenotypical consequences of mislocalizing the Myosin II regulatory light chain Spaghetti-squash.

Our results suggest that the functional Dpp morphogen gradient forms in the lateral plane of the wing disc epithelium.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>The GrabFP system consists of localized GFP-traps</title><p>Analogous to morphotrap, the novel GFP-traps GrabFP-A and GrabFP-B are fusion proteins consisting of vhhGFP4 fused to transmembrane proteins determining the localization and to a fluorescent protein as a marker (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). All constructs of the GrabFP system were implemented as Gal4 and LexA-inducible transgenes (see Materials and methods).</p><p>To test the localization and function of the GrabFP system, we made use of the <italic>Drosophila</italic> wing imaginal disc epithelium, a well-characterized model system to study epithelial polarity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Tepass, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Flores-Benitez and Knust, 2016</xref>) and dispersal of extracellular signaling proteins, for example morphogens (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Thérond, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Gradilla and Guerrero, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Akiyama and Gibson, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Langton et al., 2016</xref>). The wing imaginal disc consists of two contiguous, monolayered epithelial sheets, the pseudo stratified disc proper (DP) epithelium and the squamous peripodial epithelium (PPE; see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). The apical surface of both, the DP and the PPE, is facing a luminal cavity formed between them. In this study, we characterized the expression and activity of the GrabFP toolset focusing on the columnar cells of the DP epithelium, which will form the adult wing. Visualization of the junctions via the localization of the septate junction component Discs-large (Dlg, see Materials and methods) was used to mark the border separating the apical and basolateral compartment in DP cells.</p><p>In order to restrict the GFP-traps to specific regions along the A-B axis, the GFP-nanobody was fused to a protein of known subcellular localization. Morphotrap, based on the mouse CD8 protein scaffold, was shown to localize to both the apical and the basolateral domains (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Harmansa et al., 2015</xref>). The morphotrap<sub>Int</sub> construct, in which the nanobody faces the cytosol, also localizes to the apical and basolateral compartments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>).</p><p>In order to generate an apically anchored trap (GrabFP-A), we made use of the transcript 48 (T48) protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Kölsch et al., 2007</xref>). However, since a fusion protein between the GFP-nanobody, T48, and mCherry showed only mild apical enrichment (not shown), we additionally attached the minimal localization domain of Bazooka (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Krahn et al., 2010</xref>) to the C-terminus of the fusion protein (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref> and Materials and methods for details). Expression in DP cells of both versions of GrabFP-A, GrabFP-A<sub>Ext</sub> and GrabFP-A<sub>Int</sub>, resulted in strong enrichment in the apical compartment, while only minor amounts of GrabFP-A<sub>Ext</sub> or GrabFP-A<sub>Int</sub> were observed along the basolateral domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref>).</p><p>Our basolaterally anchored GFP-trap GrabFP-B is based on the Nrv1 protein scaffold (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Sun and Salvaterra, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Xu et al., 1999</xref>).

Therefore, single components of the GrabFP system were co-expressed with different target proteins in defined domains of the wing imaginal disc (<italic>hh::Gal4</italic> for GrabFP<sub>Ext</sub> and <italic>ptc::Gal4</italic> for GrabFP<sub>Int</sub>), while neighboring areas were used as an internal control for the analysis of wild-type target protein localization. We analysed and measured the changes in distribution along the A-B axis of a total of 15 GFP/YFP-tagged proteins, of which 11 were transmembrane/membrane-anchored and four were cytoplasmic proteins. We used target proteins localizing either exclusively to a subcellular compartment (apical or basolateral) or, alternatively, throughout the A-B axis. In order to represent target protein localization, we plotted GFP/YFP fluorescence along the A-B axis.</p><p>However, it is known that the binding of nanobodies can interfere with the fluorescent properties of GFP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Kirchhofer et al., 2010</xref>). We therefore tested if binding of vhhGFP4 to eGFP results in changes of eGFP fluorescence in vitro. Indeed, we observed that binding of vhhGFP4 to eGFP modulated the fluorescent properties of eGFP and resulted in a 1.47-fold increase in eGFP fluorescence in vitro (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref> and Materials and methods for details). Hence, it is important to consider the possibility that binding of GFP/YFP to our GrabFP traps results in modulation of GFP/YFP fluorescence in vivo. In such a scenario, the observed increase in fluorescence due to GrabFP-mediated mislocalization would be an overestimation of real protein levels. To account for this likeliness in our quantifications, we included A-B profiles of the observed GFP/YFP fluorescence levels (continuous red line) as well as profiles that were corrected for a potential fluorescence increase at GrabFP-positive positions (dashed red line, see Materials and methods for details).</p><p>We tested the GrabFP<sub>Ext</sub> system, which displays the anti-GFP nanobody along the extracellular side (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>), in combination with eight transmembrane proteins extracellularly tagged with GFP/YFP. Expression of either GrabFP-A<sub>Ext</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B,C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A–B</xref>) or GrabFP-B<sub>Ext</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D,E,F</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1C–D</xref>) caused significant changes in the distribution of all eight proteins tested. Generally, GrabFP-A<sub>Ext</sub> efficiently induced mislocalization of target proteins (i.e. the gain of a novel apical fraction in proteins excluded from the apical compartment, as seen for NrxIV-YFP, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>) and stabilization of an existing apical fraction (as seen for Dlp-YFP, Dally-YFP, PMCA-YFP, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A–B</xref>). However, GrabFP-A<sub>Ext</sub> expression did not result in efficient depletion of the basolateral protein fraction (see plots <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B–C</xref>). This might be due to the fact that GrabFP-A<sub>Ext</sub> itself was partially mislocalized by the interaction with polarized target proteins and showed enhanced localization to the basolateral compartment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1E</xref>). In contrast, GrabFP-B<sub>Ext</sub> displayed a strong potential in depleting apical target-protein fractions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D–F</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1C–D</xref>). In particular, GrabFP-B<sub>Ext</sub> significantly reduced the apical pool and increased the basolateral fraction of Dally-YFP, Notch-YFP, Fra-YFP, Crb-GFP and Ed-YFP. Furthermore, GrabFP-B<sub>Ext</sub> was resistant to mislocalization induced by target protein-interaction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1F</xref>).<fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.22549.007</object-id><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Mislocalization of transmembrane proteins using the GrabFP<sub>Ext</sub> system.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) In the GrabFP<sub>Ext</sub> system, the GFP-nanobody (vhhGFP4) faces the extracellular space and can interact with extracellular-tagged transmembrane proteins.

To this aim, we used three transmembrane proteins (Fat, Nrv1, Nrv2) containing an intracellular GFP/YFP tag and 3 GFP/YFP-tagged cytoplasmic proteins (Arm, αCat, Hts). We observed significant changes in the distribution of both transmembrane and cytoplasmic target proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B–F</xref>). GrabFP-B<sub>Int</sub> efficiently depleted the apical fraction of Fat-GFP and induced strong enrichment of its basolateral fraction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>).

Subapical projections (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>) as well as optical cross sections (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E’</xref>) showed that low amounts of eGFP-Dpp accumulated on the apical surface of morphotrap clones. However, the prominent majority of eGFP-Dpp accumulation was observed along the basolateral cell surface of morphotrap clones (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>).

In line with this, functional interference with Dpp spreading in the basolateral compartment only (GrabFP-B<sub>Ext</sub>) suggests that the patterning function of the Dpp gradient is brought about to a large extend by Dpp spreading in the lateral plane of the wing disc epithelium. Growth control, in contrast, is influenced by Dpp dispersing in both the lateral and in the basal planes. These results are based on the findings that restricting basolateral Dpp dispersal (using GrabFP-B<sub>Ext</sub>) strongly impairs pattern and size while immobilizing eGFP-Dpp in the BL (using GrabFP-ECM) only impairs the size of the <italic>Drosophila</italic> wing.</p><p>Our finding of a prominent role of the basolateral compartment in Dpp spreading is interesting with regard to the mechanism of gradient formation and, at the same time, raises several new questions. Dpp gradient formation in the <italic>Drosophila</italic> wing disc remains a paradigm to study morphogen dispersal and several mechanisms for morphogen gradient formation have been suggested, operating in different extracellular environments (for a recent review see [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Akiyama and Gibson, 2015</xref>]). These proposed mechanisms include free extracellular diffusion in the wing disc lumen (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Zhou et al., 2012</xref>), restricted extracellular diffusion in the lateral plane of the epithelium (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Belenkaya et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Akiyama et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Schwank et al., 2011</xref>), and active transport by actin-based filopodial extensions called cytonemes along the apical surface of DP cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hsiung et al., 2005</xref>). While the formation of the functional Dpp gradient in the lateral compartment is compatible with a restricted extracellular diffusion mechanism, it is not as easily compatible with the formation of a functional Dpp gradient via free diffusion in the lumen or with a key role of apical cytonemes in Dpp readout. Since we have not been able to visualize apical cytonemes, neither in wild type discs nor in disc, in which Dpp spreading along the basolateral side was blocked, we cannot make firm statements about a direct involvement of apical cytonemes in either situation.</p><p>In line with Dpp gradient formation via restricted extracellular diffusion, several studies highlighted that Dpp morphogen receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Lecuit et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Lecuit and Cohen, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Lander et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Crickmore and Mann, 2006</xref>) and interaction partners (e.g. Dally, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Belenkaya et al., 2004</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Akiyama et al., 2008</xref>) found along the extracellular surface of target cells crucially influence morphogen gradient shape. Therefore, future studies will need to investigate the localization and the effect of forced mislocalization of Dpp receptors and interaction partners on Dpp dispersal and gradient formation. Furthermore, using a GrabFP toolset based on nanobodies or protein binders against other fluorescent proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Brauchle et al., 2014</xref>), the Dpp ligand and the Dpp receptors or interaction partners could be localized to different compartments and the effect of such altered localization could confirm or refute emerging hypotheses. Of course, it will be of critical importance to complement the results obtained using the GrabFP system with functional studies interfering with trafficking and secretion of Dpp.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Material and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Fly strains</title><p>The following fly lines were used: <italic>y<sup>1</sup>w<sup>1118</sup></italic> (wild-type control), Crb-GFP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Huang et al., 2009</xref>). <italic>dpp::LG86Fb</italic> (K.

However, vhhGFP4 concentrations of 54 nM or higher resulted in increased eGFP fluorescence. This increase plateaued for amounts of 108 nM and above (corresponding to a 1:2 ratio of eGFP to vhhGFP4). To estimate the mean increase in eGFP fluorescence when the plateau was reached (at saturating conditions), we calculated the mean value of all data points at plateau conditions (108 and 216 nM vhhGFP4); which resulted in a mean eGFP fluorescence increase of 47.5% or 1.475-fold under saturating conditions.

Profiles were then extracted up to the edge of the wing disc with a 30% offset in the dorsal compartment along a line parallel to the D/V boundary (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Hamaratoglu et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Harmansa et al., 2015</xref>).

letter and accompanying author responses. A lightly edited version of the letter sent to the authors after peer review is shown, indicating the most substantive concerns; minor comments are not usually included.</p></boxed-text><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;A nanobody-based toolset to investigate the role of protein localization and dispersal in <italic>Drosophila</italic>&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by two peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by K VijayRaghavan as the Reviewing Editor and Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal his identity: Frank Schnorrer (Reviewer #1).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>In this manuscript Affolter and colleagues expand their previous studies on nanobody-based protein trapping in <italic>Drosophila</italic>. They produce 5 novel synthetic GFP traps, together named 'Grab-FP toolbox' that trap GFP-fusion proteins everywhere at the cell membrane or preferentially at the apical or basolateral side of polarised epithelial cells. For each, 2 versions were developed with the trap facing intracellularly or extracellularly.</p><p>These new tools were used to re-localise GFP fusion proteins expressed in the wing disc epitelium at endogenous levels. For example, 8 of 8 transmembrane GFP fusion proteins were re-localised using the extracellular Grab-FP. This was particularly effective when re-localising from the apical to the basolateral membrane.</p><p>Also, cytoplasmic proteins can be re-localised. An impressive example was Myosin light chain, Sqh-GFP, that led to basolateral constriction of the cell when re-localised basally. This shows the power of the technique used here.</p><p>Finally, they used the basolateral extracellular trap to show that Dpp-GFP, expressed with dpp-lexA largely travels basolaterally to produce the Dpp protein gradient.</p><p>In summary, the experiments are well designed and the data support the authors' conclusions. I am impressed by the high quality of the data shown, in particular the quantifications of the immuno-fluorescent images</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>Concern 1.</p><p>Unfortunately, the functional consequences of protein mis-localisation were only investigated for Sqh-GFP and Dpp-GFP. As most of the Dpp is found basolaterally, it is not surprising that trapping it basolaterally produces the same phenotype as trapping it everywhere at the membrane (which was beautifully shown before), so the novelty is limited. As the authors discuss, specific trapping at the apical membrane would have been interesting, but was not possible with their system.</p><p>In order to make a strong point of the general usefulness of these new tools, it would be interesting to report if mis-localisation of the transmembrane proteins tested here like Crumbs, Notch etc. result in any functional consequences. Data from Berry et al. 2016 <italic>eLife</italic> argue that many proteins are surprisingly tolerant for moving them elsewhere in the cell. What do the authors see?</p><p>Concern 2.</p><p>2A. Other issues concern the quantification of the G/YFP signal and concern mainly <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">3</xref>, and their supplementary figures (micrographs and plots showing relative GFP concentration/signal). Can the authors show (or cite work that shows) that binding of the nanobody does not affect GFP/YFP signal intensity?</p><p>2B. The authors show rel. G/YFP signal in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">3</xref> and supplementary figures. Relative to what is not clear. In most (but not all) cases it appears that the highest value along the a-b/l axis was set to 1. Absolute values measured in the same parallel experiments would seem more informative, in particular because it is not known whether the changes in distribution are caused by relocalization to another compartment or by stabilization of the fraction in the target compartment.</p><p>The Methods section states that images were acquired in the same session with the same solutions (for the 1um sections). However, it seems that confocal microscope settings were not identical and that they were optimized for individual pictures (&quot;imaging conditions within the linear range…&quot;). This would prevent a quantitative comparison between the control and the experimental sample.</p><p>Also, it is unclear, which of the two immunostaining paragraphs described in the Methods section applies to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>.</p><p>2C. Given the problems comparing experimental and control quantifications, Figures G and H are not adequate. They would be appropriate for absolute values acquired under identical conditions (but not if individual pictures were adjusted to using the entire dynamic range). For these reasons, the 2.8 and 12.6-fold enrichment, mentioned in the third paragraph of the subsection “Mislocalizing transmembrane and cytosolic proteins along the A-B axis using the GrabFP system” are overinterpretations. The same applies to the GrabFP-B value.</p><p>Micrographs and intensity curves in these figures are somewhat confusing because at first sight they often seem not to match (e.g. in many cases the GrabFP panels show different GFP intensities in the basolateral region than controls, but the red and black curves show the opposite difference for this region; see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C, F</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>).</p><p>The authors should be able to come up with an appropriate improvement on these points without necessarily doing additional experiments. One reviewer was not able to unambiguously figure out how they acquired their pics. Ideally, they have used the same settings in the experimental and corresponding control session and the settings were chosen such that even the strongest signal remained in the linear range. However, because they do not describe it in this way, it is possible that they either simply forgot to mention this one point or that they did not do it this way. In theory, you would not need an internal fluorescent standard with this approach if the disc-to-disc variations from the same experiment remained reasonable (because they used the same solutions and mounted the samples on the same slide). In short, if they have more &quot;absolute&quot; data that does not show too much variation, they should show it. Otherwise they should simply address these issues, trying to improve <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">3</xref> where they can and briefly discuss the issues.</p><p>Concern 3.</p><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref> / eGFP-Dpp studies.</p><p>In the second paragraph of the subsection Dpp disperses in the apical and in the basolateral compartment”, the authors claim that they did not detect eGFP-Dpp in the lumen. It is difficult to quantify luminal signals because they easily get washed out during fixation and staining unless they are crosslinked to a membrane. This is also suggested by the results in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B, D</xref>. An additional control would be needed to make these claims.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.22549.027</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>Essential revisions:</italic> </p><p><italic>Concern 1.</italic> </p><p><italic>Unfortunately, the functional consequences of protein mis-localisation were only investigated for Sqh-GFP and Dpp-GFP.

However, we think that this does not limit the novelty, since these findings address a longstanding question in the field, namely if the functional Dpp morphogen gradient forms in the apical/luminal or in the basolateral compartment (Entchev, Schwabedissen et al. 2000, Teleman and Cohen 2000, Gibson, Lehman et al. 2002). More importantly, this is the first time that we have functionally interfered with specific sub-pools of the Dpp morphogen and directly access their respective contribution to patterning and growth. We are convinced that the tools and concepts we describe in this manuscript provide the research community with powerful novel means to address similar questions regarding the spreading of other morphogens, such as Hedgehog and Wingless and other secreted proteins.</p><p><italic>In order to make a strong point of the general usefulness of these new tools, it would be interesting to report if mis-localisation of the transmembrane proteins tested here like Crumbs, Notch etc. result in any functional consequences. Data from Berry et al. 2016 eLife argue that many proteins are surprisingly tolerant for moving them elsewhere in the cell. What do the authors see?</italic> </p><p>We now have performed experiments in which we mislocalize the apical proteins Crumbs-GFP or Notch-YFP in homozygous GFP/YFP-tagged backgrounds using Grab-B<sub>Ext</sub>. Indeed, we observe functional consequences due to protein mislocalization. Notch mislocalization has a strong phenotypical impact on wing disc shape. The pouch of Notch-YFP hemizygous males expressing GrabFP-B<sub>Ext</sub> in their posterior compartment is severely stretched along the dorso-ventral axis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Author response image 1</xref>). Surprisingly, we observe ectopic induction of the Notch target Wg along the anterior-posterior boundary (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Author response image 1B, C</xref>). Ectopic expression of Wg along the A/P boundary results in up-regulation of the Wg target Distalless (Dll) (Figure RB1E mid panel). Furthermore, we observe increased cell division along the ectopic Wg stripe (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Author response image 1E</xref> right panel). This altered proliferation pattern might account for the elongated disc shape caused by N-YFP mislocalization. Interestingly, Wg is induced in a stripe of cells adjacent to the region expressing GrabFP-B<sub>Ext</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Author response image 1C</xref>). The molecular mechanism underlying Wg activation in this condition remains elusive and requires further in-depth investigations, which are out-of-the scope for the framework of this manuscript. However, it is known that Notch signalling is tightly regulated by the distribution of its ligand and interaction partners (Troost and Klein 2012 and several others) and that the apical localization of Notch receptor is required for Notch signalling activity (Sasaki, Sasamura et al. 2007). Accordingly, our data suggest that receptor function is influenced by the cellular environment and is drastically modified when pathway components are moved to a different cellular compartment.<fig id="fig9" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.22549.023</object-id><label>Author response image 1.</label><caption><title>N-YFP mislocalization causes the induction of an ectopic Wg stripe.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Representative wing disc of a N-YFP (green) hemizygous male (control) stained for Wg (upper panel, blue; lower panel, black).

(and as the reviewers suggested), there are cases in which the cell is surprisingly tolerant to forced protein mislocalization. However, our data show that alteration in the subcellular protein distribution can result in dramatic phenotypic changes (see Sqh-GFP or Notch-YFP mislocalization). In conclusion, we believe that our first investigations show that protein mislocalization in a homozygous GFP/YFP-tagged background results in novel, not yet described phenotypes that clearly differ from classical genetic manipulation studies. This suggests that our tools allow addressing questions, which are difficult to answer using existing tools.</p><p><italic>Concern 2.</italic> </p><p><italic>2A. Other issues concern the quantification of the G/YFP signal and concern mainly <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">3</xref>, and their supplementary figures (micrographs and plots showing relative GFP concentration/signal). Can the authors show (or cite work that shows) that binding of the nanobody does not affect GFP/YFP signal intensity?</italic> </p><p>This is a very valid concern, that we have neglected in the first version of our manuscript. Indeed, it was shown before that nanobody binding can result in the modulation of GFP fluorescence properties (Kirchhofer, Helma et al. 2010). In order to address if binding of GFP to the nanobody we used (vhhGFP4) modifies the fluorescent properties of the former, we have now included the results of an in vitro fluorescence assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>).</p><p>To estimate the changes in eGFP fluorescence upon binding of the nanobody, we have titrated purified nanobody on purified eGFP in vitro and measured the changes in fluorescence levels (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>, explained in detail in the Methods section: “Purification of eGFP and vhhGFP4 and fluorescence assay”). The results we obtain from five independent repetitions consistently show that binding of the nanobody to eGFP results in an average increase in fluorescence levels of roughly 50% under saturating conditions.</p><p>Importantly, the implications of this result on the conclusion of our experiments is limited to those observations in which existing fractions were modified in their levels. (such as seen for Dally or Dlp). In contrast, in most conditions the expression of the GrabFP system resulted in the gain of a novel fraction (as for NrxIV, Nrv1 and Nrv2) or the loss of an existing one (as for Crb, Notch, Ed or Fat). In the latter case, when a fraction is lost, increasing EGFP fluorescence due to nanobody binding does not affect the obtained interpretations. However, when gaining a novel fraction, we have to put into perspective that this novel fraction is overestimated by roughly 50% bigger due to the effects of nanobody-binding.</p><p>In order to provide a fair representation of this effect, we now included profiles which were corrected for the effect of nanobody binding on eGFP fluorescence (for detail see Methods section: “Extraction of concentration profiles along the apical-basal axis”). Therefore, we now show in our graphs both the original, non-corrected profiles (continuous lines) and the corrected profiles (dashed lines). In addition, all our statistical analysis is done on the corrected data to avoid any over interpretation of our data.</p><p>These findings are included in the main text:</p><p>“However, it is known that the binding of nanobodies can interfere with the fluorescent properties of GFP (Kirchhofer, Helma et al. 2010). […] To account for this likeliness in our quantifications, we included A-B profiles of the observed GFP/YFP fluorescence levels (continuous red line) as well as profiles that were corrected for a potential fluorescence increase at GrabFP-positive positions (dashed red line, see methods for details).”</p><p><italic>2B. The authors show rel. G/YFP signal in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">3</xref> and supplementary figures. Relative to what is not clear. In most (but not all) cases it appears that the highest value along the a-b/l axis was set to 1. Absolute values measured in the same parallel experiments would seem more informative, in particular because it is not known whether the changes in distribution are caused by relocalization to another compartment or by stabilization of the fraction in the target compartment.</italic> </p><p><italic>The Methods section states that images were acquired in the same session with the same solutions (for the 1um sections). However, it seems that confocal microscope settings were not identical and that they were optimized for individual pictures (&quot;imaging conditions within the linear range…&quot;). This would prevent a quantitative comparison between the control and the experimental sample.</italic> </p><p><italic>Also, it is unclear, which of the two immunostaining paragraphs described in the Methods section applies to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>.</italic> </p><p>We are sorry for this lack of clarity in the manuscript and the corresponding Methods section. To improve this, we have now split the methods in two parts, describing the procedures for the mislocalization part and the procedures for the Dpp part separately.</p><p>Indeed, all experiments for protein mislocalization were imaged under identical microscope setups. More precisely, since we only modified parts of the discs (either the Hh or the Ptc domain), we used the surrounding tissue as an internal control. Hence, fluorescence profiles were extracted from the same disc for the experiment and the control condition. Subsequent, we averaged data obtained from several discs (all processed in the same tube and imaged under identical conditions and in the same session) to obtain the plots and quantifications shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">3</xref> and the corresponding supplementary figures. This procedure is now mentioned in the main text and explained in detail in the Methods section:</p><p>Subsection “Mislocalizing transmembrane and cytosolic proteins along the A-B axis using the GrabFP system”:</p><p>“Therefore, single components of the GrabFP system were co-expressed with different target proteins in defined domains of the wing imaginal disc (<italic>hh::Gal4</italic> for GrabFP<sub>Ext</sub> and <italic>ptc::Gal4</italic> for GrabFP<sub>Int</sub>), while neighbouring areas were used as an internal control for the analysis of wild-type target protein localization.”</p><p>Subsection “Sample collection, immunostaining and imaging”:</p><p>“Importantly, due to our experimental design the GrabFP tools were only expressed in a subset of cells (the posterior compartment for GrabFP<sub>Ext</sub> and the <italic>ptc</italic>-domain for GrabFP<sub>Int</sub>) and we used the non-GrabFP expressing cells as internal controls. […] Therefore, the fluorescence levels between the control and the experimental condition can be compared directly.”</p><p>And subsection “Extraction of concentration profiles along the apical-basal axis”:</p><p>“Importantly, we extracted concentration profiles of the GrabFP expressing regions (experiment) and the non-GrabFP expressing neighbouring cells (internal control) of the same discs.”</p><p><italic>2C. Given the problems comparing experimental and control quantifications, Figures G and H are not adequate. They would be appropriate for absolute values acquired under identical conditions (but not if individual pictures were adjusted to using the entire dynamic range). For these reasons, the 2.8 and 12.6-fold enrichment, mentioned in the third paragraph of the subsection “Mislocalizing transmembrane and cytosolic proteins along the A-B axis using the GrabFP system”, are overinterpretations. The same applies to the GrabFP-B value.</italic> </p><p><italic>Micrographs and intensity curves in these figures are somewhat confusing because at first sight they often seem not to match (e.g. in many cases the GrabFP panels show different GFP intensities in the basolateral region than controls, but the red and black curves show the opposite difference for this region; see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C, F</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>).</italic> </p><p>As stated above, GFP signals for control and experimental conditions were extracted from discs that were processed and imaged under identical conditions. Hence, a direct comparison of fluorescence levels is possible and fair. We originally chose this kind of representation solely to visualize the relative changes in fluorescence levels between the basolateral and the apical compartment. Therefore, the black and the white curve were not related in their levels. We realized that this representation might be confusing to the reader as mentioned by the referee.</p><p>To improve this point, we now included plots showing absolute fluorescence levels (instead of relative, as suggested by the referees). Now levels between control and experimental graphs can be directly compared and statistical significant changes are directly indicated in the plots. We therefore also omitted to show a separate quantification of fluorescent levels (former bar graphs in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G, H</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3G, H</xref>).</p><p><italic>The authors should be able to come up with an appropriate improvement on these points without necessarily doing additional experiments. One reviewer was not able to unambiguously figure out how they acquired their pics. Ideally, they have used the same settings in the experimental and corresponding control session and the settings were chosen such that even the strongest signal remained in the linear range. However, because they do not describe it in this way, it is possible that they either simply forgot to mention this one point or that they did not do it this way. In theory, you would not need an internal fluorescent standard with this approach if the disc-to-disc variations from the same experiment remained reasonable (because they used the same solutions and mounted the samples on the same slide). In short, if they have more &quot;absolute&quot; data that does not show too much variation, they should show it. Otherwise they should simply address these issues, trying to improve <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">3</xref> where they can and briefly discuss the issues.</italic> </p><p>In summary, we have performed an additional in vitro essay to test for a potential effect of nanobody binding on eGFP fluorescence. Indeed, we find that binding of vhhGFP4 to eGFP results in an average increase of 47.5% in eGFP fluorescence in vitro. We have accounted for this effect by additionally showing profiles corrected for this increase. Furthermore, we now included profiles showing absolute eGFP/YFP levels that allow direct comparison of concentrations along the apical-basal axis. We are convinced that these changes improved the representation and clarity of our data.</p><p><italic>Concern 3.</italic></p><p><italic><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref> / eGFP-Dpp studies.</italic></p><p><italic>In the second paragraph of the subsection Dpp disperses in the apical and in the basolateral compartment”, the authors claim that they did not detect eGFP-Dpp in the lumen. It is difficult to quantify luminal signals because they easily get washed out during fixation and staining unless they are crosslinked to a membrane. This is also suggested by the results in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B, D</xref>. An additional control would be needed to make these claims.</italic> </p><p>We stated that: “We did not detect eGFP-Dpp signal within the luminal space (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>, magnification). These results suggest that, using fluorescence microscopy, Dpp is prominently detected within the lateral plane of the DP epithelium.” Importantly, we here state that under our experimental setup and detection method we were not able to detect apical/luminal eGFP::Dpp; we did not want to imply that there is none. The comment of the referee is very important and it seems that luminal eGFP-Dpp, if present in the luminal cavity at significant levels, is extremely difficult to detect. We also tried to use extracellular staining protocols to visualize luminal Dpp. In short, live discs are incubated in antibody solution and subsequently excessive antibody is washed of and discs are fixed. However, also using this approach we did not detect apical/luminal Dpp, possibly because the antibody cannot penetrate the lumen without permeabilization (results not shown). Hence, it seems that the lumen is not accessible for antibodies without permeabilization, however, once permeabilized, non surface-bound eGFP-Dpp is possible washed off the disc, as suggested by the reviewer.</p><p>To control for this possibility, we expressed a secreted vhhGFP::mCherry fusion protein (secVHH-mCherry) in the posterior cells of the wing disc (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11">Author response image 3</xref>). secVHH-mCherry is secreted into the disc lumen and disperses to ultimately fill the whole luminal cavity. Importantly, secVHH-mCherry can be easily detected by a conventional immunostaining approach and is not washed off despite cell permeabilization. These results suggest that a small protein fused to a fluorophore (secVHH-mCherry is of similar size as eGFP::Dpp) is retained in the wing disc lumen and can be detected by a standard immunostaining protocol. Most importantly, once we used nanobody-mediated immobilization in clones or in the peripodial epithelium, low levels of apical/luminal eGFP-Dpp can be visualized. This suggests that apical luminal levels are too low to be detected without the stabilizing effect of the GrabFP system. Such effect should be further amplified due to the increase in eGFP fluorescence caused by the binding of the nanobody.<fig id="fig11" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.22549.025</object-id><label>Author response image 3.</label><caption><title>Detection of a secreted VHH-mCherry fusion in the wing disc lumen.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Schematic representation of the experimental setup.
