attaching to macromolecular kinetochores. Only microtubule-end attached kinetochores can be pulled apart; how these end-on attachments are selectively recognised and stabilised is not known. Using the kinetochore and microtubule-associated protein, Astrin, as a molecular probe, we show that end-on attachments are rapidly stabilised by spatially-restricted delivery of PP1 near the C-terminus of Ndc80, a core kinetochore-microtubule linker. PP1 is delivered by the evolutionarily conserved tail of Astrin and this promotes Astrin’s own enrichment creating a highly-responsive positive feedback, independent of biorientation. Abrogating Astrin:PP1-delivery disrupts attachment stability, which is not rescued by inhibiting Aurora-B, an attachment destabiliser, but is reversed by artificially tethering PP1 near the C-terminus of Ndc80. Constitutive Astrin:PP1-delivery disrupts chromosome congression and segregation, revealing a dynamic mechanism for stabilising attachments. Thus, Astrin-PP1 mediates a dynamic ‘lock’ that selectively and rapidly stabilises end-on attachments, independent of biorientation, and ensures proper chromosome segregation.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>kinetochore</kwd><kwd>microtubule</kwd><kwd>mitosis</kwd><kwd>chromosome</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100009148</institution-id><institution>Queen Mary University of London</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>SBC8DRA2</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Draviam</surname><given-names>Viji M</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000268</institution-id><institution>Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01003X/1</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Draviam</surname><given-names>Viji M</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000289</institution-id><institution>Cancer Research UK</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>C28598/A9787</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Draviam</surname><given-names>Viji M</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000265</institution-id><institution>Medical Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>MR/K50127X/1</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Conti</surname><given-names>Duccio</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100003971</institution-id><institution>Islamic Development Bank</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Gul</surname><given-names>Parveen</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Human chromosome-microtubule attachments are stabilised by Astrin-mediated dynamic delivery of PP1 phosphatase to the attachment site, which ensures the normal segregation of chromosomes.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Chromosome segregation can not be initiated until all chromosomes are properly attached to microtubules from opposing spindle poles - a state called biorientation. To mediate and monitor chromosome-microtubule attachments, a macromolecular structure, the kinetochore (KT) assembles on centromeric DNA (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Conti et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Musacchio and Desai, 2017</xref>). Kinetochores are first captured along microtubule-walls (immature lateral attachment) and then brought to microtubule-ends (mature end-on attachment), by a multi-step end-on conversion process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Tanaka et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Shrestha and Draviam, 2013</xref>). Only end-on attachments can impart pulling forces to segregate chromosomes apart and in the absence of end-on attachments, checkpoint proteins are retained at the kinetochore which prevents premature chromosome segregation (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Musacchio and Desai, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Cheeseman, 2014</xref>). A highly responsive set of kinases and phosphatases together monitor and signal kinetochore-microtubule (KT-MT) attachment status (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Saurin and Kops, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Vallardi et al., 2017</xref>). Whether a similar highly responsive kinase-phosphatase feedback loop exists to selectively and rapidly stabilise end-on attachments is not known; this is important to establish as rapid stabilisation of end-on attachments is essential for withstanding microtubule-end mediated pulling forces that may otherwise detach kinetochore-microtubule attachments as soon as they form.</p><p>No outer-kinetochore bound phosphatase has been implicated in the ‘selective’ stabilisation of end-on attachments, although current models show that incorrect attachments can be destabilised by Aurora-B kinase. Aurora-B-mediated phosphorylation of Ndc80 (a core KT-MT linker) destabilises microtubule binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Miller et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Guimaraes et al., 2008</xref>). Thus, reversing the phosphorylation directly may promote attachment stability, but the phosphatase PP1 recruited by KNL1/hSPC105 to counteract Aurora-B for checkpoint silencing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Nijenhuis et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Meadows et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Rosenberg et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Liu et al., 2010</xref>) is not essential for stabilising attachments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Shrestha et al., 2017</xref>) or segregation accuracy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Zhang et al., 2014</xref>). Therefore, rapid stabilisation of end-on attachments as soon as they form, before biorientation, is likely to require KNL1 independent phosphatases that are either retained and/or newly recruited following the formation of end-on attachments.</p><p>When end-on attachments form, the checkpoint proteins BubR1, Bub1 and MPS1 that influence attachments are all either removed from or reduced at kinetochores (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Shrestha and Draviam, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Kuhn and Dumont, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">O'Connell et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Hiruma et al., 2015</xref>). Simultaneously, the Astrin-SKAP complex is recruited to kinetochores (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Shrestha and Draviam, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Kuhn and Dumont, 2017</xref>). Astrin-SKAP binds to microtubules through multiple contact points (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Friese et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Kern et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Dunsch et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Tamura et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Huang et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Wang et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Maffini et al., 2009</xref>). In the absence of Astrin-SKAP, the end-on conversion process is disrupted; end-on attachments form but are not stably maintained (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Shrestha et al., 2017</xref>). Hence, determining the mechanisms that control the kinetochore recruitment of Astrin-SKAP can shed light on how cells recognise and maintain end-on attachments. However, the precise site of Astrin recruitment at the kinetochore is not known. Dissecting Astrin-SKAP’s role and regulation has not been straightforward as the complex dimerises and binds to both microtubules and kinetochores (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Dunsch et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Kern et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Friese et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Schmidt et al., 2010</xref>). Moreover, its depletion results in a complex phenotype of chromosomes aligning on the metaphase plate but failing to maintain the congressed state due to a spindle collapse, leading to an irreversible mitotic arrest (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Thein et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Dunsch et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Kern et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Manning et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Shrestha et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>We report a molecular mechanism by which kinetochore attachments made to microtubule-ends, but not microtubule-walls, are rapidly and selectively stabilised independent of biorientation. The microtubule-associated Astrin is recruited selectively to end-on attached kinetochores, prior to the biorientation of kinetochores. We show that this selective recruitment of Astrin relies on the C-terminus of Astrin and occurs proximal to the C-terminus of Ndc80. Next we reveal that Astrin’s C-terminus delivers PP1 close to the C-terminus of Ndc80, which in turn promotes Astrin’s own enrichment, setting up a positive feedback that rapidly strengthens kinetochore-microtubule bridging. This selective and rapid stabilisation of end-on attachments can be disrupted by mutating the PP1-docking motif of Astrin. In the absence of Astrin:PP1 interaction, kinetochores can not withstand microtubule-mediated pulling forces, which activates the spindle checkpoint and delays anaphase onset. These attachment defects can be reversed by exogenously delivering PP1 near the C-terminus, but not the N-terminus of Astrin, revealing a spatially restricted PP1-mediated ‘lock’ to stabilise attachments. The defects induced by Astrin:PP1-docking mutants can not be simply overcome by inhibiting Aurora-B (an attachment destabiliser), revealing a previously unrecognised mechanism to stabilise KT-MT attachments. Premature and constitutive delivery of Astrin:PP1 disrupts chromosome congression and mitotic progression, highlighting the need for a dynamic interaction between Astrin and PP1. Thus, by delivering a pool of PP1, Astrin promotes its own enrichment, enabling a highly responsive lock that can dynamically and selectively stabilise end-on attachments and in turn, ensure the timely segregation of chromosomes.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Before biorientation, kinetochores bound to MT-ends recruit Astrin</title><p>We showed that Astrin is selectively enriched at end-on attached kinetochores and is required to stabilise end-on attachments, independent of biorientation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Shrestha and Draviam, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Shrestha et al., 2017</xref>). The enrichment of Astrin at kinetochores prior to biorientation points to a novel attachment stabilisation mechanism, independent of already known intra- or inter- kinetochore stretching mediated stabilisation of bioriented attachments (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Conti et al., 2017</xref>). To explore this hypothesis, we tracked Astrin recruitment and dynamics at the kinetochores of monopolar spindles that can not biorient kinetochores. Deconvolution time-lapse microscopy revealed two distinct kinetochore localisation patterns for Astrin in cells co-expressing YFP-Astrin and CENP-B-DsRed (centromere marker): YFP-Astrin forms either a low-intensity ‘sleeve’ decorating the outer-kinetochore and associated microtubule-end or a high-intensity ‘crescent’ decorating the outer-kinetochore alone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Tracking the fate of Astrin -sleeves and -crescents in cells co-expressing YFP-Astrin and CENP-B-DsRed, showed a gradual conversion of YFP-Astrin sleeve into brighter YFP-Astrin crescent (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). To confirm that both Astrin-crescents and sleeves are found at the outer-kinetochore, we analysed YFP-Astrin localisation in cells co-expressing Nuf2-CFP, a bonafide outer-kinetochore marker. Overlap with Nuf2-CFP signal was partial in Astrin-sleeves and complete in Astrin-crescents, confirming the outer-kinetochore localisation of Astrin prior to biorientation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Before biorientation, Astrin is recruited to kinetochores proximal to Ndc80.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Time-lapse images of monopolar spindles in STLC treated HeLa FRT/TO cells co-expressing YFP-Astrin and CENP-B-DsRed show transition of Astrin from sleeve-like to crescent-like kinetochore structure.

Previously, fragments of the two complexes were shown to bind microtubules in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Kern et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Friese et al., 2016</xref>), but their relative orientations were not known. So, we analysed FRET intensities at the kinetochores of cells co-expressing either Astrin-CFP and Ndc80<sup>HEC1</sup>-YFP or YFP-Astrin and Nuf2-CFP, an Ndc80 partner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Wigge and Kilmartin, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Meraldi et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Ciferri et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">DeLuca et al., 2006</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C,D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2A,B</xref>). FRET signals were prominent only in cells co-expressing C-terminal fluorescent protein tags for both Ndc80 and Astrin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C,D</xref>), indicating that the C-termini of both proteins are within a 5 nm distance, expected for FRET (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Müller et al., 2013</xref>). In contrast, cells co-expressing YFP-Astrin and Nuf2-CFP did not show prominent FRET signals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2A,B</xref>), confirming that Astrin is recruited near Ndc80 in a specific orientation at the kinetochore.</p><p>In summary, the timing and position of Astrin recruitment to the kinetochore is appropriate for directly stabilising end-on attachments independent of biorientation. First, kinetochore-associated Astrin-sleeve can enrich into an Astrin-crescent prior to biorientation. Second, the C-terminus of Astrin resides proximal to the C-terminus of Ndc80 ideally positioned to strengthen kinetochore-microtubule bridging after the formation of end-on attachments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Selective recognition of end-on kinetochores requires Astrin’s 70a.a tail</title><p>To determine how end-on kinetochores are selectively recognised, we searched for the minimal region of Astrin needed for its kinetochore enrichment as crescents. For Astrin recruitment at kinetochores, its C-terminal 694–1193 a.a is sufficient (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Kern et al., 2017</xref>) and 851–1193 a.a is essential (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Dunsch et al., 2011</xref>). At the very C-terminus of Astrin, using structure prediction tools (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Wolf et al., 1997</xref>), we identify a new unstructured region referred here as Astrin tail (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). Removing 70 amino acids (1123–1193 a.a) of the unstructured region (YFP-Astrin ∆70) abrogated Astrin’s kinetochore enrichment as crescents; the deletion mutant was either present as sleeves or completely absent at the kinetochore, but was normally present on spindle microtubules and poles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B,C</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A</xref>), revealing a specific role for Astrin tail in recognising end-on kinetochores.

We quantified the proportion of bipolar and multipolar spindles in cells depleted of endogenous Astrin and expressing either Astrin-WT or -∆70 mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D,E</xref>). While Astrin depleted cells displayed multipolar spindles as reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Thein et al., 2007</xref>), cells expressing either Astrin-WT or -∆70 displayed bipolar spindles, indicating a successful rescue of the multipolar spindle phenotype seen in the absence of Astrin. We conclude the kinetochore pool of Astrin-SKAP is dispensable for bipolar spindle maintenance. Thus, the ∆70-mutant uncouples Astrin’s role at the kinetochore from the rest of the spindle and serves as a molecular probe to test how Astrin selectively recognises and stabilises end-on attachments.</p><p>Using time-lapse microscopy, we tracked the fate of mitotic cells lacking the 70 a.a tail of Astrin by expressing an siRNA-resistant YFP-Astrin-WT or -∆70 mutant following siRNA-mediated depletion of endogenous Astrin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1B,C</xref>). Analysis of the time taken from Nuclear Envelope Break Down (NEBD) to anaphase onset, using YFP-Astrin signal on the spindle, showed a delayed anaphase onset in cells expressing Astrin-∆70 mutant compared to Astrin-WT; spindle bipolarity and chromosome alignment or congression were however unperturbed in mutant expressing cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F,G</xref>). In summary, kinetochore-bound Astrin is required for timely anaphase, but not the congression of chromosomes or the maintenance of bipolar spindles.

This delay in anaphase onset was despite the normal completion of chromosome congression at the spindle equator (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). In agreement, MG132-treated metaphase cells depleted of endogenous Astrin and expressing YFP-Astrin-4A maintained a bipolar spindle and aligned chromosomes similar to cells expressing YFP-Astrin-WT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3C,D</xref>). In conclusion, the PP1 docking RVxF motif is dispensable for spindle bipolarity and chromosome congression but is crucial for the enrichment of Astrin-crescents and normal timing of anaphase.</p><p>To determine the precise reason for delayed anaphase, we performed high-resolution time-lapse imaging of congressed kinetochores in MG132-treated cells depleted of endogenous Astrin and expressing either YFP-Astrin-WT or YFP-Astrin-4A. Analysing the intensity and size of YFP-Astrin signals associated with kinetochore pairs showed dimmer and smaller crescents of Astrin-4A, compared to Astrin-WT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>). In Astrin-4A expressing cells, dim kinetochore-crescents gradually declined into Astrin-sleeves (referred as, blinking; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>), explaining reduced Astrin-4A crescent intensities in fixed-cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3A</xref>). In contrast, Astrin-WT crescents were retained brightly at congressed kinetochores (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>), mediating stable kinetochore-microtubule bridging. This confirms that the PP1 docking motif is required for stably retaining Astrin at kinetochores. Next, we assessed the life-time of Astrin-crescents by counting the number of ‘blinking’ events (prominent intensity changes) within a 60 s window. Unlike Astrin-WT-expressing cells, Astrin-4A-expressing cells displayed multiple blinking events within a short 60 s window, demonstrating compromised kinetochore life-time for YFP-Astrin-4A (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref>). We conclude that the putative PP1-docking motif is not essential for the initial arrival of Astrin sleeves at kinetochores; it is essential for the maintenance of Astrin-crescents, revealing a role for the PP1-docking motif in the stable maintenance of kinetochore-microtubule bridges.</p><p>If a reduction in Astrin complex weakens kinetochore-microtubule bridging, we are likely to observe reduced pulling of sister kinetochores by microtubule-end mediated forces. To assess whether sister kinetochores experience normal microtubule-end mediated pulling forces in cells lacking the PP1-docking motif, we measured inter-kinetochore distances in live-cells expressing Astrin-4A mutant. Despite normal kinetochore alignment at the spindle equator, inter-kinetochore distances between Astrin crescents were significantly reduced in cells expressing Astrin-4A compared to Astrin-WT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3G</xref>). To confirm the reduction in inter-kinetochore distances following Astrin-4A expression, we performed live-cell imaging of metaphase cells coexpressing CENP-B-DsRed, a centromere marker and YFP-Astrin following Astrin siRNA treatment. Time-lapse movies indicated transient but steep reduction in distances between CENP-B-DsRed pairs of cells expressing YFP-Astrin-4A but not YFP-Astrin-WT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s4">Figure 3—figure supplement 4A</xref>). Measuring distances between CENP-B-DsRed pairs confirmed a significant reduction in average inter-kinetochore distances of cells expressing YFP-Astrin-4A compared to YFP-Astrin-WT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s4">Figure 3—figure supplement 4B</xref>), indicative of a failure in microtubule-mediated kinetochore pulling in Astrin-4A-expressing cells.</p><p>To determine whether reduced kinetochore life-time of Astrin-4A leads to reduced kinetochore pulling or conversely, an inability to withstand microtubule-mediated pulling leads to a reduction in Astrin-4A at kinetochores, we tested whether a brief treatment with 100 nm Taxol, which pauses microtubule dynamics and reduces microtubule-mediated pulling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Draviam et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Shrestha et al., 2014</xref>), would allow the enrichment of Astrin-4A or -∆70 at kinetochores. Taxol treatment induced no changes in the levels of YFP-Astrin-4A or -∆70 at kinetochores (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3E</xref>). We conclude that reduced microtubule-mediated pulling is a consequence, rather than the cause, of the reduced life-time of Astrin-4A at kinetochores.</p><p>In summary, selective stabilisation of end-on attachments is mediated by the PP1-binding motif of Astrin, which promotes Astrin’s own enrichment.

To directly assess whether the RVxF motif in Astrin is important for the maintenance of end-on attachments, we used a quantitative assay that has previously allowed us to clearly identify the stability of three different attachment steps of the end-on conversion process: kinetochores unattached to microtubules; kinetochores attached laterally to microtubule-walls; and kinetochores attached end-on to microtubule-ends (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Shrestha and Draviam, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Shrestha et al., 2017</xref>). We quantified the proportion of detached, laterally attached or end-on attached kinetochores in monopolar spindles of cells expressing YFP-Astrin-WT, −4A or -∆70 following the depletion of endogenous Astrin. To analyse kinetochore-microtubule attachment status, we immunostained cells using an antibody against Tubulin and the CREST antisera (centromere marker) and imaged using deconvolution microscopy. Compared to cells expressing Astrin-WT, cells expressing Astrin mutant (4A or ∆70) displayed significantly fewer end-on attached kinetochores. Importantly, laterally-attached kinetochores, and not detached kinetochores, were significantly increased in Astrin mutant-expressing cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A,B</xref>). Thus, Astrin mutant-expressing cells are able to retain kinetochores along microtubule-walls but they cannot maintain kinetochores at microtubule-ends, similar to Astrin depleted cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Shrestha et al., 2017</xref>). This reveals that the kinetochore pool of Astrin is important for the selective stabilisation of end-on attachments.

Co-expression of mCherry-GBP-PP1γ rescued the kinetochore localisation defect of both mutants (Astrin-4A-GFP and Astrin-∆70-GFP) in monopolar spindles of cells treated with Aurora-B inhibitor (compare <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7E</xref>).

In these cells, 45 min after STLC-release, confirming normal disassembly of spindle and KT-MT attachments, the kinetochore enrichment of Astrin-WT-GFP was not obvious (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s1">Figure 8—figure supplement 1E</xref>).

Next, Astrin-mediated delivery of PP1, near the C-terminus of Ndc80, promotes its own enrichment as Astrin-crescents - this positive feedback stabilises end-on attachments to withstand microtubule-mediated pulling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>). Although the inhibition of Aurora-B is essential for the formation of end-on attachment, it is insufficient to stabilise attachments in the absence of Astrin-mediated PP1 delivery. Conversely, constitutive delivery of PP1 by Astrin disrupts the dynamic regulation of KT-MT attachment stability causing delayed chromosome congression and defective anaphase. Thus, Astrin-PP1 interaction acts as a dynamic lock that rapidly and selectively stabilises mature kinetochore-microtubule attachments to ensure the accurate segregation of chromosomes.</p><fig id="fig9" position="float"><label>Figure 9.</label><caption><title>Astrin mediates rapid and selective stabilisation of end-on attachments, via local and timely delivery of PP1.</title><p>Kinetochores are first captured along microtubule-walls (immature lateral attachments) and then attached to microtubule-ends (mature end-on attachments). This process of end-on conversion requires the lowering of Aurora-B at the outer-kinetochore. We show that in the absence of Astrin's tail mediated PP1 interaction, Aurora-B inhibition alone is however insufficient to stably enrich Astrin or maintain end-on attachments. Astrin:PP1 interaction is required to promote Astrin’s own enrichment; this positive feedback loop allows rapid stabilisation of end-on attachments. Without Astrin:PP1 interaction, KT-MT attachments become unstable to cold treatment and can not withstand microtubule-mediated pulling forces, triggering the spindle checkpoint and delaying anaphase onset. Conversely, premature constitutive delivery of Astrin:PP1 interferes with error correction, chromosome congression and segregation fidelity. Thus, by dynamically regulating its own enrichment at kinetochores, Astrin-PP1 acts as a spatially restricted ‘lock’ that recognises and stabilises microtubule interactions, specifically, at end-on attached kinetochores.</p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-49325-fig9-v2.tif"/></fig></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Rapid stabilisation of end-on attachments, as soon as they form, is important for maintaining chromosome-microtubule attachments that withstand microtubule-end mediated pulling forces. How cells recognise and selectively stabilise end-on attachments before biorientation is not known. We report the first evidence for a phosphatase-based mechanism that rapidly stabilises kinetochore attachments to microtubule-ends, independent of biorientation. Because Astrin:PP1 dynamically stabilises attachment, independent of biorientation, we propose it as a dynamic ‘lock’ that works differently from the classical Aurora-B mediated destabilisation of attachments which responds to biorientation status.</p><p>Astrin binds selectively to kinetochores attached to microtubule ends (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Shrestha and Draviam, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Shrestha et al., 2017</xref>) allowing a selective delivery of Astrin:PP1 onto microtubule-end tethered kinetochores. Without Astrin:PP1, we show that kinetochores can not properly withstand microtubule-pulling or stabilise end-on attachments, leading to an anaphase delay. Importantly, Astrin-mediated PP1 delivery has to occur near the C-terminus of Ndc80 to promote Astrin’s own enrichment, presenting evidence for a spatially-restricted positive feedback loop (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>). Even in cells lacking Aurora-B activity (the attachment destabilising enzyme), Astrin:PP1 is essential for attachment stability, indicating its important role in actively stabilising KT-MT attachments. Supporting this idea, premature constitutive delivery of PP1 via Astrin leads to defective chromosome congression and segregation. Thus, this study reveals an important molecular feature of how end-on attachments are selectively recognised and rapidly stabilised, which is crucial for the normal segregation of chromosomes. In addition, the findings provide a general framework for understanding how a dynamic microtubule-end can escort proteins needed to both recognise and stabilise its presence at a specific subcellular site. Similar phospho-regulation of controlled protein enrichment has been reported at interphase microtubule-ends (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">van der Vaart et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Tamura and Draviam, 2012</xref>).</p><p>We propose that the Astrin:PP1 ‘lock’ operates proximal to the conserved tetramer junction between Ndc80-Nuf2 and Spc24-25 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Valverde et al., 2016</xref>), as targeting PP1 to Astrin’s C-terminus, but not it's N-terminus, promotes Astrin enrichment. Using bioinformatics, we identified Astrin’s C-terminus as the most evolutionarily conserved region of Astrin across Bilateria (well beyond its recognised presence in Mammalia and Hemichordata; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">van Hooff et al., 2017</xref>). These observations shed light on why Astrin’s C-terminus (343 a.a) is important for its kinetochore localisation, but not spindle localisation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Dunsch et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Kern et al., 2017</xref>).

Unlike these events that occur near the N-terminus of Ndc80 that interfaces with the microtubule, Astrin-mediated delivery of PP1 is successful only when PP1 is delivered near the C-terminus of Ndc80. In the context of multiple Ndc80 units and SKA cooperatively interacting with the microtubule lattice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Alushin et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Janczyk et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Zaytsev et al., 2013</xref>), Astrin-PP1 recruitment near the C-terminus of Ndc80 can further enhance KT-MT bridges through a different domain of Ndc80. Our study of DSN1 pSer100 status indicates that Astrin-PP1 can modulate phosphorylation at the kinetochore. However, DSN1 phosphorylation per se is not thought to be important for viability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Welburn et al., 2010</xref>). We speculate that similar phospho-changes proximal to the C-terminus of Ndc80 could be essential to promote Astrin’s own enrichment which strengthens KT-MT bridging and rapidly stabilises end-on attachments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>). Together, the Aurora-B pathway and Astrin-PP1 pathway modulate multiple events to destabilise and stabilise end-on attachments, respectively.</p><p>Several outer kinetochore pools of PP1 exist. The Astrin:PP1 pool, we report here, mediates a non-overlapping role with those previously reported (details below). PP1 recruited via KNL1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Meadows et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Liu et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Rosenberg et al., 2011</xref>) is negatively regulated by Aurora-B kinase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Nijenhuis et al., 2014</xref>); KNL1-bound PP1 is however not critical for stabilising end-on attachments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Shrestha et al., 2017</xref>). Similarly, PP1 recruited via SKA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Sivakumar et al., 2016</xref>), a MAP negatively regulated by Aurora-B (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Chan et al., 2012</xref>), is important for spindle checkpoint silencing but not microtubule-mediated force generation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Sivakumar et al., 2016</xref>). Cenp-E can also deliver PP1 to the kinetochore and abrogating this delivery blocks chromosome alignment; this again, counteracts Aurora-B-mediated phosphorylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Kim et al., 2010</xref>). Unlike these documented roles of PP1 at the outer-kinetochore, Astrin-PP1 mediated attachment stabilisation can not be substituted by Aurora-B inhibition, revealing an important role for Astrin in dictating kinetochore-microtubule attachment stabilisation.</p><p>Astrin localises along the spindle, at spindle poles and is enriched at kinetochores (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Mack and Compton, 2001</xref> and this study) with PP1 colocalising predominantly at kinetochores and to a small extent on microtubules. Although the Astrin mutants we report are impaired in their kinetochore but not spindle localisation, and PP1 tethering works only at the C but not the N-terminus of Astrin, we can not rule out that the effect of Astrin C-terminal mutants or PP1 tethered to Astrin’s C-terminus may arise from Astrin’s role in other subcellular spaces, in addition to kinetochores.</p><p>We previously reported that Astrin-SKAP complex is recruited specifically to kinetochores attached to microtubule-ends, but not -walls using fixed-cell studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Shrestha and Draviam, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Shrestha et al., 2017</xref>). This was confirmed by others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Kuhn and Dumont, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Xu et al., 2014</xref>) consistent with Astrin’s recruitment in prometaphase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Fang et al., 2009</xref>), although other fixed-cell studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Kern et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Mack and Compton, 2001</xref>) indicate a need for biorientation or metaphase alignment to enrich Astrin-SKAP at kinetochores. Here, we firmly demonstrate using live-cell imaging that Astrin can be enriched at kinetochores of monopolar spindles prior to biorientation. Recognising that Astrin can be recruited to kinetochores before biorientation (in monopolar spindles) is highly significant as it supports an inter-kinetochore stretching/tension independent mechanism to rapidly stabilise and maintain end-on attachments as soon as they form. Thus, we propose Astrin-PP1 mediated selective stabilisation of end-on attachments as a dynamic lock that works along with Aurora-B, during error correction and end-on conversion of attachments, to ensure the accurate segregation of chromosomes.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Cell culture and drug treatments</title><p>HeLa cells (ATCC) cultured in Dulbecco’s Modified Eagle’s Media was supplemented with 10% FCS and antibiotics (Penicillin and Streptomycin).

Unless specified, cells were fixed with ice-cold methanol for a minute. For cold stable assays, 4% PFA was used as in the Super-Resolution Microscopy fixation protocol (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Shrestha et al., 2017</xref>). Following fixation, two quick washes with wash buffer (1X PBS + 0.1% Tween 20) were performed, followed by three washes of 5 min each. Coverslips were incubated with (1X PBS + 0.1% Tween 20 + 1% BSA) for 20 min, before staining with primary antibodies overnight at 4°C. For assessing phospho-DSN1, cells were treated with prewarmed buffers. Following a quick rinse with PHEM (60 mM PIPES, 25 mM HEPES, 10 mM EGTA, 4 mM MgSO<sub>4</sub>, pH 6.9), cells were exposed to fixation buffer (4% PFA in PHEM), and then lysed at 37°C for 5 min in PHEM buffer, 1% Triton X-100 and Protease/Phosphatase Inhibitor Cocktail (Cell Signalling Technology; 5872S) before re-exposing to fixation buffer for 20 min. All subsequent washes were performed thrice, with 5 min incubations, in PHEM-T (PHEM buffer + 0.1% Triton X-100) at room temperature. Fixed cells were washed and then blocked with 10% BSA in PHEM buffer for an hour at room temperature prior to overnight incubation at 4°C with primary antibodies diluted in PHEM buffer with 5% BSA, which was followed by a wash prior to incubation with secondary antibodies diluted in PHEM + 5% BSA for 45 min at room temperature.

segregation and for maintaining genomic stability. Understanding how cells achieve this feat is a top priority for the field. While previous studies have demonstrated that the kinetochore-associated protein Astrin localizes to mature kinetochore-microtubule attachments and contributes to attachment stability, how it does so remains unclear. In this study, Conti and colleagues demonstrate that Astrin is loaded onto end-on microtubule-bound kinetochores prior to chromosome bi-orientation to promote attachment stability by enriching Astrin's own kinetochore localization and delivering a population of the phosphatase PP1 to kinetochores. The authors find that Astrin-mediated recruitment of PP1 specifically to a region near the Ndc80 C-terminus is required for these activities, as its delivery to other nearby locations does not have the same stabilizing effects. The described mechanisms extend our view of how proper chromosome segregation is achieved and should be of interest to those in the field of mitotic cell division. Determining the PP1 targets in this particular region of the kinetochore that control kinetochore-microtubule attachment stability will be an important and exciting next step forward.</p><p><bold>Decision letter after peer review:</bold></p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Kinetochores attached to microtubule-ends are stabilised by Astrin bound PP1 to ensure proper segregation of chromosomes&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by Jennifer DeLuca as the Reviewing Editor and Anna Akhmanova as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Christopher Campbell (Reviewer #1).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and I have drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>The kinetochore and spindle-associated protein Astrin has previously been implicated in stabilization of kinetochore-microtubule attachments in mammalian cells, however the mechanism by which it does so is poorly understood. In this new study, you report that perturbation of the C-terminus of Astrin disrupts its accumulation at kinetochores and delays anaphase onset. A series of cell-based experiments leads you to conclude that PP1 associates with the C-terminus of Astrin and delivers PP1 to a region near the C-terminus of Hec1/Ndc80 to facilitate kinetochore-microtubule attachment stabilization in an Aurora B-independent manner. The reviewers are in agreement that this study is a significant contribution to the field and the findings could potentially extend the view of how proper and accurate chromosome segregation is achieved. However, the reviewers also agreed that some of the conclusions were not sufficiently supported by the data and several points require clarification.</p><p>Overall, the reviewers are supportive of publishing the work in <italic>eLife</italic> after the following Essential Revisions have been addressed.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The authors identify a PP1 binding motif in the C-terminus of Astrin and find that disruption of this domain has a strong effect on Astrin's localization to the kinetochore. They also report an interaction between Astrin and PP1 based on pull-down and FRET assays, however, it's unclear if the PP1 motif that they mutate is responsible for the interaction that they observe. Testing if the interaction between Astrin and PP1 in these two assays is disrupted by the 4A mutation is required to make the claim that their mutation is affecting the PP1 binding.</p><p>2) The evidence that Astrin interacts with PP1 needs to be strengthened. In Figure 4D, the blot for Astrin does not appear to be specific in the GST-PP1 lane. There are at least four additional bands that are pulled down, which may be non-specifically recognized by the Astrin antibody, or non-specifically pulled-down with the bait. To better demonstrate the physical interaction between Astrin and PP1, exogenously-expressed tagged Astrin (e.g. YFP-Astrin) should be used in this experiment, which will likely provide a more specific band.</p><p>3) Fusing PP1 to Astrin rescues some aspects of Astrin function but not others (Figure 5A, Figure 6-8). It also appears that the targeting of PP1 to Astrin actually decreases the number of end-on attachments, which is counter to the authors' model that Astrin-PP1 at kinetochores stabilizes end-on attachments. For example, a comparison of WT Astrin in Figures 5B and 7F shows a decrease in end-on attachments from ~60% to ~40% when the GBP-PP1 is added. In the presence of an Aurora B inhibitor (7C vs. 7F), the number of end-on attachments goes from ~90% to ~70% with the targeted PP1. These experiments are complicated by the possibility that artificial fusion of PP1 to Astrin disrupts its spindle functions. The authors should address this by recruiting PP1 to the C-termini of either Ndc80 or Nuf2 in the presence of the 4A or Δ70 mutants, which should not interfere with the spindle microtubule functions of Astrin, and analyze the localization and functions of Astrin, including anaphase timing, end-on attachment stabilization, and chromosome congression.</p><p>4) The qualitative descriptions of Astrin localization (&quot;sleeves&quot; vs. &quot;crescents&quot;) are somewhat confusing and perhaps over-interpretative. In addition to the current measurements, the authors should quantify the fluorescence of Astrin at kinetochores, using a kinetochore marker as a counterstain. This will be helpful in understanding the levels of Astrin in various kinetochore mutants. Also, the authors' claim that Astrin transitions from &quot;sleeves&quot; to &quot;crescents&quot; is not substantiated. Since it has been shown that a fragment of Astrin that binds kinetochores but not microtubules can localize to kinetochores with proper timing (Dern et al., 2017) it is unclear whether the &quot;sleeve&quot; localization pattern is important for its kinetochore function or simply reflects its spindle localization. Time-lapse imaging of Astrin in living cells would be required to demonstrate that a &quot;transition&quot; occurs.</p><p>5) The main focus of the paper concerns phosphatase activity at the kinetochore, therefore it is surprising that there were no experiments looking at the phosphorylation status of kinetochore proteins upon perturbation of the Astrin-PP1 binding site. Considering the authors' claims of PP1 acting via an Aurora B-independent mechanism, immunofluorescence using a phosphoantibody to measure the phosphorylation state of an Aurora B site on a kinetochore protein near the proposed site of Astrin-mediated PP1 recruitment should be carried out. Given the report of an inverse correlation between Dsn1 phosphorylation and Astrin levels at kinetochores (Schmidt et al., 2010), phospho-Dsn1 would be a good antibody to use for this. In addition, identification of a phosphorylation site at the outer kinetochore that is affected by the removal of Astrin-mediated PP1 activity would greatly strengthen the paper. However, given that this is an open-ended question, identification of such a site is not a requirement for manuscript acceptance.</p><p>6) Targeting of the non-functional D71N PP1 mutation appears to have a major effect on the ability of WT Astrin to localize to kinetochores (Figure 6—figure supplement 2B). This dominant-negative effect on the WT control calls into question any conclusions made about how the mutants are affected in this experiment.</p><p>7) In Figure 1—figure supplement 1B, the recovery rate should be measured. It is unclear if the rate of recovery is different between the spindle and the kinetochore or if it is just the plateau of the recovery that changes.</p><p>8) It is difficult to conclude that the targeting of PP1 to Astrin causes a delay in chromosome congression (Figure 8C) when ~20% of cells congress faster than WT and ~20% are slower. Similarly, mitotic progression (Figure 8—figure supplement 1D) appears to be similar to WT for the large majority of cells. Are these differences significant?</p><p>9) Is it possible that the effect of the Astrin mutations on Astrin's localization to the kinetochore-microtubule interface is due to Astrin's role at the centrosome or microtubules?

The results suggest that the fusion of PP1 to Astrin may be introducing some defects unrelated to the normal function of Astrin at kinetochores. This caveat should be discussed.</p><p>12) The claim that the kinetochore recruitment of Astrin is independent of Aurora B is overstated. Previous studies have demonstrated that inhibition of Aurora B increases the kinetochore intensity of SKAP in STLC-treated cells, suggesting that Aurora B kinase activity negatively regulates SKAP (likely also Astrin) localization at kinetochores. The results in this study also support the negative role of Aurora B in Astrin localization (Figure 7D and Figure 7—figure supplement 1). The basis on which the authors made the claim is that Aurora B inhibition fails to rescue the defects in kinetochore localization of two Astrin mutants (Figure 7A), in which mutations were made in the C-terminal tail. However, if Aurora B's role on Astrin is just through Astrin's C-terminal tail, Aurora B activity would not matter much once the C-terminal tail is removed or mutated. This point should be considered by the authors.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were requested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for resubmitting your work entitled &quot;Kinetochores attached to microtubule-ends are stabilised by Astrin bound PP1 to ensure proper chromosome segregation&quot; for further consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your revised article has been evaluated by Anna Akhmanova as the Senior Editor and Jennifer DeLuca as the Reviewing Editor.</p><p>The manuscript has been improved but there are some remaining issues that need to be addressed before acceptance, as outlined below:</p><p>1) In the original manuscript, the authors reported that the C-terminus of Astrin interacts with PP1 through a PP1 docking motif, and mutation of this motif prevents Astrin localization to kinetochores. The reviewers expressed concern that there was no direct evidence that the PP1 motif described in the study is responsible for the interaction they observe, and requested the authors test the Astrin-PP1 interaction using mutants of Astrin (4A and/or Del70) in the FRET and pull-down assays. The authors were not able to pull-down exogenously-expressed Astrin, but found reduced FRET between YFP-PP1 and Astrin-4A-CFP compared to wild-type Astrin (Figure 4—figure supplement 2B). Although the new FRET data are a useful addition, the evidence for interaction through the proposed domain remains weak. One particular concern is that the motif they claim is a PP1 binding motif doesn't conform to the consensus sequence that they cite. From Bollen et al., 2010, &quot;the consensus sequence K/R K/R V/I x F/W, where x is any residue other than Phe, Ile, Met, Tyr, Asp, or Pro&quot; There is a clear conservation of the Met residue at the +3 position in this motif in Astrin, suggesting that it may not bind to PP1. The reviewers understand that demonstrating direct binding using reconstituted components is outside the scope of the current study. In light of this, presenting clear, convincing pulldown data is very important. While the authors attempted to improve upon the original pulldown experiments, there are still some problems. In Figure 4D and Figure 4—figure supplement 1B and C, the bands in the PP1 pulldown lane do not seem to match the input lane, and since a different molecular weight marker is used here and in new data in Figure 4—figure supplement 1C, it is hard to correlate them. A major concern here is that the authors only show a thin strip of limited MW range for the IP with PP1, and the staining appears smeared out over the entire lane, suggesting the pulldown may not be specific. The GST-PP1 pulldown experiment should be repeated with a control and Astrin knockdown. A larger area of the blot needs to be shown (similar to that in Figure 4—figure supplement 1C would suffice), along with its corresponding Ponceau staining to judge pulldown specificity.</p><p>2) In the original manuscript, the authors concluded that Astrin-PP1 and Aurora B function in two independent pathways. In the new manuscript, the authors revise this conclusion and report that Aurora B and Astrin-PP1 function in &quot;two separable steps&quot; that act together to control attachment status. Based on the data presented in the manuscript, this claim is not substantiated and needs to be reconsidered for the following reasons. (1) The results in Figure 7—figure supplement 1A demonstrate that Aurora B inhibition results in an increase in Astrin-GFP WT crescent localization (DMSO vs. Aurora B inhibitor), which suggests that Aurora B activity is important for regulating Astrin kinetochore localization. (2) In Figure 7, the results demonstrate that inhibition of Aurora B does not rescue the frequency of end-on attachments or the localization of Astrin to kinetochores in cells expressing Astrin C-terminal mutants. The authors take this to suggest that Astrin stabilizes end-on attachment in a separate manner from Aurora B signaling. The situation is likely much more complex than that. The way the assay is performed, cells are treated with STLC for 2 hours in the presence of different forms of Astrin, and then treated briefly with high-concentrations of Aurora B inhibitors. Thus, kinetochore-attachments are already affected by Astrin perturbation prior to treatment with ZM (i.e. there will be a different distribution of lateral vs. end-on attachments prior to ZM treatment, and it not clear that Aurora B inhibition would promote end-on attachment in this case). Failure in increasing the crescent localization of Astrin mutants and stabilizing end-on attachments upon Aurora B inhibition might simply mean that an Aurora B regulatory domain in Astrin is within the C-terminal domain or the identified four sites. (3) The authors' claim about independency or two separable steps of Astrin:PP1 and Aurora B is partly based on the results produced from their artificial PP1 targeting system. Although this system nicely finds a way for the Astrin mutants to get back to kinetochores independent of Aurora B activity, it is still possible that the artificial system could be so dominant that it overrides many pathways. (4) Their new Dsn1 phosphorylation data suggest that Astrin is a negative regulator of at least one bona fide Aurora B substrate and directly contradicts their model for Astrin and Aurora B acting independently. Overall, a more appropriate interpretation of the data is that Astrin regulates Aurora B targets and other kinase substrates or processes at the kinetochore, and that inhibition of Aurora B alone is not sufficient to rescue Astrin mutant function. This does not necessarily mean that they are separable or don't regulate each other. The text should be modified to consider these points.</p><p>3) The original reviews raised concern with the FRAP data presented in Figure 1—figure supplement 2B, and the authors were requested to calculate the recovery rates in the experiment. In response, the authors stated that they could not calculate the rates because they observed no recovery. This is somewhat concerning, since Astrin dynamically loads to kinetochores during mitosis. Such rates have been measured for a number of outer kinetochore proteins, and while they vary, they are indeed measurable. Reporting only plateau levels is not very informative, as they likely reflect the ratio of bound vs. unbound protein instead of the turnover of the bound protein. Given that these data do not contribute significantly to the manuscript, they should be removed. Alternatively, if the authors are able to optimize their assay so that recovery rates can be measured and compared to other outer kinetochore components with published recovery rates, that would certainly be acceptable.</p><p>4) In the revised manuscript, there is still little evidence that crescents increase over time. The authors have now actually provided examples where they go back and forth between sleeves and crescents in the new Figure —figure supplement 1. The authors should remove any reference to an increase of crescents over time.</p><p>5) The huge decrease in wild-type Astrin KT localization with addition of the F286A;D71N PP1-targeting construct suggests that it is no longer comparable to the functional PP1. The levels of localization are far too different in these two cases. The experiments with the mutant PP1 should either be removed or the authors should state that the dominant-negative effect of the mutations prevents them from drawing any conclusions.</p><p>6) Regarding the new Dsn1 phosphorylation data in Figure 5—figure supplement 2. The authors are encouraged to make a scatter plot of the integrated fluorescence intensity of each kinetochore. Currently, the bin sizes are all different making it hard to judge the true effects of the Astrin mutants.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.49325.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The authors identify a PP1 binding motif in the C-terminus of Astrin and find that disruption of this domain has a strong effect on Astrin's localization to the kinetochore. They also report an interaction between Astrin and PP1 based on pull-down and FRET assays, however, it's unclear if the PP1 motif that they mutate is responsible for the interaction that they observe. Testing if the interaction between Astrin and PP1 in these two assays is disrupted by the 4A mutation is required to make the claim that their mutation is affecting the PP1 binding.</p></disp-quote><p>To test whether Astrin-PP1 interaction is disrupted in the 4A mutant, we compared the extent of FRET between YFP-PP1 and Astrin-CFP WT ​<italic>versus</italic>​ Astrin-CFP 4A mutant (outcome of 4 experimental repeats presented in Figure 4—figure supplement 2). We could not perform FRET measurements at all kinetochores (KTs) as the Astrin-4A mutant does not display a sustained kinetochore localisation. Using only the timepoints when the Astrin-4A mutant is brightly localised at the kinetochore, we conclude reduced FRET between YFP-PP1 and Astrin-CFP 4A compared to YFP-PP1​γ and Astrin-CFP WT (Figure 4—figure<sub>​</sub> supplement 2B).</p><p>​We attempted several pull-down assays using lysates from HeLa FRT/TO cells conditionally expressing YFP-Astrin -WT or -4A mutant and also lysates from HeLa cells transiently transfected with YFP-Astrin expression plasmids. Unfortunately, we have not been fully successful as exogenously expressed YFP-Astrin is not recovered well in the soluble fraction using our buffer conditions for Astrin-PP1 pull down.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2). The evidence that Astrin interacts with PP1 needs to be strengthened. In Figure 4D, the blot for Astrin does not appear to be specific in the GST-PP1 lane. There are at least four additional bands that are pulled down, which may be non-specifically recognized by the Astrin antibody, or non-specifically pulled-down with the bait. To better demonstrate the physical interaction between Astrin and PP1, exogenously-expressed tagged Astrin (e.g. YFP-Astrin) should be used in this experiment, which will likely provide a more specific band.</p></disp-quote><p>To clarify the four bands relating to Astrin in the pull-down lane (Figure 4D), we include a new study of Astrin siRNA treated mitotic cell lysates to identify mitotic forms of Astrin (Figure 4—figure supplement 1C). Two of the four bands in Figure 4D (~120 kDa and 135 kDa) can be seen in the lane containing unsynchronised/interphase cell lysates (Figure 4—figure supplement 1C). Of the other two bands, the one above 135 kDa is specifically found in mitotic cell lysates and lost following Astrin siRNA treatment (Figure 4—figure supplement 1C) confirming it to be a modified mitotic form of Astrin, whereas, the band below 120 kDa (see Figure 4—figure supplement 1B) is enriched in the GST-PP1 pull-down lane and is present in the flowthrough/unbound lysate lanes (i.e., GST-PP1 exposed fractions). Similar four band pattern of Astrin has been reported in Thedieck et al., Cell 2013 (Figure 7G). Lastly, the new Figure 4—figure supplement 1C (immunoblot of control ​<italic>versus</italic>​ Astrin siRNA treated cell lysates) shows that our anti-Astrin antibody does not recognise any nonspecific protein in mitotic or interphase whole cell lysates within the 200-95 kDa region. These lines of evidence indicate that all four bands in the pull-down lane of Figure 4D refer to Astrin.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Fusing PP1 to Astrin rescues some aspects of Astrin function but not others (Figure 5A, Figure 6-8). It also appears that the targeting of PP1 to Astrin actually decreases the number of end-on attachments, which is counter to the authors' model that Astrin-PP1 at kinetochores stabilizes end-on attachments. For example, a comparison of WT Astrin in Figures 5B and 7F shows a decrease in end-on attachments from ~60% to ~40% when the GBP-PP1 is added. In the presence of an Aurora B inhibitor (7C vs. 7F), the number of end-on attachments goes from ~90% to ~70% with the targeted PP1. These experiments are complicated by the possibility that artificial fusion of PP1 to Astrin disrupts its spindle functions. The authors should address this by recruiting PP1 to the C-termini of either Ndc80 or Nuf2 in the presence of the 4A or Δ70 mutants, which should not interfere with the spindle microtubule functions of Astrin, and analyze the localization and functions of Astrin, including anaphase timing, end-on attachment stabilization, and chromosome congression.</p></disp-quote><p>None of the figures indicated above counter our model. Two distinct points need clarification:</p><p>1) As previously described in the subsection “KT-MT attachment stability depends on spatially defined delivery of PP1”, compared to Astrin-GFP (C-terminal tag), GFP-Astrin (N-terminal tag) is recruited more robustly (we add Figure 6—figure supplement 1C to further highlight this). Therefore, one cannot compare Figure 5B or Figure 7C against Figure 7F as they differ in the orientation of their tags. The correct controls to ask whether Aurora-B and Astrin-PP1 support distinct steps would be DMSO vs. Aurora-B inhibited samples within the same Figure 7F; statistical significance now added for clarity.</p><p>2) Constitutive tethering of PP1 to Astrin-GFP is not expected to rescue all aspects of Astrin function because it disrupts the dynamic nature of interaction between Astrin and PP1. Support for the dynamic interaction between Astrin and PP1 at kinetochore is evident from ​(i)​ FRET studies – some but not all KTs display FRET signal (Figure 4A, blue and yellow arrow head) and ​(ii)​ delayed mitotic progression and chromosome congression following constitutive Astrin-PP1 interaction (Figure 8 and Figure 8—figure supplement 1). Thus, PP1-tethering studies have been used to get clues about how the C-terminal tail of Astrin works.</p><p>We agree that we cannot entirely exclude the impact of Astrin:PP1 on Astrin’s spindle functions. Yet this is less likely as tethering PP1 at Astrin’s N-terminus has no effect, and the effect is seen only when tethered to C-terminus that is positioned close to Ndc80 and away from microtubules (discussed in the subsection “Astrin:PP1 acts as a dynamic ‘lock’ that stabilises attachment and ensures normal anaphase” (also see points 9 and 11 below).Recruiting PP1 or PP1-dead to the C-termini of Ndc80 (Ndc80-GFP) disrupts Astrin localisation at the KT perhaps because of steric hindrance. So, we didn’t pursue this study.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) The qualitative descriptions of Astrin localization (&quot;sleeves&quot; vs. &quot;crescents&quot;) are somewhat confusing and perhaps over-interpretative. In addition to the current measurements, the authors should quantify the fluorescence of Astrin at kinetochores, using a kinetochore marker as a counterstain. This will be helpful in understanding the levels of Astrin in various kinetochore mutants. Also, the authors' claim that Astrin transitions from &quot;sleeves&quot; to &quot;crescents&quot; is not substantiated. Since it has been shown that a fragment of Astrin that binds kinetochores but not microtubules can localize to kinetochores with proper timing (Dern et al., 2017) it is unclear whether the &quot;sleeve&quot; localization pattern is important for its kinetochore function or simply reflects its spindle localization. Time-lapse imaging of Astrin in living cells would be required to demonstrate that a &quot;transition&quot; occurs.</p></disp-quote><p>As suggested, to clarify sleeves vs. crescents, we add new figures and expanded legends: i)​ Figure 1—figure supplement 1 shows transition between sleeves and crescents in multiple KTs, along with change in Astrin intensities at KT relative to a stable centromere marker.</p><p>ii)​Figure 1A: timelapse images (grey on white) highlight transition from a sleeve (low Astrin intensity at KT that extends to MTs) to a crescent (high Astrin intensity restricted at KT).</p><p>iii)​ Figure 2—figure supplement 1A (Astrin-WT vs. ​∆70​ mutant intensities at KT with counterstain).</p><p>​iv) Figure 3—figure supplement 2A (Astrin-WT vs. 4A mutant intensities at KT with counterstain).</p><p>v)​ Expanded Figure 1A legend to explain ‘sleeve’ vs. ‘crescent’ shape and intensity changes.</p><p>While sleeve to crescent transitions are clear in our live-cell videos, whether the transition ​<italic>per se</italic>​ is essential is not tested here, but it cannot be ruled out. Astrin mutants that bind to KTs but not MTs (highlighted by the reviewer above) show reduced levels of Astrin at metaphase kinetochores (see Figure 3D Kern et al., 2017), suggesting an unrecognised role for Astrin’s microtubule-binding domain in ensuring normal enrichment of Astrin at KTs.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) The main focus of the paper concerns phosphatase activity at the kinetochore, therefore it is surprising that there were no experiments looking at the phosphorylation status of kinetochore proteins upon perturbation of the Astrin-PP1 binding site. Considering the authors' claims of PP1 acting via an Aurora B-independent mechanism, immunofluorescence using a phosphoantibody to measure the phosphorylation state of an Aurora B site on a kinetochore protein near the proposed site of Astrin-mediated PP1 recruitment should be carried out. Given the report of an inverse correlation between Dsn1 phosphorylation and Astrin levels at kinetochores (Schmidt et al., 2010), phospho-Dsn1 would be a good antibody to use for this. In addition, identification of a phosphorylation site at the outer kinetochore that is affected by the removal of Astrin-mediated PP1 activity would greatly strengthen the paper. However, given that this is an open-ended question, identification of such a site is not a requirement for manuscript acceptance.</p></disp-quote><p>As suggested, we tested the levels of Dsn1 phosphorylation in Astrin mutant expressing​ cells and report that the dephosphorylation of Dsn1 at Ser100 (an evolutionarily conserved Aurora-B phosphorylation site) is compromised (new Figure 5—figure supplement 2).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) Targeting of the non-functional D71N PP1 mutation appears to have a major effect on the ability of WT Astrin to localize to kinetochores (Figure 6—figure supplement 2B). This dominant-negative effect on the WT control calls into question any conclusions made about how the mutants are affected in this experiment.</p></disp-quote><p>In the subsection “KT-MT attachment stability depends on spatially defined delivery of PP1” we clarify that the co-expression of GBP-PP1γ​<sup>F286A;D71N</sup>​ reduces the proportion of kinetochores enriched with Astrin WT-GFP (Figure 6—figure supplement 2A, B), but it does not fully abolish Astrin-WT localisation at kinetochores, allowing us to investigate relative changes in Astrin mutant localisation. To allow such a study of relative changes, the scoring was binned into cells displaying more or less Astrin crescents. While the coexpression of wildtype-PP1 brings up the proportion of Astrin-crescents in Astrin mutant expressing cells to fully match those observed in Astrin WT expressing cells (i.e., 100% of Astrin positive KTs in both mutant and WT conditions; Figure 6B), the coexpression of non-functional mutant-PP1 does not bring Astrin mutant localisation to match those observed in Astrin WT expressing cells (less than 10% of KTs in mutants ​<italic>vs.</italic>​ 50% of KTs in WT expressing cells are Astrin positive; Figure 6—figure supplement 2B). We agree that the dominant negative effect poses a problem, but the relative changes allow us to partially overcome this problem and to indicate the significance of PP1’s activity.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7) In Figure 1—figure supplement 1B, the recovery rate should be measured. It is unclear if the rate of recovery is different between the spindle and the kinetochore or if it is just the plateau of the recovery that changes.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for highlighting this point. We reword that the plateau of recovery is different; YFP-Astrin signals at the kinetochore recovered much less compared to YFP-Astrin at the spindle (subsection “Before biorientation, kinetochores bound to MT-ends recruit Astrin”). We are unable to comment on the precise recovery rate because of the very little amount of Astrin recovered (&lt;3%) at the kinetochore.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>8) It is difficult to conclude that the targeting of PP1 to Astrin causes a delay in chromosome congression (Figure 8C) when ~20% of cells congress faster than WT and ~20% are slower. Similarly, mitotic progression (Figure 8—figure supplement 1D) appears to be similar to WT for the large majority of cells. Are these differences significant?</p></disp-quote><p>Following STLC treatment, some cells retain separated spindle poles. In Figure 8C we had showcased uncongressed to congressed chromosome phenotype independent of spindle organisation phenotype. However, we recognise from the comment above that this causes confusion. So, we now segregate cells with monopolar spindles at the beginning of the video and compare chromosome congression rates in this population (new Figure 8C; analysis explained in the subsection “Astrin:PP1 acts as a dynamic ‘lock’ that stabilises attachment and ensures normal anaphase”). In these cases, constitutive tethering of PP1 to Astrin delays or blocks congression in &gt;60% of cells (extending beyond the 35min average chromosome congression time in Astrin-GFP controls), which is a significant congression delay. In Figure 8—figure supplement 1, mitotic progression is not abrogated but delayed, and more cells exit with lagging chromatids. So, we conclude that tethering PP1 to Astrin can significantly alter mitotic outcomes.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>9) Is it possible that the effect of the Astrin mutations on Astrin's localization to the kinetochore-microtubule interface is due to Astrin's role at the centrosome or microtubules?

Although the C-terminal mutants are primarily defective in their kinetochore localisation (Figure 2B and 3A), and the mutants do not disrupt spindle bipolarity (Figure 2D, 2E and Figure 3—figure supplement 2C, D), we cannot exclude that the phenotypes reported include Astrin’s role away from the KT, in other subcellular sites.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>10) It is difficult to conceptualize how stabilizing mono-oriented attachments (as observed in the STLC-treated cells) leads to more efficient biorientation.

We agree that the sentence in quotes needs clarification and thank the reviewer for spotting it. We clarify that “constitutive delivery of PP1 by Astrin can disrupt dynamic regulation of attachment stability leading to a delay in chromosome congression and anaphase onset and chromosome mis-segregation.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>11) The data in Figure 8 suggesting a &quot;safety lock&quot; are somewhat over-interpreted, as fusion of PP1 to Astrin could also affect its spindle functions as mentioned above.

Based on this study, it’s safe to conclude that Astrin:PP1 interaction needs to be dynamic, but we cannot fully exclude impact from other sites.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>12) The claim that the kinetochore recruitment of Astrin is independent of Aurora B is overstated. Previous studies have demonstrated that inhibition of Aurora B increases the kinetochore intensity of SKAP in STLC-treated cells, suggesting that Aurora B kinase activity negatively regulates SKAP (likely also Astrin) localization at kinetochores. The results in this study also support the negative role of Aurora B in Astrin localization (Figure 7D and Figure 7—figure supplement 1). The basis on which the authors made the claim is that Aurora B inhibition fails to rescue the defects in kinetochore localization of two Astrin mutants (Figure 7A), in which mutations were made in the C-terminal tail. However, if Aurora B's role on Astrin is just through Astrin's C-terminal tail, Aurora B activity would not matter much once the C-terminal tail is removed or mutated. This point should be considered by the authors.</p></disp-quote><p>Considering this comment and others above, we have reworded the conclusion of Figure 7. Instead of stating Aurora-B and Astrin:PP1 as independent pathways, we indicate them as two separable steps, acting together, to control attachment status (see subsection “Astrin:PP1 and Aurora-B stabilise attachment as two separable steps” for details).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were requested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>The manuscript has been improved but there are some remaining issues that need to be addressed before acceptance, as outlined below:</p><p>1) In the original manuscript, the authors reported that the C-terminus of Astrin interacts with PP1 through a PP1 docking motif, and mutation of this motif prevents Astrin localization to kinetochores.

However, mutagenesis of the RVTF motif in NIPP1 shows that “the penultimate position of the RVxF motif.… can be held by any residue except Pro” (Wakula et al., 2003). In agreement, our model of Astrin’s PP1 docking peptide using the structure of a KNL1 peptide bound to PP1 (Bajaj et al., 2018) shows the +3 position of the RVxF motif is exposed and can be occupied by any a.a except Proline (Figure 3—figure supplement 2). For the sake of​ clarity, we omit previous citations and include Bajaj et al., 2018 as its recent and relevant.</p><p>b) Clarity of Figure 4 As suggested, we repeated our pull-down with Control and Astrin​ siRNA treated cells and we show that Astrin can be pull-down specifically with GST-PP1 but not GST, and Astrin-PP1 (Figure 4E). Please note that bands in input and pull-down lane cannot be directly compared as purified PP1γ is active and may dephosphorylate interactors upon prolonged exposure. We include matched molecular weight markers for the pulldown studies. In addition, we a) quantify Astrin intensities in lanes corresponding to GST-PP1 or GST, both before and after exposure to mitotic cell lysates from two repeats (Figure 4F) and b) probe for γ-tubulin as a positive control in Astrin siRNA treated lysates.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) In the original manuscript, the authors concluded that Astrin-PP1 and Aurora B function in two independent pathways. In the new manuscript, the authors revise this conclusion and report that Aurora B and Astrin-PP1 function in &quot;two separable steps&quot; that act together to control attachment status. Based on the data presented in the manuscript, this claim is not substantiated and needs to be reconsidered for the following reasons. (1) The results in Figure 7—figure supplement 1A demonstrate that Aurora B inhibition results in an increase in Astrin-GFP WT crescent localization (DMSO vs. Aurora B inhibitor), which suggests that Aurora B activity is important for regulating Astrin kinetochore localization. (2) In Figure 7, the results demonstrate that inhibition of Aurora B does not rescue the frequency of end-on attachments or the localization of Astrin to kinetochores in cells expressing Astrin C-terminal mutants. The authors take this to suggest that Astrin stabilizes end-on attachment in a separate manner from Aurora B signaling. The situation is likely much more complex than that. The way the assay is performed, cells are treated with STLC for 2 hours in the presence of different forms of Astrin, and then treated briefly with high-concentrations of Aurora B inhibitors. Thus, kinetochore-attachments are already affected by Astrin perturbation prior to treatment with ZM (i.e. there will be a different distribution of lateral vs. end-on attachments prior to ZM treatment, and it not clear that Aurora B inhibition would promote end-on attachment in this case). Failure in increasing the crescent localization of Astrin mutants and stabilizing end-on attachments upon Aurora B inhibition might simply mean that an Aurora B regulatory domain in Astrin is within the C-terminal domain or the identified four sites. (3) The authors' claim about independency or two separable steps of Astrin:PP1 and Aurora B is partly based on the results produced from their artificial PP1 targeting system. Although this system nicely finds a way for the Astrin mutants to get back to kinetochores independent of Aurora B activity, it is still possible that the artificial system could be so dominant that it overrides many pathways. (4) Their new Dsn1 phosphorylation data suggest that Astrin is a negative regulator of at least one bona fide Aurora B substrate and directly contradicts their model for Astrin and Aurora B acting independently. Overall, a more appropriate interpretation of the data is that Astrin regulates Aurora B targets and other kinase substrates or processes at the kinetochore, and that inhibition of Aurora B alone is not sufficient to rescue Astrin mutant function. This does not necessarily mean that they are separable or don't regulate each other. The text should be modified to consider these points.</p></disp-quote><p>As recommended, we remove conclusions on whether Aurora-B and Astrin-PP1 pathways are independent or not. Instead, we simply state that “Astrin-PP1 and Aurora-B​ control KT-MT attachment status.” Although the phospho-DSN1 signals we study do not​ influence KT-MT attachments or cell viability, we agree with the reviewer that we do not fully demonstrate how the two pathways act separately to control KT-MT attachment status.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) The original reviews raised concern with the FRAP data presented in Figure 1—figure supplement 2B, and the authors were requested to calculate the recovery rates in the experiment. In response, the authors stated that they could not calculate the rates because they observed no recovery. This is somewhat concerning, since Astrin dynamically loads to kinetochores during mitosis. Such rates have been measured for a number of outer kinetochore proteins, and while they vary, they are indeed measurable. Reporting only plateau levels is not very informative, as they likely reflect the ratio of bound vs. unbound protein instead of the turnover of the bound protein. Given that these data do not contribute significantly to the manuscript, they should be removed. Alternatively, if the authors are able to optimize their assay so that recovery rates can be measured and compared to other outer kinetochore components with published recovery rates, that would certainly be acceptable.</p></disp-quote><p>We have removed this supplementary data.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) In the revised manuscript, there is still little evidence that crescents increase over time. The authors have now actually provided examples where they go back and forth between sleeves and crescents in the new Figure 1—figure supplement 1. The authors should remove any reference to an increase of crescents over time.</p></disp-quote><p>We have removed reference to increase over time.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) The huge decrease in wild-type Astrin KT localization with addition of the F286A;D71N PP1-targeting construct suggests that it is no longer comparable to the functional PP1. The levels of localization are far too different in these two cases. The experiments with the mutant PP1 should either be removed or the authors should state that the dominant-negative effect of the mutations prevents them from drawing any conclusions.</p></disp-quote><p>As suggested, we have removed this data.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) Regarding the new Dsn1 phosphorylation data in Figure 5—figure supplement 2.
