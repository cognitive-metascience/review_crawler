population of sequences closely related to a single optimal site. However, some TFs can bind to two distinct sequences that represent two local optima in the Gibbs free energy of binding (ΔG). To determine the molecular mechanism behind this effect, we solved the structures of human HOXB13 and CDX2 bound to their two optimal DNA sequences, CAATAAA and TCGTAAA. Thermodynamic analyses by isothermal titration calorimetry revealed that both sites were bound with similar ΔG. However, the interaction with the CAA sequence was driven by change in enthalpy (ΔH), whereas the TCG site was bound with similar affinity due to smaller loss of entropy (ΔS). This thermodynamic mechanism that leads to at least two local optima likely affects many macromolecular interactions, as ΔG depends on two partially independent variables ΔH and ΔS according to the central equation of thermodynamics, ΔG = ΔH - TΔS.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.32963.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Genes are sections of DNA that carry the instructions needed to build other molecules including all the proteins that the cell needs to fulfill its role. The information in the DNA is stored as a code consisting of four chemical bases, often referred to simply as “A”, “C”, “G” and “T”. The order or sequence of these bases determines the role of a protein. Many organisms – including humans – are built of many different types of cells that perform unique roles. Almost all cells carry the same genetic information, but proteins called transcription factors can regulate the activity of genes so that only a relevant subset of genes is switched on at a particular time.</p><p>Transcription factors glide along DNA and bind to short DNA sequences by attaching to the DNA bases directly or through bridges made up of water molecules. Two physical concepts known as enthalpy and entropy determine the strength of the connection. Enthalpy relates to how strong the chemical bonds that form between the transcription factors and the DNA bases are, compared to a situation where the transcription factor and DNA do not form a complex and bind to water molecules around them. Entropy measures the disorder of the system – the more disordered the solvent and protein-DNA complex are compared to solvent-containing free DNA and protein, the stronger the binding. A water molecule that bridges a DNA base with an amino-acid of a protein contributes to enthalpy, but results in loss of entropy, because the system becomes more ordered since the water molecule can no longer move freely.</p><p>Most transcription factors can only bind to DNA sequences that are very similar to each other, but some transcription factors can recognize several different kinds of sequences, and until now it was not clear how they could do this. Morgunova et al. studied four different human transcription factors that can each bind to two distinct DNA sequences. The results showed that the transcription factors bound to both DNA sequences with similar strength, but via different mechanisms. For one DNA sequence, an enthalpy-based mechanism essentially ‘froze’ the transcription factor to the DNA through rigid water bridges. The other DNA sequence was bound equally strongly but through moving water molecules, because this increased the entropy of the system. It is possible that these mechanisms could also apply to many other molecules that interact with each other through water-molecule bridges.</p><p>A better knowledge of the chemical bonds between transcription factors and DNA bases may in future help efforts to develop new treatments that depend on molecules being able to bind to other molecules. In addition, these findings may one day help scientists to predict how strongly two molecules will interact simply by knowing the structures of the molecules involved.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>transcription factors</kwd><kwd>DNA recognition</kwd><kwd>thermodynamics</kwd><kwd>enthalpy</kwd><kwd>entropy</kwd><kwd>epistasis</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004063</institution-id><institution>Knut och Alice Wallenbergs Stiftelse</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>KAW 2013.0088</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Taipale</surname><given-names>Jussi</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100002794</institution-id><institution>Cancerfonden</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>CAN 2014/718</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Taipale</surname><given-names>Jussi</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004047</institution-id><institution>Karolinska Institutet</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Center for Innovative Medicine</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Taipale</surname><given-names>Jussi</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The epistasis observed in TF-DNA binding preferences can be explained by the presence of two optima of very similar Gibbs energy that are located relatively far from each other in sequence space.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The binding of transcription factors (TFs) to their specific sites on genomic DNA is a key event regulating cellular processes. Analysis of structures of known TFs bound to DNA has revealed three different mechanisms of recognition of the specifically bound sequences: (1) the ‘direct readout’ mechanism involving the formation of specific hydrogen bonds and hydrophobic interactions between DNA bases and protein amino acids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Aggarwal et al., 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Anderson et al., 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Wolberger et al., 1988</xref>); (2) ‘indirect readout’ of the DNA shape and electrostatic potential (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Dror et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Hizver et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Joshi et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Lavery, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Rohs et al., 2005</xref>) by protein contacts to the DNA backbone or the minor groove, and (3) water mediated interactions between bases and amino-acids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bastidas and Showalter, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Garner and Rau, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Ladbury et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Morton and Ladbury, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Patikoglou and Burley, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Poon, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Spolar and Record, 1994</xref>). Each of these mechanisms contributes to binding specificity of most TFs, with their relative importance varying depending on the TF and the recognized sequence.</p><p>The modes of DNA recognition differ from each other also in their thermodynamic characteristics. For example, direct hydrogen bonds can contribute strongly to enthalpy of binding, whereas indirect hydrogen bonds mediated by water are weaker, due to the loss of entropy caused by immobilization of the bridging water molecule. In many cases, the contributions of the loss of entropy and the gain in enthalpy are similar in magnitude, leading to a phenomenon called ‘enthalpy-entropy compensation’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Chodera and Mobley, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Jen-Jacobson et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Klebe, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Patikoglou and Burley, 1997</xref>). This leads to binding promiscuity, allowing a TF to bind to several different but closely related sequences with a biologically relevant affinity.</p><p>Many transcription factors appear to only recognize sequences closely related to a single optimal site. Their binding to DNA can be approximated by a position weight matrix (PWM) model, which describes a single optimal site, and assumes that individual substitutions affect binding independently of each other. Thus, the combined effect of multiple mutations is predictable from the individual effects. However, it is well established that several TFs can bind with high affinity to multiple different sequences, and populations of sequences that are closely related to these optimal sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Badis et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Johnson et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Jolma et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Morris et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Zhao and Stormo, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Zuo et al., 2017</xref>). In such cases, the effect of substitution mutations is not independent, and instead the mutations display strongly epistatic behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Anderson et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Jolma et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Lehner, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Zuo et al., 2017</xref>), where the combined effect of two mutations can be less severe than what is predicted from the individual effects. Many cases of such multiple specificity can be explained by different spacing of homodimeric TFs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Aggarwal et al., 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Párraga et al., 1998</xref>), but in some cases a single monomeric TF appears to be able to bind to two distinct sequences with similar affinities.</p><p>The molecular mechanism behind the multiple specificity phenomenon has been understood at the structural level for some dimers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Párraga et al., 1998</xref>) but not for monomeric TFs. To elucidate the mechanism, we performed structural analysis of two homeodomain proteins, the posterior homeodomain protein HOXB13, and the parahox protein CDX2, each bound to two distinct high-affinity sequences. The optimal sequences for HOXB13 are C<underline>CAA</underline>TAAA and C<underline>TCG</underline>TAAA that differ from each other by the three underlined base pairs, whereas CDX2 binds with high affinity to similar two sequences that begin with a G instead of a C.</p><p>This analysis, together with thermodynamic measurements of HOXB13, CDX2 and two other transcription factors, BARHL2 and MYF5 that also display multiple specificity revealed that in each case, one of the optimal sequences is bound primarily due to an optimal enthalpic contribution, whereas the other is bound due to an optimum of entropy. This result is likely to be general to most macromolecular interactions, as they commonly involve interaction of the macromolecules with a network of interconnected water-molecules, whose formation involves a trade-off between enthalpy and entropy.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results|discussion"><title>Results and discussion</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Modeling the binding of many TFs requires more than one PWM model</title><p>Many TFs have been reported to display multiple specificity. These include many biologically important transcription factors such as the MYF family of basic helix-loop helix factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Yin et al., 2017</xref>), the nuclear receptor HNF4A (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Badis et al., 2009</xref>), and the homeodomain proteins BARHL2, CDX1 and HOXB13 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Jolma et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Jolma et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Nitta et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Zuo et al., 2017</xref>).

Each of these factors has more than one locally optimal sequence. All sequences between these optima have lower affinity and enrich less in SELEX than the optimal sequences. Therefore, more than one positionally independent position weight matrix (PWM) model is required for describing their affinity towards DNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.32963.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Multiple TFs prefer to bind to two optimal sequences.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) MYF6 (this study); (<bold>B</bold>) BARHL2 (this study); (<bold>C</bold>) HOXB13 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Yin et al., 2017</xref>); (<bold>D</bold>) CDX1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Yin et al., 2017</xref>). Note that single PWM models (top) fail to describe sequence specificity towards different sequences shown in the bar graphs (middle). For example, a single PWM model for HOXB13 (panel C, top) predicts near-equal affinities towards sequences TCG and TCA at the position of the bracket, and lower affinity towards CAA. Analysis of the counts of the subsequences (middle), instead, reveals that the TCA sequence is bound more weakly than the two most preferred sequences TCG and CAA.

The resulting data are presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>. The replacement of Thr-261 either as a single mutation or in combination with any other amino-acids resulted in changing of HOXB13 specificity from Ctcg/Ccaa towards the sequence recognized by CDX2 (Gtcg/Gcaa; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>, left panel). No substitutions were identified that would lead to a specific and complete loss of binding to either the TCG or CAA sequence. However, some weaker effects were detected; several mutations affecting backbone contacts between HOXB13 amino-acids and DNA 5' of the divergent trinucleotide moderately increased the relative affinity towards the CAA sequence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>, right panel).</p><p>Analysis of the mutation data together with the structures revealed that amino-acids involved in the protein-DNA interface formation cannot fully explain the specificity preferences of HOXB13 and CDX2.

The HOXB13-DNA<sup>CAA</sup> structure (2.2 Å) contains chains of water molecules that interact with both HOXB13 amino-acids and each of the DNA bases in the CAA sequence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A–C</xref>). In contrast, no water molecules are visible in the HOXB13-DNA<sup>TCG</sup> structure, despite the 3.2 Å resolution that should allow identification of strongly bound water molecules. Consistently, only few water molecules were found in the CDX2-DNA<sup>TCG</sup> complex. A relatively large solvent channel (6.4 Å in smallest diameter) exists between the α3 helix of HOXB13 and DNA<sup>TCG</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>) while this space is occupied by well-defined water-net including Arg-258 in HOXB13-DNA<sup>CAA</sup> structure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1A</xref>). The electron density in this region of HOXB13-DNA<sup>TCG</sup> structure is low (σ &lt; 0.5), similar to that found in the surrounding solvent, indicating that the water-molecules in this region are highly mobile. Thus, the optimal binding of HOXB13 to the CAA sequence can be rationalized by the visible interactions that contribute to the enthalpy of binding (∆H). In contrast, no such interactions can be identified that could explain the preference of HOXB13 to the TCG trinucleotide. The absence of ordered solvent molecules, and the lower resolution of the HOXB13-DNA<sup>TCG</sup> structure is consistent with the possibility that the TCG sequence is preferred because it represents a relatively disordered, high entropy state. In complex of CDX2-DNA<sup>TCG</sup> with high resolution (2.57 Å) the water molecules were well visible but they did not form the corresponding water-chains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E,F</xref>) supporting the idea of entropically driven binding. The channel is not as clearly visible from one side of the CDX2-DNA<sup>TCG</sup> complex because of the presence of Lys-231 instead of Thr-261. The long side chain of Lys-231 does not allow Arg-228 (corresponded to Arg-258 in HOXB13) to change its conformation easily. Together, Arg-228 and Lys-231 close the entry of the channel from this side but the other end of the channel is open and well visible in CDX2-DNA<sup>TCG</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1B,C</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig4" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.32963.010</object-id><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><title>Close view of the role of water molecules in HOXB13-DNA interaction.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Schematic representation of water-mediated interactions between amino-acids (red typeface) of HOXB13 and DNA bases in the HOXB13-DNA<sup>CAA</sup> structure.

However, biological macromolecules are composed of a small set of relatively large monomers, and thus populate the shape-space more sparsely than synthetic small molecules, which can be modified at the level of single atoms. Therefore, the finding that TFs can bind to two distinct DNA sequences with equal affinity was unexpected (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Badis et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Jolma et al., 2013</xref>) and has been controversial in the field. Our initial hypothesis was that the two optimal states could be due to an ability of the TF to adopt two distinct conformational states, or due to a similarity of the shapes of the two distinct DNA sequences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Kalodimos et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Nakagawa et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Párraga et al., 1998</xref>). To address these hypotheses, we solved the structure of HOXB13, a central transcription factor involved in both development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Economides and Capecchi, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Krumlauf, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Nolte et al., 2015</xref>) and tumorigenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Ewing et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Huang and Cai, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Pomerantz et al., 2015</xref>) bound to its two optimal DNA sequences. Surprisingly, the conformational differences between the HOXB13 proteins in the two structures were minor. Similarly, the two CDX2-DNA structures also displayed very similar overall conformations. In addition, the shape and charge-distribution of the optimally bound DNA sequences were not similar to each other. Thus, the structural analysis failed to support either the dual protein conformation or the DNA shape similarity models. Instead, thermodynamic analyses of HOXB13, CDX2, BARHL2 and MYF5 revealed that the two optimal states were bound because of their distinct effects on enthalpy and entropy, principally caused by differential stability of the water network at the protein-DNA interface. We also failed to find mutations in HOXB13 that would specifically abolish binding to one of the DNA sites. This finding is consistent with the thermodynamic model presented, as both TCG and CAA are bound by the same conformation of the HOXB13 protein, using the same contacting amino-acids (even when the contacts can occur via water or be direct).</p><p>Our findings explain the mechanism behind the observed genetic epistasis at some TF binding sites. In addition, our findings are relevant to evolution of TF binding sites and macromolecular interactions. The ability of one molecular shape (HOXB13) to bind to two distinct molecular shapes (CAA and TCG) with similar affinity allows other mechanisms to selectively modulate target sites in the genome. For example, one of the HOXB13 optima, TCG, is affected by DNA methylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Yin et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Zuo et al., 2017</xref>), and methylation of this site further increases HOXB13 affinity. The CAA site does not contain a CpG dinucleotide, and thus cannot be inheritably methylated. Thus, the ability of HOXB13 to bind to two distinct sites with similar affinity allows evolution of two types of regulatory sequences, those that are directly and positively affected by CpG methylation, and those that are not.</p><p>The mechanism by which TFs bind to two optimal DNA sequences is fundamental, and applies to all macromolecular interactions. In principle, enthalpy and entropy of binding vary partially independently as a function of the shape and charge distribution of the interacting molecules. Thus, different sequences are likely to be optimal with respect to enthalpy and entropy, in such a way that one optimal sequence is close to the optimal enthalpy state, and another is close to the optimal entropy state (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). We are not aware of work that has previously described such a situation. The observed effect that commonly results in at least two distinct ΔG minima may have been missed before because it is generally strongest when there are solvent molecules at the interacting surface. Interacting through solvent molecules can increase enthalpy of binding, but also causes a large loss of entropy due to fixing of the solvent molecule(s). However, in macromolecular interactions that are driven by direct contact between residues, entropy often has lower impact on binding than enthalpy, and thus one of the optima is at a higher ΔG than the other. Another reason for overlooking this mechanism could have been the fact that multiple local optima can also exist via other mechanisms (see for example [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Klebe, 2015</xref>]), and measurements that allow inference of entropy and enthalpy separately are not commonly performed in studies of macromolecular interactions. In addition, simple additive binding models such as position weight matrices (PWMs) can hide the effect, as they can only describe a single optimal state.</p><fig id="fig6" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.32963.014</object-id><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><title>The two optimal sites bound by HOXB13 represent enthalpy and entropy-driven optima.</title><p>(<bold>A–B</bold>) Schematic cartoon illustrations of the binding mechanism driven by the low enthalpy (<bold>A</bold>) and by high entropy (<bold>B</bold>) are presented in the left panels. The DNA bases are presented as pyrimidine and purine rings, protein is represented as ellipsoid, N-terminus is shown bound to the minor groove created by A-stretch, and water molecules are shown schematically and colored blue. The dashed lines represent hydrogen bonds observed in the low enthalpy state; the solid line represents direct interactions between amino acids and bases. The blurred water molecules indicate the high entropy state. Hydrogen bonds that are common to both complexes are omitted for clarity. Graphs on the right show schematic illustration of the variance of enthalpy (ΔH, top), entropy (-TΔS, middle) and Gibbs free energy (ΔG) (bottom) as a function of an idealized one-dimensional continuous variable representing the high-dimensional variables of shape, electrostatic charge and vibration of DNA that vary as a function of the DNA sequence. As DNA is composed of only four bases, only discrete positions along this axis are possible (indicated by dots). Example models of shape and charge distribution of different DNA sequences (from <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>) are shown as surface representation above the scheme. The surfaces are colored according to the charge distribution: positively charged atoms are in blue, negatively charged are in red and neutral atoms are in green. Note that enthalpy and entropy are partially negatively correlated, leading to binding promiscuity (wider optima in ΔG compared to ΔH and ΔS). The remaining uncorrelated component leads to the presence of two optima for ΔG (bottom). Shaded boxes on the right show simplified dinucleotide binding models that illustrate how this leads to two distinct locally optimal sequences. Note that the values are for illustration purposes only and the ‘bumps’ illustrate local entropy-enthalpy compensation that broadens the peaks of ΔG.</p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="x-tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-32963-fig6-v1"/></fig><p>The cases we studied here represent some of the strongest deviations from the PWM model, and also present two optima of very similar ΔG that are located relatively far from each other in sequence space. Because we selected for this study cases with two almost equally strong binding sequences, the effect is likely to be stronger here than in most other interactions. Thus, the relative importance of the phenomenon across other types of interactions needs to be evaluated experimentally. The phenomenon we observed exists due to the fact that entropy and enthalpy of binding vary as a function of the shape of the interacting macromolecules. Both functions will have optima, commonly at different exact positions. The binding free energy will also vary as a function of the shape, but is likely to have more optima than its constituent functions because they are partially independent of each other. Thus, it is likely that many other biologically relevant examples of this effect will be identified. Many of these will represent cases where the sequences representing entropic and enthalpic optima are more closely related to each other than in the extreme cases studied here. This would manifest as a ‘flat bottom’ in the affinity landscape, where many sequences would bind with similar affinity. In addition, it is likely that in most cases one of the local optima is located at lower affinity than the other. This would manifest as a minor peak or a shoulder in the affinity landscape away from the optimal sequence. In each case, the measured affinities would deviate from those predicted from a single PWM model.</p><p>Our results and the underlying theory suggest that the ability of TFs to bind to distinct sequences could thus be widespread, and that the importance of the optimal states in determining TF-DNA binding preferences should be reinvestigated. Moreover, models for TF binding that are used to identify TF sites should also be adjusted to include features that allow two or more optima. In a broader sense, our results are potentially relevant to all macromolecular interactions, particularly in the presence of a polar solvent such as water that can contribute to bridging interactions, whose contributions to the enthalpy and entropy of binding are in the same order of magnitude. Therefore, in addition to explaining the observed epistasis in protein-DNA interactions, the presence of two optima is likely to also explain the molecular mechanisms behind other types of genetic epistasis.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s3-1"><title>Protein expression, purification and crystallization</title><p>Expression and purification of the DNA-binding domain fragment of human HOXB13 (residues 209–283) as well as CDX2 (residues 184–256) were performed as described in Refs.

The apparent binding constant K<sub>d</sub>, binding enthalpy ∆H and stoichiometry n, together with their corresponding standard deviation (s.d.), were determined by a nonlinear least square fit of the data to standard equations for the binding using a model for one set of independent and identical binding sites as implemented in the package.

Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Naama Barkai as the Senior Editor. The following individuals involved in review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Gary Stormo (Reviewer #1); Thomas D Tullius (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>In this manuscript, the authors address an important but poorly understood phenomenon: that DNA-binding proteins sometimes recognize with similar affinity DNA sites that diverge substantially in sequence. For two homeodomain proteins, they assemble thermodynamic data that argue for the primary role of entropy-enthalpy compensation in producing similar binding affinity for distinct sequences. They also collect thermodynamic binding data for two additional proteins that exhibit the same behavior, supporting their conclusions. They interpret structural data (X-ray co-crystal structures) as supporting the idea that ordered water structure (or its lack) at the protein-DNA interface is the main source of this thermodynamic compensation.</p><p>Previous work in this area (particularly the important paper by Jen-Jacobson et al. that is referenced by the authors) focused on thermodynamic analysis of several different DNA binding proteins bound to their canonical binding sites, and noted the entropy-enthalpy compensation phenomenon. The present manuscript instead shows that entropy-enthalpy compensation occurs for the same protein bound to two very different DNA sites, a new and significant observation. (Notably, in the data presented in Figure 1 of the Jen-Jacobson et al. paper, entropy-enthalpy compensation is apparent for proteins binding to the same core site in different sequence contexts, and also for proteins binding to point mutants of the canonical site, similar in some ways to the observations central to the current manuscript. However, Jen-Jacobson et al. do not discuss this point.) The authors of the present manuscript significantly extend previous work in this area by solving X-ray co-crystal structures of the complexes of interest, and by analyzing these structures to provide a structural underpinning for the thermodynamic observations.</p><p>Opinion:</p><p>The manuscript will be influential in understanding the important problem of how proteins select DNA binding sites in genomes.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>A) Conceptual:</p><p>1) The generalizability of the finding based on a handful of examples of TFs binding to DNA, to all other biomolecular interactions, is probably somewhat overstated. For example, how sure are we at this point that the last sentence of the Abstract will turn out to be as generalizable as it is currently stated? The authors should provide stronger arguments or more evidence that such duality of enthalpy/entropy-driven binding actually exists among many interactions. Or tune down this and related statements.</p><p>2) In a general sense, it would be more reassuring to see correlations of how this mechanism might translate to in vivo TF functions.</p><p>3) One of the surprising results is that, as stated &quot;no substitutions were identified that would lead to a specific loss of binding to the TCG or CAA sequences&quot;. This observation should be better explained.</p><p>4) When discussing the presence or absence of structured water in the complexes (a key feature of their structural analysis), the authors state: &quot;A relatively large solvent channel (6.4 Å in smallest diameter) exists between the α3 helix of HOXB13 and DNA (Figure 4D).&quot; To clarify their argument, the authors should specify in the text that this observation refers to the HOXB13-DNA-TCG structure (as is done in the figure caption). Is such a solvent channel present in the HOXB13-DNA-CAA structure? The text seems to imply that it is not present in the CAA structure, but please clarify. Similarly, there is no mention in the text as to the presence or absence of a channel in the CDX2 complexes. A central point in the authors' connection of structure with thermodynamics for these systems is the presence or absence of ordered water at the protein-DNA interface. Differences in the channel are implied to be, at least in part, the reason for different water ordering that is reflected in the entropy changes associated with binding, so it is important to clarify whether this is indeed observed in the structures.</p><p>B) Presentation:</p><p>5) The result, if generalizable, is clearly significant, although the authors could more explicitly spell out what findings are truly novel versus already established. For example, it is already established that binding of a TF to very different sequences is relatively widespread, but it is less well established how the thermodynamic underpinnings of such differential recognition mechanisms operate.</p><p>6) It is not immediately clear how new the observations presented in Figure 1 are. How much of what is presented here is based on data obtained in previous papers?</p><p>7) The flow might be quite difficult to follow for those without direct expertise in the technical details of the approaches used. Here is a suggestion for reorganization to improve the flow: The primary (and most obvious) evidence for the mechanistic difference in binding for the two homeodomains with the two DNA sequences is the calorimetry data shown in Figure 5. The X-ray structural data are interesting, but not really conclusive as to mechanism; the structures support the thermodynamic data but don't really stand alone. For example, that all four structures look like every other homeodomain-DNA structure is not surprising at all. The differences between the four structures are pretty subtle, and also are not well-explained in the manuscript for the two CDX2 complexes. In contrast, the calorimetry data are very consistent for the two homeodomains, and for two other proteins. Thus, we suggest to reorder the Results section as follows: (1) PWM models (which suggest the problem to be addressed); (2) calorimetry data (to experimentally address mechanism); (3) X-ray data (to support the calorimetry data); (4) MD simulations (that support the X-ray and calorimetry).</p><p>8) The references in the main text are all over the place, and should be reformatted according to <italic>eLife</italic> referencing style.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.32963.032</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>A) Conceptual:</p><p>1) The generalizability of the finding based on a handful of examples of TFs binding to DNA, to all other biomolecular interactions, is probably somewhat overstated.

We have now clarified that the phenomenon we observe exists due to the fact that entropy and enthalpy of binding are partially independent variables. They are often anticorrelated, but not completely. If they were completely anticorrelated, all binding affinities would be identical, which is clearly not the case. We have now clarified this in the third and fourth paragraphs of the subsection “Conclusions”. We have also clarified that even when the phenomenon itself is general, its relative importance in particular interactions varies. Because we selected cases with two equally strong maxima, the effect is stronger here than in most interactions. The relative importance of the phenomenon across other types of interactions needs to be evaluated experimentally. This is now stated in the fourth paragraph of the aforementioned subsection.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) In a general sense, it would be more reassuring to see correlations of how this mechanism might translate to in vivo TF functions.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree, and have now added a citation to Yin et al., 2017 and Zuo et al., 2017 papers, which show that one of the HOXB13 optima, TCG, is affected by DNA methylation (Conclusions, second paragraph). Methylation of this site further increases HOXB13 affinity. The CAA site does not contain CpG dinucleotide, and is not epigenetically methylated. Thus, the ability of HOXB13 to bind to two distinct sites with similar affinity allows evolution of two types of regulatory sequences, those that are directly and positively affected by methylation, and those that are not.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) One of the surprising results is that, as stated &quot;no substitutions were identified that would lead to a specific loss of binding to the TCG or CAA sequences&quot;. This observation should be better explained.</p></disp-quote><p>We have now clarified that this set of experiments was carried out to mechanistically understand the origin of the dual specificity, and the molecular mechanisms that explain different specificities between the posterior HOX proteins. This analysis failed to find mutations that lead to selective and complete loss of binding to TCG or CAA site. Some weaker effects were detected, and this is now clarified in the fifth paragraph of the subsection “Structural analysis of HOXB13 and CDX2 bound to DNA<sup>TCG</sup> and DNA<sup>CAA</sup>”. As we did not test all possible mutations, we cannot conclude that no such mutations exist. However, the failure to find highly selective mutations is consistent with the thermodynamic model presented, as both TCG and CAA are bound by the same conformation of the HOXB13 protein, using the same contacting amino-acids (even when the contacts can occur via water or be direct). This is now stated in the first paragraph of the subsection “Conclusions”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) When discussing the presence or absence of structured water in the complexes (a key feature of their structural analysis), the authors state: &quot;A relatively large solvent channel (6.4 Å in smallest diameter) exists between the α3 helix of HOXB13 and DNA (Figure 4D).&quot; To clarify their argument, the authors should specify in the text that this observation refers to the HOXB13-DNA-TCG structure (as is done in the figure caption). Is such a solvent channel present in the HOXB13-DNA-CAA structure? The text seems to imply that it is not present in the CAA structure, but please clarify. Similarly, there is no mention in the text as to the presence or absence of a channel in the CDX2 complexes. A central point in the authors' connection of structure with thermodynamics for these systems is the presence or absence of ordered water at the protein-DNA interface. Differences in the channel are implied to be, at least in part, the reason for different water ordering that is reflected in the entropy changes associated with binding, so it is important to clarify whether this is indeed observed in the structures.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewers for pointing this out. We have now clarified that the water channel exists in both CDX and HOXB13 TCG structures, but not in the corresponding CAA structures (subsection “Role of water molecules in the protein-DNA interface”). We have also added new figure supplement to Figure 4 to illustrate this.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>B) Presentation:</p><p>5) The result, if generalizable, is clearly significant, although the authors could more explicitly spell out what findings are truly novel versus already established. For example, it is already established that binding of a TF to very different sequences is relatively widespread, but it is less well established how the thermodynamic underpinnings of such differential recognition mechanisms operate.</p></disp-quote><p>We have now clarified in the Introduction (third paragraph) and in legend to Figure 1 that the ability of TFs to bind to two distinct sequences is well established.</p><p>In addition, we have clarified that the mechanism for this effect is also understood for dimers (e.g. SREBP; Introduction, third and fourth paragraph), but not for some monomeric TFs.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) It is not immediately clear how new the observations presented in Figure 1 are. How much of what is presented here is based on data obtained in previous papers?</p></disp-quote><p>We have clarified that Figure 1 shows new motifs derived from existing data (panels C, D) or from new data (panel A, B). We have now also cited several publications, including Badis et al., 2009, Jolma et al., 2013 and Zuo et al. 2017 to clarify that two distinct binding models for HOXB13 have been previously reported (subsection “Modeling the binding of many TFs requires more than one PWM model”, first paragraph).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7) The flow might be quite difficult to follow for those without direct expertise in the technical details of the approaches used. Here is a suggestion for reorganization to improve the flow: The primary (and most obvious) evidence for the mechanistic difference in binding for the two homeodomains with the two DNA sequences is the calorimetry data shown in Figure 5. The X-ray structural data are interesting, but not really conclusive as to mechanism; the structures support the thermodynamic data but don't really stand alone. For example, that all four structures look like every other homeodomain-DNA structure is not surprising at all. The differences between the four structures are pretty subtle, and also are not well-explained in the manuscript for the two CDX2 complexes. In contrast, the calorimetry data are very consistent for the two homeodomains, and for two other proteins. Thus, we suggest to reorder the Results section as follows: (1) PWM models (which suggest the problem to be addressed); (2) calorimetry data (to experimentally address mechanism); (3) X-ray data (to support the calorimetry data); (4) MD simulations (that support the X-ray and calorimetry).</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that a different flow of the manuscript might make it easier for some scientists to follow the manuscript. However, we prefer to retain the order of presentation as it is collinear with the actual process of the study, and the origin of the hypothesis that was tested. This is in principle an important aspect of the scientific process, and we feel that giving the reader a sense of how the discovery was made is more important than the relatively minor increase in clarity that the reordering might accomplish.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>8) The references in the main text are all over the place, and should be reformatted according to eLife referencing style.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for pointing this out.
