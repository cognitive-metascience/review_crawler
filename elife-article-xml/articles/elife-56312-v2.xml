Although it is technically possible to genome-edit the chicken, its long generation time (6 months to sexual maturity) makes it an impractical lab model and has prevented it widespread use in research. The Japanese quail (<italic>Coturnix coturnix japonica</italic>) is an attractive alternative, very similar to the chicken, but with the decisive asset of a much shorter generation time (1.5 months). In recent years, transgenic quail lines have been described. Most of them were generated using replication-deficient lentiviruses, a technique that presents diverse limitations. Here, we introduce a novel technology to perform transgenesis in quail, based on the in vivo transfection of plasmids in circulating Primordial Germ Cells (PGCs). This technique is simple, efficient and allows using the infinite variety of genome engineering approaches developed in other models. Furthermore, we present a website centralizing quail genomic and technological information to facilitate the design of genome-editing strategies, showcase the past and future transgenic quail lines and foster collaborative work within the avian community.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>quail</kwd><kwd>transgenesis</kwd><kwd>primordial germ cells</kwd><kwd>transfection</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Other</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100007393</institution-id><institution>Association Française contre les Myopathies</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Research grant</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Marcelle</surname><given-names>Christophe</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000970</institution-id><institution>Stem Cells Australia</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Research grant</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Marcelle</surname><given-names>Christophe</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Transfection of quail primordial germ cells considerably expands the possibilities of genome modifications in birds, elevating the quail to the rank of genetic laboratory animal models of reference.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Due to the easy access of chicken embryos to manipulation, this model has been at the origin of numerous seminal discoveries in a diverse range of topics (e.g. immunology, genetics, virology, cancer, cell biology, ethology, etc.; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Stern, 2005</xref>). The specificities of the avian model have fostered the development of efficient techniques to target cells and tissues (e.g. in vivo electroporation, lipophilic dye labeling) that, combined with high-end imaging technologies (e.g. light sheet and fast-scanning two-photon excitation microscopy), have allowed the studies of dynamic morphogenetic processes in an amniote embryo environment with exceptional spatiotemporal resolution. Genetic approaches in birds have, however, lagged behind the two main genetic vertebrate models (mouse and fish), largely due to the particularities of the reproductive physiology of birds. The zygote is very difficult to access as it initiates its development internally, in the hen's oviduct and on a large yolk. By the time the egg is laid, the embryo has already developed into a blastoderm of about 40,000–50,000 cells with the germ line lineage already set aside (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Eyal-Giladi and Kochav, 1976</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Intarapat and Stern, 2013</xref>). Because of this, most researchers in avian genetics have focused their efforts on two distinct methods (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Nishijima and Iijima, 2013</xref>): i) the genetic manipulation of primordial germ cells (PGCs) in vitro, which are injected back into recipient embryos (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Idoko-Akoh et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Park et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Taylor et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">van de Lavoir et al., 2006</xref>) or ii) the direct infection of PGCs within the subgerminal cavity with replication-defective lentiviruses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bosselman et al., 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">McGrew et al., 2004</xref>). Both approaches have been applied successfully to chicken (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Nishijima and Iijima, 2013</xref>). However, due to their long generation time (6 months to sexual maturity), transgenesis in chicken is impracticable within the timeframe of most research projects. Therefore, this technology has not been widely used in basic research and its development has been mainly driven by industrial interests to produce biologically active pharmaceutical proteins in eggs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Lillico et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Nishijima and Iijima, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Woodfint et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>Japanese quail (<italic>Corturnix coturnix japonica</italic>) is a better alternative for avian genetics. Quail is a well-known model in the developmental biology field through its extensive use in the so-called quail-chick chimera technique (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Le Douarin, 1973</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Le Douarin, 2005</xref>). Indeed, quail and chicken are close relatives (Order: Galliformes; Family: Phasianidae), they share on average 95% homology at the gene sequence level (GenBank) and quails are susceptible to most chicken diseases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Barnes, 1987</xref>). Similar to chicken, quail lay about one egg per day, and their smaller size makes them more compatible with the frequently limited space of animal facilities. A decisive advantage of quail over chicken is that they reach sexual maturity in 6 weeks. Thus, their life cycle is significantly shorter than that of chicken (26 weeks), but also of mice (8 weeks) or zebrafish (12 weeks). As no reliable technique for the culture of quail PGCs has yet been described, transgenesis in this species has mainly relied on the infection of blastoderm stage embryos (or circulating <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Zhang et al., 2012</xref>) with lentiviruses carrying fluorescent markers under ubiquitous or tissue-specific promoters, leading in recent years to the generation of a few quail lines: ubiquitous (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Huss et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Zhang et al., 2012</xref>); neuronal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Scott and Lois, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Seidl et al., 2013</xref>; adipose <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Ahn et al., 2015</xref>; intestinal <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Woodfint et al., 2017</xref>; endothelial <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Sato et al., 2010</xref>). A high titre of lentivirus is required to succeed at producing chimeric embryos carrying transgenic PGCs using this technique (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Poynter and Lansford, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Scott and Lois, 2005</xref>). Even though large inserts (more than 10 kilobases) can theoretically be packaged using lentiviruses, a sharp drop in viral titre is observed with insert above 4–5 kb, likely representing the upper limit of constructs that can be used to generate transgenic birds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Kumar et al., 2001</xref>; our observation). An important advance in the field was the recent use of adenoviral vectors to perform the first CRISPR/Cas9-mediated targeted gene knockout in quail by direct infection of blastoderm cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Lee et al., 2019</xref>). Whereas viruses should be sufficient for a number of applications, the size limitation of inserted constructs may be a significant restriction for their use to generate complex transgenes.</p><p>For biosafety and commercial reasons, non-viral and simpler technologies for achieving transgenic poultry have been tested. The direct in vivo transfection of PGCs with commercially available liposome-based transfection reagents has recently been successfully used to generate transgenic chicken lines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Cooper et al., 2018b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cooper et al., 2018a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Tyack et al., 2013</xref>). Insertion of Tol2 (T2) transposable elements in constructs allows the efficient and stable integration of foreign DNA into the genome of transfected PGCs in the presence of exogenously provided transposase protein. Since DNA inserts up to a size of 11 kb can be cloned between Tol2 sequences with no visible loss of transposable efficiency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Kawakami, 2007</xref>) this allows using larger and/or more complex constructs than in viruses. Another advantage of transgenesis using the Tol2 transposon system is that it leads to minimal epigenetic silencing during development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Macdonald et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>Here, we used the direct transfection of PGCs in the bloodstream of quail embryos. We present three novel quail transgenic lines carrying fluorescent proteins under ubiquitous and tissue-specific promoters. Illustrating the flexibility of the plasmid-based system, we integrated a cassette containing the GFP protein driven by a promoter for Chick βB1-Crystallin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Taube et al., 2002</xref>) making the identification of transgenic animals possible at hatching by UV illumination. Moreover, we present a community website where existing lines are described and new ones can be uploaded. This portal also centralizes useful technical resources for the study of this model and genomic information, based on the recently sequenced quail genome that will facilitate the generation of novel lines and the design of functional experiments in quail.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Direct transfection of quail PGCs</title><p>Unlike mammals, avian PGCs temporarily transit through the blood system. Chicken PGCs initially located at the end of gastrulation within the germinal crescent, enter the extra-embryonic blood vessels at about 30 hr of incubation (E1.5, HH9) and begin to circulate throughout the embryo. Their number in the blood peaks around E2/2.5 (HH15-16). By E3 (HH20), PGCs actively migrate back in the embryo and into the gonad anlagen (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Nakamura et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Nieuwkoop and Sutasurya, 1979</xref>). Chicken PGCs are transfected during their transient journey in the bloodstream, using a transfection mix containing lipofectamine, a transgenesis plasmid with Tol2 elements flanking the DNA construct to be inserted and a plasmid coding for transposase under an ubiquitous promoter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Tyack et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>To test whether the direct transfection of PGCs can be achieved in quails, we determined whether we could observe PGCs transfected with fluorescent proteins once they colonized the gonads. A transfection mix containing a transgenesis plasmid coding for a membrane-localised GFP (GFP-CAAX) and a nuclear monomeric Cherry (NLS-mCherry) under the control of a strong ubiquitous promoter (CAG: CMV promoter, chick beta actin enhancer; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Niwa et al., 1991</xref>) was injected into the bloodstream of quail embryos (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Quail develop slightly faster than chicken (17–18 days for quails; 21 days for chicken). However, we found that the timing of injection of the transfection mix resulting in the colonization of fluorescent PGCs was similar to that determined in chicken, that is at 2 days (E2) of quail embryonic development. Indeed, 5 days after injection (at E7), we observed that gonads contained many fluorescent cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). We confirmed that these were PGCs using whole-mount immunostaining with a PGC-specific marker VASA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C–F</xref>).</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>PGC transfection in vivo and generation of a quail line ubiquitously expressing membranal GFP and nuclear mCherry.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Vectors used in the injection mix.

We isolated a 462bp-long lens-specific promoter of the βB1crystallin gene (CRYBB1; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Duncan et al., 1995</xref>) from chicken genomic DNA and cloned it upstream of GFP to develop a selection mini-gene (CrystallGFP) based on lens expression. The CrystallGFP mini gene is only 1.7 kb long and can be added to transgene constructs. To test the specificity of the promoter, we co-electroporated the CrystallGFP construct together with a ubiquitously expressed RFP (CAG-RFP) into the optic cup of a quail E3 embryo (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A–D</xref>). Twenty-four hours after electroporation, RFP-positive cells were found in the retina and lens (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B,D</xref>).

In this and other experiments described below, we have observed that about half of the (50) injected eggs hatched. Six weeks later, we collected semen from adult males and tested by PCR for the presence of the transgene. Three (F0) males, positive for the transgene, were crossed with four females each. From these crosses, three transgenic (F1) birds could be readily spotted at hatching by fluorescence screening thanks to the ubiquitously expressed GFP and mCherry. Expression of GFP or mCherry was visible in the beak, eyes and legs of the transgenic birds compared to wild-type animals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G,H</xref>). Immunostaining on cross-sections of E3 transgenic embryos showed a ubiquitous expression of the GFP at the cell membrane and of mCherry in nuclei (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1I–K</xref>). From this and other crosses we have performed in the laboratory (see below), we estimate that about 1% of the offspring contain the transgene, an efficiency comparable to that observed in the chicken using the same technology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Tyack et al., 2013</xref>). Compared to the existing quail lines carrying ubiquitously expressed fluorescent proteins, this line should prove useful to researchers in the field. Indeed, we observed that the membrane-bound GFP results in a better resolution of cell membrane processes (protrusions, filopodia, etc.) than a cytoplasmic counterpart, while it also combines a nuclear mCherry, allowing accurate segmentation of cells necessary for automated image analyses such as for 3D cell tracking. As a proof of concept of the usefulness of this transgene, we performed real-time video microscopy on 2-day-old embryos (observation time of about 12 hr), which illustrates the extensive morphogenetic changes taking place during early development (e.g. somitogenesis, heart and otic placode formation, etc.; see <xref ref-type="video" rid="video1">Video 1</xref>), while a higher magnification exquisitely shows the posteriorward migration of the pronephric primordium (see <xref ref-type="video" rid="video2">Video 2</xref>) in this embryo.</p><media id="video1" mime-subtype="mp4" mimetype="video" xlink:href="elife-56312-video1.mp4"><label>Video 1.</label><caption><title>Time-lapse video of an E2 TgT2(CAG:GFP-CAAX-IRES-NLS-mCherry) embryo observed in ovo.</title><p>Embryo was maintained at 38°C and imaged every 10mn for 12 hr using Thunder Imager Model Organism Leica stereo microscope equipped with 1x lens.</p></caption></media><media id="video2" mime-subtype="mp4" mimetype="video" xlink:href="elife-56312-video2.mp4"><label>Video 2.</label><caption><title>Time-lapse video of an E2.5 TgT2(CAG:GFP-CAAX-IRES-NLS-mCherry) embryo.</title><p>Embryo was maintained at 38°C and imaged every 10mn for 12 hr using Thunder Imager Model Organism Leica stereo microscope equipped with 5x lens.</p></caption></media></sec><sec id="s2-3-2"><title>TgT2(CAG:Kaede): ubiquitous expression of a photoconvertible fluorescent protein</title><p>To generate this transgenic line, E2 quail embryos were injected with a construct coding for a cytoplasmic form of the photoconvertible fluorescent protein Kaede (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Ando et al., 2002</xref>), driven by a CAG promoter. Upon irradiation with ultraviolet light, Kaede undergoes irreversible photoconversion from green to red fluorescence. Three F1 founders were obtained in which strong and ubiquitous expression of the photoconvertible fluorescent protein is observed in adult (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>) and in developing embryos (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). Using the region of interest (ROI) function present in most confocal microscopes, specific areas of the embryo can be UV-illuminated to efficiently photoconvert the green fluorescent Kaede protein present in tissues to its red counterpart (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C–F</xref>). The long half-life of the photoconverted Kaede results in red fluorescence that can be detected up to 48 hr after photoconversion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Tomura et al., 2008</xref>). One major application of the TgT2(CAG:Kaede) quail line is the possibility to track in vivo the behaviour of cells over time.

We designed a muscle-specific promoter, based on a synthetic reporter derived from the MLC1F/3F gene regulatory sequences previously utilized for mouse transgenesis (3F-nlacZ-E; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Kelly et al., 1995</xref>). It contains a 2 kb sequence located 5' and 3' of the MLC3F transcriptional start site together with a 260 bp enhancer sequences from the 3' UTR region of the MLC3F gene, necessary for the high level of transcription in muscles. This construct was shown to drive strong LacZ expression in all (head and body) striated muscles from the early steps of myogenesis in somites of mouse embryos throughout embryogenesis, as well as in all skeletal muscles of the foetus and in the adult (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Kelly et al., 1995</xref>). We included in the transgenesis construct the CrystallGFP cassette to facilitate the selection of F1 transgenic birds (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2H</xref>).</p><p>F0 founder males were crossed with females and from 242 chicks that hatched, 3 transgenic F1 founders (1 male and 2 females, that is 1.2% efficiency) were selected, based on the expression of GFP in the lens (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2I</xref>). These F1 were used to characterize the expression of the transgene during embryogenesis.</p><p>The GFP and RFP reporters were expressed in all (i.e. head, trunk and limb) skeletal muscles of the developing embryo (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4I–N</xref>). On sections of E3 embryos, stained for GFP and RFP, strong expression was detected throughout the myotome of trunk somites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A–D</xref>). We observed that the first sign of mCherry expression was detected within the transition zone (TZ; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E–H</xref>), where MYF5-expressing cells emanating from the medial border from the overlying dermomyotome translocate and extend along the antero-posterior axis of the embryo to form myocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Gros et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Gros et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Rios et al., 2011</xref>). This is coherent with a recent characterization of the MLC promoter we have done using in vivo electroporation in the chicken and where we found that its activity is initiated in myogenin-expressing, terminally differentiating myogenic cells within the TZ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Sieiro et al., 2019</xref>). MLC thus drives expression of the reporter genes from the early stages of myogenesis. It remains active in terminally differentiated myofibres, similar to what had been observed in 3F-nlacZ-E mouse embryos (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Kelly et al., 1995</xref>). In contrast to this mouse line, where the expression of LacZ was observed in non-skeletal tissues (brain, optic vesicle and heart; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Kelly et al., 1995</xref>), we did not detect the transgene in those tissues in the transgenic quails we analyzed, suggesting a more rigorous restriction to the skeletal muscle lineage, an observation previously made in the chicken (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">McGrew et al., 2010</xref>). Refined details of the developing head, body and limb musculatures can be observed when (3DISCO) cleared E3 and E6 embryos are stained for GFP and RFP (together with an immunostaining against neural crest derivatives in blue for the E4 embryo) and imaged with light sheet microscopy (<xref ref-type="video" rid="video4">Videos 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="video" rid="video5">5</xref>).

The easy access to the embryo has fostered the development of a highly diverse range of techniques to track cells, manipulate their environment and modulate their gene function that, combined with in vivo time-lapse imaging, has brought crucial insights into many dynamic biological processes. However, the somewhat technically demanding aspects of those techniques have hampered their widespread use by many laboratories. The possibility to easily generate genetically modified bird lines would represent a game changer in the field that may incite established researchers and newcomers alike to consider using genome engineering in birds to address their questions. While the generation of transgenic quails using lentiviruses has met very significant successes, we believe that the technique of liposome-mediated PGC transfection that we describe in this report, with its simplicity, efficacy and extended possibilities of diversifications, will serve as a landmark in the use of quail as an economic alternative to others vertebrate models. In the lines generated here, the size of the transgenic DNA constructs inserted between the two Tol2 sites ranged from 3 kb for the Kaede photoconvertible line to 7.5 kb for the MLC muscle specific line. This flexibility thus allows the design of complex constructs and the use of large tissue-specific promoters that would be nearly impossible to accommodate in lentiviruses.</p><p>The website we have generated completes this technical advance and provides a wealth of information and resources that should significantly help future developments of the technology, including for the targeted insertion (knock-in) of foreign DNA into the quail genome.</p><p>A significant step to promote genetic approaches in avian is the recent creation of a quail transgenic facility (MQTF) at Monash University, where the quail lines described in this report were established and novel technologies are being developed at present. At MQTF (see link to website on QuailNet), transgenic birds can be made-to-order for avian researchers around the world. The worldwide availability of existing and future quail lines is currently addressed and details about this can be found in the QuailNet website. It is our belief that the creation of this facility constitutes the cornerstone of a network of future avian facilities that will strengthen our community and attract new generations of researchers across fields to one of the most versatile experimental systems there is.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Generating transgenic quail by direct injection</title><p>The direct injection technique is performed as described in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Tyack et al., 2013</xref>. Plasmid DNA was purified using Nucleobond Xtra Midi EF kit. Injection mix contained 0.6 μg of Tol2 plasmid, 1.2 μg of CAG Transposase plasmid, 3 μl of Lipofectamine 2000 CD (ThermoFisher Scientific) in 90 μl of OptiPro transfection medium. 1 μl of injection mix was injected in the dorsal aorta of 2.5-day-old embryos. After injection, eggs were sealed and incubated until hatching. Chicks were grown for 6 weeks until they reached sexual maturity. Semen from the male was collected using a female teaser and massage technic as described in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chełmońska et al., 2008</xref>. In short, the foam produced by the male cloacal gland was first emptied by pressing the gland. The male was then introduced in a cage, which already contained a female. When the male was ready to mate, it was taken out, turned on its back and a massage of the cloaca led to the expulsion of semen that was collected. Genomic DNA from semen was extracted and PCR was performed to test for the presence of the transgene. Males showing a positive band were kept and crossed with wild type females. F1 offsprings were selected directly after hatching using UV goggles if expression of the transgene was readily visible in newly hatched chicks or by genotyping 5 days after hatching by plucking a feather.</p></sec><sec id="s4-2"><title>Expression constructs</title><p>The T2(CAG:NLS-mCherry-IRES-GFP-CAAX) has been described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Sieiro-Mosti et al., 2014</xref>).

generation of three new transgenic quail lines using a relatively simple lipofection method using transposon-based plasmids (previously described) in quail embryos in ovo, by injecting the corresponding DNAs in the dorsal aorta and targeting circulating primordial germ cells. The three transgenic lines include: an ubiquitous double fluorescent line, a Kaede-based photoconvertible line and a skeletal muscle-specific line. The manuscript also describes the generation of a webpage (the Quail net Project) where different quail transgenic lines generated by different groups are listed together with direct access to curated quail sequences and other resources. In summary, it provides the avian community with new potent tools and encourage the use of quail as a solid genetic model.</p><p><bold>Decision letter after peer review:</bold></p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Transgenesis and web resources in quail&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by Marianne Bronner as the Senior and Reviewing Editor. The following individuals involved in review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Claudio D Stern (Reviewer #1); Cornelis Weijer (Reviewer #2); Aixa Victoria Morales (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and they all were enthusiastic about the resource. However, they point out areas in which the manuscript would require further information and clarification, all of which I believe can be achieved by textual changes. I refer you to the complete reviews below for details. Given the current world situation, we will give authors as much time as they need to submit revised manuscripts.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic></p><p>This is a very nice paper submitted as a &quot;Tools and Resources&quot; type of paper. It reports a very simple method for generating transgenic quails. The method consists of just injecting a mixture of the plasmid together with lipofectamine into the circulating blood stream of quail embryos at about E2.5, where the construct transfects some of the circulating primordial germ cells (PGCs). An elegant feature is a transgene that drives GFP expression in the lens (based on an enhancer of the crystallin gene) which allows quick and easy identification of transgenic animals in F2 for crossing and generating stable lines. The efficiency of transgenesis appears to be very high and the method lends itself to knock-in and knock-out methods for example by using CRISPR-Cas9 technology in combination with this transfection method. In principle this technique should be easily achievable in any lab with access to animal house facilities that can maintain quails (which need relatively little space and reach sexual maturity quickly). In the paper, several transgenic lines are generated including a nuclear RFP + membrane GFP double transgenic, a photoconvertible Kaede line for cell tracing, and a reporter for muscle. Examples of time-lapse films and 3d confocal imaging illustrate the usefulness of some of these for high resolution imaging and a variety of experiments. Finally the paper reports a set of online resources integrated with other existing databases, including a repository of available transgenic lines, a genome browser and other features.</p><p>Overall the paper is very well written and very nicely illustrated. I have no substantial comments to make and I feel that the paper can be published essentially &quot;as is&quot;, without the need for revision.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>In this paper it is shown that the in vivo transformation of primordial germ cells developed in chick can be adapted to quail. This makes it due to its short 6 week lifecycle and small size highly suitable for avian transgenesis experiments. The transgenesis efficiency (~1%) is manageable, especially when combined with rapid screening techniques, including such as the here developed eye lens specific crystallGFP. The authors describe the generation of three novel transgenic quail lines, a membraneGFP and nuclear RFP marker (TgT2(CAG:NLS-mCherry-IRES-GFP-CAAX)), a muscle specific marker using the promoter of the alkali myosin light chain (TgT2(Mmu.MLC1F/3F:GFP-CAAX-IRES-NLS-mCherry,Gga.CRYBB1:GFP)) as well as photo-convertable GFP line (TgT2(CAG:Kaede)).</p><p>The paper concludes with a section outlining a web resource bundling some key information concerning quail related research (transgenic lines, genomics, expression and anatomy databases as well as some tools), which useful, however see comments below</p><p>The paper is mainly a method/resource paper, it is clearly written and the methods/observations are well supported and documented.

Since transgenesis in quail is a rather recent technology, we can only talk about how a handful of colleagues that contacted us addressed this question so far. Few decided to set up small quail husbandries to maintain quail lines locally. Others decided to set up collaborations with the laboratories that generated and maintain the lines, which regularly provide fertilized eggs for their experiments. While setting up a quail husbandry locally may sound attractive, the amount of paperwork required by local and national administration, ethics and GMO committees, can be a significant deterrent as there are no established regulations on transgenesis with this novel animal model. Collaborations, on the other hand, are usually done on a small scale, and within reasonable distances from the source. To add to the confusion, international importation laws also forbid the transport of fertilized eggs between certain countries. To address those concerns, we are working on establishing reliable sources of fertilized eggs in two locations. The first is at the Veterinary school of UC Davis, CA, with whom a verbal agreement has been reached in recent months to centralize some of the existing quail lines and distribute them in the US; the second is in France, where ongoing discussions with the Lyon Veterinary School aim for something similar in Europe. Those consultations involve quite a bit of persistence and their outcomes are still uncertain. In this evolving situation, we cannot give specific details in the manuscript that address this issue, but we propose to mention those details in the QuailNet Website and refer to them in the manuscript as follows: &quot;The worldwide availability of existing and future quail lines is currently addressed and details about this can be found in the QuailNet website&quot;.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The website at the moment primarily summarises the currently existing transgenic quail lines and some novel information on anatomy.

The website is currently under a development phase and it is hoped that it will evolve as the technology spreads within the community.

This is coherent with the observation of our collaborator (T. Doran, that has developed this technology in chicken), which showed that among the 150 founders they analysed, a large majority (64%) contained one insertion in the chicken genome, while 27% contained two insertions.</p><p>These are the number of F1 founders for each transgenic line.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>TgT2(CAG:NLS-mCherry-IRES-GFP-CAAX): 3 F1 founders</p><p>TgT2(CAG:Kaede): 3 F1 founders</p><p>TgT2(Mmu.MLC1F/3F:GFP-CAAX-IRES-NLS-mCherry,Gga.CRYBB1:GFP): 3 F1 founders</p></disp-quote><p>This has been added to the text.</p><p>We have not observed any significant decrease of the signal over time, suggesting, as mentioned in the text that Tol2 insertions are not particularly prone to inactivation over time.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) The manuscript discuss poorly the transposon method they have used in relation to other methods such as lentivirus or adenovirus based method in relation to the efficiency of germline transmission. For instance, adenovirus mediated CRISPR/Cas9 mediated deletion has a transmission between 2.5 to 10% in a recent article by Lee et al., 2019, or in another recent lentivirus generated line, Ubiquitous expression of membrane tethered EGFP generated by one of the labs in the manuscript, rendered a transmission of 8% (Saadaoui et al., 2020).</p></disp-quote><p>The comparative efficiencies of those techniques is not really a limiting factor. To take an example, if a F0 male, found positive for the transgene with our technique, is crossed with 4 females that each lay an egg-a-day, one F1 will be made every 25 days of crossing (for an efficiency of 1%). As we usually cross 3 positive F0 males, we obtain about 3 F1 in the same period. The efficiencies that have been published about viruses are definitely higher (lentivirus: 8%; adenovirus: 2.5-10% efficiency) and they could allow a shorter crossing period, but in fact, our colleagues that use viruses tend to cross males with females for just about as long a period, such that they obtain more F1 than we do, which they anyhow cull to keep only two to three. Such that practically, there is not a huge advantage at having higher efficiencies to perform transgenesis. A low efficiency may become an important bottleneck if more delicate technologies are envisaged (e.g. KI), but it is unlikely that this can be solved with viruses, since the combined sizes of the Cas9, the gRNA, their respective promoters, the homology arms, and the KI construct (e.g. GFP) are clearly out of size range for viruses. As explained in the text, there are other advantages of the plasmid technique over the virus approach that make this technique attractive for specific applications.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) The authors should provide more details about the protocol for transgenesis: DNA quality purification, quail sperm obtaining, specific quail embryos clearing for 3DISCO.</p></disp-quote><p>Plasmids are prepared using the Nucleobond endotoxin-free midiprep kit.
