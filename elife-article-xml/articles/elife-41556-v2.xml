pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.41556.001</object-id><p>Many marine animals, ranging from corals to fishes, synchronise reproduction to lunar cycles. In the annelid <italic>Platynereis dumerilii,</italic> this timing is orchestrated by an endogenous monthly (circalunar) clock entrained by moonlight. Whereas daily (circadian) clocks cause extensive transcriptomic and proteomic changes, the quality and quantity of regulations by circalunar clocks have remained largely elusive. By establishing a combined transcriptomic and proteomic profiling approach, we provide first systematic insight into the molecular changes in <italic>Platynereis</italic> heads between circalunar phases, and across sexual differentiation and maturation. Whereas maturation elicits large transcriptomic and proteomic changes, the circalunar clock exhibits only minor transcriptomic, but strong proteomic regulation. Our study provides a versatile extraction technique and comprehensive resources. It corroborates that circadian and circalunar clock effects are likely distinct and identifies key molecular brain signatures for reproduction, sex and circalunar clock phase. Examples include prepro-whitnin/proctolin and ependymin-related proteins as circalunar clock targets.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.41556.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Like many other sea creatures, the worm <italic>Platynereis dumerilii</italic> reproduces by dispersing eggs and sperm in the water. For these animals, timing is everything: if they fail coordinate their release, the precious reproductive cells will drift in the vastness of the ocean without ever meeting their male or female counterparts.</p><p>Internal clocks are a set of mechanisms that allow organisms to tune their internal processes to their environment. For example, the circadian clock helps many creatures to adapt to the cycle of day and night. This involves switching genes on and off according to the time of day. When a gene is activated, its information is copied into a molecule of RNA, which is then read to create proteins that will go on performing specific roles. To produce their eggs and sperm at the right time, <italic>P. dumerilii</italic> worms rely on a poorly understood internal clock which is synchronized by the moon cycle.</p><p>To investigate this ‘inner calendar’, Schenk, Bannister et al. developed a new technique that allows them to extract both RNA and proteins from the miniscule heads of the worms. The results showed that the internal clock synchronized by the lunar phases influenced the levels of many more proteins than RNA molecules. In comparison, other life events such as the worms becoming sexually mature, had a more similar impact on both protein and RNA regulation. This might suggest that the inner calendar that coordinates the worms with the moon cycle could work by changing protein, rather than RNA levels. The analysis also highlighted several molecular actors that may be essential for the worm’s inner clock to work properly. In the future, the new technique will help to dissect more finely how <italic>P. dumerilii</italic> and many other marine creatures stay synchronized with the moon, and spawn at the right time.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>marine biology</kwd><kwd>chronobiology</kwd><kwd>development</kwd><kwd>sexual

sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Appropriate timing is essential for reproductive success, especially in organisms that reproduce via external fertilisation. In order to maximise the chances of successful mating encounters, marine animals often rely on mass spawning events that require synchronisation of behaviour and gonadal maturation, both within individuals and on a population level (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Fischer, 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Guest, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Hoeger et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Tessmar-Raible et al., 2011</xref>).</p><p>Many species achieve this synchronisation through the interplay of multiple timing systems that operate on different time scales, ranging from months or days to hours or even minutes (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Liedvogel et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Tessmar-Raible et al., 2011</xref>). One timing cue used for synchronised reproduction in organisms ranging from brown algae and corals to bristle worms, echinoderms and vertebrates, is provided by the changing phases of the moon (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Brady et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Coppard and Campbell, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Grant et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Kaniewska et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Kennedy and Pearse, 1975</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Oldach et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Rahman et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Raible et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Saavedra and Pousão-Ferreira, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Saigusa, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Skov et al., 2005</xref>). Depending on the species, the predominant physical cue interpreted by organisms is either gravitation or illumination. A study in reefs at two distinct lunar time points (full moon vs. new moon) has revealed a direct impact of moonlight illumination on the transcriptome of <italic>Acropora</italic> corals, but also found that light-induced transcriptome changes are most dramatic in mature animals, when light orchestrates the actual spawning event (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Kaniewska et al., 2015</xref>). While pointing at the transcriptome as a readout for organismal changes, this study therefore also illustrates that in natural samples, the molecular changes relating to illumination can be tightly interwoven with internal changes (maturation and spawning), and might in addition mask endogenous monthly oscillations as they can be produced by endogenous timing systems.</p><p>Laboratory research on animals such as the marine annelid <italic>Platynereis dumerilii</italic> or the marine midge <italic>Clunio marinus</italic> has indeed revealed evidence for such internal timers, showing that nocturnal light (in nature provided by the moon) does not only impact directly on transcription (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib108">Zantke et al., 2015</xref>), but is both necessary and sufficient to entrain endogenous monthly (circalunar) oscillators (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Kaiser et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib106">Zantke et al., 2013</xref>), which in turn orchestrate reproduction at distinct times of the lunar month (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.41556.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Strategy to capture the impact of maturation, sex and circalunar phase on the head transcriptome and proteome of <italic>Platynereis dumerilii.</italic></title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) Light regime of the <italic>Platynereis</italic> culture and its correlation with maturation; daily and nocturnal light conditions are schematised.

Step <bold>two</bold> is different for sex biased and circalunar transcripts/proteins on the one hand and for maturation on the other hand. For sex and lunar transcripts/proteins this step consists of subsequently merging the three individual comparisons - PM_NM_F vs. PM_NM_M, M_NM_F vs. M_NM_M and PM_FRFM_F vs. PM_FRFM_M for sex biased transcripts/proteins; and IM_NM vs. IM_FRFM, PM_NM_F vs. PM_FRFM_F and PM_NM_M vs. PM_FRFM_M for the lunar comparison - and keeping all entries in the final lists resulting in the final sex biased and circalunar transcript/proteome lists. For the maturation comparison step two is the generation of ‘unisex’ lists for the different developmental comparisons, for example out of the two IM_NM vs. PM_NM comparisons, IM_NM vs. PM_NM_F and IM_NM vs. PM_NM_M a single IM_NM vs. PM_NM list is build.

This eliminates transcripts/proteins called DE in only one sex, however, entries regulated differently between sexes and called DE between two developmental stages are retained (see overlap between maturation and sex bias in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figures 3a</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">5a</xref>, respectively). Step three only applies to the maturation comparison: In this step the four ‘unisex’ lists, IM_NM vs. PM_NM, IM_NM vs. M_NM, PM_NM vs. M_NM and IM_FRFM vs. PM_FRFM, are merged by ID and all entries are kept in the final list, as described for step two for the sex and lunar list.

Sexual dimorphisms exist in the production and response of mature worms to spawning pheromones, as well as on the level of gonadal and parapodial morphology. These differences are not obvious during the early and juvenile developmental stages, but develop within a few weeks to months prior to spawning (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a,b</xref>). The sex ratio of the worms remains constant within laboratory cultures, even under different temperature, feeding or light conditions and different population densities, consistent with genetic mechanisms underlying the sexual dimorphisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Beckmann et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Fischer and Dorresteijn, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Schulz et al., 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib109">Zeeck et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib110">Zeeck et al., 1998</xref>).</p><p>Studies from established molecular model systems have shown that sexual behaviour involves neurons expressing sexually-dimorphic markers, including <italic>fruitless</italic> and <italic>doublesex</italic> in <italic>Drosophila,</italic> and <italic>mab</italic> genes in <italic>Caenorhabditis</italic> (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Kopp, 2012</xref>). In <italic>Platynereis,</italic> differential expression of neuropeptides in whole mature males and females suggests that sexual dimorphism at the level of hormonal regulation coincides with sexual maturation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Conzelmann et al., 2013</xref>). Given the roles of such neurohormones in other animals, it is likely that they act both locally within the brain, as well as in the periphery of the animals to orchestrate sexual dimorphism of the gonads and behaviour as the animals mature. However, no systematic information is available on sexual dimorphisms in the brain of <italic>Platynereis</italic>.</p><p>Importantly, the bristleworm brain also plays a crucial role in circadian and circalunar timing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Hauenschild, 1956a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Hauenschild, 1956b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Hauenschild, 1959</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Hauenschild, 1960</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Hauenschild, 1966</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Hofmann, 1976</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Hofmann and Schiedges, 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Schenk et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib106">Zantke et al., 2013</xref>). Its importance in reproductive timing is highlighted by the fact that tails of decapitated animals undergo sexual maturation within two weeks, but are no longer synchronised to the lunar phase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Hauenschild, 1966</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Hauenschild, 1974</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Schenk et al., 2016</xref>). The brain also possesses non-visual photoreceptors that likely receive light inputs for circalunar (and circadian) clock entrainment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Arendt et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Tessmar-Raible et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib106">Zantke et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>Taken together, these findings argue that the <italic>Platynereis</italic> brain integrates information on maturation, sexual differentiation, and circalunar phase in order to bring about lunar-synchronised reproduction. We therefore sought to identify the molecular signatures of these three major biological processes using an integrated molecular profiling approach, and to assess whether a circalunar component could be disentangled from the changes brought about by maturation and sexual differentiation. We carried out this analysis on two levels: First, we systematically assessed transcriptome signatures, building on our previous observation that the transcript levels of a subset of core circadian clock genes are influenced by the phase of the circalunar oscillator in <italic>Platynereis</italic>, a finding that has also been observed in corals and the reef fish <italic>Siganus guttatus</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Raible et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Altincicek and Vilcinskas, 2007</xref> references cited therein). Second, we extended our analyses to the proteome level, reasoning that a combined quantitative transcriptomics and proteomics approach would allow us to obtain a better understanding of the major molecular changes that occur on different functional levels, and highlight molecules and pathways that are most prominent in the different processes.</p><p>This systematic approach revealed that maturation induces the largest amount of changes on both transcriptome and proteome levels, whereas the circalunar clock has a much stronger impact on the proteome than the transcriptome. Our analyses identified molecular functions, pathways and candidate genes that are diagnostic for either sex and/or maturation stage, and show that representative genes associated with these processes localise in distinct brain regions. We further identify new factors that are subject to circalunar clock-dependent changes on mRNA and/or protein level, and map their locations in the adult brain. Specifically, we demonstrate that Ependymin-related proteins (ERPs) are strongly affected on both transcript and protein levels by maturation and circalunar clock phases. We further show that the neuropeptide Whitnin/Proctolin, which recently has been correlated with the spawning event in the semilunar spawner abalone <italic>Haliotis asinina</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib105">York et al., 2012</xref>), is also regulated by the circalunar clock in <italic>Platynereis</italic>.</p><p>Taken together, our work provides a comprehensive co-evaluation of transcriptomic and proteomic regulation of stage, sex, and circalunar phase-matched tissue samples, and provides the first systematic insight into the distinct genes and molecular processes influenced by maturation, sexual differentiation and the circalunar clock in adult <italic>Platynereis dumerilii</italic>.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>In order to gain first systematic insight into the molecular impact of the circalunar clock in the brain, we conducted a comprehensive analysis of changes in the <italic>Platynereis</italic> head at two distinct phases of the circalunar clock: new moon (NM) and free-running full moon (FRFM). The environmental conditions are the same at both circalunar phases, FRFM describes the chronobiological conditions in which the animals would normally be presented with a nocturnal light stimulus (‘full moon’- FM), which is however not given (compare <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref> vs. c). Thus, their endogenous circalunar clock is under free-running conditions (i.e. FRFM, see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib106">Zantke et al., 2013</xref>). In order to disentangle these respective circalunar molecular changes from those primarily related to maturation or sexual differentiation, we performed this analysis separately for male and female worms, across three stages of maturation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1b</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). We started our analysis with gene expression profiling by RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq), to assess effects on the transcriptome. As outlined further below, we developed an extraction method that allowed us to subsequently complement this transcriptomic analysis with a comprehensive proteomic analysis on material from the identical samples (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1d</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>).</p><sec id="s2-1"><title>A maturation-stage and sex-locked lunar head transcriptome</title><p>As the current <italic>Platynereis dumerilii</italic> genome assembly is not yet optimal for unique mapping of short reads for quantitative analyses, we generated a mapping resource based on transcript data. Whereas previous <italic>Platynereis</italic> transcriptomes were generated from whole animals during various adult life stages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Conzelmann et al., 2013</xref>), or early developmental stages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Chou et al., 2016</xref>), we reasoned that this might result in under-representation of head-specific transcripts. Moreover, when using whole animal samples, the increase in germ cells during maturation (see e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Schenk and Hoeger, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Schenk et al., 2016</xref> and references cited therein) could obscure low abundance expression, which might be of regulatory importance.</p><p>Therefore, we generated a head reference transcriptome assembled from RNA-Seq data combined from heads sampled under various circalunar conditions and maturation stages (see Materials and methods). The FRFM condition refers to animals kept in a standard daily 16:8 hr light dark (LD) light cycle whose circalunar clock was previously entrained by nocturnal light for at least two months, but are not exposed to nocturnal light at the expected full moon time when sampling was performed. Such ‘free-running’ conditions can thus reveal effects solely caused by the endogenous circalunar clock (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib106">Zantke et al., 2013</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1c</xref>).</p><p>Our primary assembly (Pdu_HeadRef_TS_v1) was systematically curated to (i) remove redundancies, (ii) merge scaffold information provided by published <italic>Platynereis</italic> sequences, (iii) remove sequence contaminations (e.g. prokaryotic), and (iv) flag additional sequences with high similarity to other species (see Materials and methods section), resulting in our final reference sets (Pdu_HeadRef_TS_v4 and v5, see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig2sdata1">Figure 2—source data 1</xref>–<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig2sdata3">3</xref> and Materials and methods section).</p><fig id="fig2" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.41556.008</object-id><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Processing and basic features of the <italic>Platynereis</italic> head transcriptome.</title><p>The primary assembly consisting of 407,172 transcripts with &gt;200 bp was successively processed by: i) collapsing multi-copy transcripts to the longest transcripts of each cluster, ii) removing transcripts shorter than 500 bp, ii) removing transcripts arising from common model organisms or potential food sources, iv) substituting less complete transcripts with previously published sequences from NCBI and the transcriptome published by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Conzelmann et al.

For this, we analysed the expression profiles by soft clustering analysis using the Mfuzz R-package (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Futschik and Carlisle, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Kumar and Futschik, 2007</xref>). Mfuzz clustering on the mean expression values (details see Materials and methods) resulted in five clusters each for maturation- and sex-related DETs, and four for the circalunar DETs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3b</xref>, gene lists <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig3sdata6">Figure 3—source data 6</xref>). The maturation-related DETs showed two clusters with transcripts peaking in the premature (PM) stage, two with a peak in the mature (M) stage, and one in which the expression values declined from immature (IM) over PM to M. The two most prominent clusters, with 2,687 DETs and 2,310 DETs, respectively, were those in which expression was reduced in mature animals (clusters 3 and 5 in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3b</xref>), while the single cluster showing an increase in transcript levels from IM over PM to M contained the least number of transcripts (649 DETs, cluster 3).</p><p>Clustering of the sex-related DETs set yielded four clusters with different profiles. Two of these displayed peaks of transcript levels either in mature females or mature males (clusters 2 and 3, respectively), whereas the other two clusters harboured transcripts peaking either in PM and M females, or in PM and M males (clusters 4 and 1, respectively, see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3b</xref>). Cluster one was less clear, exhibiting a trough of expression in mature animals of either sex.</p><p>Due to the comparatively low number of DETs in the circalunar comparison, the patterns of the circalunar-related DET clusters were less clear than for the sex and maturation related DETs. However, transcripts belonging to clusters two and three containing 22 and 18 DET of the 63DET, respectively, clearly exhibited differences between IM_FRFM compared to IM_NM, specifically a peak in IM_FRFM (cluster three) and a trough in clusters one and two (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3b</xref>).</p><p>Taken together, these results suggest that the three assayed conditions – maturation, sex, and circalunar clock phase – affected largely different sets of genes and by this delineate specific brain ‘molecular signatures’. To further analyse if the individual signatures also differed with respect to functional or molecular categories, Gene Ontology annotations were analysed using the GOStats R-package (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Falcon and Gentleman, 2007</xref>).</p><p>These analyses revealed that overall 239 out of a total 4,775 GO-terms were significantly enriched in our comparisons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3c</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplements 1</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig3sdata7">Figure 3—source data 7</xref>–<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig3sdata11">11</xref>). When analysing the ten most abundant GO-terms, these confirmed the above notion of distinct signature processes for maturation, sexual differences and circalunar phase. Specifically, in the Molecular Function category, ‘Protein binding’ is the most abundant, significantly-enriched single term for maturation, whereas ‘catalytic activity’ and ‘phosphorous-oxygen lyase activity’ are most enriched for the sex-specific and circalunar expression comparisons, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3c</xref>). The Biological Processes and Cellular Compartment ontologies also showed pronounced differences in significantly over- and under-represented GO-terms (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplements 1</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig3sdata6">Figure 3—source datas 6</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig3sdata7">7</xref>). We found little overlap between all the 239 significantly enriched GO-terms when sorted by our three analysis categories: 131 out of 142 were uniquely present in maturation DETs, 83 of 97 were unique to sex differences and ten of fifteen were specific for the circalunar phase DETs (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplements 2</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s9">9</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig3sdata11">Figure 3—source data 11</xref>). No GO-terms were shared between maturation and circalunar DETs. Taken together, these results suggest that maturation, sexual differentiation and circalunar timing – while being tightly coordinated processes - can be clearly distinguished on a molecular level and are likely driven by different biological mechanisms.</p><p>The view that these processes can be well separated in <italic>Platynereis</italic> is further supported by the exemplary whole mount in situ hybridisations (ISH): Maturation candidates tested by in situ hybridisation generally showed broadly-distributed expression over the whole brain. One prominent region was found around the posterior eye pair, where two kidney shaped regions of expression were visible, and another in the medial brain between the eyes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4a’,b’,a’’,b’’</xref>). Sex biased transcripts exhibited similarly broad expression domains, with noted dimorphism of expression domains, and/or staining intensity reflective of expression level differences between males and females (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4c’,d’,c’’,d’’, d’’’, d’’’’</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Establishment of a combined transcriptomic and proteomic profiling procedure</title><p>While transcriptomic analyses provide broad-scale insights into molecular dynamics that occur on the level of mRNA regulation (transcription itself and transcript stability regulation), most physiological processes are driven by protein function, but as has been pointed out, the knowledge about the proteome changes in lunar spawning cycles is missing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib112">Zoccola and Tambutté, 2015</xref>) We therefore complemented our transcriptomic study with a systematic proteomic analysis. This objective posed two challenges: (i) whereas general transcript analyses have been previously performed for <italic>Platynereis</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Chou et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Conzelmann et al., 2013</xref>), no comparable reference set exists yet at proteome level; (ii) we anticipated that maximal comparability between transcriptomic and proteomic data would require a method that was able to isolate both RNA and protein from the same specimen.</p><p>To minimise sampling bias and to facilitate comparisons between the transcriptome and proteome data, we took advantage of the different chemical properties of ribonucleic acid and proteins, and the fact that most of the protein is expected to elute as the flow-through from RNA extractions that use SiO<sub>2</sub>-based columns under denaturing conditions.</p><p>However, in these flow-through fractions, proteins are highly diluted and we found that the high concentrations of guanidin thiocyanate (GuSCN) impair downstream analyses (data not shown). Thus, we first established an appropriate method for concentrating the protein fraction. We freeze-dried and then reconstituted the sample in the original volume, followed by protein precipitation. Due to the presence of thiocyanate in the samples acid based precipitations were not feasible. We tested different alcohol-based precipitation protocols (details see Materials and methods), and found that a 5:1 dilution with acetone yielded the best recovery. The resulting pellets were washed thoroughly in ice-cold EtOH to remove any traces of GuSCN which may damage the filters (FASP protocol, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib103">Wiśniewski et al., 2009</xref>). We found no evidence for non-precipitated proteins in the acetone precipitation supernatant (for further details see Materials and methods) encouraging us to continue with quantitative proteomic analyses.</p><p>To enable quantitative proteomic analysis, open reading frames (ORFs) &gt; 100 amino acids were predicted for all transcripts in the HeadRef_Tsv4 transcriptome for all six possible reading frames, resulting in 92,645 predicted protein sequences (45,065 transcripts; Pdu_HeadRef_prot_v4). In total we identified 2,290 proteins with at least two unique peptides identified per protein from our experimental samples. The number of identified proteins with these stringent criteria matches well with analyses from other invertebrate head/brain proteomes; 2,987 proteins were identified in <italic>Apis mellifera</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Hernández et al., 2012</xref>) and 3,004 proteins in the larval brain of <italic>Bombyx mori</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Li et al., 2016</xref>), despite the fact that both of these studies employed an unlabelled shotgun proteomics approach and required only one unique peptide match per protein.</p><p>To further compare to existing datasets, we correlated the normalised log10-transformed transcriptome and proteome expression values to each other. This showed a significant, but relatively low correlation (cor.test()) Pearson-correlation coefficient of 0.482 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>). This relatively low correlation between transcript and protein levels is highly consistent with previous transcriptome-proteome comparisons studies. Correlations with very similar R-values were found for the developmental transcriptome/proteome in <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Casas-Vila et al., 2017</xref>) and sexual difference transcriptome/proteome comparisons in <italic>C.elegans</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">Tops et al., 2010</xref>). A comparison of protein and mRNA expression levels for multiple stages of <italic>C.elegans</italic> development resulted in even much lower R values (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Grün et al., 2014</xref>). These (and further) studies imply that only limited conclusions about the level of protein can be drawn based on its transcript level in an organism, further emphasising the importance of proteomic comparisons. The consistency with other studies provides further evidence that our methodological approach did not negatively impact on the proteome data quality.</p><p>As final quality estimation, we took advantage of another <italic>Platynereis</italic> head proteome that was independently generated using a conventional sample processing method, a label-free approach (see Materials and methods) and did not include large-scale comparisons between different maturation- or sex-specific stages. In total, 3,847 proteins were detectable in this conventionally-processed (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>), label-free proteome set, out of which 2,105 proteins overlapped with the transcriptome/proteome co-processed proteome. To test for possible large-scale systematic compositional biases caused by the different sample processing, we performed a GO-term analysis with both sets comparing to all possible annotated GO-terms and relative frequencies present in the transcriptome dataset (taking all three categories - molecular process, cellular compartment and function - into account). In the 2,290 proteins detected in the transcriptome/proteome co-processed set, 372 significantly over- and 244 under-represented GO-terms were present; whereas in the conventionally-processed set (3,847 proteins) 444 G0-terms were over- and 248 under-represented (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig5sdata3">Figure 5—source datas 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig5sdata4">4</xref>). Overall, the types of over- and under-represented GO-terms were similar and, in the majority, overlapped (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig5sdata3">Figure 5—source data 3</xref>–<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig5sdata5">5</xref>), suggesting that the transcriptome/proteome co-processing of our samples did not induce any significant bias in terms of functional complexity.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>A maturation-stage and sex locked circalunar head proteome</title><p>We next analysed the proteome with respect to the different sampling conditions. To enable robust comparison between all conditions, we defined a subset of ‘quantifiable protein’ comprising only those detected uniquely in at least 2 BR and in 3 out of the 5 TR per BR for all samples, yielding a total of 1,064 proteins; a number comparable to studies of the mosquito <italic>Aedes aegypti</italic> head proteome, applying similar stringency filters (1,139 proteins, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Nunes et al., 2016</xref>).

As for the transcriptome data, the largest proportion of proteins, that is 693 proteins were differentially expressed over the process of maturation, corresponding to 65.13% of quantifiable proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5a</xref>). Contrary to the transcriptome profiling results, however, sexual differentiation accounted for only 17 differentially expressed proteins (DEP, 1.60%). Conversely, circalunar phase affected 261 DEP (24.53%), significantly exceeding the amount observed in the transcriptomic analysis. Of the 17 sex biased proteins, 12 were regulated during maturation, as were 177 of the 261 (67.82%) circalunar proteins.

This likely explains the difference in the number of sex-specific DETs vs. DEPs, but not the difference observed in the numbers of circalunar DETs vs. DEPs.</p><p>To further assimilate the proteomic data with the transcriptomic profiles, we performed the same type of soft cluster analysis of the significant DEPs using the Mfuzz algorithm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Futschik and Carlisle, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Kumar and Futschik, 2007</xref>) to assess if co-regulated clusters existed for the respective processes. Maturation as well as circalunar DEPs each clustered robustly into five protein expression clusters, whereas the sex-specific DEPs showed only weak associations to three clusters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5b</xref>, gene lists <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig5sdata9">Figure 5—source data 9</xref>). A comparison between protein and RNA expression clusters for the maturation process revealed similar dynamic groups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3b</xref> vs. 5b), however, these were not necessarily populated by corresponding transcripts and proteins, as only 40.12% (278 out of 693) of DETs showed a similar profile of regulation on the protein level. This finding suggests that transcript to protein changes are ‘offset’ in time for the majority of the transcripts. Comparisons between DET and DEP clusters were less robust for the sex-specific and circalunar categories, given that only few DEPs or DETs were identified, respectively.</p><p>GO enrichment analysis of the DEPs showed that out of a total of 2,448 GO terms present in all 2,290 detectable proteins, 121 GO terms were enriched. Of these, 75 (62.5%) GO terms were found to be enriched in maturation DEPs, 17 in sex biased DEPs, and 46 in circalunar DEPs. Like for the transcriptome, there was little overlap between the GO term enrichments across the three different analysed biological processes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5c</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplements 2</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig5sdata10">Figure 5—source data 10</xref>–<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig5sdata13">13</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>Additional proteomic analyses confirm the large change in protein abundance between different circalunar phases</title><p>In our initial proteomic analysis for differences between NM and FRFM stages we discovered a much higher amount of differentially expressed proteins than we would have expected based on the transcriptome data (0.12% DET vs. 24.53% DEP, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figures 3a</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">5a</xref>). This difference is specific for the circalunar comparison and not present or opposite for the maturation and sex-biased comparisons, respectively (for further interpretation and discussion- see discussion section below). In order to verify that this result was not caused by sampling, extraction or measurement artefacts we repeated the proteomics analysis using independent samples. We limited this analysis to IM stages, which showed a large proportion of differences between circalunar phases and are less affected by sexual differentiation and maturation.</p><p>This second round (filtered as above) led to a set of 1,671 quantifiable proteins (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig5sdata14">Figure 5—source data 14</xref>), out of which 1,017 were also present in the initial (1,064 quantifiable proteins) dataset, thus 95.58% of the proteins initially passing our stringent quality filter criteria again passed these criteria, indicating a high reliability and reproducibility of protein detection for this sample type. Of the 1,671 proteins of the new dataset, 173 (10.35 %, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig5sdata15">Figure 5—source data 15</xref>) were significantly differentially expressed. Re-analysing the dataset by using only the 1,017 quantifiable proteins shared between the first and second dataset resulted in 64 DEPs (testing was limited to IM animals, see above) comparable to the 70 DEPs in IM animals in the first analysis (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig5sdata8">Figure 5—source datas 8</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig5sdata16">16</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig5sdata17">17</xref>).</p><p>To identify commonly regulated proteins in all tested proteome datasets, irrespective of frequently occurring sequence differences (e.g. due to isoforms or alleles), which could obscure identical ID-calling, we ran BLASTx against the Uniprot DB for all 365 circalunar DEPs identified from both proteomic analyses (i.e. the initial circalunar IM, PM_Female and PM_Male sets and the second IM set) and grouped these according to their BLASTx annotations. We then manually inspected the DEPs for similar identities. Protein groups with similar identities or individual proteins that were either regulated in at least one dataset of the first proteomic analysis and the second proteomic analysis or in all three conditions (IM, PM male, PM female) of the first proteomic analysis (only one –IM - condition was tested in the second proteomic analysis) were marked as candidates.</p><p>This resulted in 27 protein groups (i.e. identified proteins with related, but not identical ID) and 29 individual protein IDs, which were repeatedly detected in the different quantitative proteomic comparisons (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig5sdata18">Figure 5—source data 18</xref>).</p><p>Finally, we tested if the high numbers of circalunar regulated proteins could be explained by the lower number of proteins compared to the high transcriptome number, which reduces the stringency of the Benjamini Hochberg multiple testing algorithm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Benjamini and Hochberg, 1995</xref>) used to calculate the FDR. We tested how many transcripts are significantly regulated, if we focus the analyses on the top 5,000 or 1,000 expressed transcripts. For the 5,000 most highly expressed transcripts we found 20 circalunar DET (0.40% compared to 0.12% in the complete transcriptome set), a 3.3-fold enrichment; 262 sex different DET (5.24% compared to 1.22% in the complete transcriptome set), a 4.3-fold enrichment and 2,435 maturation regulated DET (48.70% compared to 16.52% in the complete transcriptome set), a 3.3-fold enrichment. For the ,1000 most highly expressed transcripts we found four circalunar DET (0.40% compared to 0.12% in the complete transcriptome set), a 3.3-fold enrichment; 52 sex different DET (5.20% compared to 1.22% in the complete transcriptome set), a 4.3-fold enrichment and 546 maturation regulated DET (54.60% compared to 16.52% in the complete transcriptome set), a 3.3-fold enrichment. This means that statistical differences (due to overall lower numbers tested) can explain the overall increase in the maturation regulated proteins, but cannot explain the about 245-fold increase we observe between circalunar transcriptome and proteome.</p></sec><sec id="s2-6"><title>Characterisation of circalunar proteome regulated candidates reveals ependymin-related genes and prepro-whitnin as putative circalunar clock phase signalling molecules</title><p>We next started to characterise several circalunar DEP candidates and provide a showcase of five of them.

These expression analyses are based on whole mount in situ hybridisations, which we think is justified to do as we were interested in their place of origin.</p><p>A larger group that caught our attention consisted of iron binding proteins. We selected two of these for validation: Myohaemerythrin (myoHr), and Somaferritin. MyoHr is a representative of the Haemerythrins, small oxygen-binding non-haem iron proteins present in all phyla except for in Deuterostomes; myoHr in particular appears to be restricted to marine invertebrates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Coates and Decker, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Costa-Paiva et al., 2017</xref>). Ferritins are intracellular iron storage proteins, which additional to their role iron metabolism have been implicated in oxidative stress resistance and immunology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Altincicek and Vilcinskas, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Andrews et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Pham and Winzerling, 2010</xref>).</p><p>Another circalunar DEP that caught our attention was annotated as Whitnin precursor. Whitnin is the mollusc orthologue of the insect neuropeptide Proctolin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib98">Veenstra, 2010</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig7sdata1">Figure 7—source datas 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig7sdata2">2</xref>). Of note, <italic>prepro-whitnin</italic> was shown to be differentially regulated on transcript level in the nervous system of abalone <italic>Haliotis asinina</italic> over the course of two weeks. Maximal expression occurred just prior to the semi-circalunar spawning events of this organism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib105">York et al., 2012</xref>). Whitnin is thus a potential candidate for relaying the circalunar signal to other cells. The last two DEPs we focused on both belong to the large family of Ependymin-related proteins. These are highly sequence-related and could either represent different alleles of the same gene or are the result of a recent gene duplication event (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6a</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig6sdata1">Figure 6—source datas 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig6sdata2">2</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig6" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.41556.071</object-id><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><title>Members of a lineage-specific expansion of Ependymin-related proteins are subject to circalunar regulation on RNA and protein level.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) Unrooted maximum likelihood phyolgenetic tree of Ependymin-related proteins based on the analysis published by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Suárez-Castillo and García-Arrarás, 2007</xref> including eleven of 15 <italic>Platynereis</italic> Ependymin-related proteins (ERP4.1–4.10; ERP3; blue boxes) and various additional invertebrate Ependymin sequences.

The analyses profited from our newly established and benchmarked protocol for the isolation and subsequent quantitative analysis of RNA and protein from the same tissue sample, which does not compromise the complexity of the detected proteins. We expect this method to be widely applicable and be particularly useful for studies that are restricted by the amount of samples that can be obtained and analysed.</p><p>Using this protocol for <italic>Platynereis dumerilii,</italic> we find that ~ 17 percent of all analysed transcripts and ~66% of the analysed proteins undergo regulation during maturation. This indicates that the maturation process is the biggest driving force for changes on both transcriptome and proteome levels as worms approach the single circalunar-synchronised spawning event of their lifecycle. This finding is consistent with the fact that physiology, metabolism, body morphology and behaviour change dramatically during the maturation phase: Animals change from a benthic, solitary, and feeding life style to a sexually mature, anorexic state that prepares them for their ‘nuptial dance’, during which germ cells are released. While this process is accompanied by major morphological changes in the trunk (in particular, the generation of germ cells that amass to up to 40% of the body mass, accompanied by a deprivation of up to 60% of longitudinal muscle fibres), the head is known to be a major source of factors that orchestrate this transition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Hauenschild, 1956a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Hauenschild, 1956b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Hauenschild, 1966</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Hofmann, 1976</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Schenk et al., 2016</xref>). The observed changes in the head transcriptome and proteome strongly support this notion, and the recent identification of a major brain hormone component that regulates maturation onset and progression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Schenk et al., 2016</xref>) provides an interesting entry point to understand how these significant changes are hormonally regulated and conveyed to the entire body.</p><p>Maturation of <italic>Platynereis</italic> is also accompanied by a significant increase of overall eye volume (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Fischer and Brökelmann, 1966</xref>). In line with the described expansion of the outer segments of the eye photoreceptors – that typically harbour the photopigments – we observed a significant increase in transcript abundance of the <italic>Platynereis r-opsin1</italic> gene, a major opsin gene expressed in the adult eye photoreceptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Arendt et al., 2002</xref>).</p><p>Comparing the observed transcriptome changes to the changes found in other species shows variable similarities, depending on brain regions and species. A similar study of the honeybee brain showed that ~40% of the assessed transcripts exhibited changes associated with maturation, the majority of which (~61%) were associated with caste behaviour (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib102">Whitfield et al., 2003</xref>). Other species show less pronounced changes, such as in the human neocortex, in which about 9% of the transcripts were reported to change during postnatal development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Kang et al., 2011</xref>); in zebrafish ~20% of the pituitary transcripts were differentially expressed during sexual maturation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">He et al., 2014</xref>), while ~11% of the murine hippocampus transcriptome were differentially expressed during maturation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bundy et al., 2017</xref>) and the Mediterranean fruit fly <italic>Ceratitis capitata</italic> exhibited up to 7% of head transcriptome changes during maturation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Gomulski et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>Overall proteome changes in the brain during development/maturation show a distribution range in vertebrates from 2–8% (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Ori et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib100">Walther and Mann, 2011</xref>), while 15–17% changed in the larval brain development of <italic>Bombyx mori</italic> and <italic>Apis mellifera</italic>, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Hernández et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Li et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>Sexual differences in the brain transcriptome are highly dependent on the species studied. In guppies ~ 13% and in the beetle <italic>Callosobruchus maculatus</italic> ~17% of the brain`s transcripts have been described to be sex biased (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Sharma et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Immonen et al., 2017</xref>); while in birds around ~2% of the brain transcripts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Naurin et al., 2011</xref>) and human brain ~1.1% of the transcripts show a sex bias (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Kang et al., 2011</xref>).</p><p>While the observed transcriptome and proteome changes in <italic>Platynereis dumerilii</italic> heads during development, growth and maturation and brain transcriptome changes between different sexes are thus within the range of expectations, we somewhat unexpectedly found that the circalunar phase has little impact on transcript expression changes, but more prominently affects protein level changes. Specifically, we find that only 0.12% of the transcripts we analysed are regulated. This is more than 20-fold less than what has been shown as an impact of the circadian clock on the regulation for brain/head transcriptome in several animals, for example <italic>Aedes aegypti</italic> (6.7%, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Leming et al., 2014</xref>), <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> (2.8%, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Hughes et al., 2012</xref>) and <italic>Mus musculus</italic> (3–4%, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib111">Zhang et al., 2014</xref>). Directly equivalent studies on head/brain proteomes have not been performed, instead specific central nervous system parts of mice and rats have been investigated. For the murine suprachiasmatic nucleus, 13–20% of the identified and quantifiable proteins (871 and 2,112, respectively) exhibited circadian abundance changes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chiang et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Deery et al., 2009</xref>), compared to about 5% of transcriptome changes in the same tissue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib97">Ueda et al., 2002</xref>). Thus, the proteomic changes we observe between two different circalunar time points (with a similar number of quantifiable proteins) are comparable to the circadian changes observed in the nervous system of other animals.</p><p>While it is possible that we underestimate the amount of circalunar transcriptomic changes due to limited sampling resolution (only sampling two circalunar time points and one circadian time point), as well as stringent multiple comparisons statistics (see tests in result section), it is not obvious why such an underestimation effect should be different for the proteome under the same conditions. Alternatively, it is also possible that the level of variability is higher in the transcriptome than in the proteome, which – due to the higher experimental noise - would lead to a lower number of detected transcripts compared to the proteome. However, we do not see evidence for such a scenario in our data.</p><p>We therefore suggest as the most parsimonious explanation that we underestimate the occurring circalunar changes in both transcriptome and proteome, but that the observed relative difference is representative. This implies that, differing from the known circadian clock studies, the circalunar oscillator has a significantly stronger impact on the proteome than on the transcriptome. Thus, the mechanisms responsible for circalunar reproductive timing possibly operate and might be coordinated more strongly at post transcriptional, translational/post-translational level(s), than on transcript level(s).</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th>Reagent type (species) or resource</th><th>Designation</th><th>Source or reference</th><th>Identifiers</th><th>Additional information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Strain, strain background (<italic>Platynereis dumerilii</italic>, immature)</td><td>IM_NM; IM_FRFM</td><td>MFPL Fish and Marine Facility</td><td>NA</td><td>NA</td></tr><tr><td>Strain, strain background (<italic>Platynereis dumerilii</italic>, Female)</td><td>PM_NM_F; PM_FRFM_F; M_NM_F</td><td>MFPL Fish and Marine Facility</td><td>NA</td><td>NA</td></tr><tr><td>Strain, strain background (<italic>Platynereis dumerilii</italic>, Male)</td><td>PM_NM_M; PM_FRFM_M; M_NM_M</td><td>MFPL Fish and Marine Facility</td><td>NA</td><td>NA</td></tr><tr><td>Recombinant DNA reagent</td><td>pJet1.2 (plasmid)</td><td>Thermo Scientific</td><td>Thermo Scientific: K1232</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Sequence-based reagent</td><td>primers see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref></td><td>this study</td><td/><td>qPCR primers were designed exon-intron spanning using the Roche Universal probe library homepage (see Materials and methods section for details).

Mature animals were defined as having undergone metamorphosis, exhibiting typical yellow (females) or red/white (male) colouration, but were not yet actively swimming (i.e. prior to spawning, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1b</xref>). Large PM animals were selected for staging 3–5 days prior to sampling.</p><p>Animals were first anesthetised for 10 min in a 1:1 mixture of 7.5% (w/v) MgCl<sub>2</sub> and ASW. Sex and stage were checked by making a small incision in the trunk wall between two parapodia and gently squeezing out a sample of the coelomic contents.

Two days prior to head sampling worms were transferred into sterile filtered NSW containing 0.125 mg/mL ampicilin and 0.500 mg/mL streptomycin-sulphate; after 24 hr, the antibiotics concentration was reduced to 50% for approximately 16 hr, until animals were sampled the following day. For all analyses, pools of 6 heads per biological replicate were sampled at Zeitgeber time 4.</p><p>For sampling, animals were anesthetised with MgCl<sub>2</sub> as before and the head was cut directly behind the posterior eyes, and in front of the first parapodial segment (red dotted line in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1b</xref>).

Cutadapt (v1.9.1, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Martin, 2011</xref>) to remove the adapter sequences (-b option) of the paired end reads and to quality trim the reads (-q 20) requiring that the remaining sequence was at least 13 bp long (-m 13). We used ngm-utils interleave (v0.4.5) to reorder the fastq files and filter out reads not having a paired read anymore. The so processed reads were merged and used as input for the RNA-Seq assembly with Trinity (v2.0.2, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Grabherr et al., 2011</xref>).

Subsequently, reads were quality filtered (-q20) and converted to a bam file using samtools. The coverage per scaffold was assessed using bedtools (v2.17.0) multicov. The obtained Pdu_HeadRef_TS_v4 count data (generated by HTseq v0.6.1) were processed by first, collapsing the technical replicates (see above and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1e</xref>) by sum, then by filtering out 83 transcripts with extremely uneven counts in IM_NM sample [counts IM_NM.2&gt;=10 x counts(IM_NM.1+IM_NM.3)] and finally by removing the 5,727 contaminations identified by KRAKEN leading to a 52,059 transcripts (equivalent to Pdu_HeadRef_TS_v5) containing input table (S5_Pdu_HeadRef_TS_v5_ReadCounts).

DESeq2 was run with standard parameters and EdgeR was run applying the generalised linear model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Hughes et al., 2012</xref>) algorithm. Output lists were cut off using a Benjamini-Hochberg FDR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Benjamini and Hochberg, 1995</xref>) of 0.1 (10%).</p><p>To filter candidate lists for validation, separate lists of differentially expressed transcripts (DETs) from DESeq2 and EdgeR were merged by transcript ID and rankings were applied separately to the DESeq2 and EdgeRGLM-derived lists, where transcripts were assigned a rank from one to <italic>n</italic> (where <italic>n</italic> is the number of transcripts), based on ranking by lowest to highest adjusted p-value (padj/FDR). The DESeq2 and EdgeRGLM rank values for each transcript were then added to give a rank sum value, and the table was re-sorted by this rank sum value from lowest to highest. For maturation comparisons, ‘unisex’ candidate lists were further defined as subsets of transcripts predicted as differentially-expressed between stages, for both male and female comparisons (e.g. if transcript A is up-regulated in IM_NM vs PM_NM_male and up-regulated IM_NM vs PM_NM_female, it is classed as ‘unisex’ up-regulated for IM_NM vs PM_NM).

The precipitate was then collected by centrifugation for 30 min by centrifugation at 3,500xg at 4°C. The resulting pellet and a quarter of the supernatant were transferred in to a fresh tube and the remaining supernatant split into three equal parts which were then centrifuged for 30 Min at 14,000xg and 4°C to collect the remaining proteins. Pellets were then washed with 100 µL −20°C-cold EtOH to remove the co-precipitated GuSCN from the RNA-extraction buffer and allowed to dry over-night, dissolved in 100 µL UA-buffer [8M urea, 50 mM triethylammonium bicarbonate (TEAB), pH 8.5] by sonification, and finally re-pooled. Proteins were digested for MS/MS-analysis using the Filter Aided Sample Preparation method (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib103">Wiśniewski et al., 2009</xref>). Briefly, the samples were reduced by 10 mM DTT for 30 Min at RT in UA, applied to an YM-30 filter membrane, centrifuged and washed. Thiols were alkylated for 30 Min with 50 mM iodoacetamide at RT in UA centrifuged and washed with 50 mM TEAB. Proteins were then digested with trypsin (1:50 trypsin:protein ratio) overnight at 37°C in 50 mM TEAB. Digested peptides were eluted from filters by centrifugation and acidified by the addition of trifluoroacetic acid, and desalted by solid phase extraction (SPE) with Sep-Pak C18 columns (Waters). Eluates were dried in a speed-vac and the resulting pellets were dissolved in 100 µM TEAB and labelled with TMT isobaric tags (TMTsixplex Isobaric Label Reagent, Thermo Fisher Scientific) according to manufacturer's protocol. Labelling efficiency was assessed by a LC-MS/MS run on Q Exactive plus Orbitrap mass spectrometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific) for each label separately and found to be complete when semi- or unlabelled peptides were less than 1% of total PSMs. Once maximal labelling efficiency was confirmed the reaction was quenched with 8 µL 5% hydroxylamine per reaction vial (15 min incubation time at room temperature). FASP-digested and labelled samples were then combined in a 5-plex multiplex format for Set1 and a 6-plex format for Set2. Peptides were separated on an Ultimate 3000 RSLC nano-flow chromatography system using a pre-column for sample loading (PepMapAcclaim C18, 2 cm ×0.1 mm, 5 μm,) and a C18 analytical column (PepMapAcclaim C18, 50 cm ×0.75 mm, 2 μm, all Dionex-Thermo Fisher Scientific), applying a linear gradient over for 4 hr from 2% to 35% solvent B (80% acetonitrile, 0.1% formic acid; solvent A 0.1% formic acid) at a flow rate of 230 nL/min. Eluting peptides were analysed on a Q Exactive Plus Orbitrap mass spectrometer equipped with a Proxeon nanospray source (all Thermo Fisher Scientific), operated in a data-dependent mode. Survey scans were obtained in a mass range of 380–1,650 m/z with lock mass off, at a resolution of 70,000 at 200 m/z and an AGC target value of 3 × 10<sup>6</sup>. The 12 most intense ions were selected with an isolation window width of 1.2 Da, fragmented in the HCD cell at 35% collision energy and the spectra recorded at a target value of 1 × 10<sup>5</sup> and a resolution of 17,500. The peptide match and exclude isotope features were enabled and selected precursors were dynamically excluded from repeated sampling for 40 s. Five technical replicate runs were analysed for each set of multiplexed samples.</p><p>Data analysis was performed with Proteome Discoverer 2.1 using Sequest to search against the <italic>Platynereis</italic> proteome database (Pdu_HeadRef_prot_v4, ProteomeXchange: identifier PXD010532). Carbamidomethylation of cysteines, TMT-labelling on peptide N-termini and lysines were selected as fixed modifications, oxidation of methionine as variable modification. Precursor tolerance was set to 10ppm, fragment tolerance to 0.02 Da. Data were filtered for an FDR of 1% at PSM and protein level. Quantification was performed via the reporter ions quantifier mode in PD 2.1 based on the signal/noise values (herein referred to as intensity). Spectra with isolation interference greater 30% were not used for quantification. Protein intensity values were calculated for each biological replicate as the average intensity of all peptides per protein across all five technical replicates (herein referred to as Mean Intensities per protein). Mean intensities per protein were then normalised between isobaric ion channels to obtain a 1:1:1:1:1 ratio of reporter ion intensities based on the summed reporter intensities across all proteins per channel, within each set of 5 multiplexed samples (herein these expression values are referred to as Norm. Mean intensities per protein). Quantifiable proteins were further defined as those with at least two uniquely mapping peptides and detected in at least 2/3 biological replicates per sample group.</p><p>To normalise for variation in protein intensity distributions between individual samples, an additional channel median normalisation was applied, whereby the median protein intensity value was calculated for each sample (‘channel median value’) and all individual protein values per sample were then divided by this channel median value. We performed an additional inter-replicate median normalisation to account for inter-run variation between biological replicate sets within each of the NM and FRFM experiments, by: i) calculating for each biological replicate set; the median intensity across all five samples per protein, ii) calculating conversion factors to equalize the median intensity per protein between biological replicate sets. Conversion factors (CF) were calculated for the NM set relative to BR1, for example: CF.BR2 = Median_NM_BR1/Median_NM_BR2; CF.BR3 = Median_NM_BR1/Median_NM_BR3, and relative to BR3 for the FRFM set, for example: CF.BR1 = Median_FRFM_BR3/Median_FRFM_BR1; CF.BR2 = Median_FRFM_BR3/Median_FRFM_BR3. All intensity values per protein per biological replicate were then multiplied by the respective conversion factor. To enable normalisation and comparison of the data from the NM and FRFM experiments we included a spiked-control sample from the NM_BR1 set (TMT-128_PM_NM_female.1) in each of the FRFM biological replicate sets. Therefore, as a final step the FRFM intensity values were normalised relative to those of the NM_BR1 set by multiplying the values for each protein in each BR set, by corresponding conversion factors (CF) calculated as the ratio of the NM_BR1 TMT-128_PM_NM_female1 intensity/intensity value recorded for this sample in FRFM BR sets 1, 2 and 3 (e.g. CF.FRFM1 = TMT-128_PM_NM_female1:NM/TMT-128_PM_NM_female1:FRFM_BR1; CF.FRFM2 = TMT-128_PM_NM_female1:NM/TMT-128_PM_NM_female1:FRFM_BR2). The effect of normalisation resulted in median-centred data and decreased variability in the distribution of protein intensity values between biological replicates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s7">Figure 5—figure supplement 7</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig5sdata1">Figure 5—source data 1</xref>).

An adapted filter aided sample preparation protocol was used for protein digestion as described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Slany et al., 2016</xref>).

Briefly, input tables of mean read counts, or mean normalised protein intensity values were organised in columns with separate rows for each protein or transcript. Input data was standardised using the standardise() function of the Mfuzz package and the estimate of fuzziness (m1) was calculated using mestimate(). The number of clusters was determined by analysing cluster dendograms generated from a distance matrix using hclust() and cutree() to visualise different cluster numbers relative to the dendogram branching. Cluster information was used to group candidate transcript and protein expression profiles by likeness and membership were used as a measure of fit for individual profiles to the cluster mean profile.</p></sec><sec id="s4-17-2"><title>GOstats analysis for predictive functional annotation</title><p>Gene ontology (GO) analysis was performed using the GOstats package (v2.46.9, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Falcon and Gentleman, 2007</xref>), adapting the procedure described by Carlson for uncommon model organisms (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/vignettes/GOstats/inst/doc/GOstatsForUnsupportedOrganisms.pdf"><named-content content-type="sequence">https://www.bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/vignettes/GOstats/inst/doc/GOstatsForUnsupportedOrganisms.pdf</named-content></ext-link>). Briefly, the background gene set (gene universe) files (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig3sdata3">Figure 3—source data 3</xref>) were generated using GO terms retrieved from the InterProScan results containing evidence code ‘IAE’. For GO enrichment testing of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) from RNA-Seq experiments, and for testing over and under-represented GO ids in the detected set of proteins against the transcriptome, the gene universe was derived from the full set of GO terms for the whole Pdu_HeadRef_Ts_v5 transcriptome, and comprised 2,472 unique GO terms corresponding to 16,921 transcripts (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig3sdata3">Figure 3—source data 3</xref>). For differential expression of proteins the gene universe size was derived from the set of 2,290 quantifiable proteins, and comprised 1,035 GO terms corresponding to 1,751 proteins (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig5sdata2">Figure 5—source data 2</xref>). To perform hypergeometric testing using the selected gene universe, GO2All mapping was first performed using the Human AnnotationDbi package and the resulting GOALLFrame object was used to generate a customised GeneSetCollection for the hypergeometric testing, leading to 4,775 unique GO-terms in the transcriptome universe; and 2,448 unique GO-terms in the protein background. Tests for over and under-representation of GO terms were run for all sets of candidates, for all ontologies (Biological Process: BP, Molecular Function: MF, Cellular Compartment: CC) using conditional parameters. Ranking of GO enrichment was performed using the p-value, which indicates the relative significance of enrichment of genes in the tested gene list compared to the specified gene universe.</p><p>Individual ontologies (BP, MF, CC) were analysed for over and/or under-representation for each subset of candidate transcripts/proteins and enriched GO terms were linked to corresponding transcript ids using the original gene universe file, and by mapping to parent terms using acyclic graphs from the GO.db package.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4-18"><title>Statistics</title><p>All statistical analyses were performed with R (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">R Core Development Team, 2015</xref>), and various statistical packages available for R.</p><p>Analysis of differentially expressed genes was performed with EdgeR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">McCarthy et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Robinson et al., 2010</xref>) and DESeq2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Love et al., 2014</xref>) using custom made scripts, considering a BH FDR of 0.1 as statistically significant.</p><p>Proteomic data were analysed using either LIMMA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Ritchie et al., 2015</xref>) and ROTS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Elo et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Elo et al., 2009</xref>). LIMMA uses linear modelling to test the fit of obtained expression data to the null hypothesis based on the defined experimental design. The script used was modified based on a previously available application for labelled-proteomics data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Kammers et al., 2015</xref>, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.biostat.jhsph.edu/~kkammers/software/eupa/R_guide.html">http://www.biostat.jhsph.edu/~kkammers/software/eupa/R_guide.html</ext-link>), and used the more conservative BH FDR rather than q-values (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Storey and Tibshirani, 2003</xref>) originally in the script. ROTS is a modified form of the t-test, which uses bootstrapping to analyse differential expression between sample groups using random-subsets of samples. From the collective results a modified test statistic is calculated based on the reproducibility of the list of differentially expressed predictions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Elo et al., 2008</xref>).</p><p>GO-Term analysis was performed using the GOstats package (v2.46.0), which applies a hypergeometric test to test for significance. We used the conditional algorithm of hypergeometric test which takes into account the hierarchical structure of the GO-terms by testing the leaves (GO-Terms with no child-terms) first. The conditioning then leads to the elimination of those genes associated with a GO-Term which have been tested as significant in the GO-term`s children (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Falcon and Gentleman, 2007</xref>).</p><p>qRT-PCR data were first checked for normality by the Shapiro-Wilk test (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Shapiro and Wilk, 1965</xref>) using the generic shapiro.test() function. Statistical significance was then assessed by an unpaired t-test with Welch`s correction for heteroskedasticity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib101">Welch, 1947</xref>) with at least five biological replicates per group. Corrections for multiple testing were done applying the BH algorithm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Benjamini and Hochberg, 1995</xref>).</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We thank the members of the Tessmar-Raible and Raible groups for discussions, Andreij Belokurov and Margaryta Borysova for excellent worm care at the MFPL Fish and Marine facility.</p></ack><sec id="s5" sec-type="additional-information"><title>Additional information</title><fn-group content-type="competing-interest"><title>Competing interests</title><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf1"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf2"><p>is affiliated with Lexogen GmbH.

This paper unquestionably represents a very important resource for a very intriguing biological phenomenon and <italic>eLife</italic> is, in principle, happy to provide a platform for publishing this as a Tools and Resources article.</p><p>However, the Reviewing Editor also agrees with the reviewer's request for a number of revisions. All three major comments are essential to address, but as you can see they will only require (very important) editorial changes and no further experimentation. In regard to major point 3, we urge you to discuss this issue with proper depth in the manuscript.</p><p>Overall assessment:</p><p>The manuscript &quot;Combined transcriptome and proteome profiling reveals specific molecular brain signatures for sex, maturation and circalunar clock phase&quot; by Schenk and coauthors provides several rich -omics datasets to define the molecular differences in the heads of the marine annelid <italic>Platynereis dumerilii</italic> between sexes, during maturation, and during different moon phases. The authors establish a novel method to extract both mRNAs and proteins from head/brain regions from the same sample enabling comparison between proteomic and transcriptomic results from the very same tissue. The authors generate a de novo head transcriptome to estimate transcript levels in the head under various conditions, perform differential gene expression analyses as well as subsequent downstream analyses for enrichments for these processes. &gt;8000 differentially expressed transcripts (DETs) were identified during the maturation process, 640 DETs with a sex bias, and 63 DETs specific for one of two lunar phases. DET results were validated by qRT-PCR and in situ hybridization for a small number of selected genes with different signatures in regard to the three processes. Furthermore, 693 differentially expressed proteins (DEPs) were identified during maturation, 17 DEPS with a sex bias, and 261 DEPS during circalunar phases. Apparently the proteomic approach implicated more genes with significant changes during the two moon phases than the transcriptomic approach. The authors continued to investigate five circalunar DEPs genes that exhibited also correlated transcriptional changes within the RNA seq data.

However, studies across various organisms and in different experimental contexts show that the correlation between the genes that are detected in the transcriptome and the corresponding proteome is relatively low. As a matter of fact, our correlation coefficient (R=0.48) is at the upper end of what has been published for such analyses in organisms. To provide concrete examples:</p><p>Casas-Vila et al., 2017, found only a moderate correlation (maximum R=0.5) for the developmental transcriptome/proteome in the fruitfly <italic>Drosophila melanogaster.</italic> Comparison of transcriptome vs. proteome for sexual differences in the nematode <italic>C.elegans</italic> by Tops et al., 2010, results in an R=0.41. Likewise, Grün, D et al., 2014, compare protein and mRNA expression levels for multiple stages of <italic>C.elegans</italic> development. While they do not provide absolute numbers across all stages (for direct comparison to our numbers), their correlations between mRNA and protein levels across different developmental stages (see their Figure 4C, p-570) are much lower than ours. These authors attribute the effect (at least in part) to post-transcriptional regulation. Finally, also in line with all these observations, Schrimpf, SP et al. (PLoS Biol. 2009 Mar 3;7(3):e48.) already noticed that the abundance of orthologous proteins across species is better correlated than the protein vs. transcript abundances within the same species. We had mentioned this aspect already briefly in the previous version of the manuscript, but now extended it, including the above-mentioned citations (see “To further compare to existing datasets…”).</p><p>All the cited studies provide evidence that the assumption that the detectable DEP should be among the highest approximately 2000 expressed RNA transcripts is incorrect. Indeed, consistent with these studies, we find that DEPs for maturation, sex and lunar distribute as a cloud across the DETs corresponding to all detected proteins. We do not detect a particular bias. To make this point clearer, we now included these analyses in the initial transcriptome-proteome correlation figure (Figure 5—figure supplement 1).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Could DE analysis of proteomics data create 'artificially' high numbers of DEPs?

But as this might escape our detection to some extent (e.g. how variable would the transcriptome vs. proteome have to be in order to get such an effect?), we now mention this as a point that should be kept in mind in the revised Discussion section (“Alternatively, it is also possible that the level of variability is higher in the transcriptome than in the proteome, which…”).</p><p>It is clear that further quantitative transcriptomic and proteomic studies will be beneficial to better understand the circalunar effects on the worms. However, we think that our data already provide significant conceptual advance with respect to the possible functional mechanism and impact of the circalunar clock:</p><p>Combined transcriptome and proteome comparisons have previously been taken as a strong indication for post-transcriptional regulation, see e.g. Grün et al., 2014, “For most genes, protein abundances could not be explained by changes of the transcript level, suggesting ubiquitous posttranscriptional regulation….” Also see Zappulo A et al. (Nat Commun. 2017 Sep 19;8(1):583) for the usage of such data to conclude on spatially specific post-transcriptional regulation.

The results are detailed below, and we also included them in the Results part of the manuscript (Results subsection “Additional proteomic analyses confirm the large change in protein abundance between different circalunar phases”, from “Finally, we tested if the high numbers of circalunar regulated proteins could be explained by the lower number of proteins compared to the high transcriptome number,…” and subsection “Mass spectrometry” for methodological description).</p><p>In summary, focusing the analyses on the top 5000 or 1000 expressed transcripts can explain an about 3-4.3-fold increase in significantly regulated DET. This is likely due to a “relaxation” of the multiple testing correction due to lower total numbers to correct for. Interestingly, this 3-4.3-fold increase in enrichment with lower numbers of tested transcripts covers the increase we observe for protein regulation across maturation. In contrast, it does not explain the about 245-fold increase we observe between circalunar transcriptome and proteome.</p><p>Circalunar:</p><p>5000 most highly expressed transcripts:</p><p>20 DET = 0.4% (compared to 0.12% in the complete transcriptome set) – 3.3-fold enrichment</p><p>1000 most highly expressed transcripts:</p><p>4 DET = 0.4% (compared to 0.12% in the complete transcriptome set) – 3.3-fold enrichment</p><p>Sex differences:</p><p>5000 most highly expressed transcripts:</p><p>262 DET = 5.2% (compared to 1.22% in the complete transcriptome set) – 4.3-fold enrichment</p><p>1000 most highly expressed transcripts:</p><p>52 DET = 5.2% (compared to 1.22% in the complete transcriptome set) – 4.3-fold enrichment</p><p>Maturation:</p><p>5000 most highly expressed transcripts:</p><p>2435 DET = 48.7% (compared to 16.5% in the complete transcriptome set) – 3.3-fold enrichment</p><p>1000 most highly expressed transcripts:</p><p>546 DET = 54.6% (compared to 16.5% in the complete transcriptome set) – 3.3-fold enrichment</p><p>As we did these calculations, we noticed that the programme versions of DESeq and EdgeR have meanwhile been updated.
