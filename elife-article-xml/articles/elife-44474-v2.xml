pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.44474.001</object-id><p>In plants, antimicrobial immune responses involve the cellular release of anions and are responsible for the closure of stomatal pores. Detection of microbe-associated molecular patterns (MAMPs) by pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) induces currents mediated via slow-type (S-type) anion channels by a yet not understood mechanism. Here, we show that stomatal closure to fungal chitin is conferred by the major PRRs for chitin recognition, LYK5 and CERK1, the receptor-like cytoplasmic kinase PBL27, and the SLAH3 anion channel. PBL27 has the capacity to phosphorylate SLAH3, of which S127 and S189 are required to activate SLAH3. Full activation of the channel entails CERK1, depending on PBL27. Importantly, both S127 and S189 residues of SLAH3 are required for chitin-induced stomatal closure and anti-fungal immunity at the whole leaf level. Our results demonstrate a short signal transduction module from MAMP recognition to anion channel activation, and independent of ABA-induced SLAH3 activation.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>MAMP</kwd><kwd>PAMP-triggered immunity</kwd><kwd>PTI</kwd><kwd>CERK1</kwd><kwd>LYK5</kwd><kwd>SLAH3</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>A. thaliana</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000324</institution-id><institution>Gatsby Charitable Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Group Leader Fellowship</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Robatzek</surname><given-names>Silke</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100010663</institution-id><institution>H2020 European Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Project Award</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Robatzek</surname><given-names>Silke</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000268</institution-id><institution>Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Project Award</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Faulkner</surname><given-names>Christine</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001659</institution-id><institution>Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Project Award</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Geiger</surname><given-names>Dietmar</given-names></name><name><surname>Hedrich</surname><given-names>Rainer</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001659</institution-id><institution>Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Heisenberg Fellowship</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Robatzek</surname><given-names>Silke</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>S-type anion channel activity, which promotes stomatal closure and improves anti-fungal immunity in plants, is directly regulated through phosphorylation by a kinase of the chitin receptor complex.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Activation of the innate immune system plays an important role in the protection of body surface tissues against microbial invaders. Many agronomical important pathogens penetrate plant tissues directly through the epidermis or via stomata (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Grimmer et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Faulkner and Robatzek, 2012</xref>). These include fungal pathogens that are the causal agents of devastating diseases such as rust fungi (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Fones et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Nguyen et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bebber and Gurr, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Shafiei et al., 2007</xref>). To defend fungal infection at the level of penetration, epidermal cells are highly immunomodulatory to oligosaccharides of fungal chitin, a microbe-associated molecular pattern (MAMP) present across fungal families (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Faulkner and Robatzek, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">McLachlan et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Koers et al., 2011</xref>). In Arabidopsis, perception of chitin is mediated at the cell surface by three related pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Boutrot and Zipfel, 2017</xref>). CHITIN ELICITOR RECEPTOR KINASE 1 (CERK1) and LYSINE MOTIF (LysM) RECEPTOR KINASE 5 (LYK5) encode single-pass transmembrane receptor kinases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Liu et al., 2012</xref>). LysM-domain-containing GLYCOSYLPHOSPHATIDYLINOSITOL (GPI)-anchored protein 2 (LYM2) encodes a receptor-like protein predominantly present at plasmodesmal membranes and specifically involved in cell-to-cell signalling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Faulkner et al., 2013</xref>). Their ectodomains consist of three LysM domains, of which in CERK1 the middle LysM domain was shown to bind directly to chitin oligomers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Liu et al., 2012</xref>). Recent data demonstrate that LYK5 is the major chitin receptor in Arabidopsis, binding chitin oligomers with higher affinity than CERK1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cao et al., 2014</xref>). Upon chitin binding, LYK5 forms a complex with CERK1 leading to signal generation, which depends on CERK1 autophosphorylation at specific threonine and tyrosine residues and dephosphorylation by the CERK1-INTERACTING PROTEIN PHOSPHATASE 1 (CIPP1) phosphatase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cao et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Liu et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Suzuki et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>A key event of PRR signalling is the phosphorylation of receptor complex-associated RECEPTOR-LIKE CYTOPLASMIC KINASES (RLCKs), which induces the release of the RLCKs from the PRR complex and activation of downstream substrates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Rao et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bi et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Yamada et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Lu et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Zhang et al., 2010</xref>). Of the 46 members of the RLCK VII subfamily, several RLCKs have been associated with pattern-triggered immunity (PTI) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Rao et al., 2018</xref>). BOTRYTIS-INDUCED KINASE 1 (BIK1) and the closely related PROBABLE SERINE/THREONINE-PROTEIN KINASE-LIKE 1 (PBL1) of the VII-8 subgroup induce defence signalling downstream of CERK1, the bacterial MAMP receptors FLAGELLIN SENSING 2 (FLS2) and EF-TU RECEPTOR (EFR), and the danger receptors PEP1 RECEPTOR KINASEs (PEPR) 1 and PEPR2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Lu et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Zhang et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Liu et al., 2013</xref>). CERK1-dependent chitin signalling is shared with members of the RLCK VII-4 subgroup and PBL27 belonging to the VII-1 subgroup (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Rao et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Yamada et al., 2016</xref>), highlighting that subfamily VII RLCKs have both redundant and specific roles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Rao et al., 2018</xref>). Consistently, higher order mutants of VII-1, VII-4 and VII-8 subgroup members are all compromised in the chitin-induced burst of reactive oxygen species (ROS) while showing different response signatures depending on the type of MAMP and defence reaction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Rao et al., 2018</xref>). Being a direct substrate of CERK1, initial studies suggest that <italic>pbl27</italic> mutants were not defective in chitin-induced ROS burst but MITOGEN -ACTIVATED PROTEIN KINASES 3/6 (MPK3/6) signalling and callose deposition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Yamada et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Shinya et al., 2014</xref>). PBL27 was shown to phosphorylate MAPKKK5 in a CERK1-dependent manner, resulting in the dissociation of MAPKKK5 from PBL27 and activation of MKK4 and MKK5, upstream kinases of the MAPK signalling cascade (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Yamada et al., 2016</xref>). However, these findings are recently challenged, since chitin-triggered MAPK activation was not compromised in single <italic>pbl27</italic> and higher order <italic>rlck vii-1</italic> mutants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Rao et al., 2018</xref>), suggesting that more research is required. Instead, subgroup VII-4 members are involved in activation of MPK3/6 by chitin, yet not immune signalling by bacterial flagellin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Ranf et al., 2014</xref>). On the other hand, BIK1 and PBL1 are required for flagellin-induced ROS production but not MAPK activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Zhang et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Li et al., 2014</xref>). This highlights differences between RLCK-mediated signalling in response to fungal and bacterial MAMPs.</p><p>MAMP perception results in the closure of stomata, pores formed by a guard cell pair, and thereby promotes plant tissue surface immunity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">McLachlan et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Melotto et al., 2006</xref>). As a counterstrategy and demonstrating the importance of stomatal closure, infectious pathogens secrete effectors, which function to inhibit closure of stomata and to induce stomatal opening, or lock stomata in the wide open state by fungal-produced fusicoccin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">McLachlan et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Lozano-Durán et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Melotto et al., 2006</xref>). Reducing the complexity of whole plant/organ systems with different cell types, guard cells have been well established as a single cell model system and used to dissect both immune- and ABA-signalling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Qi et al., 2017</xref>). Stomatal apertures are controlled by cell volume changes triggered upon ion fluxes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">McLachlan et al., 2014</xref>). Stomatal closure to bacterial flagellin requires activation of S-type anion channels mediated by the SLOW ANION CHANNEL-ASSOCIATED 1 (SLAC1), a weak rectifying anion channel present at the plasma membrane of guard cells, and closely related SLAC1 HOMOLOG 3 (SLAH3) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Guzel Deger et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Montillet et al., 2013</xref>). Exposure to chitin oligosaccharides (herein referred to as chitin) and chitosan, a deacetylated derivative of chitin, reduce stomatal apertures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bourdais et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Klüsener et al., 2002</xref>). Evidence suggest that chitosan stimulates S-type anion channels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Koers et al., 2011</xref>), but the molecular components involved in channel activation and thus promoting stomatal closure to chitin and derivatives remain elusive.</p><p>In abiotic stress signalling, SLAC1 is activated by OPEN STOMATA 1 (OST1), a SUCROSE NON-FERMENTING 1 (SNF1)-related protein kinase (SnRK), which involves S120 phosphorylation of the SLAC1 N-terminus and is independent of elevated cytoplasmic calcium (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Geiger et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Vahisalu et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Geiger et al., 2009</xref>). Yet, elevation of cytosolic calcium also activates S-type anion channels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Stange et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Schroeder and Hagiwara, 1989</xref>), consistent with the findings that CALCIUM-DEPENDENT PROTEIN KINASE 3 (CPK3) and CPK21 activate SLAC1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Geiger et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Scherzer et al., 2012</xref>). CPK6 and CPK23 also appear to activate SLAC1 but largely independent of cytosolic calcium elevation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Geiger et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Scherzer et al., 2012</xref>), which involves S59 phosphorylation at the SLAC1 N-terminus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Brandt et al., 2012</xref>). Moreover, calcium sensitive CALCINEURIN B-LIKE 1 (CBL1) and CBL9 together with CBL-INTERACTING PROTEIN KINASE 23 (CIPK23) are capable of SLAC1 activation, through a phosphorylated residue distinct from OST1 phosphorylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Maierhofer et al., 2014a</xref>). This demonstrates that different kinases regulate SLAC1 activity at distinct phosphorylation sites. SLAH3 is only activated upon co-expression of CPKs and CBL/CIPKs but not by OST1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Maierhofer et al., 2014a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Geiger et al., 2011</xref>), suggesting a different mode of regulation.</p><p>Previous studies suggested several kinases in guard cell signalling downstream of FLS2, including BIK1, MPK3/6 and OST1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kadota et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Li et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Guzel Deger et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Montillet et al., 2013</xref>). Thus, although the pathways conferring MAMP-induced stomatal closure are emerging, the molecular events that result in anion release upon PRR signalling are not understood. Here, we identify that the Arabidopsis LYK5-CERK1-PBL27 receptor complex is responsible for chitin-induced stomatal closure and anti-fungal immunity. Using biochemical and molecular approaches, we show that PBL27 directly interacts with and phosphorylates SLAH3, consistent with SLAH3 phosphorylation induced by chitin. PBL27 phosphorylates S127 and S189 residues of SLAH3, which are required for chitin-induced stomatal closure and anti-fungal immunity.

Most crude chitin preparations, i.e. as used in this study, represent a mixture of long-chain and short-chain chitin and chitosan oligosaccharides, which could be perceived by different receptors. CERK1 binds both chitin and chitosan with a preference for long-chain oligosaccharides (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Petutschnig et al., 2010</xref>), suggesting that it is a major receptor in chitin-induced closure of stomata.

However, co-injection with PBL19 or PBL39, both belonging to the VII-4 subgroup involved in chitin-induced ROS production and MAPK activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Rao et al., 2018</xref>), did not induce SLAH3 anion channel activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1C</xref>). A putative role for SLAH3 regulation by MAPKs is further excluded, as co-injection with MAPKKK5, a direct substrate of PBL27 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Yamada et al., 2016</xref>), did neither activate SLAH3 directly nor influence PBL27-mediated activation of SLAH3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1D</xref>).

PBL1 is closely related with and functionally redundant to BIK1, and also implicated in chitin defences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Zhang et al., 2010</xref>). We therefore tested PBL1 and observed that it activated SLAH3, inducing current amplitudes even higher compared with PBL27 injection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1C</xref>). Thus, in addition to PBL27, the VII-8 subgroup member PBL1 can produce SLAH3-mediated S-type anion currents.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>PBL27-mediated SLAH3 activation is increased by signalling competent CERK1</title><p>PBL27 is a direct substrate of the LYK5-CERK1 complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Yamada et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Shinya et al., 2014</xref>). We therefore investigated the contribution of the receptor kinases for SLAH3 activation by PBL27. SLAH3-mediated anion current amplitudes were strongly increased in the presence of CERK1 but not LYK5 co-injection, when activated by PBL27 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). The positive regulation of SLAH3 opening by CERK1 is even more striking when the steady-state currents are blotted against the voltage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2A, B and C</xref>). The enhanced activity is due to a shift of the relative open probability of SLAH3 to more negative membrane potentials in the presence of CERK1. When LYK5 and CERK1 were co-injected without PBL27, SLAH3 remained silent (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>), corresponding with SLAH3 interaction with PBL27 but not CERK1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). Consistent with the finding that PBL27 is phosphorylated by CERK1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Shinya et al., 2014</xref>), only signalling-competent CERK1 amplified PBL27-mediated SLAH3 activation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2D</xref>). Activation of SLAH3 by PBL27 was dependent on its kinase activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>), which was also necessary for amplified SLAH3 activation by CERK1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2E</xref>). This suggests that the phosphorylation status of PBL27 correlates with the activation of SLAH3 and is in agreement with enhanced phosphorylation of SLAH3 when PBL27 was purified from chitin-stimulated cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). We next tested whether PBL1 activation of SLAH3 is downstream of CERK1 signalling. Unexpectedly, co-injection with CERK1 inhibited PBL1 activation of SLAH3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1E</xref>). It is possible that PBL1 regulates SLAH3 downstream of PEPR1/2 signalling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Liu et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Zheng et al., 2018</xref>), and becomes inactive for <italic>trans</italic>-phosphorylation of SLAH3 in the presence of CERK1. We conclude that PBL27 is the primary kinase that directly phosphorylates SLAH3 for the release of anions and functions in an activation status-dependent manner regulated by CERK1.</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>PBL27 activates SLAH3 anion transport through specific phospho-sites</title><p>Having found that PBL27 phosphorylates SLAH3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C and D</xref>), these results are consistent with the hypothesis that PBL27 activates SLAH3 through phosphorylation. For that reason, we sought to identify residues that are phosphorylated by PBL27 and tested whether these sites are required for SLAH3 activation. To identify the SLAH3 phosphorylation sites resulting from PBL27 <italic>trans</italic>-phosphorylation, SLAH3-N and SLAH3-C were incubated with PBL27 in vitro, and the phosphorylation sites were determined by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) analysis. We discovered that SLAH3 was phosphorylated at three sites by PBL27: S127 and S189 at SLAH3-N and S601 at SLAH3-C (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A, B and C</xref>).</p><p>We next examined the functional relevance of PBL27-mediated S127, S189 and S601 phosphorylation for the activation of SLAH3. In oocytes, injection of single phospho-mimic mutations of S127, S189 and S601 (S127D, S189D and S601D) did not auto-activate SLAH3 and had no impact on PBL27 activation of SLAH3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). However, remarkably, the double mutant S127D/S189D, but neither S127D/S601D nor S189D/S601D, was constitutive active (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>). Current amplitudes of the mutants were comparable with wild type SLAH3 activated by PBL27 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>). Interestingly, co-expression of S127D/S189D with PBL27 did not result in a further increase in anion currents whereas S127D/S601D and S189D/S601D could still be activated by PBL27 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>). These results provide evidence that the phosphorylation status of both S127 and S189 is critical for SLAH3 channel opening.</p><p>We tested single phospho-dead mutations of S127, S189 and S601 (S127A, S189A and S601A) for the activation of SLAH3. Importantly, we observed that PBL27 activation of SLAH3 is abrogated by S127A, but not S189 and S601 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref>). We also found that S127A did not affect the activation of SLAH3 by other kinases such as CPK21ΔEF and CBL1/CIPK23 or by the heteromerization with the silent anion channel subunit SLAH1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3A</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Cubero-Font et al., 2016</xref>). These results demonstrate that PBL27 regulates SLAH3 activation through phosphorylation of S127, a site not required for CPK21 and CBL1/CIPK23 activation of SLAH3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3A</xref>). However, whilst S127 phosphorylation is required for SLAH3 activation by PBL27, it is not sufficient by itself to induce anion transport (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>). It can only auto-activate SLAH3 in the context of additional S189 phospho-mimicry (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>), and thus suggests a functional link between these two residues in SLAH3 channel opening.</p><p>Surprisingly, the S189A instead of the S189D mutation resulted in constitutive activation of SLAH3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D and F</xref>). The S189A auto-activation could not be further elevated by co-injection of PBL27 or other anion channel activating components like CIPK23/CBL1 or SLAH1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3B</xref>). However, CERK1-mediated amplification of SLAH3 activation by PBL27 is compromised in the S189A constitutive active variant of SLAH3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3G</xref>). Thus, it seems that PBL27 phosphorylation of S127 activates SLAH3 but full opening of the SLAH3 channel additionally requires PBL27 phosphorylation of S189, in a CERK1-dependent manner. However, it is possible that S127 also contributes to amplified SLAH3 opening by CERK1, which we are unable to address as a S127A/S189A variant would already affect the PBL27 pre-activation of SLAH3. S601 seems not to be involved in phosphorylation-dependent or -independent activation of SLAH3, since the mutant S601A could be either activated by PBL27 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref>) or by CPK21ΔEF, CIPK23/CBL1 and SLAH1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3C</xref>). This is in line with single or double phospho-mimic mutants including S601D that do not affect SLAH3 activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D and E</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-6"><title>SLAH3 is required for chitin-induced stomatal closure and anti-fungal immunity</title><p>We finally evaluated the relevance of the PBL27-dependent SLAH3 phospho-sites in chitin-induced stomatal closure. We generated stable transgenic Arabidopsis lines expressing wild type SLAH3 and the single S127A, S189A and S601A phospho-dead variants in the <italic>slah3</italic> mutant background. We tested each six independent T1 lines that all exhibited significant transcription of the transgene (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>). Transgenic <italic>slah3</italic> plants expressing wild-type SLAH3 showed chitin-induced stomatal closure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). By contrast, plants expressing the S127A and S189A variants failed to close stomata in response to chitin, similar to <italic>slah3</italic> mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B and C</xref>). This is consistent with our result that S127 phosphorylation is required for activation of SLAH3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref>). The observation that plants expressing the S189A variant were impaired in stomatal closure is in apparent contrast with its auto-activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref>). It would be expected that auto-active SLAH3 triggers a continual closure of stomata and such plants would be severely affected in development. Since we could recover transgenic plants expressing SLAH3 S189A (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>) and having no obvious developmental phenotype suggest two scenarios: Firstly, constitutive negative regulation at a residue that could compensate the effect of S189A, i.e. S127 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>). This could result in insensitivity to chitin stimulation and open stomata (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>). Secondly, the level of S189A auto-activation of SLAH3 is below a threshold of triggering continual stomatal closure. Since S189A is compromised in CERK1-dependent full activation of SLAH3 by PBL27 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3G</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2A, B and C</xref> note, in the presence of CERK1, the SLAH3/PBL27 pair mediated three times higher currents), stomata do not close in response to chitin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>). However, although CIPK23/CBL1 were unable to increase SLAH3 opening beyond the level of its auto-activation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3B</xref>), we cannot exclude the possibility that the auto-activation of SLAH3-S189A in oocytes hints at a structurally important role in SLAH3 function that is not only specific to the activation of PBL27 by CERK1. As expected from oocyte experiments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref>), plants expressing the S601A SLAH3 variant behaved wild type-like (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig4" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.44474.018</object-id><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><title>SLAH3 phospho-sites S127 and S189 are necessary for chitin-induced stomatal closure.</title><p>(<bold>A–D</bold>) Stomatal aperture measurements in transgenic <italic>slah3-1/35S::SLAH3−3 × FLAG</italic> wild type (<bold>A</bold>), S127A (<bold>B</bold>), S189A (<bold>C</bold>) and S601A (<bold>D</bold>) variants of SLAH3.

Notably, <italic>slah3</italic> mutants were not generally immune-compromised, since we observed wild type-like chitin-induced ROS burst and ethylene production (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B and C</xref>). MAMP-induced ethylene production appears to be downstream of MAPK activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bethke et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Liu and Zhang, 2004</xref>). We therefore assume that SLAH3-mediated resistance to <italic>B. cinerea</italic> is primarily the result of impaired ion fluxes, as in the case of stomatal closure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>), rather than through altered MAPK signalling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Meng et al., 2013</xref>). We also found that the chitin-induced ROS burst was not altered in <italic>pbl27</italic> mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>), consistent with previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Shinya et al., 2014</xref>) and that PBL27 showed no interaction with RBOHD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). Although a higher order <italic>rlck vii-1</italic> mutant was partially reduced in ROS production to chitin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Shinya et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Rao et al., 2018</xref>), it is the members of the VII-4 subgroup that play major roles in the chitin-induced ROS burst (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Rao et al., 2018</xref>). Thus, the failure of <italic>pbl27</italic> to close stomata in response to chitin is not explained by a compromised ROS burst, supporting a role for SLAH3. Examination of <italic>B. cinerea</italic> infection in <italic>pbl27</italic> revealed no significant differences compared with wild type (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>). This might not be unexpected in light of PBL1 also activating SLAH3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1C</xref>). Furthermore, resistance to <italic>B. cinerea</italic> involves PEPR1/2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Gravino et al., 2017</xref>), receptors that detect danger signals from the infection and that induce stomatal closure depending on SLAH3 and guard cell-specific SLAC1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Zheng et al., 2018</xref>). We would argue that PBL27 mediates activation of SLAH3 in response to CERK1 signalling while PBL1 activates SLAH3 upon PEPR1/2 signalling, suggesting specific signalling pathways that converge on SLAH3. In agreement with this hypothesis, <italic>slah3</italic> but not <italic>pbl27</italic> show compromised resistance to <italic>B. cinerea</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A and E</xref>).

SLAC1 and SLAH3 activity is mostly regulated through phosphorylation at their N-termini, mediated by kinases sensitive and insensitive to elevated cytosolic calcium levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Geiger et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Scherzer et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Maierhofer et al., 2014a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Geiger et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Maierhofer et al., 2014b</xref>). Here, we show that SLAH3 is activated by PBL27, a member of the RLCK subgroup VII-1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Rao et al., 2018</xref>), interacting with and functioning downstream of the LYK5-CERK1 chitin-binding receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Yamada et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Shinya et al., 2014</xref>). Our data are consistent with a direct activation of SLAH3 by PBL27, which is amplified by signalling-active CERK1. In such a model, chitin binding activates the LYK5-CERK1 receptors, inducing auto-phosphorylation and <italic>trans</italic>-phosphorylation events (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Couto and Zipfel, 2016</xref>), which result in the phosphorylation and activation of PBL27 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Shinya et al., 2014</xref>). Therefore, only signalling-competent CERK1, but not kinase-dead CERK1, amplified PBL27-mediated SLAH3 opening (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2D</xref>). As PBL27 pre-exists in a complex with SLAH3 independent of chitin stimulus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A,B</xref>), activated PBL27 enhanced the phosphorylation of the SLAH3 N-terminus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>), which fully opens SLAH3 to release anions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). Full activation of SLAH3 appears to be required for chitin-induced stomatal closure and resistance to <italic>B. cinerea</italic> infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F and G</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>): S127 is a phospho-site required for SLAH3 activation by kinase-active PBL27, and S189 represents a phospho-site, which is sensitive to amplifying SLAH3 opening by CERK1-activated PBL27 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3G</xref>). The importance of both phospho-sites is supported by the finding that SLAH3 auto-activation by phospho-mimicry required the combination of S127D and S189D (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>). Since PBL1 can also activate SLAH3 and that <italic>slah3</italic> but not <italic>pbl27</italic> mutants supported <italic>B.cinerea</italic> infection, it is plausible to speculate that S127 and S189 are also involved in PBL1 activation of SLAH3.</p><p>Stomatal closure induced by FLS2 and PEPR1/2 signalling relies on both SLAH3 and SLAC1, and requires BIK1 for activation of anion currents in response to PEPR1/2 signalling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Guzel Deger et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Zheng et al., 2018</xref>).

OST1 does not activate SLAH3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Maierhofer et al., 2014a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Geiger et al., 2011</xref>), although it was described to regulate flagellin-induced stomatal closure and confers SLAC1 activation (Figure 3-figure supplement 1B) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Guzel Deger et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Geiger et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Vahisalu et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Geiger et al., 2009</xref>). Instead, PBL1 belonging to the VII-8 subgroup and closely related with BIK1 activated SLAH3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1C</xref>). We may speculate that PBL1 confers SLAH3 activation while OST1, or a closely related SnRK kinase, activates SLAC1. Being directly associated with PRRs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Yamada et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Lu et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Zhang et al., 2010</xref>), it seems that different PRRs integrate different RLCK VII members for distinct signalling outputs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Rao et al., 2018</xref>), i.e. FLS2-activated BIK1 phosphorylates RBOHD to produce ROS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kadota et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Li et al., 2014</xref>). Consistently, our work identifies a phospho-regulatory pathway that directly links PRR complexes with S-type anion transportation in a specific and signalling-dependent manner. Since CERK1 also functions in LYM1 and LYM3 perception of bacterial peptidoglycan (PGN) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Willmann et al., 2011</xref>), it will be interesting to explore whether PGN induces stomatal closure through SLAH3 activation by PBL27 or PBL1, thereby promoting anti-bacterial immunity at the level of tissue invasion.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Contact for reagent and resource sharing</title><p>Further information and requests for resources and reagents should be directed to and will be fulfilled by the Lead Contacts, Rainer Hedrich (hedrich@botanik.uni-wuerzburg.de) and Silke Robatzek (robatzek@bio.lmu.de).</p></sec><sec id="s4-2"><title>Experimental model and subject details</title><p>Seeds of wild-type <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> Col-0 and T-DNA insertion mutants of <italic>cerk1</italic> (<italic>cerk1-2</italic>, GABI_096F09), <italic>lyk2</italic> (SALK_152226), <italic>lyk3</italic> (SALK_140374), <italic>lyk4</italic> (WiscDsLox297300_01C), <italic>lyk5</italic> (SALK_ 131911C), <italic>slac1-3</italic> (SALK_099139) and <italic>slah3-1</italic> (GK_371G03) were obtained from the <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> Biological Research Center (ABRC).

Instantaneous currents (I<sub>inst</sub>) were extracted immediately after the voltage jump from the holding potential of 0 mV to 50 ms test pulses ranging from +70 to −150 mV.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4-3-11"><title>Immune assays</title><p>Ethylene and ROS measurements were conducted as described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Albert et al., 2010</xref>), with the following modifications: Ethylene accumulation was measured after 5 hr incubation of three leaf pieces per 6 ml tube (three replicates for each condition) containing 500 µl water plus or minus 1 µM chitin resulting in 0,1–0,2 pmol/ml (ethylene in the headspace) for the water controls and 0,3–0,4 pmol/ml after treatment with chitin. For <italic>slah3</italic> mutants, the production of ROS was observed with 20 µM L-012 (Wako) and 2 µg/ml horseradish peroxidase (Applichem) in the reaction assay. Each biological replicate consisted of the mean of at least 4 up to eight single measurements. Chitin (mean degree of polymerization = 7) was prepared as described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Nars et al., 2013</xref>) and dissolved in water. For <italic>pbl27-1</italic> mutants, ROS production was basically measured as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Albrecht et al., 2012</xref>). Briefly, ROS was elicited with chitin (0.1 mg/ml) and water treatment was included as a negative control. 6 to 27 leaf discs (4 mm Ø) from 5 weeks old plants were used for each condition, transferred into a 96-well plate and incubated overnight in 200 μl water. The water was then replaced with 100 μl of a luminol/peroxidase solution (17 μg/ml luminol and 10 μg/ml HRP) supplemented or not with chitin (0.1 mg/ml). Luminescence was measured over 60 min using a Tecan Infinite M200 PRO plate reader.</p></sec><sec id="s4-3-12"><title>Current ejection of chitosan</title><p>The experiment was carried out with stomata in intact leaves, which were excised from 4 to 5 weeks old plants and fixed in a small petri dish (diameter 35 mm) with double-sided adhesive tape. The leaves were incubated in the bath solution (10 mM KCl, 1 mM CaCl<sub>2</sub> and 10 mM MES/BTP, pH 6) and illuminated with 100 µmol m<sup>−2</sup> s<sup>−1</sup> white light for at least 2 hr before the start of the experiment. Guard cells in the abaxial epidermis of intact leaves were applied with chitosan by using the current ejection technique (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Huang et al., 2019</xref>), which the tip of a microelectrode was filled with 0.3 mg/mL of chitosan (or 10 mM of MES/BTP, pH6, as control), while the remaining part was filled with 300 mM KCl. The microelectrodes were connected to a custom-made amplifier (Ulliclamp01) via Ag/AgCl half-cells. A reference electrode filled with 300 mM KCl and sealed with 2% agarose (prepared with 300 mM KCl) was bathed to the solution. The microelectrodes were slowly moved towards the cell wall of guard cell under the control of piezo-driven micro-manipulator (MM3A, Kleindiek Nanotechnik). The positively charged chitosan was ejected into the cell wall by application of a current of 1 nA for a period of 60 s. After the ejection, the microelectrode was rapidly removed from the guard cell wall.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>Quantification and statistical analysis</title><sec id="s4-4-1"><title>Plant and oocyte data</title><p>All experiments were performed at least three times. Sample size, n, for each experiment was given in the figure legends. Statistical significances for stomatal assays was based on two-way ANOVA post hoc Tukey’s HSD test. Statistical significances for pathogenicity assays was based on nested one-way ANOVA test. Statistical significances for oocyte assays was based on one-way ANOVA.</p></sec><sec id="s4-4-2"><title>Software processing and peptide identification</title><p>Peak lists in the form of Mascot generic files (mgf files) were prepared from raw data using MS Convert (Proteowizard project) and sent to peptide match search on Mascot server v2.4.1 using Mascot Daemon (Matrix Science Ltd.).</p><p>Peak lists were searched against protein databases including typical proteomics contaminants such as keratins, etc. Tryptic peptides with up to two possible miscleavages and charge states +2, +3, +4 were allowed in the search. The following peptide modifications were included in the search: oxidized Methionine (variable), phosphorylated Serine/Threonine/Tyrosine (variable) and carbamidomethylated Cysteine (static). Data were searched with a monoisotopic precursor and fragment ion mass tolerance 10ppm and 0.6 Da respectively. Decoy database was used to validate peptide sequence matches. Mascot results were combined in Scaffold v4.4.0 (Proteome Software Inc) and exported to Excel (Microsoft Office) for further processing and comparisons.</p><p>In Scaffold, the peptide and protein identifications were accepted if probability of sequence match and protein inference exceeded 95.0% and 99% respectively. Protein probabilities were calculated in Scaffold by the Protein Prophet algorithm; proteins that contained similar peptides and could not be differentiated based on MS/MS analysis alone were grouped to satisfy the principles of parsimony (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Searle, 2010</xref>).</p></sec></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We like to thank members of the Robatzek and Hedrich laboratories, and Dr. Tsutomu Kawasaki (Kindai University, Osaka, JP) for providing materials.

A lightly edited version of the letter sent to the authors after peer review is shown, indicating the most substantive concerns; minor comments are not usually included.</p></boxed-text><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Anion channel SLAH3 is a regulatory target of chitin receptor-associated kinase PBL27 in microbial stomatal closure&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the evaluation has been overseen by Christian Hardtke as the Senior Editor.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>The study provides evidence that the LYK5-CERK1 complex regulates SLAH3 channel activity through PBL27 during chitin signaling. Notably, the phosphorylation of SLAH3 on S127 and S189 appear to play a key role in SLAH3 activation. They also provide evidence that this regulation plays a major role in chitin-induced stomatal closure and disease resistance to <italic>Botrytis cinerea</italic>. There are several issues raised by the reviewers and require attention from the authors:</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) A major weakness of the study is with the biological significance of the findings. The proposed role of SLAH3 in stomatal movement and disease resistance to <italic>Botrytis cinerea</italic> are not properly integrated, since this fungus does not utilize stomata for invasion. A role of SLAH3 in other aspects of PTI should be rigorously tested. For example, is the SLAH3 anion channel activity required for chitin-induced MAPK activation, defense gene expression, ROS burst and whether any of these defenses contribute to resistance to <italic>B. cinerea</italic>. To support a role of PBL27-regulated SLAH3 activation in <italic>B. cinerea</italic> resistance, <italic>pbl27</italic> needs to be tested to see whether it is compromised in resistance.</p><p>2) It is puzzling that S189A confers constitutive active channel activity, but the transgenic plants display a constitutive open stomata phenotype. Isn't it supposed to be constitutive closed stomata? In addition, constitutive activation of SLAH3 channel by S189A suggests that phosphorylation on S189 negatively regulates channel activity, which works against the idea that PBL27 positively regulates SLAH3. Please clarify.</p><p>3) In all BiFC and current experiments, protein levels need to be shown to rule out the possibility that the lack of protein-protein interaction or current is caused by low levels of protein.</p><p>4) It is not known whether SLAH3 is phosphorylated in vivo upon chitin treatment. The authors are advised to perform phos-tag or other assays to shown this is indeed the case. If so, it is then necessary to show whether S127 and S189 are major phosphosites in vivo and whether this chitin-induced phosphorylation requires PBL27.</p><p>5) In Introduction, Results, and Discussion, the authors cite that PBL27 is a major component in chitin signaling. This has been challenged. A role of PBL27 and the entire clade of RLCK VII-1 in MAPK activation, ROS, and selected gene expression could not be detected. Previous studies have not examined stomatal closure and anion channel activity in the <italic>pbl27</italic> mutant. Also, the sentence &quot;Similarly, chitin stimulates S-type anion channels (Koers et al., 2011), but the molecular components involved in channel activation….remain elusive&quot;. This is a key information item, but the cited original study (Koers et al., 2011) used 'chitosan', a deacetylated derivative of chitin, to induce stomata close. Although both are components of fungal cell wall, they are different chemicals and may initiate different signaling steps. It was shown that chitosan may not induce CERK1-dependent immune response (Kaku et al., 2006, and Petutschnig et al., 2010). Authors need to clarify this point to avoid misleading readers. The authors need to be concise about the literature.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.44474.027</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) A major weakness of the study is with the biological significance of the findings.

Given the limited availability of a fungal pathosystem to address stomatal infecting fungi in Arabidopsis, we utilized resistance to <italic>Botrytis cinerea</italic> in whole leaves to show a role of SLAH3 in immunity. We agree that it is an important point to ask whether SLAH3 generally compromises immune defences in response to chitin. We now provide two lines of evidences that SLAH3 is not compromised in prototypic PTI responses: Firstly, chitin induces a wild type-like ROS burst in <italic>slah3</italic> mutants. This shows that both impaired stomatal closure and resistance to <italic>B. cinerea</italic> is not a result of possible altered ROS production. Secondly, chitin induces wild-type like ethylene production in <italic>slah3</italic>. Because ethylene production is downstream of MAPK activation (Liu and Zhang, 2004), it suggests that impaired stomatal closure and anti-fungal immunity in <italic>slah3</italic> are not primarily affected at the level of MAPK activation. We also tested chitin-induced ROS and resistance to <italic>B. cinerea</italic> in <italic>pbl27</italic>, which were wild type-like. We therefore exclude the possibility that altered ROS production could impair stomatal closure in <italic>pbl27</italic>. We speculate that <italic>pbl27</italic> shows wild type-like resistance to <italic>B. cinerea</italic>, because of functional redundancy with PBL1, since we found that this RLCK also activates SLAH3. We have included this information in new Figure 5 and Figure 3—figure supplement 1C, and have made respective changes in the text.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) It is puzzling that S189A confers constitutive active channel activity, but the transgenic plants display a constitutive open stomata phenotype.

Please clarify.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that auto-active SLAH3 S189A could be expected to trigger continual stomatal closure.</p><p>However, finding that CERK1 amplified PBL27-mediated SLAH3 activation depending on S189A inspired our discussion of PBL27 as a positive regulator. To better describe this, we have modified the text and now state:</p><p>“The observation that plants expressing the S189A variant were impaired in stomatal closure is in apparent contrast with its auto-activity (Figure 3F). […] However, although CIPK23/CBL1 were unable to increase SLAH3 opening beyond the level of its autoactivation (Figure 3—figure supplement 3B), we cannot exclude the possibility that the auto-activation of SLAH3-S189A in oocytes hints at a structurally important role in SLAH3 function that is not only specific to the activation of PBL27 by CERK1.”</p><p>“In such a model, chitin binding activates the LYK5-CERK1 receptors, inducing autophosphorylation and <italic>trans</italic>-phosphorylation events [Nour-Eldin et al., 2006], which result in the phosphorylation and activation of PBL27 [Shinya et al., 2014]. […] The importance of both phospho-sites is supported by the finding that SLAH3 auto-activation by phosphomimicry required the combination of S127D and S189D (Figure 3E).”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) In all BiFC and current experiments, protein levels need to be shown to rule out the possibility that the lack of protein-protein interaction or current is caused by low levels of protein.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that it is important to show protein accumulation in order to draw conclusions. For BiFC experiments, all constructs used showed at least in one of the tested interactions a positive signal. This shows that the constructs are generally expressed in the conditions used. Lacking a combination that would show a positive interaction with SLAC1, we replaced PBL27-YFPc + SLAC1-YFPn with PBL27-YFPc + YFPn-RBOHD. This revealed no BiFC signal, which is also interesting in light of PBL27 and a possible role in ROS burst. For current experiments, we used in all cases but one (SLAC1-YFPc and OST1-YFPn to promote interaction) untagged constructs. This was motivated to avoid possible interferences on current generation caused by the tag. Importantly, we directly injected the constructs in the form of cRNA, as <italic>Xenopus oocytes</italic> very efficiently translate cRNAs (Tammaro et al., 2008). This information is included in the text.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) It is not known whether SLAH3 is phosphorylated in vivo upon chitin treatment. The authors are advised to perform phos-tag or other assays to shown this is indeed the case. If so, it is then necessary to show whether S127 and S189 are major phosphosites in vivo and whether this chitin-induced phosphorylation requires PBL27.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for your suggestion. We agree that it is important to show whether SLAH3 is phosphorylated in vivo. Using immunoprecipitation from SLAH3-FLAG transgenic plant (Figure 4—figure supplement 1) and Phos-tag SDS, we detected a band shift of SLAH3-FLAG in response to chitin, which was sensitive to phosphatase treatment. This suggests that chitin induces SLAH3 phosphorylation in vivo. We have included this information in new Figure 2E and have made respective changes in the text.</p><p>Unfortunately, our attempts to show differences in SLAH3 phosphorylation using</p><p>immunoprecipitation of FLAG-tagged SLAH3-S127A and SLAH3-S189A from respective transgenic plants (Figure 4—figure supplement 1) were not successful. We believe that the resolution of Phos-tag SDS is too small to detect such differences at individual residues.</p><p>Having no SLAH3-FLAG transgenic line in the <italic>pbl27</italic> mutant background, we attempted transient expression of the tagged channel in protoplasts from <italic>pbl27</italic>. However, expression levels of SLAH3FLAG from transfected protoplasts in both wild type and <italic>pbl27</italic> were very low and not sufficient to reveal a phosphorylated band of SLAH3-FLAG using Phos-tag SDS.</p><p>However, having shown that:</p><p>- chitin-induces SLAH3 phosphorylation in vivo (Figure 2E),</p><p>- PBL27 promoting phosphorylation of the SLAH3 N-ter in a chitin-dependent manner using an in vivo<italic>-</italic>in vitro approach (Figure 2D),</p><p>- PBL27 phosphorylating the SLAH3 N-ter at S127, S189 and S601 in vitro (Figure 2C),</p><p>- PBL27 mediating SLAH3 activation depending on S127 in a heterologous system (Figure 3F),</p><p>- PBL27 kinase dead version does not activate SLAH3 in a heterologous system (Figure 3B),</p><p>- PBL27 mediating CERK1-dependent amplification of SLAH3 requiring S189 in a heterologous system (Figure 3G),</p><p>- SLAH3-S127A and SLAH3-S189A compromising chitin-induced stomatal closure and resistance to fungal infection in planta (Figures 4B, 4C, 5A),</p><p>it would be consistent to conclude that S127 and S189 are major phospho-sites targeted by PBL27 in chitin signalling.</p><p>We appreciate that this does not address concerns over the functional redundancy in the VII subfamily (Rao et al., 2018). We therefore explored additional members of the subgroups VII-4 (PBL19 and PBL39) and VII-8 (PBL1 in addition to BIK1) for their potential to activate SLAH3. Only PBL1, which is associated with FLS2 and PEPR1/2 signalling, conferred SLAH3 activation. This suggests that some of the other PBLs with roles in chitin signalling are not involved in SLAH3 activation (Rao et al., 2018). Moreover, it suggest that PBL1 could mediate SLAH3 activation i.e. in the context of stomatal closure to flagellin and danger trigger (Guzel Deger et al., 2015) (Zheng et al., 2018). We have included this information in new Figure 3—figure supplement 1C and have made respective changes in the text.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) In Introduction, Results, and Discussion, the authors cite that PBL27 is a major component in chitin signaling.

We consolidated our information on PBL27 and other RLCKs with roles in chitin signalling and immunity throughout the text. To better alert the readership about findings related to chitosan, we made revisions in the text and also included data showing that chitosan induces stomatal closure in Arabidopsis, which was partially depending on SLAH3. We have included this information in new Figure 1—figure supplement 2 and have made respective changes in the text.</p></body></sub-article></article>
