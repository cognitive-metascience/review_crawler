differentiation and has emerged as a promising therapeutic target for autoimmune disorders and cancer. However, divergence in function between the iP and the constitutive proteasome (cP) has been unclear. A global peptide library-based screening strategy revealed that the proteasomes have overlapping but distinct substrate specificities. Differing iP specificity alters the quantity of production of certain MHC I epitopes but does not appear to be preferentially suited for antigen presentation. Furthermore, iP specificity was found to have likely arisen through genetic drift from the ancestral cP. Specificity differences were exploited to develop isoform-selective substrates. Cellular profiling using these substrates revealed that divergence in regulation of the iP balances its relative contribution to proteasome capacity in immune cells, resulting in selective recovery from inhibition. These findings have implications for iP-targeted therapeutic development.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>proteasome</kwd><kwd>immunoproteasome</kwd><kwd>antigen presentation</kwd><kwd>proteostasis</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>None</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>F32CA168150</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Winter</surname><given-names>Michael B</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100008069</institution-id><institution>University of California, San Francisco</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Program for Breakthrough Biomedical Research</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Winter</surname><given-names>Michael B</given-names></name><name><surname>Ravalin</surname><given-names>Matthew</given-names></name><name><surname>Craik</surname><given-names>Charles S</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100008069</institution-id><institution>University of California, San Francisco</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Enabling Technologies Advisory Committee</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Winter</surname><given-names>Michael B</given-names></name><name><surname>Ravalin</surname><given-names>Matthew</given-names></name><name><surname>Craik</surname><given-names>Charles S</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R21CA186077</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Sali</surname><given-names>Andrej</given-names></name><name><surname>Craik</surname><given-names>Charles S</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R21AI133393</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>O'Donoghue</surname><given-names>Anthony J</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>P41CA196276</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Craik</surname><given-names>Charles S</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Divergence in immunoproteasome substrate specificity and regulation from the constitutive proteasome impacts peptide cleavage quantity and the cellular capacity of the ubiquitin-proteasome system.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Mammalian proteasomes are complexes with multiple protease active sites that carry out the regulated degradation of proteins, mediating processes such as the clearance of mutated or misfolded proteins, cell signaling, and antigen presentation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Kisselev et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Stadtmueller and Hill, 2011</xref>). The 20S proteasome core particle is a barrel-shaped structure composed of four stacked heptameric rings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Tomko and Hochstrasser, 2013</xref>). The two outer rings, containing the α-subunits, act as binding sites for regulatory complexes (e.g., 19S, 11S, and PA200 families) that stimulate its peptidase activity and modulate access of cytosolic proteins into the proteasome inner chamber (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Stadtmueller and Hill, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Tomko and Hochstrasser, 2013</xref>). The two inner rings contain the β-subunits, three of which (β1, β2, and β5) have an active site containing a catalytic threonine residue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Tomko and Hochstrasser, 2013</xref>). These catalytic subunits have been traditionally referred to as &quot;caspase-,” &quot;trypsin-,” and &quot;chymotrypsin-like&quot; (CT-L), respectively, based on their general substrate specificity preferences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Kisselev et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>In addition to the constitutive proteasome (cP), which is expressed in all cell types, an immunoproteasome (iP) isoform is predominantly expressed in cells of hematopoietic origin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">McCarthy and Weinberg, 2015</xref>). The overall architecture of the iP and cP core particles is identical; however, the iP contains different catalytic subunits – referred to as LMP2 (iβ1), MECL-1 (iβ2), and LMP7 (iβ5) – that share respectively 62%, 59%, and 71% sequence identity with their cP counterparts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Ferrington and Gregerson, 2012</xref>). Expression of all immuno catalytic subunits, along with the 11S-type activator PA28, is upregulated by pro-inflammatory signals, such as IFN-γ, during the immune response. Mapping of the LMP2 (<italic>PSMB9</italic>) and LMP7 (<italic>PSMB8</italic>) genes to the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) locus combined with interferon-induced activation first led to the proposal that the iP carries out a specialized role in generating peptides for MHC class I antigen presentation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Ferrington and Gregerson, 2012</xref>). Furthermore, early biochemical evidence suggested that the iP catalytic subunits show an enhanced ability to generate peptides with specific C-terminal residues that may better match the terminal (anchor) amino acid residue preferences of MHC I molecules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Gaczynska et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Driscoll et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Gaczynska et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Cardozo and Kohanski, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Toes et al., 2001</xref>). More recently, it was found that mice completely lacking in iP catalytic subunits display an antigen repertoire that differed from wild-type mice and resulted in transplant rejection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kincaid et al., 2011</xref>). These findings have suggested a possible role for iP cleavage specificity in shaping the immune response.</p><p>Inhibition of proteasome CT-L activity was initially pursued as a therapeutic strategy for the treatment of cancers with highly proliferative and proteasome-dependent cells; however, current FDA-approved proteasome inhibitors lack selectivity between the cP and iP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Kisselev et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Adams, 2004</xref>). Bortezomib (Velcade), a reversible boronic acid-based inhibitor, provided clinical validation of proteasome inhibition in multiple myeloma (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Richardson et al., 2003</xref>). The second-generation proteasome inhibitor, carfilzomib (CFZ; Kyprolis or PR-171), which also targets the CT-L subunits, uses an irreversible epoxyketone warhead and shows reduced off-target inhibition, while circumventing resistance against bortezomib (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Arastu-Kapur et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Siegel et al., 2012</xref>). Recently, considerable effort has been dedicated toward the development of iP-selective inhibitors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Johnson et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Dubiella et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Sosič et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Muchamuel et al., 2009</xref>) in the interest of selectively targeting iP-dominant cells for the treatment of autoimmune disorders and certain cancers. In particular, the epoxyketone inhibitor, ONX 0914 (PR-957), which preferentially inhibits the LMP7 subunit, was able to block cytokine production and attenuate disease progression in a rheumatoid arthritis mouse model at a significantly lower dose than bortezomib or CFZ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Muchamuel et al., 2009</xref>). In addition, ONX 0914 has showed promise for the treatment of lupus and multiple sclerosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Ichikawa et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Basler et al., 2014</xref>) and for inflammation-associated colorectal cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Koerner et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Vachharajani et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>Although the iP has emerged as a promising therapeutic target, it is not well understood how its functions diverge from those of the cP, which is often found within the same cell. Here, we applied a recently-developed peptide library-based profiling strategy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">O'Donoghue et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">O'Donoghue et al., 2015</xref>) to define the substrate specificities of each proteasome in a global and an unbiased manner. This analysis revealed that the iP and cP have overlapping substrate specificities, with some significant differences. These differences were exploited to rationally design LMP7- and β5-selective fluorogenic peptide substrates for the cellular profiling of each proteasome. The global substrate specificities of the iP and cP were then compared to MHC I peptides and further queried experimentally using a synthetic peptide library designed from amino acid sequences flanking MHC I peptide-processing sites. This analysis suggested that the specificity of the iP may alter the extent of display of certain MHC I peptides but does not appear to be preferentially suited for MHC I epitope generation. Furthermore, an evolutionary analysis suggested that divergent iP substrate specificity is due to genetic drift from the cP. Finally, the iP- and cP-selective fluorogenic substrates were used to probe the contribution of the iP to ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS) capacity in immune cells and assess proteasome recovery (or ‘bounce-back’) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Radhakrishnan et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Sha and Goldberg, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Radhakrishnan et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Weyburne et al., 2017</xref>) from iP-selective inhibitor treatment. Our results suggest that divergence in iP substrate specificity primarily impacts the content of the immune repetoire by altering the quantity of production of certain epitopes and that divergence in iP regulation balances the contribution of each proteasome to the total UPS capacity.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Global substrate specificity screen of the iP and cP</title><p>To provide biochemical insight into the substrate specificities of the iP and cP, we performed a global substrate screening approach referred to as Multiplex Substrate Profiling by Mass Spectrometry (MSP-MS) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">O'Donoghue et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">O'Donoghue et al., 2015</xref>). The MSP-MS assay uses an equimolar mixture of 228 rationally-designed, 14-mer peptide substrates and provides an unbiased assessment of protease substrate specificity. The iP or cP was added to the peptide library and peptide cleavage products were identified after 60, 120, 240, and 480 min of incubation through liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). Only cleavage sites found in two biological replicates of each proteasome are reported. The proteasomes were found to have broad substrate specificity, being capable of hydrolyzing 391 (iP) and 330 (cP) different peptide bonds after 480 min of incubation; this corresponds to 13.2% and 11.1% of the total cleavage sites in the library for the iP and cP, respectively. Saturation of new cleavage-site usage was evident by the 480 min assay time point (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>), reflecting depletion of the most favored cleavage sites in the library, and the ability of the MSP-MS assay to readily detect the most dominant cleavage events, as described in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.27364.002</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Global substrate specificity profiling of the iP and cP with Multiplex Substrate Profiling by Mass Spectrometry (MSP-MS) reveals shared and differential substrate specificity features.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) iceLogo representations of iP and cP substrate specificity (P4–P4ʹ) at the 480 min assay time point (p≤0.05 for non-grayed residues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Colaert et al., 2009</xref>); ‘n’ is norleucine).

Specificity is dominated by non-prime-side residues, in particular the P1 position, with a shared enrichment of extended hydrophobic residues at P1, P3 and P4 as well as lysine at P2. The preferred specificity for hydrophobic residues and arginine in the P1 position suggest that the CT-L subunits (β5 and LMP7) and trypsin-like subunits (β2 and MECL-1) cleave many more peptide bonds than the β1 and LMP2 subunits of the cP and iP, respectively.

To expand the scope of our analysis, we sought to address the extent to which the substrate specificities of the iP and cP shape the repertoire of peptides displayed during MHC class I antigen presentation. Using the substrate specificity profiles from the MSP-MS assay, we initially applied a bioinformatic approach to score MHC I peptides based on their relative propensity for cleavage by either proteasome (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>). Peptide scoring was performed using a recently reported large proteomic dataset of MHC I peptides (<italic>n</italic> = 22,598) that were displayed by allelic-diverse MHC I complexes in multiple human cell lines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bassani-Sternberg et al., 2015</xref>). In this dataset, the most frequently occurring C-terminal amino acid residues were the long-chain residues leucine (27.6%), lysine (19.1%), and tyrosine (10.8%). In our specificity differentiation profiles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref>), the iP and cP had an overall similar preference for cleavage on the C-terminal side (P1 position) of these residues, particularly lysine, which indicates that many MHC I peptides have a similar potential of being generated by either proteasome (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>). Peptides with C-terminal tryptophan are much more likely to be generated by the iP relative to the cP but were observed in only 0.30% of MHC I peptides. Similarly, peptides with smaller and polar C-terminal residues are more likely to be generated by the cP and were also less frequently observed (e.g., 6.0% for alanine and less than 0.4% for serine, threonine, and other cP-favored amino acids). Notably, comparison of MHC I C-terminal amino acid residue distribution to the human proteome revealed de-enrichment of these preferential P1 residues (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>), suggesting that their propensity for display by MHC I molecules might be reduced compared to residues that are similarly preferred by both proteasomes.</p><p>To provide an experimental measure of iP and cP cleavage selectivity for MHC I peptides, we constructed a synthetic peptide library consisting of the 7 amino acid residues flanking sites of MHC I processing, using sequences selected at random from the proteomic data set. The peptides in the library were pooled at equimolar concentration and incubated with the iP or cP. Peptide cleavage products were identified over time using LC-MS/MS, and label-free quantitation was used to calculate relative rates of peptide hydrolysis (between positions 7 and 8 at the MHC I site). In agreement with our bioinformatic approach, the proteasomes hydrolyzed most peptides at a similar rate (≤2 fold difference) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). However, several peptides were clearly favored by either the cP or iP with up to 12-fold and 15-fold selectivity, respectively. Among the majority of cleavages with P1 specificity for hydrophobic residues, the sequences HTQVIEL^ERKFSHQ and VSEGTHF^LETIETP displayed the greatest cP and iP selectivity, respectively. As expected, the peptide substrate containing a P1 tryptophan, KNTFPKW^KPGSLAS, was preferentially cleaved by the iP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). Taken together, our bioinformatic and substrate profiling approaches revealed that the majority of MHC I peptides have a similar potential for being generated by either proteasome. Differing iP specificity appears to impact the content of the MHC I repertoire primarily by altering the quantity of production of certain epitopes. We note that this outcome appears to be only partly explained by the differential preference of the iP for certain P1 residues.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig4" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.27364.017</object-id><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><title>Differential substrate specificity of the iP alters MHC I peptide cleavage and is likely due to neutral evolution from the ancestral cP.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Label-free quantitation of relative iP and cP cleavage rates against a library of synthetic peptides derived from sequences flanking sites of MHC I peptide processing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bassani-Sternberg et al., 2015</xref>).

Our global and unbiased peptide library-based strategy (MSP-MS) revealed that the iP and cP have overall similar substrate specificities but that certain cleavage preferences exist for each proteasome. The iP displays a particularly increased preference for cleavage following certain bulky hydrophobic amino acid residues such as tryptophan, whereas the cP displays a greater preference for cleavage following smaller and polar amino acid residues. Indeed, supporting crystallographic evidence suggests that LMP7 has a larger S1 pocket than β5 due to a Met45 conformation that allows for greater access to the binding pocket (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Huber et al., 2012</xref>). Differences may exist in profiling peptide versus protein-based substrates (as well as between biochemical and cellular contexts); however, our peptide library-based approach has a key advantage of affording chemically defined substrates with uniform amino acid distribution. The differences in P1 specificity discovered combined with additional non-prime-side specificity determinants were exploited to develop LMP7- and β5-selective fluorogenic substrates for monitoring the activity of each proteasome under cellular conditions. Compared to activity-based probes, fluorogenic substrates have the advantage of enzymatic signal amplification and enabling a continuous assay readout. In contrast, activity-based probes afford direct subunit labeling for downstream biochemical or cellular applications and are a more direct template for inhibitor development. We envision that the global substrate specificity features identified in this study will aid in next-generation isoform-selective probe and inhibitor design and improve the prediction of endogenous cleavage-site preferences.</p><p>Degradation of protein substrates by the proteasome generates the pool of peptides made available for display to cytotoxic CD8+ T cells during the MHC I antigen presentation pathway. Proteasomal cleavage preferences are reflected in the C-terminal specificity of MHC I peptides, although additional peptide selection steps further shape the MHC I peptide repertoire, including trafficking into the ER through TAP (transporter associated with antigen processing), binding to allelic-diverse MHC I molecules, and N-terminal trimming by ER-resident aminopeptidases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Rock et al., 2004</xref>). Initial biochemical studies following the discovery of the iP subunits led to the long-held suggestion that the specificity of the iP is better suited for the generation of peptides for display by MHC I molecules. However, these studies relied on querying limited sets of peptide substrates and inhibitors or on the degradation of model protein substrates. They provided, at times, conflicting evidence that the iP has an increased preference for cleavage following certain basic (arginine), aromatic (phenylalanine and tyrosine), or branched chain amino acids (leucine, valine, and isoleucine) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Gaczynska et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Driscoll et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Gaczynska et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Cardozo and Kohanski, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Toes et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Boes et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Eleuteri et al., 1997</xref>).

We further queried iP and cP cleavage preferences using a synthetic peptide library that mimics the protein sequences from which these MHC I peptides are derived. This analysis suggested that the majority of MHC I peptides have a similar potential to be generated by either the iP or cP (within a 2-fold difference in cleavage rate). We also show that preferred substrates exist for each proteasome isoform; however, iP specificity differences may primarily alter the extent of display of these epitopes. This appears to only partially result from the increased preference of the iP for specific P1 residues. For example, tryptophan was found to be the most iP-selective P1 amino acid residue but de-enriched at the C-terminal position of displayed MHC I peptides compared to its natural abundance in the human proteome.</p><p>Recent evidence suggests that the iP and cP have comparable protein-level selectivity because they bind ubiquitin conjugates similarly and degrade ubiquitinated proteins at similar rates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Nathan et al., 2013</xref>). In the absence of differences in upstream protein-level selectivity, divergence in iP and cP cleavage preference likely shapes the amount of certain epitopes available for antigen presentation, in combination with basal or conditional (e.g., interferon-induced) differences in proteome composition and the relative activity levels of each proteasome in a given cell. The significant overlap in iP and cP cleavage specificity reported here is consistent with the immune repertoire identified from the splenocytes of iP knockout mice. This repertoire differed from that of wild-type mice by only 50 percent, and furthermore, only certain viral epitopes exhibited an appreciable reduction in display during viral infection in this model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kincaid et al., 2011</xref>). These findings have supported the suggestion that the ‘quantity’ of substrate cleavage, as opposed to strong ‘qualitative’ differences in specificity, (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Mishto et al., 2014</xref>) impacts the contribution of each proteasome to the MHC I peptide content.</p><p>In addition to differential production of certain peptides for antigen presentation, we have shown that iP activity contributes to basal UPS capacity and undergoes a selective recovery response to counter a critical loss in protein load. Irreversible inhibition of LMP7 in immune cells results in selective recovery of LMP7 activity, which is correlated with transcriptional up-regulation of <italic>PSMB8</italic>. However, in immune cells with predominant iP activity, inhibition of LMP7 results in clear compensatory induction of <italic>PSMB5</italic> in the absence of an appreciable change in β5 activity, suggesting that regulation of cP stability, assembly, and/or activation ultimately serves to maintain homeostatic iP and cP activity levels. The transcription factor Nrf1 is well known to mediate production of new cP subunits as a stress recovery response to cP inhibition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Radhakrishnan et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Sha and Goldberg, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Radhakrishnan et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Weyburne et al., 2017</xref>). In our study, Nrf1 activation is correlated with production of <italic>PSMB5</italic> following inhibition of the iP.

We have shown that the iP and cP have overlapping substrate specificities as well as distinct cleavage preferences. In addition, both proteasomes are controlled through distinct yet interconnected mechanisms of regulation. Divergence in regulation balances the relative contribution of each proteasome to basal cellular capacity and in addition, enables induction of the iP during an immune response. Thus, relative cellular capacity and differences in cleavage efficiency for certain peptides likely contribute to iP-specialized roles in signaling and epitope presentation.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Biological reagents</title><p>Purified human immunoproteasome core particle (i20S) (cat.

Your article has been reviewed by two peer reviewers (reviewers 2 and 3), and the evaluation has been overseen by a Guest Reviewing Editor and Michael Marletta as the Senior Editor. The following individuals involved in review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Peter M Kloetzel (Reviewer #1); Herman Overkleeft (Reviewer #2).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Guest Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>The manuscript is in principle within the scope of <italic>eLife</italic>'s interest/mission. Both reviewers raise valid points, so rather than try to condense these two reviews, I suggest that the authors be given access to the full reviews and be given the opportunity to submit a properly revised version within the time line customarily allotted by <italic>eLife</italic>. I look forward to seeing a revised manuscript.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic> </p><p>Winter et al., have analysed the differences in cleavage properties of standard and immunoproteasome and they rightly state that these differences still are not fully understood. It has been previously shown that both isoforms in principle have the ability to cleave behind any of the 20 aa residues but that sP and iP depending on the substrate reveal differences in relative cleavage site usage. Based on peptide library based profiling Winter et al. now conclude that sP and iP exhibit overlapping but distinct substrate specificities. The authors also designed novel isoform selective substrates and confirm previous studies by showing that iP function affects proteostasis in cells predominantly expressing iP.</p><p>This reviewer appreciates this multi-disciplinary study to improve our knowledge and to eventually confute former models. The paper however raises a number of concerns with regard to the experiments and the conclusions drawn as will be outlined in detail below.</p><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>.</p><p>The authors use a rationally designed peptide library comprising 228 14mer peptides to test their degradation by sP or iP. However, this multi-substrate approach and the data deduced raise a number of question and important information is lacking.</p><p>In order to be able to reproduce the experiments one has to know:a) what are the sequences of the peptides in the library?b) what was the rationale behind the design of the peptide library?</p><p>Given that the proteasomes can cleave behind any given residue the percentages of cleavage sites identified (18.4% and 21.3% of 2964 potential cleavage sites) seems to be very low and questions the overall sensitivity of the assays. It is well known that different substrates will be degraded with different efficiencies by either sP or iP. However, such differences will strongly influence the validation of cleavage site usage unless the cleavage site usage is not corrected for max/2 turnover of the substrate. Importantly, proteasomes are known to cut less efficiently and also slowly within short peptides. Dolenc et al. (FEBS Lett 1998) identified a length of 13 residues as lower limit to have an efficient degradation rate. Since the MSP-MS method uses 14mers, this reviewer thinks that it is mandatory to repeat the MSP-MS assay with much longer kinetics than 60 min (2,4,6,8 hours).</p><p>The authors neither report on the number of experiments performed to generate the data shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> nor on the reproducibility or the overlap between different experiments.</p><p>Assuming that technical replicates of the MS analysis and biological replicates (proteasome digestions) were performed, it will be very important to know the number of unique cleavage sites between:</p><p>- technical replicates;</p><p>- biological replicates;</p><p>- biological replicates performed at different time points using either sP or iP. The latter is a particular relevant control. I suppose that the alleged unique cleavage sites reported in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref> will not be confirmed by performing the assays with longer time-point. (Also see comment to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>).</p><p>I am also intrigued by the fact that the authors identified 217 cleavage sites being specific for sP. However, as stated in Materials and methods the commercial PBMC derived iP contains between 10% and 48% standard subunits. How can it be that such mixed-type proteasomes cannot cleave at all at sites used by the sP?</p><p>Performing and showing the outcomes of the requested controls will help to understand whether sP and iP really have such a large number of unique cleavage sites (348 of 762 cleavage sites identified). Using longer kinetics will most likely dramatically reduce this number. Even in case that there are only very few differences this would not affect the relevance of the study but will modify one of the main take home messages of the study.</p><p>I would also suggest to add a supplementary figure comparing the outcome of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>, with those of Toes et al., JEM 2001 and Mishto et al., EurJI 2014 to better understand differences and similarities.</p><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>.</p><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A and 2B</xref> may serve the purpose of the idea but are not very informative. It is not clear how the experiment was performed. Were these peptides individually processed by either sP or iP and if so, what were the conditions. Are these peptides equally well degraded by both isoforms; are these all the cleavage sites detected by MS?</p><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>.</p><p>There seems to be an editorial error for the km value of EWFW-ACC for i20S. It probably should read 1.8 μm instead 7.0 uM.</p><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>.</p><p>It is somewhat surprising that independent of the sP/iP ratio the activity measured with the commonly used substrate Suc-LLVY-AMC remained unchanged. This certainly stands in contrast to several reports by Gaczynska and coworkers (cited) as well as by many others.</p><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>.</p><p>I do not really understand why the authors state that iP clearly expands the MHC-I repertoire when the authors don´t find proteasome isoform specific cleavage sites which generate the tested epitopes. As documented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref> the most sP preferred epitope HTQVIEL&gt;ERKFSHQ is also generated by iP, albeit less efficiently. Similarly, the most iP favoured epitope is also generated by sP. My interpretation of the data shown is that there are epitopes which are more efficiently generated by either sP or iP which consequently will affect their presentation at the cell surface. (in this context see Zanker, D., Waithman, J., Yewdell, J. W. and Chen, W.. J. Immunol. 2013. 191: 52-59.)</p><p>In part the experiments shown also answer my concerns expressed for the data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>. Here, in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref> the authors have performed longer kinetics as requested above and conclude that many peptides have an equivalent potential of being generated by either proteasome isoform. Even the tryptophan-cleavage site, although preferred by iP is shown to be used by sP as well, albeit less efficiently (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>).</p><p>This reviewer has some concerns regarding the label-free quantification of the peptides. It is well known that the MS ion signal strongly varies between peptides of different sequence. This is irrelevant with a dataset of thousands of peptides but render not applicable the label-free strategy to quantify a small number of short peptides (Bassani-Sternberg et al., MCP 2015; Liepe et al., Science 2016; Tenzer et al., Nat Immunol 2009).</p><p>In Materials and methods it is stated that 89 epitope derived peptides were analysed but only slightly more the 50 are documented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref> (please explain).</p><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>.</p><p>The authors show that in cells mostly expressing iP, selective inhibition of LMP7 results in an accumulation of ub-conjugates. They infer from these results that iP activity makes a significant contribution to UPS capacity. This conclusion is in agreement with previously published data Seifert et al. Cell (2010), which I would suggest to cite in this context. That inhibition of the beta5 site doesn´t evoke similar effects is most likely due to the small amounts of sP present in these samples.</p><p>The authors observe a bounce back of LMP7 activity after irreversible inhibition of LMP7 as well as upregulation of both PSMB8 and PSMB5 mRNAs during the recovery phase. This is a well-known phenomenon. That PSMB5 mRNAs has little impact on β 5 activity is also to be expected because in the presence of both β 5 and LMP7 units, incorporation of LMP7 is dominant due its higher binding affinity for the proteasome maturation protein POMP.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic> </p><p>As I see it this paper consists of two parts that are interconnected by the use of the fluorogenic beta5c/beta5i substrates developed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">3</xref> to link iCP activity, set off against cCP activity, in global proteasomal proteolysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>) and MHCI ligand production (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). These two (or three) sections feel somewhat disconnected to me and the main aim: to establish substrate preferences of the various proteasomal activities and to connect these to cellular processes has not been reached to satisfaction. Despite this, the workflow to identify substrate preferences and to derive two new and considerably beta5c and beta5i-selective substrates – the part of the work I am able to judge best – is executed very well and the resulting reagents should be of considerable interest to the research community. I have a few points that may need clarification:</p><p>Different proteasome preparations are being used in the various assays: sometimes SDS-activated and sometimes PA28-activated. To what extent are these methods providing similarly activated proteasomes?</p><p>Peptides, rather than (unfolded) proteins are being used to establish cleavage preferences. To what extent are peptides suitable protein substitutes? what about concentration, reaction times, other factors that may be different in cells?</p><p>Why only beta5c/beta5i?</p><p>Are ONX0914 and PR825 – developed for murine proteasomes, equally selective against their respective human proteasome targets (given that recent literature point towards differences in the active sites of especially the chymotryptic sites from these two species)?</p><p>Why, in designing selective fluorogenic substrates, not considering non-proteinogenic amino acids, also in view of the literature on likewise-designed inhibitors?</p><p>In using the substrates in mixtures containing both proteasome species: how to correct for minor processing of the 'unwanted' proteasome (since the reagents are not truly selective?)</p><p>Next top cP and iP species mixed proteasomes exist and that may have other substrate preferences: how does the work take the possible existence of such species into account?</p><p>Presentation of the work, I would favour some chemical structures, possibly also a chemical scheme (even though the methodology to synthesise the compounds has been published from the same group some time ago). In general I find the manuscript hard to get into, with lots of abbreviations.</p><p>A survey of the pros and cons of fluorogenic substrates in comparison with other methodology (activity-based protein profiling, the Procise assay) would be helpful.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were requested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for resubmitting your work entitled &quot;Immunoproteasome Functions Explained by Divergence in Cleavage Specificity and Regulation&quot; for further consideration at <italic>eLife</italic>. Your revised article has been favorably evaluated by Michael Marletta as the Senior and Reviewing Editor, and one reviewer.</p><p>The manuscript has been improved but there are some remaining issues that need to be addressed before acceptance, as outlined below.</p><p>We try hard to avoid requiring more experiments after one round of revision. I ask that you consider the points raised below and send a response to me before initiating a new round experiments (the replicates referred to below).</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic> </p><p>I appreciate the additional work by Winter et al. Their efforts certainly improved the manuscript. In particular, the kinetics experiments and the biological replicates of the MSP-MS assays give now a clearer picture of the results and the potency of the method.</p><p>Having said this, there still remain some points which in my mind cast doubt onto the robustness of some the experiments.</p><p>The authors show that:a) they have a 70% reproducibility of technical replicate at 8 h digestion (they show it only for immunoproteasome and at 8h, though);b) they have around 70% reproducibility of biological replicate at 8 h digestion (as far as I get from <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>);c) there is a strong increase of the number of cleavage-sites identified over time;d) they have 19.5% cleavage sites identified only in cP digestions although their iP has 10-48% cP subunits. How can it be that a cP-iP mixed population doesn't use all cleavage-sites used by cP?e) After 8 h, 11-13% of the cleavage-sites have been used by proteasomes.</p><p>Comment: The surprisingly low number of cleavage sites identified is not compatible with the extent of cleavage site usage published in the literature and also the fact that proteasomes cleave more or less behind any amino acid. When single polypeptide substrates are analysed a cleavage site coverage of &gt;60% is the rule.</p><p>I raised the issue of the sensitivity of the MSP-MS before. In the point by point review this issue is however only partially addressed. I now see the rationale behind the design of the library, but considering the cleavage site coverage in the experiments I start to wonder whether what works perfectly for conventional proteases also will work for the proteasome with extremely little cleavage site specificity. (This does not imply that proteasomes don´t have cleavage site preferences).</p><p>The authors propose that the MSP-MS method represents an improvement for understanding the proteasome dynamics. Despite all the work published in the past two decades, understanding proteasome dynamics still is an important issue. Because of this, the authors should try to give a robust answer to the question they raised: does iP differ from cP in terms of cleavage-site usage? Is the truth close to &quot;only quantitative differences&quot; as stated by a few or close to &quot;strong qualitative differences&quot; as published by others?</p><p>The authors rephrased several parts of the text to satisfy both hypotheses. They would have, however, the opportunity to provide strong evidence supporting one of the two hypotheses. Such an answer would be a significant improvement in the field and certainly worth publishing.</p><p>To this end, the authors ought to strengthen their MS analysis. Here I have some suggestions:</p><p>a) The authors should perform more technical replicates than 2 (5 are sufficient in our set up), considering the reproducibility that they have.</p><p>b) They should add the new peptides identified in each replicate to the final list of identified peptides (and thus cleavage-sites used), instead of focusing only on the common peptide products. Because if only the common peptide products (and cleavage-sites) are true, it means that the authors have an experimental FDR =30%. Clearly too high to say anything about differences between cP and iP.</p><p>For example, in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>—figure supplement.1B I see 101 cleavage-sites used by cP and 134 by iP after 1h. In the first submitted <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>, they had 631 cleavage-sites for cP and 545 for iP. What did happen to the others? I guess the discrepancy is due to the new data analysis used. In fact, even considering the cleavage-sites identified in only one of the biological replicates, in the new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref>, after 1 h digestion, I see around 220 cleavage-sites identified in cP and 250 in iP.</p><p>I suggest, that the authors should try to increase the coverage of the peptide products. Considering only the products common to the replicates the authors likely analyse only the most abundant peptide products. Therefore, my question is, do the authors want to study only the most frequently used cleavage-sites (top 10 I would say since they identified only 11-13% of the cleavage-sites) or all cleavage-sites used by proteasome? If the intention is to focus on the top ten only, they should re-phrase the entire manuscript.</p><p>With 5 technical replicates, they could have a better view of the cleavage-site usages by proteasome isoforms. And I guess they will also increase the number of cleavage-sites used by proteasome since 11-13% is really not compatible with proteasomes cleaving after almost any amino acid (see also above).</p><p>c) The authors may perform longer digestions. In their experiments, the authors see a decline in the number of newly identified cleavage-sites over time. However, this could also be due to inhibitory effects of the products on proteasome activity (see Liepe et al., <italic>eLife</italic> 2015). To minimize this problem, the authors could (should) also increase the concentration of proteasome.</p><p>Everything that it is useful to identify at least 40-50% of the potential cleavage sites or at least reaching a plateau in terms of cleavage-sites used by proteasome. Otherwise the authors are watching only the tip of the iceberg.</p><p>d) Concerning the MS analysis, FDR=0.05 is not conservative. The other parameters (Materials and methods) should be better clarified without referring to other studies.</p><p>I wonder if the analysis of the MHC-I peptides using the outcome of the MSP-MS would be different using a more sensitive approach and if it would show differences between cP and iP.</p><p>e) The authors added the statement: &quot;Proteasomes from different biological replicates were normalized based on activity against the fluorogenic substrate Suc-LLVY-AMC (Anaspec, AS-63892)&quot;.</p><p>It is generally accepted that the hydrolytic activity measured with short fluorogenic substrates such as Suc-LLVY-AMC may have very little to do with the ability of proteasomes to degrade larger polypeptide substrates. Identical peptide hydrolysing activities or adjustment of the amounts of proteasomes to obtain identical activities is by no way a reliable method if one wants to study the processing of polypeptides by different proteasome subtypes or by different commercially available proteasome charges.</p><p>As pointed out in my first review in a different context, it is essential to monitor the turnover of the substrate(s) and compare fragment patterns or cleavage site usage when approx.. 40% of the substrates is turned over. In this way, it is possible to compare the cleavage site usage of two proteasome samples more or less independent of their activity and independent of different substrate degradation kinetics (which often differ between substrates and certainly will do so in a library).</p><p>f) The authors should make the RAW files of the XL measurements available by depositing them in an online archive. They should also provide in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig1sdata1">Figure 1—source data 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig4sdata1">Figure 4—source data 1</xref> enough info (MS scan, RT) to reproduce the results. They also ought to provide the list of the peptide library (not on a collaboration-base) as supplementary material in this manuscript. I think this is the <italic>eLife</italic> policy. The aim is allowing other scientists to reproduce the results</p><p>g) The <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref> is not clear. I did not find a caption explaining the meaning of #1, #2, #3. Are they biological replicates? No enzyme is the control without any enzyme?

To address this point, we have made the peptide library available through academic collaboration with our research groups (subsection “Multiplex Substrate Profiling by Mass Spectrometry (MSP-MS)”, last paragraph). In <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig1sdata1">Figure 1—source data 1</xref>, we have provided a list of all iP and cP cleavage site data used to generate <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1</xref> and 2.</p><p>The MSP-MS peptide library has been described in O’Donoghue et al. Nat. Methods 2012 (PMID:23023596). The library design is based on the specificity preference of proteases for two optimally positioned amino acids within a substrate. For example, the amino acids in the P1 and P1ʹ position generally drive the specificity of aspartic acid proteases, whereas matrix metalloproteases have important substrate binding interactions in the S2 and S1ʹ sub-sites. In another example, the substrate specificity for caspase 3 and granzyme B is primarily located in the S4 and S1 pockets. Therefore, we designed an unbiased and diverse library of 14-mer peptides containing all possible neighbor (XY) and near neighbor (X*Y and X**Y) amino acid pairs so that all proteases would be able to cleave a selection of peptides. We have shown that highly specific proteases, such as human rhinovirus-14 protease, cleave a single peptide within the library (Nat. Methods 2012), whereas proteases with broad specificity, such as human cathepsin E, cleave 277 peptide bonds (Ivry et al. Clin Cancer Res 2017; PMID: 28424202). The mathematical formula used to design these sequences was published in our 2012 Nat. Methods paper.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Given that the proteasomes can cleave behind any given residue the percentages of cleavage sites identified (18.4% and 21.3% of 2964 potential cleavage sites) seems to be very low and questions the overall sensitivity of the assays. It is well known that different substrates will be degraded with different efficiencies by either sP or iP. However, such differences will strongly influence the validation of cleavage site usage unless the cleavage site usage is not corrected for max/2 turnover of the substrate. Importantly, proteasomes are known to cut less efficiently and also slowly within short peptides. Dolenc et al. (FEBS Lett 1998) identified a length of 13 residues as lower limit to have an efficient degradation rate. Since the MSP-MS method uses 14mers, this reviewer thinks that it is mandatory to repeat the MSP-MS assay with much longer kinetics than 60 min (2,4,6,8 hours).</p></disp-quote><p>In the Dolenc et al.paper, the cleavage rate of a 14-mer peptide by <italic>Thermoplasma acidophilum</italic> proteasome is equivalent to a 16-mer and 23-mer peptide. Therefore, the length of our starting substrates is likely to be sufficient for these assays. However, to address the concern from the reviewer about cleavage events that take place after 1 h, we have repeated the MSP-MS assay and performed an 8-hour time course. These additional time points have allowed for the generation of progress curves for iP and cP cleavage of the library (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>). As predicted by the reviewer, the number of new cleavage sites identified increases with time; however, the rate of new cleavage sites generated by each proteasome reduces as the assay progresses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A and 1B</xref>). We have also provided heat maps to compare proteasome specificity throughout the extended assay time course (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The authors neither report on the number of experiments performed to generate the data shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> nor on the reproducibility or the overlap between different experiments.</p><p>Assuming that technical replicates of the MS analysis and biological replicates (proteasome digestions) were performed, it will be very important to know the number of unique cleavage sites between:</p><p>- technical replicates;</p><p>- biological replicates;</p><p>- biological replicates performed at different time points using either sP or iP. The latter is a particular relevant control. I suppose that the alleged unique cleavage sites reported in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref> will not be confirmed by performing the assays with longer time-point. (Also see comment to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>).</p></disp-quote><p>All MSP-MS assays have now been performed with two commercial stocks of cP and iP (different lot numbers). In our manuscript, only cleavage sites that were found in two independent cP assays and in two independent iP assays (summarized in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref>) are reported and discussed. We have modified the main text (subsection “Global Substrate Specificity Profiling of the iP and cP”, first paragraph) and figure legends to clearly state that only cleavage sites that are common between two biological replicates are considered in our study.</p><p>For technical replicates, we have shown that the number of peptides identified in duplicate technical replicate assays ranges from an average of 78.5% at the start of the assay (before addition of proteasome) to 70.0% after 8 hours of incubation with proteasome. A table showing these data has been included in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>.</p><p>As suggested, we have provided the overlap between biological replicates throughout the assay time course (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref>). This analysis indicated that indeed the iP and cP have increased cleavage overlap at longer time points but that the proteasomes also retain unique specificity features (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>). We feel that this experiment helped strengthen the message of the manuscript and thank the reviewer for the suggestion.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>I am also intrigued by the fact that the authors identified 217 cleavage sites being specific for sP. However, as stated in Materials and methods the commercial PBMC derived iP contains between 10% and 48% standard subunits. How can it be that such mixed-type proteasomes cannot cleave at all at sites used by the sP?</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewer has correctly pointed out that each proteasome sample used in this study has β1, β2, β5, LMP2, MCEL-1 and LMP7 subunits although the ratio of each subunit differs considerably between the iP and cP preparations. With extended incubation time, iP and cP may eventually hydrolyze the peptide library into the same set of cleavage products. The differences in cleavage site preferences that are detected in our assay over the course of 8 hours are likely due to differences in cleavage efficiency. Therefore, we have removed the term “unique” cleavage sites from the manuscript to avoid confusion.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Performing and showing the outcomes of the requested controls will help to understand whether sP and iP really have such a large number of unique cleavage sites (348 of 762 cleavage sites identified). Using longer kinetics will most likely dramatically reduce this number. Even in case that there are only very few differences this would not affect the relevance of the study but will modify one of the main take home messages of the study.</p></disp-quote><p>We have performed the experiments requested by the reviewer and feel that they have strengthened the message of the paper. Our results suggest that specificity differences are clearly evident between the two proteasomes. We agree with the reviewer that the altered substrate specificity largely results in the proteasomes displaying differing efficiencies of cleavage for certain substrates. Therefore, we have removed the term “unique” cleavage sites from the paper to avoid confusion as stated above.

This is best seen in the progress curves provided in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>, which demonstrate that the number of new peptide bonds being cleaved in the library by the iP and cP begins to slow after 60 minutes. At 60 minutes, the iP and cP cleaved 264 and 225 peptide bonds corresponding to 8.9% and 7.5% of the 2,964 peptide bonds in the library. After 4 hours of incubation, the total number of new cleavage sites had not yet doubled (498 for the iP and 425 for the cP).</p><p>1)</p><p>3) As the peptides get smaller due to hydrolysis by the proteasome, they eventually become too small to detect reliably, as now schematically illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>. This is why the assay predominately detects initial cleavage products and running the assay longer will not uncover additional activities.</p><p>4) The MSP-MS peptide library has now been used to uncover the substrate specificity of ~80 proteases including enzymes with substrate preferences that are similar to the β1 (caspase-like) and β2 (trypsin-like) subunits of the proteasomes. For example, caspase activity was identified in a recent paper (Julien et al. PNAS 2016; PMID: 27006500). Similarly, tryptic and chymotryptic activities were identified in a separate paper (Winter et al. MBio 2016; PMID: 27624133). Therefore, our assay can detect these same specificities associated with the proteasome. However, since most of the specificity discovered in our study is chymotrypsin-like, we don’t believe that the assay lacks “sensitivity.”</p><p>5) The commercial preparations of the iP we used contain a significant portion of the β1 subunit from the cP. However, we are primarily detecting activity associated with the chymotrypsin-like subunit of the iP (LMP7) since it is the major activity of the proteasome. This is consistent with the development of the proteasome inhibitors carfilzomib and bortezomib, which target this subunit. Our assays detect the most dominantly cleaved substrates. However, we are also able to detect other activities as mentioned above.</p><p>6) Points: The reviewer misidentifies the false discovery rate (FDR) from the MS experiments. The &quot;0.05&quot; referred to is the maximum expectation value for peptide hits. The peptide FDR from our original paper introducing the MSP-MS assay is &lt;0.17% (O’Donoghue et al. Nat Methods 2012; PMID 23023596). The reviewer also disagrees with the use of the universal LLVY fluorogenic substrate to normalize the proteasome input for the MSP-MS assays. However, our MSP-MS data proves that at the concentration used, LLVY cleavage is an appropriate normalization strategy because we achieve very similar numbers of cleavages for the two proteasomes against our unbiased MSP-MS library using this approach.</p><p>7) The sum total of the data presented in the paper suggests that if we were able to run the MSP-MS assay to its theoretical limit, each site cleaved by one proteasome would ultimately be cleaved by the other. For example, from the more sophisticated label-free quantitation in the MSP-MS assay performed with the MHC peptides (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>), it is clear that even highly favored sequences are cleaved by the opposing proteasome at some rate. This is even the case for the optimized fluorogenic substrates. Therefore, our conclusion in the paper is that proteasome substrate specificity preferences (which clearly exist) primarily lead to differences in &quot;quantity&quot; of substrate cleavage and epitope generation, as opposed to strong “qualitative” differences.</p><p>Revisions to the Manuscript:</p><p>1) The Results section has been modified (subsection “Global Substrate Specificity Screen of the iP and cP”, first paragraph) to emphasize that the MSP-MS assay is being performed as a screening strategy for iP and cP cleavage and that discriminatory peptides have been identified with a particular emphasis on the β5/LMP7 subunits of the proteasome. We have also clarified that the β1 (caspase-like) activity is only a minor contributor to the overall cleavage profile (subsection “Global Substrate Specificity Screen of the iP and cP”, second paragraph and subsection “ProCISE Quantification of Proteasome Subunit Levels and IC50 Values”, last paragraph).</p><p>2) The limitations of the MSP-MS assay now have been stated in the Results section (subsection “Global Substrate Specificity Screen of the iP and cP”, first paragraph) to clarify the percentage of peptides that are being cleaved and why running the assay under longer or under other conditions would not provide additional information. We have also added a figure to illustrate this concept (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>).</p><p>3) We have re-emphasized throughout the manuscript (Abstract, Results, and Discussion) that the substrate specificity differences displayed by the proteasome lead to predominately quantitative differences in substrate cleavage and epitope generation (as opposed to absolute differences in selectivity).</p><p>4) As requested by the reviewer, we have deposited the raw mass spectrometry data from the paper (subsection “Multiplex Substrate Profiling by Mass Spectrometry (MSP-MS)”, last paragraph and subsection “MHC I Peptide Library Cleavage Assay”, last paragraph). We have also provided the mass spectrometry peptide reports and sequences for both the MSP-MS library (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig1sdata1">Figure 1—source data 1</xref>) and MHC library (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig4sdata1">Figure 4—source data 1</xref>).</p></body></sub-article></article>
