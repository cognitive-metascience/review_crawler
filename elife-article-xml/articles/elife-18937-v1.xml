In previous work (Hunt et al., 2015), we argued that PFC correlates of chosen value are a consequence of varying rates of a dynamical evidence accumulation process. Yet within PFC, there is substantial variability in chosen value correlates across individual neurons. Here we show that this variability is explained by neurons having different temporal receptive fields of integration, indexed by examining neuronal spike rate autocorrelation structure whilst at rest. We find that neurons with protracted resting temporal receptive fields exhibit stronger chosen value correlates during choice. Within orbitofrontal cortex, these neurons also sustain coding of chosen value from choice through the delivery of reward, providing a potential neural mechanism for maintaining predictions and updating stored values during learning. These findings reveal that within PFC, variability in temporal specialisation across neurons predicts involvement in specific decision-making computations.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.18937.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.18937.001</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>decision-making</kwd><kwd>prefrontal cortex</kwd><kwd>time constant</kwd><kwd>value</kwd><kwd>evidence accumulation</kwd><kwd>reward</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd>Rhesus macaque</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Middlesex Hospital Medical School General Charitable Trust</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Graduate Student Fellowship</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Cavanagh</surname><given-names>Sean E</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000026</institution-id><institution>National Institute on Drug Abuse</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R21-DA035209</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Wallis</surname><given-names>Joni D</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000025</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Mental Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01-MH097990</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Wallis</surname><given-names>Joni D</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100004440</institution-id><institution>Wellcome Trust</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>096689/Z/11/Z</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kennerley</surname><given-names>Steven W</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000025</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Mental Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>F32MH081521</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kennerley</surname><given-names>Steven W</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-7"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100004440</institution-id><institution>Wellcome Trust</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>098830/Z/12/Z</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Hunt</surname><given-names>Laurence T</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Variability in individual neurons' temporal receptive fields of integration is found to explain the heterogeneity of neuronal responses observed in prefrontal cortex during reward-guided decision making.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Theoretical models of decision making emphasise the importance of evidence accumulation across time until a categorical choice is reached (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bogacz et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Gold and Shadlen, 2007</xref>). One widely studied class of evidence accumulation models are cortical attractor networks, originally derived from studies of working memory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Amit and Brunel, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Wang, 1999</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">2002</xref>). These rely upon strong recurrent connections between similarly tuned neurons to integrate evidence across time, and exhibit temporally extended persistent activity that stores the outcome of the decision process in memory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Wang, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Wong and Wang, 2006</xref>). In value-guided decision making tasks, attractor network models predict the emergence of correlates of chosen value during choice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Hunt et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Rustichini and Padoa-Schioppa, 2015</xref>). These value correlates result from varying speeds of decision formation across different trials, an issue we explored closely in our previous paper (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hunt et al., 2015</xref>). However, in contrast to the relative homogeneity of chosen value correlates within such models, it is known that decision correlates are highly <italic>heterogeneous</italic> across different cells within a given region (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Kennerley et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Wallis and Kennerley, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Meister et al., 2013</xref>). The source and functional significance of this neuronal heterogeneity remains unclear.</p><p>Neurons also exhibit heterogeneity in their <italic>temporal receptive fields of integration</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chen et al., 2015</xref>). The temporal receptive field of a neuron can be established by examining its spike-count autocorrelation function (ACF) at rest (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Ogawa and Komatsu, 2010</xref>). A slowly decaying ACF whilst at rest reflects temporal stability in firing, suggesting that the neuron integrates information across long periods of time; by contrast, a fast-decaying ACF reflects temporal variability in firing. Recently, this approach was used to demonstrate a hierarchy of temporal receptive fields across areas of cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Murray et al., 2014</xref>), with populations of neurons in lower and higher cortical areas exhibiting brief and extended temporal receptive fields, respectively. Those areas with temporally extended receptive fields thus appear intrinsically adapted to cognitive tasks involving extended integration of information across time, such as working memory and decision making (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Mazurek et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Gold and Shadlen, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Wang, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chaudhuri et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chen et al., 2015</xref>). Yet in addition to the heterogeneity of temporal fields <italic>across</italic> regions, similar heterogeneity is also evident <italic>within</italic> cortical areas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Ogawa and Komatsu, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Nishida et al., 2014</xref>). It remains unknown whether this intra-regional heterogeneity in temporal specialisation might predict the computations served by different neurons in decision-making tasks.</p><p>In our previous study of reward-guided decision making (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hunt et al., 2015</xref>), we provided evidence that correlates of chosen value may emerge as a consequence of varying rates of evidence accumulation. A corollary of this idea is that neurons functionally specialised to perform temporally extended computations (such as evidence accumulation) might exhibit stronger chosen value correlates during choice. We hypothesised that this would be indexed by measuring individual neurons’ temporal receptive fields whilst at rest. We also hypothesised that this functional specialisation might support other temporally extended computations during reward-guided choice, such as the maintenance of value coding until reward delivery. This could be one component of a mechanism for credit assignment in learning, which is known to rely upon PFC and in particular orbitofrontal cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Walton et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Takahashi et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chau et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Jocham et al., 2016</xref>), with the other component being a representation of the chosen stimulus identity, which is also encoded by OFC neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Raghuraman and Padoa-Schioppa, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Lopatina et al., 2015</xref>). We therefore sought to link variability in spike-rate autocorrelation at rest with the variability of neuronal responses during reward-guided choices.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>We re-examined the neural correlates of chosen value during choice within rhesus macaque prefrontal cortex (PFC) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Hosokawa et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hunt et al., 2015</xref>), and extended our analysis to the time of reward delivery (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). During choice, chosen value correlates were remarkably similar across all three PFC brain regions (dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC), orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) and anterior cingulate cortex (ACC)) at the population level (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). However, this was not the case at the time of outcome, where the chosen value correlates predominated in OFC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). This value signal at outcome contained information about both the chosen benefit and chosen cost (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>). As well as variability in value correlates across time, there was a large degree of variability at the level of single neurons constituting the population averages, both at choice and outcome (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C–D</xref>). Within each region there were some neurons with strong chosen value correlates, but other neurons with weak or non-selective responses to chosen value.<fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.18937.002</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Homogeneity and heterogeneity of chosen value correlates.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) At decision time, chosen value correlates appeared <italic>homogenous</italic> across regions in their expression.

CPD was calculated by regressing chosen value onto firing rate during the choice period of a cost-benefit decision making task (see Materials and methods).

We characterised resting properties of neuronal firing by examining their spike rate autocorrelation during pre-trial fixation. The decay of the autocorrelation function (ACF) provides a metric of each neuron’s temporal stability in firing rate. Careful inspection of ACFs at the level of single neurons demonstrated marked heterogeneity of ACFs across individual neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>), complementing previous descriptions that have examined average population responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Murray et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chaudhuri et al., 2015</xref>). We fitted an exponential decay function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Murray et al., 2014</xref>) to all neurons that could be described by such an equation, yielding a single decay time constant, τ, for each neuron (446 of 857 neurons, see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref> and Materials and methods). We found a large degree of heterogeneity in time constants across neurons, both within and between cortical areas (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). Time constants were larger in the DLPFC and ACC population (Kruskal-Wallis test, p=0.0007), but most variable within OFC and ACC populations (Bartlett’s Statistic = 11.913, p=0.0026). Averaging across the ACFs of individual neurons prior to fitting the exponential equation yielded similar qualitative results to the population averages reported in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Murray et al.

We first sought to visually identify a potential relationship with chosen value by sorting the matrices in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref> by time constant. To maximise our sensitivity, and because of the similarity in chosen value correlates across PFC brain regions at choice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>), we collapsed this analysis across all three PFC regions (n = 446 neurons). We found that more neurons with high chosen value coefficient of partial determination (CPD) were more apparent at the bottom of the sorted matrix than at the top (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>), implying a relationship between chosen value coding and resting τ. To test this relationship statistically, neurons were subdivided into high and low time constant populations using a median split (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). The population with a higher τ (more stable activity at rest) had more variance explained by chosen value during choice (permutation test (see Materials and methods), p=0.0298). We further demonstrated this relationship by performing a rank correlation between each neuron’s coefficient of partial determination (CPD) at the time of the maximum population-average CPD with its time constant (Correlation Coefficient = 0.148, p=0.0018; 95% CI [0.0556, 0.2373], <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>).

Such sustained coding of chosen value from choice through outcome was not present in ACC and DLPFC.

These include the accumulation of evidence during choice, and the persistence of value encoding until the experience of outcome delivery.</p><p>Circuits within the prefrontal cortex are endowed with several features that may support persistent activity. These include complex pyramidal cell morphology, strong reciprocal connections, slow-decaying NMDA-Receptor transmission and augmenting synapses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Wang, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Elston, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Wang et al., 2006</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Freeman, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Wang et al., 2013</xref>). These factors may account for both the prolonged resting stability within PFC, and the ability of its neurons to support computations that subserve flexible cognition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Miller et al., 1996</xref>). However, there are different cell-classes within the PFC, with substantial heterogeneity in their morphology, synapses and expression of slow-decaying NMDA-Receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Wong and Wang, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Zaitsev et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Wang et al., 2013</xref>). When randomly sampling neurons within the macaque PFC, the morphology, cell-type, cortical layer and synaptic features are unknown. Recorded neurons are therefore likely sampled from separate subnetworks with differing resting stabilities and distinct roles in cognitive processing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Wang et al., 2013</xref>). This may explain the heterogeneity we observed in both resting activity and involvement in decision making computations observed across PFC neurons. Recent evidence has shown diversity in functional responses of PFC neurons dependent upon the cell-type and cortical layer in which they were located (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Zhou et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Pinto and Dan, 2015</xref>).</p><p>Most importantly in this study, we demonstrated that neurons with higher resting time constants had strong chosen value correlates at choice. Following on from our previous work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hunt et al., 2015</xref>) – where we demonstrated that chosen value correlates can arise indirectly from the dynamics of decision processes – our result implies that neurons with more persistent resting activity are more involved in value-based choice. This provides new experimental evidence to support computational theories which attribute evidence integration to strongly recurrent attractor networks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Wang, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Wong and Wang, 2006</xref>). Neurons located within these reverberant PFC subnetworks would be expected to have both higher time constants and stronger value correlates. It also indicates that such models need refinement if they are to encompass the heterogeneous correlates of decisions varaiables that we and others have observed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Kennerley et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Meister et al., 2013</xref>). Our findings facilitate several testable predictions for research into single-neuron mechanisms of decision making. For perceptual decisions, such as the random dot-motion task, which involve the integration of evidence over time more explicitly than our cost-benefit decision paradigm, we would predict task-related neurons would also have high time constants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Gold and Shadlen, 2007</xref>).</p><p>Cross-temporal pattern analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Stokes et al., 2015</xref>) provides a powerful tool to allow for the interrogation of maintained activity within neuronal populations. In addition to decision-making, computational models of working memory also rely upon stable, persistent activity within richly reverberant networks for the retention of information across delays (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Wang, 1999</xref>). Our data showing that evidence maintenance is indeed fulfilled by neurons with higher time constants concurs with this hypothesis. The ability to maintain a representation of chosen value across delays may explain why OFC is essential for delay-based decision making (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Rudebeck et al., 2006</xref>) and why OFC damage causes decision-making and credit assignment deficits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Rudebeck et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Noonan et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Walton et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Camille et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chau et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>Our data on single neuron time constants have provided new insights into potential credit assignment mechanisms within the orbitofrontal cortex.

However, despite ideas that OFC is critical for credit assignment during learning, we are not aware of any study that has demonstrated what a neuronal signature of credit assignment might resemble. Here we show that OFC neurons with high temporal specializations not only encode an integrated chosen value signal during choice, but that the same OFC neurons maintain this representation through to the experience of an outcome. This neural signature - when combined with a representation of the chosen stimulus identity, which is also encoded in OFC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Raghuraman and Padoa-Schioppa, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Lopatina et al., 2015</xref>) - could be a key computation for credit assignment processes.</p><p>As well as our findings at the single-neuron level, our results reiterate the value of assigning timescales at the level of a cortical area (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Murray et al., 2014</xref>). We replicated the findings of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Murray et al. (2014)</xref> showing that the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) had the longest timescale within the PFC regions studied. It is possible the ACC may be supporting extended cognitive processes that our experimental paradigm was not designed to capture. These include the encoding or integrating of reward, planning and/or choice information across multiple trials (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Matsumoto et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Seo and Lee, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bernacchia et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Hayden et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kennerley et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Stoll et al., 2016</xref>). Future studies might explore the timescales of other prefrontal regions proposed to have unique roles in storing information across multiple trials, such as frontal polar cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Boorman et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Donoso et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>We demonstrate that calculating the decay in a neuron’s intrinsic resting-state autocorrelation can provide a powerful tool for predicting functional properties during cognitive tasks. Our findings therefore have important implications for how neurophysiological datasets are collected and analysed. One current method of avoiding variability in neuronal responses during cognitive tasks is pre-selection of neurons based upon their response properties; neurons with stable, persistent responses on memory guided saccade tasks are preferentially selected for analysis in decision-making tasks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Roitman and Shadlen, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Huk and Shadlen, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Yang and Shadlen, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Mante et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kira et al., 2015</xref>). This method may lead investigators to record from neurons with longer temporal receptive fields, as evidenced (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Murray et al., 2014</xref>) by the higher population-level time constants within the lateral intraparietal area (LIP) when neurons are screened prior to recording (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Freedman and Assad, 2006</xref>) versus when they are not (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Seo et al., 2009</xref>). A more unbiased characterisation of the heterogeneity of neuronal responses may be obtained by recording from all encountered neurons and categorising them post-hoc, as is more common practice in PFC studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Freedman et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Padoa-Schioppa and Assad, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Kim et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Kennerley et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Hanks et al., 2015</xref>). In the context of decision-making, this has highlighted several ‘non-classical’ neuronal response profiles in regions such as LIP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Meister et al., 2013</xref>). Indeed, even in spite of pre-screening neurons prior to the task, substantial heterogeneity in task-related responses can nonetheless remain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Premereur et al., 2011</xref>). A more complete understanding of decision-making computations requires us to understand the roles of all of the neurons in these decision processes.</p><p>In summary, we have shown that functional specialisation for temporally extended computations predicts the involvement of PFC neurons in specific aspects of value-guided decision making. We anticipate that this approach may become significant in predicting the role of neurons in many other temporally extended computations dependent upon prefrontal cortex. These might include working memory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Wang et al., 2013</xref>), strategic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Seo et al., 2014</xref>) and rule-based reasoning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Buschman et al., 2012</xref>), and foraging behaviours (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Hayden et al., 2011</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><p>Neurophysiological procedures, task structure and regression analysis of single-neuron responses have been reported previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Hosokawa et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hunt et al., 2015</xref>). In brief, four male rhesus macaques served as subjects. Recordings were taken from dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC), orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) and the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC). The sample size of neurons recorded was therefore predetermined from this pre-existing dataset. The number of neurons and cortical areas recorded from each of the four subjects have been reported previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Hosokawa et al., 2013</xref>).

In addition to the data lost due to incomplete trials, previous investigators have excluded a further proportion of trials due to the drifting resting firing rate of neurons over the course of a session (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Murray et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Nishida et al., 2014</xref>). As we intended to assign time constants to individual neurons, we decided that estimating autocorrelation from a restricted trial number would not provide the best estimation of spike-count autocorrelation. However, it is possible our method artificially inflated autocorrelation due to drifting firing rates throughout a session. Therefore, as a control analysis, we filtered trials when firing rates drifted, using the same approach as in (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Nishida et al., 2014</xref>). For each neuron, the total spike count during the fixation period of each trial was calculated. A sliding window of these spike counts for 100 trials was subdivided into 4 groups of 25 trials and entered into a Kruskal-Wallis test. By shifting this sliding window from the 1st to the last trial within a session, we obtained the longest sequence of trials in which activity did not differ significantly (p&gt;0.005). This procedure reduced the number of trials used for estimating the autocorrelation function on average by 38.4%.

Your article has been reviewed by two peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Eve Marder as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal his identity: Daeyeol Lee (Reviewer #1).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>This paper builds on the authors' earlier analysis of the single-neuron data previously collected in three different regions of the primate prefrontal cortex (DLPFC, ACC, and OFC), now focusing on the relationship between the intrinsic timescale (time constant) of spiking activity and their role in value-based decision making. In particular, they found that neurons in the ACC and OFC with longer time constants during fixation (as measured by spike rate autocorrelation) are more likely to encode chosen value signals. Moreover, OFC neurons tended to encode the chosen value signals more strongly during the outcome period compared to the neurons in the DLPFC and ACC. The cross temporal correlation analysis also revealed that the chosen value coding in the OFC during the choice and outcome epochs was consistent. The authors suggested that this might be important for the proposed role of the OFC in resolving temporal credit assignment.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>Overall, the findings reported in this manuscript are very timely. They are nice additions to the previous work from the authors, and provide important new insights into the neural mechanism of decision making. Also, the manuscript is written clearly and easy to follow. Nevertheless, both reviewers identified some important issues that need to be clarified.</p><p>1) It is not clear how the persistent coding of chosen value signals can be used for, or reflect, the resolution of the temporal credit assignment problem. For resolving the temporal credit assignment problem, the brain must recognize one of the previous actions or previously visited states that is related to a particular outcome after a delay. How can the chosen value signals, rather than the signals directly related to previous actions or states, can be used for this purpose? The focus on the temporal credit assignment problem also seems a bit inconsistent with the prediction of the authors from the Wang model about the relationship between the timescale and value coding. In other words, their model of mutual inhibition predicts this relationship, even though it is not clear how that model resolves the temporal credit assignment problem.</p><p>2) Similarly, the Discussion focuses mostly on the function of the OFC, but the results from this manuscript and Murray et al. showed that the longest time scale is seen in the ACC. Therefore, it might be helpful to include some discussion about the possible function of the long time scale of ACC activity. One possibility is that ACC might play a more important role in integrating signals across multiple trials, as suggested by Seo and Lee (2007) and Bernacchia et al. (2011).</p><p>3) Tests of the association between time constant and chosen-value coding mainly use a median split on the time constant tau. However, it doesn't look like tau values fall into discrete high and low clusters (there's no apparent discontinuity at the median in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>, right-hand side). The rank correlation test mentioned in the third paragraph of the Results seems like a much more natural approach. What's the justification for not using the rank correlation for all the analyses, i.e. the tests of the entire time course, of individual brain regions, and of the outcome phase? As it stands the correlation analysis is confined to a single time point, and the criterion for choosing this time point is vague (&quot;maximal population response&quot;). Does this mean (1) maximum spike rate, (2) maximum population-average CPD, or (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">3</xref>) maximum high-versus-low effect in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>? #1 seems like the most natural reading, but #2 is what I would guess given the context (#3 would be circular).</p><p>4) In a few places the paper infers differences because an effect reaches significance in one condition but not another. A direct contrast between the two conditions is generally more appropriate in such cases. This applies to: (1) greater outcome-related value coding in OFC than in DLPFC/ACC (Results, fourth paragraph); (2) greater reactivation coding in high-tau than low-tau neurons (Results, last paragraph); (3) greater reactivation coding in OFC than in DLPFC/ACC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">2</xref>).</p><p>5) For the cross-temporal correlation analysis, the authors draw a distinction between &quot;sustained&quot; and &quot;reactivation&quot; coding. But this distinction sometimes gets blurry. The evidence mainly supports reactivation coding, but the conclusion is that OFC is &quot;maintaining a representation of chosen value until an expected outcome is experienced&quot; (Results, last paragraph), which sounds more like sustained coding. Similarly, earlier (Results, fourth paragraph) the paper concludes that OFC codes value through the choice-outcome interval, but only a post-outcome epoch is actually tested.</p><p>6) The paper should at least briefly address the distinction between &quot;chosen value&quot; and what one might call &quot;outcome value&quot; – the size of the juice reward. These aren't identical, since chosen value also incorporates an effort/delay requirement. But they may be correlated. Can the authors rule out that OFC is merely encoding the juice magnitude in the outcome phase? That is, is there direct evidence it also encodes the (already completed) effort or delay requirement?</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.18937.023</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>Essential revisions:</italic> </p><p><italic>Overall, the findings reported in this manuscript are very timely.

We agree that a chosen value signal could only play an important part in resolving the temporal credit assignment problem in combination with a representation of the chosen stimuli/action to which credit must be assigned.</p><p>In our original paper (Huntet al., 2015), we found that a signal for chosen action was present in dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) in the latter part of the choice epoch. We therefore tested whether chosen action coding was also present at the time of reward delivery. Just as is evident during the choice epoch, chosen action signals during the outcome epoch are predominantly found in DLPFC:<fig id="fig6" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.18937.017</object-id><label>Author response image 1.</label><caption><title>Population averages when chosen action was regressed onto firing rate during reward delivery.</title><p>DLPFC showed stronger chosen action correlates following reward onset than ACC and OFC (permutation tests; DLPFC v OFC, p = 0.0006, DLPFC v ACC, p = 0.0002; see Methods).

Although there may have been some credit assignment of outcomes to actions, optimal credit assignment in this task would involve the assignment of values to the visual stimuli. It is possible that firing rates of OFC neurons could encode information about individual stimuli using a linear relationship that also reflected a value code. In our study, such a ‘stimulus identity’ code would be inherently confounded with value, so we do not believe it could be isolated from this dataset. Nevertheless, recent studies (Lopatinaet al., 2015) have demonstrated that single OFC neurons can encode specific stimuli or stimulus-outcome relationships, so it appears plausible that both a stimulus-specific code and a sustained chosen value code could be utilized across the OFC population to support both choice and credit assignment processes.</p><p>Nonetheless, we accept the reviewer’s point and have therefore toned down the references to credit assignment throughout the manuscript (except when referencing other papers that address the question of credit assignment more directly). Instead, we refer to this signal as an important component of a system to update stored values.</p><p>For example, in the Abstract, we now say:</p><p>“Within orbitofrontal cortex, these neurons also sustain coding of chosen value from choice through the delivery of reward, providing a potential neural mechanism for maintaining predictions and updating stored values during learning.”</p><p>In the Introduction, we now say:</p><p>“This could be one component of a mechanism for credit assignment in learning, which is known to rely upon PFC and in particular orbitofrontal cortex (Walton et al., 2010; Takahashi et al., 2011; Chau et al., 2015; Jocham et al., 2016), with the other component being a representation of the chosen stimulus identity, which is also encoded by OFC neurons (Lopatina et al., 2015).”</p><p>In the Results, we now say:</p><p>“This implies a unique neuronal signature within OFC which could contribute to the linking of choices to outcomes, a process critical for learning.”</p><p>In the Discussion we now add:</p><p>“This neural signature – when combined with a representation of the chosen stimulus identity, which is also encoded in OFC (Lopatina et al., 2015) – could be a key computation for credit assignment processes.”</p><p><italic>2) Similarly, the Discussion focuses mostly on the function of the OFC, but the results from this manuscript and Murray et al. showed that the longest time scale is seen in the ACC. Therefore, it might be helpful to include some discussion about the possible function of the long time scale of ACC activity. One possibility is that ACC might play a more important role in integrating signals across multiple trials, as suggested by Seo and Lee (2007) and Bernacchia et al. (2011).</italic> </p><p>Thank you for raising this comment. We agree that this is a point worth discussing. We have added the following paragraph to the Discussion:</p><p>“As well as our findings at the single-neuron level, our results reiterate the value of assigning timescales at the level of a cortical area (Murray et al., 2014). […] Future studies might explore the timescales of other prefrontal regions proposed to have unique roles in storing information across multiple trials, such as frontal polar cortex (Boorman et al., 2009; Donoso et al., 2014).”</p><p><italic>3) Tests of the association between time constant and chosen-value coding mainly use a median split on the time constant tau. However, it doesn't look like tau values fall into discrete high and low clusters (there's no apparent discontinuity at the median in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>, right-hand side). The rank correlation test mentioned in the third paragraph of the Results seems like a much more natural approach. What's the justification for not using the rank correlation for all the analyses, i.e. the tests of the entire time course, of individual brain regions, and of the outcome phase? As it stands the correlation analysis is confined to a single time point, and the criterion for choosing this time point is vague (&quot;maximal population response&quot;). Does this mean (1) maximum spike rate, (2) maximum population-average CPD, or (3) maximum high-versus-low effect in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>? #1 seems like the most natural reading, but #2 is what I would guess given the context (#3 would be circular).</italic> </p><p>We thank the reviewers for raising this important point. As mentioned by the reviewers below, we felt that the median split was the most straightforward way to visualise the difference between chosen value correlates in both low and high time constant cells. We also tried to show a representation of chosen value correlates across the entire population in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>, sorted by time constant. We felt that it was important to show both of these, as they demonstrate that there are some cells with comparatively low time constants that do have some variance explained by chosen value – but they are fewer in number and weaker than those with high time constants.</p><p>In response to this comment, however, we have added sliding rank correlation tests for both choice and outcome periods for both <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref> as supplementary figures. In short, these supplementary analyses essentially recapitulate the results shown using the median split approach.</p><p>In new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref> (collapsed across regions), there is a positive correlation between time constant and chosen value coefficient of partial determination (CPD) around the maximum-population average CPD. This time course corresponds to the greatest separation between the high and low time constant median split in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>.</p><p>With respect to the reviewer’s final comment: on each plot we have now marked the maximum population-average CPD with a vertical blue line (i.e. the reviewer is correct that we meant #2). We recognise that this was previously vague within the text. We have clarified we meant #2 within the Results section:</p><p>“We further demonstrated this relationship by performing a rank correlation between each neuron’s coefficient of partial determination (CPD) at the time of the maximum population-average CPD with its time constant (Correlation Coefficient = 0.148, p = 0.0018; 95% CI [0.0556, 0.2373], <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>).”</p><p>Note that the ‘dip’ in correlation between chosen value correlates and time constants (at the very start of the trial) is also observed in the median split analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). This result may seem surprising – it appears very early for such a factor to explain variance in neural firing. However, we interpret this finding in a similar way to the ‘prescient’ pre-stimulus activity observed in (Padoa-Schioppa, 2013). In particular, the firing rate of neurons before trial onset may affect the success of the network in making decisions, and so induce correlations with chosen value pre-stimulus. This is indeed apparent in the analyses of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>, where there is chosen value coding that is slightly higher than chance, pre-stimulus, across all three regions. The negative correlation with time constants suggests that this is in a different set of cells to the high time constant ‘temporal integrators’ that express chosen value most strongly during choice. However, as this point is rather orthogonal to the main point of the paper (and there is far less variance explained by chosen value at this time point anyway), we do not focus on this explicitly in the main text.</p><p>We also perform the sliding rank correlation separated by regions, in new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>. Here there is a positive correlation between time constant and chosen value coefficient of partial determination (CPD) around the maximum-population average CPD within OFC during choice. The positive correlation between time constant and CPD emerges later within ACC, similar to the median split method in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>. At the time of outcome, there is only a relationship between time constant and chosen value coding within OFC; this is in the form of a strong positive correlation both at the maximum-population CPD around 900ms into the outcome period, and in the period shortly after reward onset.</p><p>We are in agreement with the view expressed by the reviewers below, however, that the median split is overall the clearer way to visualise the results. This is especially true for the cross-temporal pattern analysis in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>, which relies upon correlating the regression coefficients of distinct groups of neurons. We therefore feel that it is best to focus predominantly on this median-split method in the main manuscript, and include the sliding rank correlation figures shown above as supplementary analyses.</p><p><italic>4) In a few places the paper infers differences because an effect reaches significance in one condition but not another. A direct contrast between the two conditions is generally more appropriate in such cases. This applies to: (1) greater outcome-related value coding in OFC than in DLPFC/ACC (Results, fourth paragraph); (2) greater reactivation coding in high-tau than low-tau neurons (Results, last paragraph); (3) greater reactivation coding in OFC than in DLPFC/ACC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">2</xref>).</italic> </p><p>This is a useful comment which has helped to make our conclusions more thorough. To address this comment, we used non-parametric permutation tests to perform the direct contrasts between the conditions. We did this for all of the three suggestions raised by the reviewer.</p><p>For (1), we have added a permutation test to compare chosen value coding across brain regions to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>. Details of this test have been added to the “Significance Testing using Cluster-Based Permutation Tests” subheading on the Methods section:</p><p><italic>“</italic>Significance Testing using Cluster-Based Permutation Tests” (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>).</p><p>To identify significant clusters of chosen value coding whilst correcting for multiple comparisons across time, cluster based permutation tests were used (Nichols &amp; Holmes, 2002).</p><p>[…] The length of the longest cluster for each permutation was entered into the null distribution. The true cluster size was significant at the p&lt;0.05 or p&lt;0.01 level (corrected) if the true cluster length exceeded the 97.5<sup>th</sup> percentile or 99.5<sup>th</sup> percentile of the null distribution, respectively.”</p><p>This test highlighted that chosen value coding following reward onset was significantly stronger in OFC than DLPFC or ACC, which we now describe in the <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> legend:</p><p>“OFC showed stronger chosen value correlates following reward onset than ACC and DLPFC (permutation tests; OFC v DLPFC, p = 0.0010, OFC v ACC, p = 0.0028; see Methods).”</p><p>For (2), we developed a similar permutation test to compare sustained coding between high and low time constant neurons. Details of this test have been included within the new section of the methods entitled “Comparing sustained coding between cortical areas and high/low time constant neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>)”.</p><p>“Comparing sustained coding between cortical areas and high/low time constant neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>)</p><p>To compare the sustained coding present from choice through reward delivery between different cortical areas, a permutation test was performed. […] A similar test was performed to compare high vs. low time constant neurons (i.e. to compare <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref> vs. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>); except in the permuted data, neurons were shuffled between high/low groups – as opposed to between different brain areas.”</p><p>Note that this direct comparison did not produce a statistically significant difference. We now report this in the text:</p><p>“Within OFC, this sustained population code appeared most prominent in the neurons with a high resting time constant τ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>), but absent in those with a low τ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>). Note, however, that this difference should be interpreted cautiously, as a formal comparison of cluster size within the high and low τ populations (using a non-parametric permutation test, see Methods) was not significant (p=0.59).”</p><p>For (3), we developed a similar permutation test to compare reactivation coding across cortical areas. Details of this test were also included within the new section of the methods entitled <italic>“</italic>Comparing sustained coding between cortical areas and high/low time constant neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>)”.This test highlighted sustained coding was stronger in OFC than in DLPFC or ACC, which we now report in the Results section:</p><p>“Nonetheless, the sustained population code from choice through outcome was much stronger in OFC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B-C</xref>) than in both the ACC and DLPFC populations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">2</xref>; permutation tests, OFC v DLPFC, p = 0008; OFC v ACC, p &lt; 0.0001; see Methods).”</p><p><italic>5) For the cross-temporal correlation analysis, the authors draw a distinction between &quot;sustained&quot; and &quot;reactivation&quot; coding. But this distinction sometimes gets blurry. The evidence mainly supports reactivation coding, but the conclusion is that OFC is &quot;maintaining a representation of chosen value until an expected outcome is experienced&quot; (Results, last paragraph), which sounds more like sustained coding. Similarly, earlier (Results, fourth paragraph) the paper concludes that OFC codes value through the choice-outcome interval, but only a post-outcome epoch is actually tested.</italic> </p><p>On reflection, we agree with the reviewers that our use of the terms “reactivation” and “sustained” coding became confusing during the Results section. To clarify whether orbitofrontal cortex activity is better characterised as ‘sustained’ coding from choice through reward delivery, or alternatively a ‘reactivation’ code which re-emerges only in response to reward delivery, we extended our cross-temporal pattern analysis backwards in time to begin 1500ms prior to reward onset. We also extended our permutation tests to incorporate a ‘pre-outcome’ epoch (-1000ms to 0ms after reward onset), in addition to our existing ‘outcome’ epoch (0 to 1000ms after reward onset). We chose these epoch lengths to ensure the analysis was not contaminated by choice activity given the differing lengths of the cost (effort/delay requirement) epochs on different trials.</p><p>We found a strong cross-correlation within OFC activity that was present for the whole of our extended analysis epoch. There were large significant clusters of activity within the “Pre-Outcome” epoch (grey dashed area) which extended all the way until around 1500ms after reward onset (which is the end of the reward delivery period) in the “Outcome” epoch (black dashed area). We show these new results in the updated <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>.</p><p>Such sustained coding from pre- to post-outcome was absent in a similar analysis within the ACC and DLPFC populations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">2</xref>). These results suggest that OFC exhibits “sustained” coding from choice through outcome, rather than “reactivation” coding, and that this sustained coding is unique to OFC. The Results section has been updated accordingly:</p><p>“Crucially, however, there was also evidence for sustained coding: the same neuronal population in OFC at choice encoded chosen value from at least 1000ms before outcome through to 1000ms after outcome (warm colours in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>, grey and black dashed boxes, permutation tests (see Methods), largest clusters p &lt; 0.0001); such sustained coding of value from choice through outcome was absent within DLPFC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1A</xref>) and ACC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2A</xref>) neuronal populations. […] This demonstrates that OFC neurons with persistent activity at rest encode a “sustained” representation of chosen value until an expected outcome is experienced, and that this neural signature appears unique to OFC.”</p><p><italic>6) The paper should at least briefly address the distinction between &quot;chosen value&quot; and what one might call &quot;outcome value&quot; – the size of the juice reward. These aren't identical, since chosen value also incorporates an effort/delay requirement. But they may be correlated. Can the authors rule out that OFC is merely encoding the juice magnitude in the outcome phase? That is, is there direct evidence it also encodes the (already completed) effort or delay requirement?</italic> </p><p>Thanks for raising this point; this crucial distinction was not addressed in the manuscript. We have now included evidence to show that OFC is encoding the chosen cost (i.e. the effort / delay requirement already completed) at the time of outcome – see new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>. We used the same regression model as before, but split chosen value into a benefit and cost component.</p><p>“However, this was not the case at the time of outcome, where chosen value correlates predominated in OFC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). This value signal at outcome contained information about both the chosen benefit and chosen cost (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>).”</p></body></sub-article></article>
