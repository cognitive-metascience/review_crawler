Two major cytoskeletal components, microtubules and actin filaments, together with a microtubule motor, kinesin-1, and an actin motor, myosin-V, are essential for <italic>osk</italic> mRNA posterior localization. In this study, we use Staufen, an RNA-binding protein that colocalizes with <italic>osk</italic> mRNA, as a proxy for <italic>osk</italic> mRNA. We demonstrate that posterior localization of <italic>osk</italic>/Staufen is determined by competition between kinesin-1 and myosin-V. While kinesin-1 removes <italic>osk</italic>/Staufen from the cortex along microtubules, myosin-V anchors <italic>osk</italic>/Staufen at the cortex. Myosin-V wins over kinesin-1 at the posterior pole due to low microtubule density at this site, while kinesin-1 wins at anterior and lateral positions because they have high density of cortically-anchored microtubules. As a result, posterior determinants are removed from the anterior and lateral cortex but retained at the posterior pole. Thus, posterior determination of <italic>Drosophila</italic> oocytes is defined by kinesin-myosin competition, whose outcome is primarily determined by cortical microtubule density.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><title>eLife digest</title><p>One of the most fundamental steps of embryonic development is deciding which end of the body should be the head, and which should be the tail. Known as 'axis specification', this process depends on the location of genetic material called mRNAs. In fruit flies, for example, the tail-end of the embryo accumulates an mRNA called <italic>oskar</italic>. If this mRNA is missing, the embryo will not develop an abdomen.</p><p>The build-up of <italic>oskar</italic> mRNA happens before the egg is even fertilized and depends on two types of scaffold proteins in the egg cell called microtubules and microfilaments. These scaffolds act like ‘train tracks’ in the cell and have associated protein motors, which work a bit like trains, carrying cargo as they travel up and down along the scaffolds. For microtubules, one of the motors is a protein called kinesin-1, whereas for microfilaments, the motors are called myosins.</p><p>Most microtubules in the egg cell are pointing away from the membrane, while microfilament tracks form a dense network of randomly oriented filaments just underneath the membrane. It was already known that kinesin-1 and a myosin called myosin-V are important for localizing <italic>oskar</italic> mRNA to the posterior of the egg. However, it was not clear why the mRNA only builds up in that area.</p><p>To find out, Lu et al. used a probe to track <italic>oskar</italic> mRNA, while genetically manipulating each of the motors so that their ability to transport cargo changed. Modulating the balance of activity between the two motors revealed that kinesin-1 and myosin-V engage in a tug-of-war inside the egg: myosin-V tries to keep <italic>oskar</italic> mRNA underneath the membrane of the cell, while kinesin-1 tries to pull it away from the membrane along microtubules. The winner of this molecular battle depends on the number of microtubule tracks available in the local area of the cell. In most parts of the cell, there are abundant microtubules, so kinesin-1 wins and pulls <italic>oskar</italic> mRNA away from the membrane. But at the posterior end of the cell there are fewer microtubules, so myosin-V wins, allowing <italic>oskar</italic> mRNA to localize in this area. Artificially 'shaving' some microtubules in a local area immediately changed the outcome of this tug-of-war creating a build-up of <italic>oskar</italic> mRNA in the 'shaved' patch.</p><p>This is the first time a molecular tug-of-war has been shown in an egg cell, but in other types of cell, such as neurons and pigment cells, myosins compete with kinesins to position other molecular cargoes. Understanding these processes more clearly sheds light not only on embryo development, but also on cell biology in general.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>kinesin</kwd><kwd>myosin</kwd><kwd>oskar</kwd><kwd><italic>Drosophila</italic></kwd><kwd>microtubules</kwd><kwd>actin</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>D. melanogaster</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000057</institution-id><institution>National Institute of General Medical Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>GM124029</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Gelfand</surname><given-names>Vladimir I</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000057</institution-id><institution>National Institute of General Medical Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>GM131752</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Gelfand</surname><given-names>Vladimir I</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Posterior determination of <italic>Drosophila</italic> oocyte is defined by competition between kinesin-1 removing posterior determinants from the cortex and myosin-V anchoring them.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Kinesin-1, also known as conventional kinesin, is a major microtubule motor that transports many types of cargoes, including mRNA-containing granules towards plus-ends of microtubules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Verhey and Hammond, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Hirokawa et al., 2009</xref>). Kinesin-1 is required for the posterior accumulation of <italic>osk</italic> mRNA in <italic>Drosophila</italic> oocytes that is essential for embryo posterior determination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Brendza et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Palacios and St Johnston, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Krauss et al., 2009</xref>). Defects in <italic>osk</italic> mRNA localization prevent germ cell formation and abdomen specification (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Lehmann and Nüsslein-Volhard, 1986</xref>). Posterior localization of <italic>osk</italic> mRNA is initially established during mid-oogenesis (late stage 8 to stage 9) and maintained throughout late oogenesis (stage 10B to stage 14). Staufen, an RNA-binding protein that forms ribonucleoprotein particles (RNPs) with <italic>osk</italic> mRNA, is commonly used as a proxy for <italic>oskar</italic> RNA (referred as ‘<italic>osk</italic>/Staufen’ hereafter) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Brendza et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Palacios and St Johnston, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Erdélyi et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Shulman et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Lu et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Lu et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">St Johnston et al., 1991</xref>).</p><p>During mid-oogenesis (stage 7–9), the oocyte forms an anterior-to-posterior gradient of cortical microtubules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Theurkauf et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Clark et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Clark et al., 1997</xref>). These microtubules are anchored at the cortex by their minus ends via the minus-end binding protein Patronin and a microtubule-actin crosslinker, Short stop (Shot) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Nashchekin et al., 2016</xref>). Because Shot is excluded from the posterior cortex in a Par-1-dependent manner, more microtubule minus ends are anchored at the anterior and lateral cortex than at the posterior cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Shulman et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Nashchekin et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Zimyanin et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Parton et al., 2011</xref>). This anterior-posterior cortical microtubule gradient is established in stage 7–8 oocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Theurkauf et al., 1992</xref>), just before <italic>osk</italic>/Staufen starts accumulating at the posterior pole. The anterior-posterior gradient of cortical microtubule results in slightly more microtubule plus ends oriented towards the posterior pole (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Nashchekin et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Zimyanin et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Parton et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Khuc Trong et al., 2015</xref>). Kinesin-1 has been proposed to drive <italic>osk</italic> mRNA transport along these weakly biased cortical microtubules, favoring <italic>osk</italic> mRNA movement from the anterior to the posterior pole (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Brendza et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Palacios and St Johnston, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Zimyanin et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Khuc Trong et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Nieuwburg et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>In addition to its conventional cargo-transporting activity, kinesin-1 has another essential function in reorganizing microtubules. Using its N-terminal motor domain and a second microtubule-binding site at the C-terminus of kinesin-1 heavy chain (KHC), kinesin-1 slides antiparallel microtubules against each other in many cell types (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Jolly et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Lu et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Lu et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Winding et al., 2016</xref>). Kinesin-driven microtubule sliding together with kinesin-driven cargo transport generates the force that drives fast cytoplasmic streaming of the ooplasm in late-stage <italic>Drosophila</italic> oocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Lu et al., 2016</xref>). Diffusion facilitated by streaming, rather than directed transport along microtubules, is responsible for the localization of posterior determinants during late oogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Lu et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Glotzer et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Forrest and Gavis, 2003</xref>).</p><p>Despite the necessity of directed transport and streaming, they are not sufficient for stable <italic>osk</italic>/Staufen accumulation at the posterior pole; an anchorage mechanism is required to counteract both diffusion and shear forces of the streaming ooplasm that can displace <italic>osk</italic>/Staufen from the posterior cap. <italic>osk</italic> mRNA anchorage has been suggested to be actin-dependent. Cortical localization of <italic>osk</italic>/Staufen is significantly reduced upon F-actin fragmentation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cha et al., 2002</xref>). An actin motor, myosin-V (<italic>didum</italic> in <italic>Drosophila</italic>), is involved in <italic>osk</italic> mRNA cortical localization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Krauss et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Sinsimer et al., 2013</xref>). However, myosin-V is uniformly localized at the oocyte cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Krauss et al., 2009</xref>); it is not clear why a uniformly distributed cortical anchor attaches <italic>osk/</italic>Staufen only at the posterior pole.</p><p>Genetic data suggest that kinesin-1 activity antagonizes the function of myosin-V as a cortical anchor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Krauss et al., 2009</xref>). In several other biological systems including neurons and pigment cells (melanophores), competition between long-distance transport along microtubules by kinesins and anchorage/local transport by myosin-V can direct the distribution of cellular cargoes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Rogers and Gelfand, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Wu et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kapitein et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">van Bergeijk et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Pathak et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bridgman, 1999</xref>). In the oocyte, kinesin-1 has been proposed to actively remove <italic>osk</italic> mRNA from the cortex (cortical exclusion) by transporting it along cortical-anchored microtubules towards plus-ends of microtubules in the cytoplasm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cha et al., 2002</xref>). This cortical exclusion function of kinesin-1 against myosin-V may explain <italic>osk</italic>/Staufen specific anchorage at the posterior pole.</p><p>In this study, we propose and directly test a unifying model that explains how <italic>osk</italic>/Staufen is transported in the oocyte and localized at the posterior pole. According to the model, myosin-V directly competes with kinesin-1 to achieve the correct posterior localization of <italic>osk</italic>/Staufen. Specifically, kinesin-1, walking along microtubules, removes <italic>osk</italic>/Staufen from the cortex, while myosin-V, walking along actin filaments that are randomly oriented in the cortical network, dynamically anchors <italic>osk</italic>/Staufen and counteracts kinesin-driven cortical clearance. Kinesin-1 wins this competition at the anterior and lateral regions where cortical microtubule density is higher; myosin-V wins over kinesin-1 at the posterior pole where microtubule tracks are less abundant.</p><p>We genetically modulate the motor activities of either kinesin-1 or myosin-V, and find that a proper balance between kinesin-1 and myosin-V activities is essential for <italic>osk</italic>/Staufen posterior localization. Using optogenetic tools we show that cortical microtubule density indeed controls <italic>osk</italic>/Staufen localization. Furthermore, using a synthetic complex that contains both myosin V and kinesin-1 motor domains, we demonstrate that these two motors are not only necessary but also sufficient for posterior localization in the oocyte. Thus, for the first time, we directly demonstrate that direct competition between an actin motor myosin-V and a microtubule motor kinesin-1 controls posterior determinant localization in <italic>Drosophila</italic> oocytes and that the outcome of this competition is determined by the local density of cortical microtubules.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Staufen localization is controlled by kinesin-1</title><p>If Staufen localization is defined by kinesin-myosin competition, it can be disrupted in a predictable way by modulating the activity of kinesin-1.

Cortical F-actin remodeling and Myosin-V, as well as the Arp1 subunit of the dynactin complex, have been all implicated in the <italic>osk</italic>/Staufen cortical localization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Krauss et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Nieuwburg et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Tanaka et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Tanaka and Nakamura, 2011</xref>). In this study, we combined genetic and optogenetic tools to demonstrate that direct competition between two motors, kinesin-1 and myosin-V, ensures the posterior anchorage of <italic>osk</italic>/Staufen. Notably, we demonstrate that the outcome of the competition is primarily determined by the density of cortical microtubules. High microtubule density at the anterior and lateral cortex favors kinesin-driven <italic>osk</italic>/Staufen cortical exclusion, while low microtubule density at the posterior pole favors myosin-driven cortical retention. Therefore, the kinesin-myosin competition and cortical microtubule density together determine the initial accumulation of <italic>osk</italic> mRNA at the posterior pole (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>).</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>Kinesin-driven delivery versus kinesin-driven cortical exclusion</title><p>The cortical exclusion model was first proposed after uniform cortical localization of <italic>osk</italic> mRNA was observed in the kinesin-null oocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cha et al., 2002</xref>).

These data support the model that kinesin-driven cortical exclusion along cortically-attached microtubules plays an essential role in restricting <italic>osk</italic>/Staufen to the posterior pole.</p><p>Previously, several groups have proposed that kinesin-1 transports <italic>osk</italic>/Staufen particles along slightly biased cortical microtubules, resulting in net movement of <italic>osk</italic>/Staufen from the anterior side to the posterior pole in stage 8–9 oocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Palacios and St Johnston, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Lu et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Zimyanin et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Parton et al., 2011</xref>). In fact, kinesin-driven cortical exclusion and kinesin-driven transport towards the posterior pole are not mutually exclusive; they describe the same event of <italic>osk</italic>/Staufen movement. Within the oocyte, cortical microtubules are anchored to the cortex by their minus-ends while their plus-ends face towards the cytoplasm. Due to the anterior-posterior gradient of cortical microtubule density, more microtubule plus ends are oriented towards the posterior pole (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Nashchekin et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Zimyanin et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Parton et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Khuc Trong et al., 2015</xref>). Thus, kinesin-1-driven transport along microtubules is a prerequisite for kinesin-1-driven cortical exclusion. Cortical exclusion of <italic>osk</italic>/Staufen by kinesin-1 results in biased transport of <italic>osk</italic>/Staufen towards the posterior pole (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Kinesin-myosin tug-of-war, oocyte style</title><p>This kinesin-myosin competition model is suggested by genetic interaction data from a previous study. Specifically, increasing KHC dosage enhances <italic>osk</italic>/Staufen mislocalization phenotypes in myosin-V loss-of-function mutants, while reducing KHC dosage by half partially suppresses myosin loss-of-function phenotypes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Krauss et al., 2009</xref>).

These data strongly imply that in the absence of kinesin-1, myosin-V promiscuously anchors <italic>osk/</italic>Staufen everywhere in the cortex. In this study, we manipulate the activity of either kinesin-1 or myosin-V, and find that proper balance between the activities of these two motors is critical for correct <italic>osk</italic>/Staufen localization, supporting the model in which kinesin-myosin competition is key to the correct posterior determination in the <italic>Drosophila</italic> oocyte.</p><p>The competition between kinesin-1 and myosin-V we described here is not the first example of such a mechanism for cargo transport and localization. For instance, myosin-V opposes microtubule-dependent transport and provides a dynamic anchor for melanosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Rogers and Gelfand, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Wu et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Wu et al., 1997</xref>), peroxisomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kapitein et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">van Bergeijk et al., 2015</xref>), recycling endosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">van Bergeijk et al., 2015</xref>), mitochondria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Pathak et al., 2010</xref>), and synaptic vesicles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bridgman, 1999</xref>) at sites of local accumulation of F-actin. At these sites, the abundance of F-actin tracks provides an upper hand for myosin-V to win the tug-of-wars over microtubule motors. Kinesin-myosin competition appears to be an evolutionarily conserved mechanism to allow flexible refinement and/or error correction, as motors constantly undergo reversible binding and releasing activity on cytoskeletal filaments.</p><p>In the oocytes, the machinery responsible for <italic>osk</italic>/Staufen localization contains the same basic building blocks; however, unlike the other systems, the outcome of the competition is not determined by actin filament density, as F-actin density is uniform along the oocyte cortex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). Instead, the outcome of this competition is decided by abundance of microtubule tracks. Higher microtubule density at the anterior and lateral cortex favors kinesin-mediated cortical removal of <italic>osk</italic>/Staufen, while scarcity of microtubule tracks at the posterior pole favors myosin-V-dependent anchoring. To confirm this model, we used optogenetic tools to recruit a microtubule-depolymerizing kinesin, kinesin-13/Klp10A, to actin cortex, and thus locally modulate cortical microtubule density. Locally decreasing cortical microtubule density causes ectopic accumulation of Staufen at the cortex. The loss of microtubules prevents kinesin-driven cortical exclusion, which allows myosin-V to win the competition and form a patch of cortically localized Staufen. This recruitment of Staufen is reversible and repeatable, indicating this kinesin-myosin competition is continuous, and the outcome of this never-ending battle is decided by the local microtubule concentration.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Competition between kinesin-1 and myosin-V is sufficient for initial anchoring at the posterior pole</title><p>Previously, synthetic motor domains of a plus-end motor, kinesin-1, and a minus-end motor, kinesin-14/Nod, were used to label overall microtubule polarity in <italic>Drosophila</italic> oocytes and neurons (Kin:βGal and Nod:βGal) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Clark et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Clark et al., 1997</xref>).

Images were acquired every 0.5 µm/step in Z stacks.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We thank Dr. Chris Q Doe (University of Oregon) for anti-Staufen antibody, Dr. Helge Ewers (Freie Universität Berlin) for tubulin nanobody, Dr. Jill C Wildonger (University of Wisconsin-Madison) for <italic>Khc<sup>Δhinge2</sup></italic> line, Dr. Anne Ephrussi (EMBL) for <italic>FRT42B didum<sup>88</sup></italic>, <italic>UASp-MyoV.FL-GFP</italic> lines, Dr. Yukiko Yamashita (University of Michigan) for <italic>vasa-Gal4</italic> (II) line, Dr. Allan C Spradling (Carnegie Institution for Science) for <italic>vasa-Gal4</italic> (III) line, Dr. Uri Abdu (Ben-Gurion University) for <italic>UASp-GFP-Patronin</italic> line, Dr. Daniel St Johnston (University of Cambridge) for <italic>mat αtub-RFP-Staufen</italic> line, the Bloomington <italic>Drosophila</italic> Stock Center (supported by National Institutes of Health grant P40OD018537) for fly stocks, and <italic>Drosophila</italic> Genomics Resource Center (supported by NIH grant 2P40OD010949) for cDNA clones.

Although genetic studies have indicated antagonistic roles of Kinesin-1 and myosin-V in <italic>oskar</italic> and staufen localization, there remained puzzles as to how this can be achieved, such as why myosin-V that shows even distribution can specifically localize <italic>oskar</italic>/staufen at a specific (posterior) place in the oocyte. In this study, Gelfand and colleagues show that the competition between microtubule-mediated transport by kinesin-1 and actin-based anchoring by Myosin-V determines posterior localization of <italic>oskar</italic> and staufen. This is primarily determined by density of microtubules at the cortex.</p><p>Their conclusion is well-supported by well-executed experiments. In a sense, this paper's conclusion can be predicted by synthesizing previous studies but this is the first to really nail the mechanisms. And the feeling of 'it could have been predicted' only reflects the elegance of this work (often, a very clear study gives this impression-'we should have known!') instead of the lack of novelty. Optogenetic manipulation of microtubule-density at a local spot of oocyte is particularly elegant. I really do not have any major comments, and I think this is an important contribution to the field.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>The manuscript by Lu et al. uses elegant experimental approaches to tie up loose ends about how <italic>oskar</italic> RNA becomes localized to the posterior of the <italic>Drosophila</italic> oocyte in order to create the germ plasm. This in turn is essential for the patterning of the embryonic A-P body axis and the development of the germline. To date, there is good evidence that <italic>oskar</italic> is transported by kinesin motors on a weakly polarized microtubule cytoskeleton, resulting in a biased random walk that leads to its ultimate accumulation at the posterior pole. There is also evidence that the retention (anchoring) of <italic>oskar</italic> RNA at the posterior of the oocyte depends on the cortical actin cytoskeleton and the MyoV motor. This work answers the question of why <italic>oskar</italic> becomes anchored only at the posterior when actin and MyoV are uniformly distributed around the periphery of the oocyte. The idea that kinesin drives <italic>oskar</italic> away from the cortex, where it can otherwise &quot;stick&quot; has already been proposed so the paper does not provide a major conceptual leap. But it does uncover the molecular underpinnings that support this model through the use of constructs that allow the authors to manipulate kinesin and MyoV activity as well as the use of optogenetic recruitment of a depolymerizing kinesin to locally deplete microtubules at the cortex and the use of a dimerized Khc-MyoV to test their competition model. The latter two experiments, and particularly the local depletion of microtubules, are the most compelling and provide the most conclusive evidence for a tug of war between kinesin and MyoV.</p><p>Overall the data are solid, although a number of issues need to be addressed. Most of these relate to interpretations of results and/or conclusions drawn (see below). In addition, there are many instances where the authors need to be more careful about citing or interpreting previous work.</p><p>1) In Figure 1—figure supplement 1B, the cortical distribution of Staufen is not very obvious – this same pattern of fluorescence can be generated with uniformly distributed protein due to edge effects. Cortical localization of <italic>oskar</italic> and Staufen in khc germline clones has been more convincingly documented by others. Why don't the authors perform FISH for <italic>oskar</italic>, which would provide superior resolution to anti-Staufen IF.</p><p>Similarly, in Figures 2L-N and particularly in Figure 3H, it isn't at all clear whether Staufen is really cortical or uniformly distributed throughout the oocyte. The authors should confirm using <italic>oskar</italic> FISH.</p><p>2) The distribution shown in Figure 1—figure supplement 1E, F could be equally well explained by delayed localization. The &quot;bump&quot; in the middle is consistent with a delay as is the finding that the distribution at stage 10 is wild-type. Also, the term displaced indicates that <italic>oskar</italic> was localized and then removed from the posterior, which is most likely not the case.</p><p>Further consistent with a delay in localization is the observation that &quot;later in development (at stage 10B) normal Staufen distribution is recovered with the restoration of the posterior cap and clearing of the central cytoplasmic aggregate (Figure 1F-1H; Figure 1—figure supplement 1G-1H)&quot;.</p><p>Similarly, the conclusion: &quot;…we show that constitutively active kinesin-1 causes <italic>osk</italic>/Staufen detachment from the posterior pole (Figure 1),…&quot; is not correct.&quot; The data show that Staufen is not properly localized at the posterior, not that it has become detached.</p><p>3) The authors focus a lot of attention on the idea of a microtubule gradient, but they don't actually test whether a graded distribution of microtubules is relevant – they only test the differential between having microtubules and not having microtubules.</p><p>See also: &quot;Together, these data demonstrate that <italic>osk</italic>/Staufen localization is controlled by the microtubule gradient in the oocyte. Decreased density of cortical microtubules favors myosin-V resulting in uniform cortical localization of <italic>osk</italic>/Staufen, whereas increased microtubule density favors kinesin-1 resulting in exclusion of <italic>osk</italic>/Staufen from the cortex.&quot;</p><p>If the gradient was relevant, one would expect to see a graded distribution of Staufen at the cortex of wild-type oocytes. The wording should be changed to reflect whether there are/aren't microtubules rather the gradient of microtubules.</p><p>4) Figure 5D: It looks like much more than &quot;some cortical localization of MyoVHMM remains at the anterior and lateral cortex. Shouldn't it accumulate around the entire cortex (like wild-type MyoV) if it is not dimerized with KHC576? Why is there such a high concentration specifically at the anterior?</p><p>5) Introduction section: The authors state that posterior localization of <italic>oskar</italic> &quot;is maintained throughout late oogenesis (stage 10B to stage 13)&quot;. Oogenesis progresses through 14 stages and <italic>oskar</italic> is maintained through stage 14.</p><p>6) The statement that Staufen is &quot;commonly used as a marker for posterior determination&quot; is not correct. This should be changed to &quot;Staufen is commonly used as a proxy for <italic>oskar</italic> RNA&quot;.</p><p>7) The statement that &quot;kinesin-1 has been proposed to drive the <italic>osk</italic> mRNA transport along these cortical microtubules from the anterior to the posterior pole&quot; is an oversimplified and misleading interpretation of published data. In addition, it could easily be taken to mean that microtubules span the length of the oocyte from anterior to posterior pole. The current model indicates that <italic>oskar</italic> is localized by a random walk on a weakly polarized microtubule cytoskeleton. Zimyanin et al., 2008, showed that <italic>oskar</italic> RNA &quot;is actively transported along microtubules in all directions, with a slight bias toward the posterior&quot;. In addition, Ghosh et al., 2012, analyzed the motility of <italic>oskar</italic> RNA and derivatives with mutations in localization elements and concluded that for both the wild-type and mutants: &quot;we did not detect a statistically significant net posterior vector.&quot;</p><p>Same issue with the sentence in the Discussion.</p><p>8) The statement that &quot;Kinesin-driven microtubule sliding generates the force that drives fast ooplasmic streaming of the ooplasm in late-stage <italic>Drosophila</italic> oocytes&quot; is an oversimplification of their own lab's work. In Lu et al., 2016, the authors conclude that &quot;This microtubule motility and kinesin-1-based organelle transport together generate the forces required to drive oocyte cytoplasmic streaming&quot;.</p><p>9) The statement &quot;Streaming, rather than directed transport along microtubules, is responsible for the localization of posterior determinants during late oogenesis&quot; should be referenced to Glotzer et al., 1997 and Forrest and Gavis, 2003. In addition, it is diffusion facilitated by streaming, not streaming per se that is responsible.</p><p>10) For the statement &quot;An actin motor, myosin-V (didum in <italic>Drosophila</italic>), is involved in <italic>osk</italic> mRNA cortical localization,&quot; the citation should include Sinsimer et al., 2013, in addition to Krauss et al.</p><p>11) The statement that &quot;This finding agrees with a previous study using ectopic expression of Khc<sup>ΔHinge2</sup> in the Khc null background&quot; is incorrect.

Except for point 1 by reviewer 2, all comments can be addressed by modifications to texts. Thus, we would like to invite you to submit a revised version of the manuscript. In doing so, we would like you to pay special attention to describing/summarizing past studies. In some cases, the description of past work was not sufficient, failing to convey what is exactly novel/unique about this work.</p><p>Reviewer #1:</p><p>mRNA localization is a critical mechanism to determine the oocyte polarity (future body plan and germ line determination) during <italic>Drosophila</italic> oogenesis. Although genetic studies have indicated antagonistic roles of Kinesin-1 and myosin-V in oskar and staufen localization, there remained puzzles as to how this can be achieved, such as why myosin-V that shows even distribution can specifically localize oskar/staufen at a specific (posterior) place in the oocyte. In this study, Gelfand and colleagues show that the competition between microtubule-mediated transport by kinesin-1 and actin-based anchoring by Myosin-V determines posterior localization of oskar and staufen. This is primarily determined by density of microtubules at the cortex.</p><p>Their conclusion is well-supported by well-executed experiments. In a sense, this paper's conclusion can be predicted by synthesizing previous studies but this is the first to really nail the mechanisms. And the feeling of 'it could have been predicted' only reflects the elegance of this work (often, a very clear study gives this impression-'we should have known!') instead of the lack of novelty. Optogenetic manipulation of microtubule-density at a local spot of oocyte is particularly elegant. I really do not have any major comments, and I think this is an important contribution to the field.</p><p>Reviewer #2:</p><p>The manuscript by Lu et al. uses elegant experimental approaches to tie up loose ends about how oskar RNA becomes localized to the posterior of the <italic>Drosophila</italic> oocyte in order to create the germ plasm. This in turn is essential for the patterning of the embryonic A-P body axis and the development of the germline. To date, there is good evidence that oskar is transported by kinesin motors on a weakly polarized microtubule cytoskeleton, resulting in a biased random walk that leads to its ultimate accumulation at the posterior pole. There is also evidence that the retention (anchoring) of oskar RNA at the posterior of the oocyte depends on the cortical actin cytoskeleton and the MyoV motor. This work answers the question of why oskar becomes anchored only at the posterior when actin and MyoV are uniformly distributed around the periphery of the oocyte. The idea that kinesin drives oskar away from the cortex, where it can otherwise &quot;stick&quot; has already been proposed so the paper does not provide a major conceptual leap. But it does uncover the molecular underpinnings that support this model through the use of of constructs that allow the authors to manipulate kinesin and MyoV activity as well as the use of optogenetic recruitment of a depolymerizing kinesin to locally deplete microtubules at the cortex and the use of a dimerized Khc-MyoV to test their competition model. The latter two experiments, and particularly the local depletion of microtubules, are the most compelling and provide the most conclusive evidence for a tug of war between kinesin and MyoV.</p><p>Overall the data are solid, although a number of issues need to be addressed. Most of these relate to interpretations of results and/or conclusions drawn (see below). In addition, there are many instances where the authors need to be more careful about citing or interpreting previous work.</p><p>1) In Figure 1—figure supplement 1B, the cortical distribution of Staufen is not very obvious – this same pattern of fluorescence can be generated with uniformly distributed protein due to edge effects. Cortical localization of oskar and Staufen in khc germline clones has been more convincingly documented by others. Why don't the authors perform FISH for oskar, which would provide superior resolution to anti-Staufen IF.</p><p>Similarly, in Figures 2L-N and particularly in Figure 3H, it isn't at all clear whether Staufen is really cortical or uniformly distributed throughout the oocyte. The authors should confirm using oskar FISH.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this comment. Here we have to admit that our original cortical Staufen staining in KHC-RNAi mutant is not as obvious as previously published <italic>Khc</italic> germline clones using <italic>osk</italic> FISH (e.g., Cha et al., 2002). Based on our <italic>osk</italic> FISH staining in the previously published study, we observed no major difference in image quality between <italic>osk</italic> FISH and anti-Staufen IF (Lu et al., 2018, compared Figure S4S-T (<italic>osk</italic> FISH) to Figure S5F-G (anti-Staufen IF)). We think the major reason for inferior cortical Staufen staining in the original manuscript was that we used a spinning disk confocal microscopy for the Staufen imaging, which resulted in sub-optimal z-resolution. To improve the image quality, we re-imaged the Staufen staining using A1-plus confocal scanning microscope with a GaAsP detector. We found better examples of the uniform cortical Staufen localization in KHC-RNAi and Klp10A overexpressing samples and partial cortical Staufen staining in MyoVΔ1017-1114 overexpression samples. As a result, we have updated Figure 2, Figure 3 and Figure 1—figure supplement 1 with the new Staufen staining images.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) The distribution shown in Figure 1—figure supplement 1E, F could be equally well explained by delayed localization. The &quot;bump&quot; in the middle is consistent with a delay as is the finding that the distribution at stage 10 is wild-type. Also, the term displaced indicates that oskar was localized and then removed from the posterior, which is most likely not the case.</p><p>Further consistent with a delay in localization is the observation that &quot;later in development (at stage 10B) normal Staufen distribution is recovered with the restoration of the posterior cap and clearing of the central cytoplasmic aggregate (Figure 1F-1H; Figure 1—figure supplement 1G-1H)&quot;.</p><p>Similarly, the conclusion: &quot;…we show that constitutively active kinesin-1 causes osk/Staufen detachment from the posterior pole (Figure 1),…&quot; is not correct.&quot; The data show that Staufen is not properly localized at the posterior, not that it has become detached.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this comment. We have replaced “displace” with “mislocalize”, and replaced “detachment” with “mislocalization”.</p><p>Regarding the possible delayed localization instead of mislocalization, we believe it is less likely for two reasons:</p><p>1) At stage 8 (before the posterior localization is achieved), we never observed Staufen staining as a “bump” (cytoplasmic aggregation) in the control; instead it is “cloudy” cytoplasmic localization. Therefore, Staufen aggregation in the cytoplasm in <italic>Khc<sup>Δhinge2</sup></italic> clone (stage 9) does not resemble the control at the earlier stage (stage 8).</p><p>2) The rescue of Staufen localization observed in <italic>Khc<sup>Δhinge2</sup></italic> 10B oocytes is mostly driven by streaming circulation. At stage 10B, the microtubules reorganize dramatically and it would be very difficult to achieve the posterior accumulation based on kinesin-driven transport at stage 10B.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) The authors focus a lot of attention on the idea of a microtubule gradient, but they don't actually test whether a graded distribution of microtubules is relevant – they only test the differential between having microtubules and not having microtubules.</p><p>See also: &quot;Together, these data demonstrate that osk/Staufen localization is controlled by the microtubule gradient in the oocyte. Decreased density of cortical microtubules favors myosin-V resulting in uniform cortical localization of osk/Staufen, whereas increased microtubule density favors kinesin-1 resulting in exclusion of osk/Staufen from the cortex.&quot;</p><p>If the gradient was relevant, one would expect to see a graded distribution of Staufen at the cortex of wild-type oocytes. The wording should be changed to reflect whether there are/aren't microtubules rather the gradient of microtubules.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer that what controls Staufen localization is the absolute density of microtubule tracks. Based on our optogenetic experiment, local microtubule density is the key to determine whether Staufen would be cortically localized. To avoid any confusion, we have replaced the “microtubule gradient” with “microtubule density” discussing the motor competition. We still keep the term “microtubule gradient” in other contents (Introduction and reference to other’s work, etc) just to keep it consistent with previously published literature.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) Figure 5D: It looks like much more than &quot;some cortical localization of MyoVHMM remains at the anterior and lateral cortex. Shouldn't it accumulate around the entire cortex (like wild-type MyoV) if it is not dimerized with KHC576? Why is there such a high concentration specifically at the anterior?</p></disp-quote><p>In fact, for the MyoVHMM channel, we did observe accumulation around the entire cortex (like wild-type MyoV). The slightly higher concentration at the anterior cortex could be due to its proximity to the ring canals where the MyoVHMM is transported to the oocyte. Here we used the term “at the anterior and lateral cortex” to distinguish from the posterior cortex where KHC576 accumulates after rapalog treatment.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) Introduction section: The authors state that posterior localization of oskar &quot;is maintained throughout late oogenesis (stage 10B to stage 13)&quot;.

In addition, it could easily be taken to mean that microtubules span the length of the oocyte from anterior to posterior pole. The current model indicates that oskar is localized by a random walk on a weakly polarized microtubule cytoskeleton. Zimyanin et al., 2008, showed that oskar RNA &quot;is actively transported along microtubules in all directions, with a slight bias toward the posterior&quot;. In addition, Ghosh et al., 2012, analyzed the motility of oskar RNA and derivatives with mutations in localization elements and concluded that for both the wild-type and mutants: &quot;we did not detect a statistically significant net posterior vector.&quot;</p></disp-quote><p>We have modified the Introduction to better reflect the current model in the field: “The anterior-posterior gradient of cortical microtubules results in slightly more microtubule plus ends oriented towards the posterior pole.

In Lu et al., 2016, the authors conclude that &quot;This microtubule motility and kinesin-1-based organelle transport together generate the forces required to drive oocyte cytoplasmic streaming&quot;.</p></disp-quote><p>We have corrected the statement in the Introduction to: “Kinesin-driven microtubule sliding together with kinesin-driven cargo transportgenerates the force that drives fast cytoplasmic streaming of the ooplasm in late-stage <italic>Drosophila</italic> oocytes”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>9) The statement &quot;Streaming, rather than directed transport along microtubules, is responsible for the localization of posterior determinants during late oogenesis&quot; should be referenced to Glotzer et al., 1997 and Forrest and Gavis, 2003. In addition, it is diffusion facilitated by streaming, not streaming per se that is responsible.</p></disp-quote><p>We apologize for missing out these two key references.

The main reason for this discrepancy is that tubulin immunostaining in addition to microtubules also detects the soluble tubulin pool (which, obviously, does not form the gradient). To overcome this problem, we use a protein trap line of an endogenous MAP (Jupiter-GFP, ZCL2183) to visualize microtubules in the oocyte. Using Jupiter-GFP, we demonstrated a clear anterior-posterior gradient of microtubules at stage 9 (added as Figure 3—figure supplement1A).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) More information should be given about the ultimate phenotypic consequences of the genetic manipulations. In particular, do Khc<sup>ΔHinge2</sup> oocytes (Figure 1G) complete development and support embryogenesis? If so are the resulting embryos normal or posterior-group in phenotype?

We believe that detailed discussion of these data would distract the readers from the main message of this paper.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) The authors should discuss why they think Stau aggregates in the centre of the oocyte when microtubule density is increased. Also, does the central aggregation of Stau in OE Patronin oocytes (Figure 3I) later resolve itself as it does for Khc<sup>ΔHinge2</sup>? If not can the authors speculate as to why not, and does this affect the argument they propose at the end of the third paragraph in subsection “Staufen localization is controlled by kinesin-1”.</p></disp-quote><p>According to our model, <italic>osk</italic>/Staufen aggregation in Patronin overexpression is caused by increased microtubule density at the posterior pole, which in turn allows kinesin-1 to win over myosin-V and translocate the <italic>osk</italic>/Staufen particles from the posterior pole to the microtubules plus-ends. As most of the microtubule plus-ends are pointing towards the centre of the oocyte, <italic>osk</italic>/Staufen accumulates in the middle of the oocyte. We have included a brief explanation of the cytoplasmic aggregation in Patronin overexpression: “This increase of microtubule density causes the exclusion of Staufen from the entire cortex and forms aggregation in the center of the oocyte cytoplasm where most of the plus-ends of microtubules are pointing towards (Figure 3G, 3I and 3K).”.</p><p>Different from the <italic>Khc<sup>∆hinge2</sup></italic> mutant, these Patronin O/E oocytes do not restore the posterior cap. Instead, small Staufen aggregates get scattered in the cytoplasm at stage 10B, probably due to the shear force generated by streaming (see the attached image of Staufen staining at late stage 10B with Patronin overexpression). We speculate that the difference between <italic>Khc<sup>∆hinge2</sup></italic> mutant and Patronin O/E in late stages lies in the <italic>osk</italic>/Staufen cap formed at stage 9. Compared the Figure 1 (C and E) and Figure 3 (I and K), we found that the <italic>Khc<sup>∆hinge2</sup></italic> mutant forms a cap that is at a comparable intensity level to the cytoplasmic aggregation, while most of the Staufen is in the cytoplasmic aggregation in Patronin O/E mutant. This mini-cap at stage 9 in <italic>Khc<sup>∆hinge2</sup></italic> mutant can translate into Osk protein and therefore forms a positive feedback loop to attract more <italic>osk</italic>/Staufen during streaming. We have a brief explanation in the Results: “Previously, studies suggest that Osk protein, translated at the posterior pole, functions in a positive feedback mechanism for <italic>osk</italic>/Staufen accumulation in streaming oocytes. We postulate that enough Osk protein translates from the residual cap, initiating the positive feedback loop, while ooplasmic streaming circulates mislocalized <italic>osk</italic>/Staufen particles to the posterior cap, enhancing Osk localization, resulting the restoration of the posterior crescent.”</p><fig id="respfig1"><label>Author response image 1.</label><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-54216-resp-fig1-v2.tif"/></fig><p>In contrast, there may not be enough <italic>osk</italic> mRNA at the posterior pole of Patronin O/E mutant at stage 9 and therefore it fails to initiate the positive feedback loop using translated Osk protein.
