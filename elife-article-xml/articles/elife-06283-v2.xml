First, copies of the DNA are made using another molecule called ribonucleic acid (RNA) in a process known as transcription. Then the RNA is used as a template to make a protein. During transcription, enzymes called RNA polymerases move along the DNA to produce the RNA copies.</p><p>When a cell is actively growing it needs large quantities of new proteins to be made, and so the level of transcription is higher. However, if a cell experiences stress caused by adverse environmental conditions (e.g., high temperatures), it can conserve resources by shutting down transcription. For example, one RNA polymerase—called Pol III—makes RNA copies with the help of a protein called BRF1 and several other proteins. However, when a cell is under stress, another protein called MAF1 can interfere with transcription by binding to BRF1, which prevents it from interacting with Pol III.</p><p>Previous work has suggested that MAF1 can also inhibit the activity of another RNA polymerase called Pol II, but it was not clear how this could work. Lee et al. studied the effect of MAF1 on transcription in human cells. The experiments show that MAF1 blocks the transcription of many genes that are transcribed by Pol II, including one called <italic>CDKN1A</italic>.</p><p><italic>CDKN1A</italic> is involved in regulating many important processes, including the growth of cells and cell death. Cells that produced lower amounts of MAF1 had higher levels of <italic>CDKN1A</italic> transcription<italic>,</italic> and several proteins—including Pol II, Pol III and BRF1—were more able to bind to this gene. However, this effect was not observed in cells that also produced lower levels of Pol III or BRF1, suggesting that Pol III is needed for Pol II to be able to transcribe <italic>CDKN1A</italic>.</p><p>Taken together, Lee et al.'s findings suggest that MAF1 inhibits the transcription of <italic>CDKN1A</italic>, and possibly other genes transcribed by Pol II, by regulating the activity of Pol III. Further research is needed to understand the details of how this works.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.06283.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.06283.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author keywords</title><kwd>MAF1</kwd><kwd>Pol III</kwd><kwd>CDKN1A</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100002338</institution-id><institution>Ministry of Education of the People's Republic of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Aim for the Top University Plan</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Hsu</surname><given-names>Ming-Ta</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004866</institution-id><institution>National Research Program for Biopharmaceuticals (NRPB)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>High-throughput Genome Analysis Core Facility (NSC-102-2319-B-010-001)</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Hsu</surname><given-names>Ming-Ta</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.3</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Pol II-mediated transcription and chromatin looping of CDKN1A are repressed by MAF1 through the regulation of Pol III activity.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Transcription by RNA polymerase III (Pol III) is regulated by MAF1, which is a highly conserved protein in eukaryotes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Pluta et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Reina et al., 2006</xref>). MAF1 represses Pol III transcription through association with BRF1, a subunit of initiation factor TFIIIB, which prevents attachment of TFIIIB onto DNA. This interaction also inhibits Pol III from binding to BRF1, which in turn prevents recruitment of Pol III to Pol III promoters. Furthermore, MAF1 also inhibits Pol III transcription through direct binding with Pol III, which interferes with the recruitment of Pol III to the assembled TFIIIB/DNA complexes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Desai et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Vannini et al., 2010</xref>). In addition, association of MAF1 with Pol III-transcribed genes has been detected genome-wide concomitant with an increase in occupation during repression; this indicates that direct interaction of MAF1 with Pol III genes is also an important attribute of repression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Roberts et al., 2006</xref>).</p><p>MAF1 has also been proposed to have the potential to repress Pol II-mediated transcription via repression of <italic>TBP</italic> transcription due to binding of MAF1 to the Elk-1 site on the <italic>TBP</italic> promoter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Johnson et al., 2007</xref>). Thus, to investigate the potential regulatory role of MAF1 in Pol II genes, we carried out <italic>MAF1</italic> knockdown coupled with microarray analysis. Microarray analysis showed that 124 genes were upregulated and 170 genes were downregulated more than twofold after <italic>MAF1</italic> knockdown. Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA) indicated that most of these genes are related to cell proliferation. Among them, <italic>CDKN1A</italic> (also known as p21) was significantly upregulated and the mechanism of induced transcription of this gene after <italic>MAF1</italic> knockdown was further investigated.</p><p><italic>CDKN1A</italic> is a cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor that inhibits cell cycle progression through interaction with cyclins and cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs). As a member of the Cip and Kip family of CDK inhibitors, <italic>CDKN1A</italic> mediates p53-dependent cell-cycle arrest at the G<sub>1</sub> phase by inhibiting the activity of <italic>CDK2</italic> and <italic>CDK1</italic> (also known as <italic>CDC2</italic>). In addition, <italic>CDKN1A</italic> also inhibits the activity of proliferating cell nuclear antigen and blocks DNA synthesis and repair as well as cell-cycle progression. As a result, <italic>CDKN1A</italic> can regulate many cellular processes, such as proliferation, differentiation, apoptosis, metastasis, cell survival, and stem cell renewal. Expression of <italic>CDKN1A</italic> can be regulated at the transcriptional level by oncogenes and tumor suppressor proteins that bind various transcription factors to specific elements in response to a variety of intracellular and extracellular signals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abbas and Dutta, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Warfel and El-Deiry, 2013</xref>).</p><p>In this study, we showed that MAF1 can bind to the <italic>CDKN1A</italic> promoter to repress its transcription. Enhanced binding of Pol III after <italic>MAF1</italic> knockdown induced <italic>CDKN1A</italic> transcription and chromatin looping by recruiting common Pol II and Pol III transcription factors as well as binding of TBP, p300, CFP1, and PCAF, along with increase in histone modifications associated with gene activation. Simultaneous knockdown of Pol III and <italic>MAF1</italic> abolished both promoter looping and activation of <italic>CDKN1A</italic> transcription, which indicates that Pol III actively participated in regulation of Pol II genes. Similar results were observed in another cell proliferation-related gene, <italic>GDF15</italic>. These observations reveal a new type of gene regulation in which binding of MAF1 regulates Pol III-mediated transcriptional activation and chromatin looping of Pol II genes.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title><italic>MAF1</italic> knockdown strongly upregulated <italic>CDKN1A</italic> expression</title><p>To examine whether MAF1 has the potential to repress Pol II-transcribed genes, we first examined the knockdown effect of <italic>MAF1</italic> by quantitative RT-PCR (qRT-PCR) and immunoblot using multiple siRNAs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A,B</xref>).

Together, these results demonstrate that MAF1 can regulate <italic>CDKN1A</italic> expression in a variety of cell types independent of p53.</p><p><italic>CDKN1A</italic> activation after <italic>MAF1</italic> knockdown could be due either to interference of binding of transcription factors to the <italic>CDKN1A</italic> promoter by MAF1 or to the active recruitment or activation of Pol III after <italic>MAF1</italic> knockdown. To determine which of these two mechanisms are involved in this process, we carried out simultaneous knockdown of both <italic>MAF1</italic> and Pol III. The former mechanism would not be affected by the double knockdown, whereas the latter would be. The effect of Pol III knockdown was analyzed by qRT-PCR and immunoblot using multiple siRNA sequences (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1G,H</xref>). Simultaneous knockdown of Pol III and <italic>MAF1</italic> indeed abolished the induction of <italic>CDKN1A</italic> expression by knockdown of only <italic>MAF1</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B,C,E,F</xref>) in five different cell lines. A control experiment using two Pol III genes, pretRNA<sup>Tyr</sup> and pretRNA<sup>Leu</sup>, confirmed the efficiency of Pol III knockdown (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B,C,E,F</xref>). Knockdown of Pol III alone did not significantly affect <italic>CDKN1A</italic> expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). This result indicates that Pol III plays a critical role in activation of <italic>CDKN1A</italic> expression by <italic>MAF1</italic> knockdown.</p><p>Because mRNA levels can be affected by transcription, post-transcriptional processing as well as RNA turnover rate, upregulation of gene expression after <italic>MAF1</italic> knockdown could be due to post-transcriptional mechanisms other than transcription activation. To demonstrate that the induced <italic>CDKN1A</italic> expression indeed occurs at the transcriptional level, we analyzed the rate of nascent transcription by conducting a nuclear run-on experiment after <italic>MAF1</italic> knockdown or simultaneous knockdown of <italic>MAF1</italic> and Pol III. The run-on nascent RNA was labeled with biotin, affinity purified, and analyzed by RT-PCR. A negative control without biotin labeling was used. Consistent with qRT-PCR analysis, nascent transcription of <italic>CDKN1A</italic> was indeed induced after <italic>MAF1</italic> knockdown, whereas transcription of <italic>ACTB</italic> and <italic>TAF5</italic> was not affected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A,B</xref>).

Both in vivo gene expression and R-looping analysis as well as in vitro transcription using the HeLa nuclear extract and in vitro binding using purified MAF1 protein revealed that MAF1 represses <italic>CDKN1A</italic> and <italic>GDF15</italic> promoter activity by binding to the SINE repeats within their promoters. This result strongly indicates a novel transcription regulatory mechanism whereby MAF1 also acts as a specific repressor of some Pol II genes by binding to promoter-associated SINEs. Binding specificity was demonstrated by an in vitro DNA binding assay with purified MAF1 to wild-type <italic>CDKN1A</italic> and <italic>GDF15</italic> promoters and the lack of binding to promoters with mutations in the SINE. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time that MAF1 has been shown to bind to specific DNA sequences.</p><p>We also demonstrated that recruiting Pol III to SINEs in the 5′ flanking region is required to promote Pol II gene transcription, epigenetic modifications, and chromatin looping after <italic>MAF1</italic> knockdown. Recruitment of Pol III, positive regulatory factors, and common transcription factors (TBP and POLR2E) of Pol II and Pol III demonstrate a novel mechanism of activating Pol II genes through Pol III-mediated activation mechanism. Gene expression induced by chromatin remodeling through SINEs has also been described in neuronal genes that undergo acetylation of distal promoter SINEs by p300 to translocate genes to transcription factories (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Crepaldi et al., 2013</xref>). In our result, <italic>MAF1</italic> knockdown promoted recruitment of p300, which has been shown to promote acetylation of histone K27 and active transcription by Pol II. However, how extensively this mechanism regulates genes is currently unknown.</p><p>Histone H3K4me has been suggested to serve as a hallmark of enhancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Herz et al., 2012</xref>). Examination of ENCODE database revealed that this epigenetic mark was presented in both 5′ flanking regions of <italic>CDKN1A</italic>. Indeed the identified p53-binding site located between 1.4 kb and 2.3 kb upstream of <italic>CDKN1A</italic> has been identified as the enhancer region (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Melo et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Leveille et al., 2015</xref>). However, the SINE with the MAF1-binding site located at 2.65 kb upstream of short promoter exerted no enhancer activity in the luciferase assay prior to or after <italic>MAF1</italic> knockdown (data not shown). The chromatin looping we observed for <italic>CDKN1A</italic> and <italic>GDF15</italic> after <italic>MAF1</italic> knockdown may be mediated through the proximity and interaction between the sets of transcriptional factors recruited in the two 5′ flanking regions after chromatin remodeling as proposed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Crepaldi et al. (2013)</xref>.</p><p>Because the background expression of Pol II genes slightly decreased when Pol III was knockdown, Pol III may be able to regulate the expression of some minor alleles without MAF1 being bound to the promoter. However, it is difficult to unequivocally validate this possibility without specific technology that can efficiently separate different alleles in cells.</p><p>Human genome analysis indicated that 71% of genes contained SINEs in their promoter regions. Microarray analysis showed that 124 genes were upregulated after <italic>MAF1</italic> knockdown. Of these, 76% contained SINEs within the promoter region, which indicates the regulation potential of these genes by MAF1 and Pol III. However, microarray analysis of steady-state mRNA level alone is not sufficient to show whether these genes are directly regulated by MAF1 at the transcriptional level or as the result of downstream secondary effects. Further analysis using in vitro transcription, reporter gene analysis, and nuclear run-on would be required to unambiguously establish how general Pol II genes are regulated by MAF1 and Pol III. In vitro transcription using HeLa cell extracts with depletion or addition of specific transcription regulators could provide very strong support of the involvement of specific factors in transcription regulation.</p><p>Close proximity of Pol III genes to Pol II genes has been observed genome-wide (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Oler et al., 2010</xref>). Active Pol III-transcribed genes and non-coding RNAs often associate with Pol II transcription start sites. Pol II and its associated epigenetic marks are also present at active Pol III-transcribed genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Barski et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Raha et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Canella et al., 2012</xref>). This shows that there is common epigenetic regulation between these two types of transcription units, and the polymerases may work with one another to regulate gene expression. Indeed, cross-talk between Pol III and Pol II transcription factors, such as TFIIS in Pol III transcription, has also been reported in yeast and mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Ghavi-Helm et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Carriere et al., 2011</xref>). The core Pol III transcription factor TFIIIC can also directly regulate transcription from a Pol II promoter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Kleinschmidt et al., 2011</xref>). Binding of TFIIIC to SINE promoters has been shown to mediate the relocation and transcription of neuronal genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Crepaldi et al., 2013</xref>). <italic>RPPH1</italic>, to which BRF2, Pol III, GTF2B, and Pol II bind, can be transcribed by either Pol II or Pol III (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">James Faresse et al., 2012</xref>). Our results indicate that Pol III and Pol II association may have functional relevance for genome functional organization, because simultaneous knockdown of both Pol III and <italic>MAF1</italic> diminished the induced active transcription caused by knockdown of only <italic>MAF1</italic>. Furthermore, enhanced binding of TBP to TFIIIB and TFIIB can lead to formation of Pol III and Pol II complexes to initiate transcription (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Zhao et al., 2003</xref>). We propose that this type of SINE-associated-Pol II promoter architecture may introduce an additional layer of control in gene expression.</p><p>Recently, MAF1 was shown to be a negative regulator of transcription of all three polymerases, Pol I, Pol II, and Pol III, through mediating <italic>TBP</italic> expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Johnson et al., 2007</xref>). Johnson et al. showed that MAF1 binds to the Elk-1-binding site of the <italic>TBP</italic> promoter to prevent the binding of Elk-1. Indeed, there is a SINE with an A-box (−10 to +1) and B-box (−105 to −95) that encompass the Elk-1-binding site of the <italic>TBP</italic> promoter. In our analysis, <italic>MAF1</italic> knockdown only slightly increased <italic>TBP</italic> expression (1.6-fold) compared with the results reported by Johnson et al. (twofolds). This may be due to the already high expression of <italic>TBP</italic> in cell lines, and we did not detect binding of MAF1 to this active promoter.</p><p>Based on our results, we propose the following mechanism of control of Pol II gene transcription by MAF1 and Pol III: Before removal of MAF1 from SINEs, Pol II is in a transcriptionally engaged but paused state, where TBP/TFIIB is pre-assembled and remains at the promoter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Guenther et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Kwak et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Venters and Pugh, 2013</xref>). Removal of <italic>MAF1</italic> by knockdown then leads to recruitment of TFIIIB through enhanced binding of TBP; the shared surface of TBP then directs both Pol II and Pol III binding through association with TFIIB and TFIIIB, respectively. Further recruitment of active regulatory factors would then induce transcription by Pol II and Pol III. This model is consistent with those proposed by previous studies, which were based on a component of TBP-associated complexes, p300, interacting with SET1C-coupled histone modifications to activate <italic>CDKN1A</italic> transcription (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Abraham et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Tang et al., 2013</xref>).

Nuclei were isolated, and the pellets were resuspended in 1 ml of glycerol buffer (50 mM Tris-Cl, pH 8.3, 40% glycerol, 5 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, and 0.1 mM EDTA). 1 ml of transcription buffer (20 mM Tris-Cl, pH 8.0, 200 mM KCl, 5 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 4 mM dithiothreitol, 4 mM each of ATP, GTP, and CTP, 200 mM sucrose, and 20% glycerol) was added in the nuclei along with 10 μl of biotin-16-UTP or UTP for run-on reaction or negative control, respectively (Roche). After incubation at 29°C for 30 min, the reaction was terminated by the addition of 12 μl of 250 mM CaCl<sub>2</sub>, and 12 μl of RNase-free DNase I and incubated at 29°C for 10 min. To purify RNA, a TRIreagent extraction, phenol-chloroform extraction, and isopropanol (Sigma) precipitation were then performed. A small aliquot (5 μl from a total of 50 μl) was saved as input control. Dynabeads M-280 streptavidin (Invitrogen) were mixed with an equal volume of the isolated RNA samples for 20 min at 42°C for 20 min and 2 hr at room temperature. After washing with 15% formamide and 2× SSC, the beads were resuspended in 45 μl of nuclease-free water. Reverse transcription was performed by using superScript III RNase H—Reverse Transcriptase (Invitrogen). Total cDNA was then synthesized by means of random hexamer primed reverse transcription of captured molecules. The gel pictures were quantified with ImageJ (provided by NIH: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://imagej.nih.gov/ij/">http://imagej.nih.gov/ij/</ext-link>). The purified run-on products where normalized with internal control (<italic>GAPDH</italic>) to obtain the relative transcription levels for each gene.</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>Detection of R loops using non-denaturing bisulfite treatment</title><p>Knockdown assay was performed using siRNA obtained from MISSION RNA (Sigma). Inhibition of expression of Pol III (SASI_Hs01_00046568) and <italic>MAF1</italic> (SASI_Hs01_00135954) was achieved by transfection with Lipofectamine RNAiMax (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's protocol for 72 hr. DNA purification and single-stranded R loop foot-printing were carried out as previously described with slight modifications (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Yu et al., 2003</xref>). 500 ng of purified genomic DNA was bisulfite converted by adding CT Conversion Reagent from the EZ DNA Methylation-Gold Kit (Zymo Research; Irvine, CA) at 37°C for 16 hr in the dark. PCR amplified region for cloning is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A,F</xref> as foot-printing region. The PCR product was gel eluted and ligated to sequencing vector yT&amp;A (Sigma). Approximately, 20 individual clones were sequenced for all PCR products, and the sequencing data were analyzed and aligned to <italic>CDKN1A</italic> or <italic>ACTB</italic> genomic sequence. The sequence of the beginning and end of each clone is trimmed due to low quality of sequencing. A background conversion (approximately 5% of cytosine) may be seen possibly due to DNA breathing during the prolonged incubation at 37°C in our data and others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Yu et al., 2003</xref>). Approximately, 1–2 clones showed both cytosine to thymine and guanine to adenine conversions, which is known as ‘mosaic molecules’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Yu et al., 2003</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-10"><title>ChIP and qPCR</title><p>ChIP assay was performed according to the manufacturer's protocol (Upstate Biotechnology, Inc.; Lake Placid, NY) with slight modifications. Human MCF-7 cells were fixed with 1% of formaldehyde at room temperature for 10 min. The cells were lysed and the chromatin was sonicated to 200–500 bp fragments by Bioruptor sonicator (cycle condition of 25 s on and 25 s off in a total of 25 min at highest output). Chromatin was immunoprecipitated by using Pol III (ab96328, Abcam), Pol II (ab5131, Abcam), MAF1 (GTX106776, Acris), H3K4me3 (04–745, Millipore; Billerica, MA), H3K27me3 (ABE44, Millipore), TBP (ab28175, Abcam), H3K9Ace (06–942, Millipore), H3K27Ace (07–360, Millipore), CFP1 (ABE211, Millipore), p300 (05–257, Millipore), POLR2E (ab180151, Abcam) BRF1 (ab74221, Abcam)or IgG (ab46540, Abcam) antibody, with 10 μg/ml of BSA and 50 μl of Dynabeads Protein A and G (Invitrogen) for overnight at 4°C. The beads were washed once with each washing buffer, including low salt immune complex wash buffer, high salt immune complex wash buffer, and LiCl immune complex wash buffer, and twice with 1× TE buffer. Precipitates were eluted with 1% of SDS and 100 mM of NaHCO<sub>3</sub>. Proteinase K was added to the samples, and rotated at 65°C for 2 hr followed by 95°C for 10 min and cooled down to room temperature. RNase A was added and samples were incubated at 37°C for 1 hr. After genomic DNA extraction, qPCR was performed. The degree of enrichment is calculated relative to the ratio of signals obtained in the input DNA fraction subtracting IgG-immunoprecipitated DNA.</p></sec><sec id="s4-11"><title>3C assay</title><p>3C assay was performed according to (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Dekker et al., 2002</xref>) with some modifications. MCF-7 cells were fixed in 2% formaldehyde for 10 min at room temperature and quench with 0.125 M glycine. After centrifugation for 15 min at 3500 rpm, the cells were suspended in lysis buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0, 10 mM NaCl, 0.2% Nonidet P-40 and 1:500 Complete protease inhibitor cocktail; Roche) for 90 min on ice. Next, the nuclei were pelleted by centrifugation for 15 min at 2500 rpm, resuspended in 500 μl of 1× NEB buffer 4 plus 0.3% SDS and incubated at 37°C for 1 hr. After the addition of Triton-X to a final concentration of 1.8% to sequester the SDS, the mixture was incubated at 37°C for 1 hr, which was followed by the addition of 800 U of PstI and incubation at 37°C overnight to digest the chromatin. The reaction was terminated by adding SDS to a final volume of 1.6% and then the solution heated to 65°C for 20 min. Ligation of DNA in situ was carried out using 0.5–2.0 ng/μl of chromatin in 800 μl of ligation buffer (NEB; Ipswich, MA) plus 1% Triton-X and 30 Weiss Units of T4 ligase (NEB) for 4 hr at 16°C. After reversing of the crosslinks with proteinase K digestion at 65°C overnight, the DNA was purified by phenol-chloroform extraction and ethanol precipitation. The ligation products were detected by PCR using primers located near Pst1 cutting sites. The PCR products were purified from an agarose gel, cloned and sequenced.</p></sec><sec id="s4-12"><title>In vitro DNA binding assay coupled with immunoprecipitation and qPCR</title><p><italic>CDKN1A</italic> (with or without MIR3), <italic>ACTB</italic>, <italic>GDF15</italic> (including deleted or mutated A-box) and <italic>RPPH1</italic> template DNA was obtained by PCR followed by gel elution (Qiagen; Venlo, Netherlands) according to the manufacturer's protocol.

The in vitro protein-DNA binding assay coupled with immunoprecipitation was performed as following: 20 ng of DNA template, 400 ng of MAF1 protein (His tag) (80R-1955, Cantor Fitzgerald; New York, NY), 400 ng of Anti-6X His tag antibody (ab18184, Abcam), protease inhibitor (539134, Calbiochem; La Jolla, CA), and 200 ng of BSA was added into 50 μl of binding buffer (20 mM HEPES [pH7.6], 150 mM NaCl, 0.25 mM EDTA, 10% glycerol, 0.2% NP40, and 1 mM DTT). A negative control was performed by substituting IgG antibody for Anti-6× His tag antibody (Protein + IgG) or with only the Anti-6× His tag antibody for the MAF1 protein (Ab only). The mixture was rotated at 4°C for 10 min and on ice for 30 min. 10 μl of Dynabeads Protein G (Invitrogen) was added to the mixture and rotated at 4°C for 10 min and on ice for 30 min. The immunoprecipitated DNA-protein complexes were then washed twice with washing buffer (20 mM Tris [pH 7.5], 0.25 mM EDTA, 10% glycerol, and 0.2% NP40) and once with TE buffer by each rotating at 4°C for 5 min. Elution was performed with 1% of SDS and 0.1 M of NAHCO<sub>3</sub>. Input DNA was prepared as 1 ng of template DNA (5% of 20 ng). Proteinase K was added to the samples, and rotated at 65°C for 2 hr followed by 95°C for 10 min and cooled down to room temperature.

Your article has been evaluated by James Manley (Senior editor) and four reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors.</p><p>The Reviewing editor and the other reviewers discussed their comments before we reached this decision, and the Reviewing editor has assembled the following comments to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>The reviewers found the findings to be potentially exciting as they extend and expand thinking about how protein-coding genes are transcribed, in particular a novel role for RNA polymerase III in this process. Overall, this report presents some exciting new findings that are very timely in view of (i) extensive ChIPseq data in the literature demonstrating the localization of components of the Pol III transcription machinery adjacent to Pol II-transcribed genes and (ii) the widespread localization of SINE elements (of unknown function) in the human genome and near promoters. However, the reviewers found several issues that must be addressed in the revised manuscript before it could be recommended for publication:</p><p>1) The possible role of p53. The two genes examined throughout the manuscript, <italic>CDKN1A</italic> and <italic>GDF15</italic>, are the two most potently transcribed p53 target genes (Allen et al., <italic>eLife</italic> 2014). However, the authors do not examine the effects that p53 may play in their system. It is entirely possible that most of the effects described upon <italic>MAF1</italic> knockdown are driven indirectly by activation of p53 downstream of a cellular stress response caused by deregulated RNAPIII function. The authors should check for p53 induction upon <italic>MAF1</italic> knockdown. Key experiments should be repeated in an isogenic system -/+ p53. This could be done with stable p53 knockdown MCF7 cells (Agami et al.) or HCT116 p53 -/+ cells (Vogelstein et al.).</p><p>2) Promoter definition. The authors indicate that ‘Examination of <italic>CDKN1A</italic> gene shows that there are two promoter regions (hereafter referred as long and short form)’. This description contrasts with many earlier reports that clearly show a major promoter for <italic>CDKN1A</italic> with minor alternative start sites. What exactly are the long and short forms? What NM genebank reference numbers do they correspond to? Where are they located relative to the well-characterized p53 enhancers? Importantly, the authors show equivalent Ser5-phospho-RNAPII binding to both promoters, but high H3K4me3 and TBP binding are found only at the downstream promoter encoding the ‘short form’, indicating that this promoter is the functional promoter. Confusingly, although the authors show equivalent binding of Ser5-phospho-RNAPII to both promoters, RBP5, a subunit common to all three polymerases is found preferentially at the downstream promoter. How much RNA is being produced from the ‘long’ and ‘short’ promoters? Some form of quantitative assay should be done to define the relative strength and RNA output of these two ‘promoters’.</p><p>3) Massive misinterpretation of ‘chromatin looping’ data. The authors repeatedly state throughout the manuscript (including the Title) a cause-effect relationship between chromatin looping and gene activation. They state in a subheading of the results that ‘<italic>MAF1</italic> knockdown enhanced <italic>CDKN1A</italic> gene expression from both long and short form promoters through Pol III-mediated promoter looping’. In the next subheading they repeat: ‘<italic>MAF1</italic> knockdown enhanced <italic>GDF15</italic> gene expression through PolIII-mediated promoter looping’. This is a massive misinterpretation of data, because there is no experiment showing a cause-effect relationship between looping and gene activity, only a correlation. The authors state that ‘Moreover, simultaneous knockdown of <italic>MAF1</italic> with either Pol III or <italic>BRF1</italic> (subunit of TFIIIB) disrupted the looping formation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D-E</xref>). These observations suggest chromatin looping between the long and short form promoter regions is important for the activation of <italic>CDKN1A</italic> transcription from both promoters’, and ‘The above results demonstrate that <italic>MAF1</italic> knockdown can activate <italic>CDKN1A</italic> expression through promoter looping induced by recruitment of Pol III and Pol II along with histone-modifying factors’. Later on, they state ‘These results further demonstrate unambiguously that <italic>MAF1</italic> protein represses the promoter activity of <italic>CDKN1A</italic> and <italic>GDF15</italic>, and that recruitment of Pol III after <italic>MAF1</italic> depletion is crucial for the activation of transcription of these genes through promoter looping’. The looping observed may as well be a consequence, rather than a driver, of gene activation, or just as well a totally inconsequential event. The manuscript should be rewritten to remove all indication of cause-effect relationship between looping and gene activation.</p><p>4) The authors rely on the use of a single cell line, MCF7. As these are breast cancer cells that have sustained multiple genetic alterations, it is unclear whether the findings will hold in normal cells or even in other tumor cell lines. This needs to be addressed as the results with <italic>MAF1</italic> may represent a peculiar result of the specific genetic make-up of this single, genetically complex cell type.</p><p>5) The bulk of the findings rely in the use of RNAi approaches but the authors use only a single targeting sequence for the knockdown of each particular target. Multiple targeting sequences need to be used and the extent of downregulation at both the protein and RNA levels needs to be shown to reduce the possibility of off-target effects and to further validate the conclusions.</p><p>6) As a general comment both on the cellular knockdown data and the in vitro immuno-depletion data, the authors do not generally indicate the extent of depletion of the factors of interest, and this may well account for some of the modest, albeit significant, effects. Thus it would help to have data/comments on the depletion efficiencies.</p><p>7) In the nuclear run-on assay of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>, the effect of the <italic>MAF1</italic> knockdown on <italic>CDKN1A</italic> expression appears relatively modest (especially in relation to the clear large effect in the quantitative RT-PCR analysis of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). Could the authors provide quantitation of the data for <italic>CDKN1A</italic> (and for <italic>GDF15</italic>, where the up-regulation is larger) and perhaps improved data?</p><p>8) The authors state that knocking down Pol III alone did not affect <italic>CDKN1A</italic> expression. However, a close examination the data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref> suggest that expression of <italic>CDKN1A</italic> is actually reduced about 30% (and that of <italic>GDF15</italic> more than 50%). This fits the model that Pol III can positively regulate the expression of <italic>CDKN1A</italic> and <italic>GDF15</italic>, but is potentially inconsistent with the authors' failure to see any Pol III occupancy prior to <italic>MAF1</italic> knockdown. Is this just due to the lower sensitivity and higher background in the ChIP analysis?</p><p>9) In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>, the <italic>MAF1</italic> ChIP signal is only 3-fold above background. Because this data provides important evidence of direct regulation, and even though it is supported by the in vitro demonstration of direct <italic>MAF1</italic> binding to the SINE element, the authors might consider ways to modify the ChIP protocol to increase the signal/background ratio.</p><p>10) While the in vitro data for the direct <italic>MAF1</italic> binding to the p21 SINE element (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>) seems convincing, especially with the SINE deletion control, it would be very interesting to have more detailed data on the interaction site in light of the novelty of this observation. Have the authors any further information from DNase footprinting, gel shifts with point mutations in the Pol III promoter elements etc. on this point, especially in relation to their suggestion in the Discussion that “<italic>MAF1</italic> and Pol III/TFIIIB may recognize similar DNA elements”? (It should also be noted that the promoter elements of Pol III-transcribed genes are directly recognized by TFIIIC and not by Pol III/IIIB.)</p><p>11) In relation to the interesting (and potentially provocative) new <italic>MAF1</italic> mechanism involving direct binding to promoter elements, the reader is advised (in the Introduction) of prior reports indicating <italic>MAF1</italic> binding to <italic>BRF1</italic> and/or Pol III as well as Pol III/<italic>MAF1</italic> co-occupancy on target genes, and thus anticipates that <italic>MAF1</italic> may be repressing Pol III function by a related mechanism on the target genes analyzed here. This, of course, appears not to be the mechanism from the ChIP analyses that follow the functional studies, but I think the rationale and results could be presented with more clarity and with clear indications that, perhaps surprisingly, they do not fit the original models but suggest an alternate mechanism that is pursued (by the direct binding studies).</p><p>[Editors’ note: further concerns were raised before acceptance.]</p><p>Thank you for resubmitting your article entitled “MAF1-Regulated-Pol III-Mediated Activation of <italic>CDKN1A</italic> and Chromatin Looping” for further consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your revised submission has been evaluated by the original Reviewing Editor and Senior Editor.</p><p>Despite a commendable effort by the authors to try to address the concerns raised by the reviewers, the revised manuscript fails to meet the high standards of scholarship expected for publication in <italic>eLife</italic>. The authors have performed additional experiments in response to the reviewers suggestions, mostly to include missing controls and replicates, but the manuscript still fails to produce a clear picture of how exactly <italic>MAF1</italic> and POLIII regulate protein-coding genes such as <italic>CDKN1A</italic> and <italic>GDF15</italic>.</p><p>The major issue is that, in response to a request for clarification from the reviewers, it is now evident that the genomic region that the authors have called the ‘p21 long promoter’ (p21L) is indeed the enhancer regulatory region of this gene, known to be bound by p53 and many other transcription factors. This region, located 2.25kb upstream of the canonical p21 promoter, produces enhancer-derived RNAs (eRNAs) and may engage with the promoter through a chromatin loop. In view of this, the entire dataset must be reinterpreted as <italic>MAF1</italic> and POLIII likely affecting the activity of the enhancer region at the <italic>CDKN1A</italic> locus, and the manuscript should be rewritten in light of this fact.</p><p>Finally, the revised manuscript failed to correct some points raised by reviewers. As an example of a major oversight, the authors tested for ‘p53 activation’ by Q-RT-PCR, when it is well established that p53 activation upon cellular stress occurs at the protein level, and thus should have been tested by Western blot.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.06283.015</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>1) The possible role of p53. The two genes examined throughout the manuscript,</italic> CDKN1A <italic>and</italic> GDF15<italic>, are the two most potently transcribed p53 target genes (Allen et al.,</italic> eLife <italic>2014).

Indeed, both <italic>CDKN1A</italic> and <italic>GDF15</italic> are p53 target genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Allen et al., 2014</xref>) and therefore maybe indirectly activated by p53 instead of <italic>MAF1</italic>. To directly address this question, we perform <italic>MAF1</italic> knockdown experiments in wild-type and p53-null HCT116 cells. Western blot indeed demonstrate the lack of p53 protein in p53-null HCT116 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1–figure supplement A</xref>; subsection headed “MAF1 knockdown strongly upregulated <italic>CDKN1A</italic> expression”). Since <italic>CDKN1A</italic> expression is induced in both of these cell lines, the induction is independent of p53 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1–figure supplement C-D</xref>; same section).</p><p><italic>2) Promoter definition. The authors indicate that ‘Examination of</italic> CDKN1A <italic>gene shows that there are two promoter regions (hereafter referred as long and short form)’.

Some form of quantitative assay should be done to define the relative strength and RNA output of these two ‘promoters’</italic>.</p><p>We thank you for highlighting that many earlier reports clearly show a major promoter for <italic>CDKN1A</italic> with minor alternative start sites. Indeed, most published papers refer to the transcription start site (TSS) of short form promoter, whereas the well-characterized p53 enhancers are located 1.4 kb and 2.3 kb upstream from TSS, which is near long form promoter (Hung et al., 2011; Lee et al., 2012). In our manuscript, the long form promoter refers to the upstream region of NM_001220777, whereas the short form promoter refers to the upstream region of NM_001220778 according to NM genebank reference numbers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3–figure supplement A</xref>). The relative location of the first exons of <italic>CDKN1A</italic> (“L-Ex-1” for long form and “Ex1” for short form) with respect to the identified p53 response elements and ChIP amplicons (p21-L, p21, p2 and p3) is depicted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Author response image 1</xref>.<fig id="fig9" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.06283.016</object-id><label>Author response image 1.</label><caption><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.06283.016">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.06283.016</ext-link></p></caption><graphic xlink:href="elife-06283-resp-fig1-v2.tif"/></fig></p><p>Therefore, we have modified the text to: “Examination of <italic>CDKN1A</italic> gene in the UCSC Genome Database shows that there are two transcription start sites, NM_001220777 (long form) and NM_001220778 (short form), which are 2.25 kb apart” (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3–figure supplement A</xref>; the subsection headed “<italic>CDKN1A</italic> promoter”). Although the expression of both forms is induced after <italic>MAF1</italic> knockdown, the short form has a higher expression level and stronger promoter activity in MCF-7 cell line (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3–figure supplement B-D</xref>; same section).</p><p>In order to show the relative strength and RNA output of the two promoters, we perform luciferase assay and quantitative RT-PCR to detect the relative promoter activity and transcription level, respectively. In consistent with short form promoter being the major promoter, our luciferase promoter assay showed that the short form <italic>CDKN1A</italic> has a higher promoter activity than the long form (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3–figure supplement D</xref>). Consistent with the above result, our quantitative RT-PCR analysis also shows that the expression of the short form of <italic>CDKN1A</italic> is higher than the long form (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3–figure supplement B</xref>). Since both forms of <italic>CDKN1A</italic> contain active promoters and are transcribed, Ser5-phospho-RNAPII is detected at both promoter regions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3–figure supplement B-D</xref>). However, due to the fact that the short form promoter is the major promoter with higher expression level and promoter activity, the detection of H3K4me3, as well as binding of TBP and RBP5 are found preferentially at short form promoter. The weak binding of these factors on long form promoter is consistent with the lower activity of the long form promoter. However, the biological function of the long form <italic>CDKN1A</italic> with alternative 5′ non-coding exon remains to be elucidated.</p><p><italic>3) Massive misinterpretation of ‘chromatin looping’ data.

The looping observed may as well be a consequence, rather than a driver, of gene activation, or just as well a totally inconsequential event. The manuscript should be rewritten to remove all indication of cause-effect relationship between looping and gene activation</italic>.</p><p>Indeed, we have no evidence that chromatin looping plays a causal role in the gene expression of the two genes we studied. Therefore, we have rewritten the manuscript to remove the indications of cause-effect relationship between looping and gene activation. We have changed the title to “MAF1-Regulated-Pol III-Mediated Activation of <italic>CDKN1A</italic> and Chromatin Looping”. The subheadings were also modified to “Pol III is required for transcriptional activation and chromatin looping of <italic>CDKN1A</italic>/<italic>GDF15</italic> after <italic>MAF1</italic> knockdown” (in the Results section).</p><p><italic>4) The authors rely on the use of a single cell line, MCF7. As these are breast cancer cells that have sustained multiple genetic alterations, it is unclear whether the findings will hold in normal cells or even in other tumor cell lines. This needs to be addressed as the results with</italic> MAF1 <italic>may represent a peculiar result of the specific genetic make-up of this single, genetically complex cell type</italic>.</p><p>To address this question, we choose four other cell lines, MCF-10A (non-tumorigenic), MDA-MB-231, HCT116<sup>p53+/+</sup> (wild-type) and HCT116<sup>p53-/-</sup> (p53-null), to repeat our experiments. We performed quantitative RT-PCR to analysis the effect of <italic>MAF1</italic> knockdown and simultaneous knockdown of <italic>MAF1</italic> and <italic>POLR3A</italic> on the expression of <italic>CDKN1A</italic> and <italic>GDF15</italic> in these four cell lines. Consistent with the MCF-7 results, the expression of <italic>CDKN1A</italic> and <italic>GDF15</italic> is induced after <italic>MAF1</italic> knockdown, and simultaneous knockdown of <italic>MAF1</italic> and <italic>POLR3A</italic> abolished the induced expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1–figure supplement B-F</xref>; subsection headed “<italic>MAF1</italic> knockdown strongly upregulated <italic>CDKN1A</italic> expression”). Together, these results demonstrate that <italic>MAF1</italic> regulates <italic>CDKN1A</italic> expression in non-tumorigenic (MCF-10A), as well as breast (MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231) and colon cancer (HCT116<sup>p53+/+</sup> and HCT116<sup>p53-/-</sup>) cells, and is independent of p53.</p><p><italic>5) The bulk of the findings rely in the use of RNAi approaches but the authors use only a single targeting sequence for the knockdown of each particular target. Multiple targeting sequences need to be used and the extent of downregulation at both the protein and RNA levels needs to be shown to reduce the possibility of off-target effects and to further validate the conclusions</italic>.</p><p>To address this question, we ordered two more siRNA targeting sequences for <italic>MAF1</italic> and <italic>POLR3A</italic>. Quantitative RT-PCR and western blot were performed to analyze the knockdown effect of <italic>MAF1</italic> and <italic>POLR3A</italic> using three different siRNAs, including the original one. The results showed that the three siRNAs for <italic>MAF1</italic> depleted <italic>MAF1</italic> and up-regulated tRNA genes, as well as <italic>CDKN1A</italic> and <italic>GDF15</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A-B and D-E</xref>; subsection headed “<italic>MAF1</italic> knockdown strongly upregulated CDKN1A expression”). However, probably due to slow turnover time of <italic>MAF1</italic> protein, western blot analysis showed only 45% of reduction for the <italic>MAF1</italic> protein in cells treated with siRNA (#1, the one used in the original experiment) with the strongest affect. Nevertheless, the reduction percentage for <italic>MAF1</italic> is consistent with the up-regulation of <italic>CDKN1A</italic> in mRNA and protein level, indicating that depletion of <italic>MAF1</italic> induces <italic>CDKN1A</italic> expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A-B and D-E</xref>; in the aforementioned section). The three siRNAs for <italic>POLR3A</italic> also depleted <italic>POLR3A</italic> and down-regulated tRNA genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1–figure supplement G-H</xref>; subsection headed “<italic>MAF1</italic> knockdown strongly upregulated <italic>CDKN1A</italic> expression”). The siRNAs with the strongest knockdown affect for <italic>MAF1</italic> (#1, the original one) and <italic>POLR3A</italic> (#1, the original one) were used to perform knockdown in ChIP, 3C and reporter assays.</p><p><italic>6) As a general comment both on the cellular knockdown data and the in vitro immuno-depletion data, the authors do not generally indicate the extent of depletion of the factors of interest, and this may well account for some of the modest, albeit significant, effects. Thus it would help to have data/comments on the depletion efficiencies</italic>.</p><p>For cellular knockdown, we have performed western blot analysis to show that <italic>MAF1</italic> and <italic>POLR3A</italic> are reduced about 45% and 60% in protein level, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>; subsection “<italic>MAF1</italic> knockdown strongly upregulated <italic>CDKN1A</italic> expression” and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1–figure supplement H</xref>). For the depletion efficiency of in vitro immune-depletion data, we used anti-Pol II antibody on Pol II genes, <italic>CDKN1A</italic>, <italic>GDF15</italic> and <italic>TAF5</italic>, to show that the transcription activity is reduced 93%±4%, which is similar to treatment with α-amanitin (87%±1%) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D-E</xref>; subsection “In vitro transcription using HeLa cell nuclear extract demonstrated that transcription of Pol II genes was reciprocally regulated by <italic>MAF1</italic> and Pol III). We also used anti-Pol III antibody on Pol III transcribed-RPPH1 to show that the reduction is 79%±1% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>; aforementioned subsection). The modest, albeit significant, results may thus be accounted by the depletion level.</p><p><italic>7) In the nuclear run-on assay of</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1"><italic>Figure 1D</italic></xref><italic>, the effect of the</italic> MAF1 <italic>knockdown on</italic> CDKN1A <italic>expression appears relatively modest (especially in relation to the clear large effect in the quantitative RT-PCR analysis of</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1"><italic>Figure 1C</italic></xref><italic>). Could the authors provide quantitation of the data for</italic> CDKN1A <italic>(and for</italic> GDF15<italic>, where the up-regulation is larger) and perhaps improved data</italic>?</p><p>We repeated run-on assay to provide quantification results (n=3) and a more improved gel picture in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A-B</xref> (please see “<italic>MAF1</italic> knockdown strongly upregulated CDKN1A expression”). The gel pictures were quantified with ImageJ (provided by NIH: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://imagej.nih.gov/ij/">http://imagej.nih.gov/ij/</ext-link>). The purified run-on products where normalized with internal control (<italic>GAPDH</italic>) to obtain the relative transcription levels for each gene. <italic>MAF1</italic> knockdown induced the expression of <italic>CDKN1A</italic> and <italic>GDF15</italic> for 2.9±0.8 and 88.8±12.2 folds, respectively, in run-on assay. This shows that <italic>MAF1</italic> knockdown induces newly transcribed <italic>CDKN1A</italic> and <italic>GDF15</italic> mRNA, and the up-regulation is not due to post-transcriptional processing or RNA turnover rates. The run-on results were moved from <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E-F</xref> to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">figure 2A-B</xref> for clarity.</p><p><italic>8) The authors state that knocking down Pol III alone did not affect</italic> CDKN1A <italic>expression. However, a close examination the data in</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1"><italic>Figure 1C</italic></xref> <italic>suggest that expression of</italic> CDKN1A <italic>is actually reduced about 30% (and that of</italic> GDF15 <italic>more than 50%). This fits the model that Pol III can positively regulate the expression of</italic> CDKN1A <italic>and</italic> GDF15<italic>, but is potentially inconsistent with the authors' failure to see any Pol III occupancy prior to</italic> MAF1 <italic>knockdown. Is this just due to the lower sensitivity and higher background in the ChIP analysis</italic>?</p><p>The expression of <italic>CDKN1A</italic> and <italic>GDF15</italic> is indeed reduced about 30% and 50%, respectively, in Pol III knockdown, which fits the model that Pol III can positively regulate the expression of <italic>CDKN1A</italic> and <italic>GDF15</italic>. However, the occupancy of Pol III prior to <italic>MAF1</italic> knockdown is relatively very weak. Thus, we speculate that since the down-regulation of <italic>CDKN1A</italic> and <italic>GDF15</italic> is not as efficient as tRNA genes after Pol III knockdown, the amount of Pol III binding at <italic>CDKN1A</italic> and <italic>GDF15</italic> prior to <italic>MAF1</italic> knockdown may be too low to be differentiated from background (MAF1/Pol III knockdown). Thus, although knockdown Pol III showed a decrease in Pol III binding at tRNA genes, the amount of Pol III is relatively the same as the <italic>CDKN1A</italic> and <italic>GDF15</italic> knockdown control and MAF1/Pol III knockdown. It is possible that there is a minor subpopulation of alleles with Pol III bound at the promoter, and they are responsible for the low level background transcription. Knockdown of Pol III will thus reduce the background expression level from this subset of alleles. However, the low level of binding does not allow us to show that unequivocally. Therefore, we modify the manuscript in the Discussion to state that Pol III may be able to regulate expression of <italic>CDKN1A</italic> and <italic>GDF15</italic>, before <italic>MAF1</italic> knockdown, but the low level of Pol III binding prior to <italic>MAF1</italic> knockdown does not allow us to validate this possibility unequivocally (Discussion).</p><p><italic>9) In</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3"><italic>Figure 3C</italic></xref><italic>, the</italic> MAF1 <italic>ChIP signal is only 3-fold above background. Because this data provides important evidence of direct regulation, and even though it is supported by the in vitro demonstration of direct</italic> MAF1 <italic>binding to the SINE element, the authors might consider ways to modify the ChIP protocol to increase the signal/background ratio</italic>.</p><p>In order to optimize our ChIP protocol, we performed pilot experiments by adding different concentrations of BSA (0, 5, 10, 20 and 50 μg/ml) during complex binding, as well as using various washing conditions (either with or without LiCl or by washing with different number of times for high-salt washing buffer). The condition used (see Methods) is already our optimized condition after testing various conditions. Our 3-fold signal/background ratio for <italic>MAF1</italic> ChIP is also relatively higher than other published <italic>MAF1</italic> ChIP data, which showed a 2-fold signal/background ratio at Pol II and Pol III promoter in yeast and mammalian cell lines (Graczyk et al., 2011 [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>]; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Johnson et al., 2007</xref> [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref>]; Palian et al., 2014 [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>]). Whether the relatively low binding in the MAF1 ChIP assay is due to the intrinsic inefficiency of MAF1 antibody available or to omission of an unknown cofactor remains to be analyzed in the future.</p><p><italic>10) While the in vitro data for the direct MAF1 binding to the p21 SINE element (</italic><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4"><italic>Figure 4</italic></xref><italic>) seems convincing, especially with the SINE deletion control, it would be very interesting to have more detailed data on the interaction site in light of the novelty of this observation. Have the authors any further information from DNase footprinting, gel shifts with point mutations in the Pol III promoter elements etc. on this point, especially in relation to their suggestion in the Discussion that “MAF1 and Pol III/TFIIIB may recognize similar DNA elements”? (It should also be noted that the promoter elements of Pol III-transcribed genes are directly recognized by TFIIIC and not by Pol III/IIIB</italic>.<italic>)</italic></p><p>In addition to the SINE deletion control, we constructed point mutations in the A-box Pol III promoter element obtained from <italic>CDKN1A</italic> promoter. We performed in vitro binding assay using the A-box-mutated SINE element as described before (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Britten, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Toth and Biggin, 2000</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>; subsection “<italic>MAF1</italic> binds to the short interspersed element (SINE) of <italic>CDKN1A</italic>”). In addition, we also performed in vitro DNA-protein binding assay by using a colorimetric assay kit provided by Abcam (ab117139) to further validate that <italic>MAF1</italic> binds to the Pol III promoter element, but not the mutant form (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>; please also see the aforementioned subsection). We hope that the two assays along with mutant forms of Pol III promoter can provide more detailed data on the interaction site.</p><p><italic>11) In relation to the interesting (and potentially provocative) new</italic> MAF1 <italic>mechanism involving direct binding to promoter elements, the reader is advised (in the Introduction) of prior reports indicating</italic> MAF1 <italic>binding to BRF1 and/or Pol III as well as Pol III/</italic>MAF1 <italic>co-occupancy on target genes, and thus anticipates that</italic> MAF1 <italic>may be repressing Pol III function by a related mechanism on the target genes analyzed here. This, of course, appears not to be the mechanism from the ChIP analyses that follow the functional studies, but I think the rationale and results could be presented with more clarity and with clear indications that, perhaps surprisingly, they do not fit the original models but suggest an alternate mechanism that is pursued (by the direct binding studies)</italic>.</p><p>We thank you for highlighting that we should modify the manuscript to present the rationale and results in more clarity and indications that our model does not fit the original models. Therefore, we have rewritten the last paragraph of the Introduction and modified the first paragraph of the Discussion to suggest an alternate mechanism as shown by the direct binding studies.</p><p>[Editors’ note: a second round of author responses follow.]</p><p><italic>Despite a commendable effort by the authors to try to address the concerns raised by the reviewers, the revised manuscript fails to meet the high standards of scholarship expected for publication in</italic> eLife<italic>. The authors have performed additional experiments in response to the reviewers suggestions, mostly to include missing controls and replicates, but the manuscript still fails to produce a clear picture of how exactly</italic> MAF1 <italic>and POLIII regulate protein-coding genes such as</italic> CDKN1A <italic>and</italic> GDF15<italic>.</italic></p><p>Overall, this report presents some exciting new findings that are very timely in view of (i) extensive ChIPseq data in the literature demonstrating the localization of components of the Pol III transcription machinery adjacent to Pol II-transcribed genes and (ii) the widespread localization of SINE elements (of unknown function) in the human genome and near promoters”. The decision is based mainly on three criticisms, which we would like to respond to here.</p><p>First, PCAF in our manuscript is <italic>not</italic> PCNA as stated in the rejection letter. PCAF is lysine acetyltransferase 2B (an interacting partner of the transcriptional co-integrators CBP and p300), also known as P/CAF, or KAT2B; and it has been shown to be associated with p300 for chromatin modification. We performed ChIP of PCAF to show that this epigenetic factor becomes associated with <italic>CDKN1A</italic> promoter after <italic>MAF1</italic> knockdown (subsection “<italic>MAF1</italic> knockdown promoted recruitment of positive regulatory factors and epigenetic modifications” and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>). Therefore, this is just a misunderstanding.</p><p>The second point is about our interpretation of our data in view of the fact the 2.25kb upstream of canonical promoter is probably the enhancer region. We will rewrite the manuscript to incorporate this fact. As Darwin said: “False facts are highly injurious to the progress of science, for they often long endure; but false views, if supported by some evidence, do little harm, as every one takes a salutary pleasure in proving their falseness”. A set of data can always have different interpretation and progress of science is achieved to resolve the different hypothesis or interpretation. We will also perform experiment to test whether the upstream region is the enhancer for the canonical promoter. We will restrict the interpretation in the Discussions section, which is the place used for making hypothesis or interpretation of the data.</p><p>The third point is that we failed to correct some points raised by the reviewers such as the test of p53 level by western blot. We did not perform western blot in the revised manuscript because we have already shown that in the revised manuscript, <italic>CDKN1A</italic> and <italic>GDF15</italic> in both HCT116 and HCT116<sup>p53-/-</sup> cell lines were up-regulated, and thus the effect is independent of p53. Nevertheless, we will perform western blot of p53 to further show that the up-regulation of <italic>CDKN1A</italic> and <italic>GDF15</italic> after <italic>MAF1</italic> knockdown is independent of p53.</p><p><italic>The major issue is that, in response to a request for clarification from the reviewers, it is now evident that the genomic region that the authors have called the ‘p21 long promoter’ (p21L) is indeed the enhancer regulatory region of this gene, known to be bound by p53 and many other transcription factors. This region, located 2.25kb upstream of the canonical p21 promoter, produces enhancer-derived RNAs (eRNAs) and may engage with the promoter through a chromatin loop. In view of this, the entire dataset must be reinterpreted as</italic> MAF1 <italic>and POLIII likely affecting the activity of the enhancer region at the</italic> CDKN1A <italic>locus, and the manuscript should be rewritten in light of this fact</italic>.</p><p>The editors questioned the interpretation of our data in view of the fact the 2.25 kb upstream of canonical promoter is probably the enhancer region. For clarification, the TSS start site of NM_001220777 (long form <italic>CDKN1A</italic>) is located 2.25 kb upstream of NM_001220778 (short form <italic>CDKN1A</italic>) TSS. However, the chromatin looping and identified MAF1 binding site by ChIP is 2.65 kb upstream of TSS. Therefore, to address the possibility of enhancer activity at this region, we cloned the 2.25 ∼ 2.65 kb upstream region into the promoter of <italic>CDKN1A</italic> (CDKN1A-S) used in our original luciferase assay. The promoter activity was analyzed by luciferase assay and the results showed that the cloned 5′ region, both in sense (labeled as “LE(+)”) and antisense direction (labeled as “LE(-)”) does not exert enhancer activity on <italic>CDKN1A</italic> promoter after <italic>MAF1</italic> knockdown as shown below (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Author response image 2</xref>). We have included the interpretation in our Discussion section, but did not include the data in the results. In brief, we hypothesized that the chromatin looping we observed for <italic>CDKN1A</italic> and <italic>GDF15</italic> after <italic>MAF1</italic> knockdown may be mediated through the proximity of these 5′ regions in the transcription factory and looping is resulted by the interaction between the sets of transcriptional factors recruited in the two 5′ flanking regions after chromatin remodeling as proposed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Crepaldi et al. (2013)</xref>.<fig id="fig10" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.06283.017</object-id><label>Author response image 2.</label><caption><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.06283.017">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.06283.017</ext-link></p></caption><graphic xlink:href="elife-06283-resp-fig2-v2.tif"/></fig></p><p><italic>Finally, the revised manuscript failed to correct some points raised by reviewers. As an example of a major oversight, the authors tested for ‘p53 activation’ by Q-RT-PCR, when it is well established that p53 activation upon cellular stress occurs at the protein level, and thus should have been tested by Western blot</italic>.</p><p>The other concern raised by the editors is that we failed to test p53 level by western blot to determine whether the induced <italic>CDKN1A</italic> expression after <italic>MAF1</italic> knockdown is independent or dependent of p53. To directly show that induced <italic>CDKN1A</italic> expression after <italic>MAF1</italic> knockdown is independent of p53, we analyzed the <italic>MAF1</italic> knockdown effect of <italic>CDKN1A</italic> expression in p53-null HCT116. Western blot analysis indeed confirmed that this cell line does not express p53 at protein level (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1–figure supplement A</xref>; subsection entitled “<italic>MAF1</italic> knockdown strongly upregulated <italic>CDKN1A</italic> expression”). Both quantitative RT-PCR and western blot showed that the expression of <italic>CDKN1A</italic> is induced after <italic>MAF1</italic> knockdown in p53-null HCT116 cell line (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1–figure supplement C-D</xref>; aforementioned subsection). This result unequivocally shows that in the absence of p53 protein, the expression of <italic>CDKN1A</italic> is still induced after <italic>MAF1</italic> knockdown, indicating the induced transcription is independent of p53. Consistent with this result, we also showed that induction of <italic>CDKN1A</italic> expression in MDA-MB-231 cell line, which carries mutation in p53 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1–figure supplement F</xref>; same subsection).</p></body></sub-article></article>
