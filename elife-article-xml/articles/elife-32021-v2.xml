disorders. Expedited OL regeneration may prevent further axonal damage and facilitate functional CNS repair. Although adult OL progenitors (OPCs) are the primary players for OL regeneration, targetable OPC-specific intracellular signaling mechanisms for facilitated OL regeneration remain elusive. Here, we report that OPC-targeted PTEN inactivation in the mouse, in contrast to OL-specific manipulations, markedly promotes OL differentiation and regeneration in the mature CNS. Unexpectedly, an additional deletion of mTOR did not reverse the enhanced OL development from PTEN-deficient OPCs. Instead, ablation of GSK3β, another downstream signaling molecule that is negatively regulated by PTEN-Akt, enhanced OL development. Our results suggest that PTEN persistently suppresses OL development in an mTOR-independent manner, and at least in part, via controlling GSK3β activity. OPC-targeted PTEN-GSK3β inactivation may benefit facilitated OL regeneration and myelin repair.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>oligodendrocytes</kwd><kwd>GSK3b</kwd><kwd>progenitors</kwd><kwd>PTEN</kwd><kwd>mTOR</kwd><kwd>myelination</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000065</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01NS089586</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kang</surname><given-names>Shin H</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000863</institution-id><institution>Ellison Medical Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>AG-NS-1101-13</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kang</surname><given-names>Shin H</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100011781</institution-id><institution>Shriners Hospitals for Children</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>85500-PHI-14</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kang</surname><given-names>Shin H</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100011781</institution-id><institution>Shriners Hospitals for Children</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>84298-PHI</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Jeong</surname><given-names>Hey-Kyeong</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000065</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01NS07693</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Son</surname><given-names>Young-Jin</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100011781</institution-id><institution>Shriners Hospitals for Children</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>86600</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Son</surname><given-names>Young-Jin</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>OPC-specific genetic inhibition of Akt upstream and downstream molecules in the mouse, and simultaneous OPC fate analysis reveal that PTEN-AKT-GSK3b forms a persistent negative signaling pathway for OL development, in parallel with the AKT-mTORC1 pathway.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>In the mammalian central nervous system (CNS), NG2 and PDGFRα (platelet-derived growth factor receptor α)-expressing OPCs (also known as NG2<sup>+</sup> cells) are abundant throughout life (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Dimou and Gallo, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Nishiyama et al., 2009</xref>). The lineage progression from OPC to OL is a multi-step process that involves gradual changes in cell morphology and properties, from OPCs to pre-myelinating OLs (pre-OLs) to fully mature OLs, culminating in the formation of lipid-rich myelin around axons (myelinogenesis) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Nave and Werner, 2014</xref>). In the adult CNS, OPCs continue to serve as the primary reservoir for homeostatic maintenance of OLs by generating new myelinating OLs in the event of OL loss (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Chamberlain et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Young et al., 2013</xref>), while they proliferate and sustain their own population size (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Hughes et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>Although a number of intracellular signaling pathways are known to regulate OL development and myelination during early development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Gaesser and Fyffe-Maricich, 2016</xref>), it is not clear whether the same signaling mechanisms equally regulate continuing OL generation in the adult CNS, as well as OL regeneration after demyelination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Fancy et al., 2011</xref>). Indeed, genetic ablation of proposed OL development regulators often resulted in only transient delay in early myelination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">He et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Huang et al., 2013</xref>). Moreover, in contrast to a plethora of molecules whose loss-of-function results in myelin defects, there are far fewer examples of significantly improved OL generation and regeneration in the mature CNS.</p><p>It is conceivable that there are multiple cell-stage-specific signaling mechanisms, each of which may regulate a distinct aspect of the OL development and myelination, such as OPC proliferation, a permanent exit from the OPC cell cycle, morphological change, axon recognition, and, finally, plasma membrane outgrowth and tight myelin formation. Accordingly, OPC-intrinsic signaling that regulates OPC-to-OL transition should be considered as a separate step from the OL-intrinsic mechanisms that drive myelin growth and maintenance.</p><p>The mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling is known to be necessary for proper CNS myelination in early life (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Figlia et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Lebrun-Julien et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Wahl et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Wood et al., 2013</xref>), but the therapeutic potential of mTOR signaling manipulation for improved OL regeneration is not clear (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Jiang et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Lebrun-Julien et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">McLane et al., 2017</xref>). As an effort to identify OPC-intrinsic signaling mechanisms that promote OL generation in the mature CNS, we first determined whether the OPC-specific increase in mTOR complex 1 (mTORC1) activity enhances OL development, by OPC-specific genetic deletion of the tuberous sclerosis complex 1 (TSC1) or phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN), the two negative regulators of mTORC1 activity (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Here, we report that OPC-targeted PTEN genetic ablation markedly enhanced OPC proliferation and OL differentiation, regardless of the examined CNS areas and age windows. OPC-targeted PTEN inactivation also remarkably facilitates OL regeneration and promotes remyelination after toxin-induced demyelination. However, such positive outcomes were not observed for OL-specific PTEN ablation. Moreover, in contrast to PTEN, OPC-specific TSC1 inactivation impaired OL development/survival.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.32021.002</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>OPC-specific <italic>Tsc1</italic> ablation impairs oligodendrocyte development in the brain.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Schematic diagram of the Akt-mTOR signaling pathway.

In contrast, the numbers of EYFP<sup>+</sup> pre-myelinating OLs (pre-OLs, NG2<sup>-</sup> CC1<sup>-</sup>) and EYFP<sup>+</sup> OPCs (NG2<sup>+</sup>) were not significantly affected, except for cortical pre-OLs that were increased in the <italic>Tsc1</italic> cKO (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1H,I</xref>). Consequently, despite no or only a small increase in labeled OPCs and pre-OLs, the composition of EYFP-labeled cells changed to a state where the proportion of OPCs and pre-OLs became significantly larger, whereas that of mature OLs was markedly reduced in both the CC and CTX (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1J</xref>). The altered composition of EYFP-labeled cells excludes the possibility that the marked decrease of EYFP<sup>+</sup> OLs was not caused by inefficient Cre-loxP recombination in <italic>Tsc1</italic> cKO mice (P20 +21). The same OPC-targeted <italic>Tsc1</italic> cKO mice also exhibited impairment of new OL development in the spinal cord (SC) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>).</p><p>Our examination on the Ki67 (a marker of a proliferating cell) expression pattern in the brain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1K</xref>) revealed that the OPC proliferation was not impaired in these <italic>Tsc1</italic> cKO mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1L</xref>). The percentage of Ki67<sup>+</sup> cells among cortical EYFP<sup>+</sup> OPCs was even higher in the cKO mice than in control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1L</xref>). Nonetheless, there was a slight reduction in total OPCs in the CTX of the cKO mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1M</xref>). These observations indicate that the marked decrease of new OLs in the cKO mice is not due to OPC proliferation defects. Consistent with the impaired OL accumulation, the levels of MBP expression were also reduced in the CTX of <italic>Tsc1</italic> cKO mice (P20 +21) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1N,O</xref>).</p><p>These results raise two possibilities that are not mutually exclusive: Pre-OL-to-OL lineage progression is arrested, and/or newly born OLs undergo premature cell death. Although our cleaved caspase-3 staining did not reveal any increase in cell death in the cKO mice brain (data not shown), it is possible that the observation time point of cleaved caspase-3 (3 weeks after <italic>Tsc1</italic> deletion) is too late to detect the cell death events. The different degree of OL impairment in the CC and CTX may be related to the numbers of new OLs in the two brain areas for the examined age window (from P20 to P41). A more actively OL-generating CNS region may have been more severely affected by a premature OL loss and/or maturation arrest. Indeed, the CC is known to be more active in OL development than CTX in all examined ages in earlier studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Kang et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Rivers et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Young et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>Along with others’ results on OL lineage cKO of <italic>Tsc1</italic> or <italic>Tsc2</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Carson et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Jiang et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Lebrun-Julien et al., 2014</xref>), our results further support the idea that a complete inactivation of TSC1 (or consequent mTORC1 hyperactivation) is detrimental to OLs, and thus would not benefit OL development or remyelination. However, the situation is not entirely clear, because another, recently published study suggests that <italic>Tsc1</italic>-deleted OPCs (with <italic>Cspg4-CreER</italic>) leads to increased myelin thickness after demyelination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">McLane et al., 2017</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>OPC-specific PTEN inactivation promotes new OL development in both the young and mature CNS</title><p>Next, we targeted <italic>Pten</italic>, another upstream negative regulator of the Akt-mTORC1 signaling (See <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>), in OPCs. <italic>Pten</italic> had been targeted in OL lineage cells in earlier studies, in which gene deletion was achieved using either <italic>Olig2-Cre</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Harrington et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Maire et al., 2014</xref>) or OL-specific Cre lines (i.e. <italic>Cnp-Cre</italic> and <italic>Plp1-CreER</italic>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Goebbels et al., 2010</xref>). Those studies did not report apparent changes in OL numbers or pattern of remyelination, but abnormal myelin outgrowth. However, it is possible that the cell-specific roles of PTEN in OPC were not completely revealed, because <italic>Olig2-Cre</italic> may affect many other neural cells besides OL lineage cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Maire et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Masahira et al., 2006</xref>), and OL-specific Cre mice do not impact the majority of adult OPCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Goebbels et al., 2010</xref>).

Similar to <italic>Tsc1</italic> cKO, <italic>Pten</italic> deletion increased pS6 levels in EYFP<sup>+</sup> cells in the CC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B,C</xref>), indicating that PTEN was inactivated, and as a consequence, mTORC1 activity was significantly enhanced. However, in contrast to <italic>Tsc1</italic> cKO, the number of EYFP<sup>+</sup> cells increased for most of the observed brain areas, including the CC and CTX (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D,E</xref>). The fate analysis of EYFP-labeled OPCs with co-immunostaining of cell stage markers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>) revealed that there were significant increases in EYFP<sup>+</sup>CC1<sup>+</sup> cells in the CTX of <italic>Pten</italic> cKO mice for both age-windows (p=0.0002 for P20 ~P41; p=0.0037 for P45 ~P75) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>). The new OL generation was also higher in the CC of P45 +30 <italic>Pten</italic> cKO mice than the age-matched control (p=0.0006) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>). The failure to observe a significant increase of EYFP<sup>+</sup>CC1<sup>+</sup> cells in the CC of P20 +21 <italic>Pten</italic> cKO (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>) may be due to the high rate of OL differentiation (with a larger variation) in the CC of the developing brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Kang et al., 2010</xref>). Thus, facilitated OL differentiation may not have been sufficiently pronounced by the relatively short-term (i.e. 3 weeks) OPC fate-tracking. In contrast to the increased new OLs, densities of EYFP-labeled OPCs were not changed by <italic>Pten</italic> cKO (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G</xref>). Consequently, the percentage of mature OLs among EYFP-labeled OL lineage cells increased in both the CC (for P45 +30) and CTX (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2H</xref>). These results strongly suggest that PTEN inactivation in OPCs promotes new OL development, even in the mature brain.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.32021.007</object-id><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>OPC-specific <italic>Pten</italic> ablation enhances oligodendrocyte differentiation and OPC proliferation in the brain.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Experimental scheme for 4HT injection and BrdU administration into <italic>Pdgfra-CreER; R26-EYFP; ±Pten<sup>f/f</sup> mice</italic>, and for mouse sampling.

Similarly, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Figlia et al. (2017</xref>) showed that <italic>Tsc1</italic> cKO-induced mTORC1 hyperactivity delays the onset of Schwann cell myelination in the PNS, although residual mTORC1 activity derives myelin growth at later stages. Therefore, a large body of evidence suggests that even though mTORC1 is necessary, uncontrolled stimulation of mTORC1 activity may not be a practical approach for adult myelin repair.</p><p>This study provides the first <italic>in vivo</italic> genetic evidence that, in parallel with PI3K-Akt-mTORC1 signaling, PTEN-Akt-GSK3β signaling negatively regulates OL development and myelination. In particular, we demonstrate that PTEN-dependent inhibition of OPC-to-OL progression widely occurs both in the brain and the SC, and is persistent into adulthood. Our findings reveal that inactivation of PTEN in OPCs mobilizes its cell-intrinsic downstream signaling via mTOR-independent mechanisms, probably by controlling GSK3β activity. Thus, OL regeneration may be effectively enhanced by OPC-targeted inactivation of PTEN or GSK3β in the adult CNS.</p><p>Previously, PTEN has been only thought of as a negative regulator of OL membrane outgrowth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Goebbels et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Harrington et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Maire et al., 2014</xref>). However, neither its OPC-specific role nor its inhibitory action on the OPC-to-OL transition had been revealed. Moreover, it was thought that PTEN/Akt-initiated myelin changes are mediated mostly by mTORC1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Goebbels et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Narayanan et al., 2009</xref>).

However, because Olig2 is expressed in subsets of neural stem/progenitor cell populations through embryonic development, it appears that not only OL lineage cells, but also astrocytes and some types of neurons, are affected by <italic>Olig2-</italic>Cre (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Maire et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Masahira et al., 2006</xref>). Thus, it is possible that the phenotypes of <italic>Olig2-Cre; Pten<sup>f/f</sup></italic> mice were complicated by non-cell-autonomous mechanisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Codeluppi et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Goebbels et al., 2017</xref>). More importantly, prolonged PTEN deficiency in OLs may have led to continuous myelin growth, which may eventually have exerted detrimental effects on the integrity of OLs and axons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Goebbels et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Harrington et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Narayanan et al., 2009</xref>), masking the positive impact of short-term PTEN inhibition on OPCs that was revealed in the present study.</p><p>PTEN is a cell-intrinsic regulator critical for axonal regeneration, and its deletion in neurons enhances post-injury axon regeneration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Liu et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Park et al., 2008</xref>). A recent study has shown that PTEN-inactivated neurons are even able to recruit OPCs, and induce ectopic myelination in the cerebellar granule cell layer, in which myelination is normally absent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Goebbels et al., 2017</xref>). Our findings on PTEN’s role in OPCs, along with those previous observations, have broaden our understanding of PTEN function in CNS neural repair and regeneration. One concern in targeting PTEN for better myelin repair is that long-term PTEN inhibition (or Akt over-activation) in OLs may cause axonal pathologies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Flores et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Harrington et al., 2010</xref>). However, if PTEN inactivation were effectively guided to OPCs via short-term pharmacological delivery near the site of CNS injury, this could recruit and activate OPCs toward OL differentiation, while minimizing systemic complications. A recent <italic>ex vivo</italic> approach demonstrated a similar rationale by inhibiting PTEN in cultured OPCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">De Paula et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>It is important to identify the downstream mechanism that mediates PTEN-inactivation-enhanced OL generation. PTEN inhibition results in phosphatidylinositol (3,4,5)-trisphosphate (PIP3) accumulation, and thus activates Akt. Even though Akt is known to phosphorylate many different downstream molecules, its major targets may differ according to the type of cell. TSC1/2 phosphorylation and subsequent mTORC1 activity has been considered the most responsible mediator of PTEN-inactivation-dependent axon regeneration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Liu et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Park et al., 2008</xref>) and PTEN-inactivation-induced myelin membrane outgrowth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Goebbels et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Harrington et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Narayanan et al., 2009</xref>). In the PNS, PTEN also regulates the onset of myelination, exclusively through mTORC1 activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Figlia et al., 2017</xref>). In most cases, the supporting evidence for the importance of mTORC1 has been obtained with rapamycin, an mTORC1 inhibitor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Du et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Figlia et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Goebbels et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Narayanan et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Park et al., 2008</xref>). However, given the widespread impact of systemically administered rapamycin on multiple cell types (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Goldshmit et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Srivastava et al., 2016</xref>), the <italic>in vivo</italic> results may be difficult to interpret in terms of cell-type-specific mechanisms. We selectively deleted <italic>Mtor</italic> in OPCs, and subsequent cell fate analysis confirmed the importance of mTOR in OL development, in agreement with prior studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bercury et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Lebrun-Julien et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Wahl et al., 2014</xref>). It is noteworthy that the degree of impairment of OL development shown by OPC-specific <italic>Mtor</italic> ablation in this study was far greater than that observed with rapamycin administration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Narayanan et al., 2009</xref>). However, despite this effective mTOR inactivation, it did not reverse PTEN-inactivation-promoted oligodendrogenesis, indicating that the observed OL promotion was not mediated by mTOR signaling. Furthermore, when PTEN and mTOR were deleted together, the activated signaling mechanisms in OPCs sufficiently compensated for the loss of mTORC1, stimulating OL generation more than in normal OL development. Therefore, our results reveal that there are one or more PTEN-downstream mechanisms besides Akt-mTORC1 signaling that are critical for OL development and CNS myelination.</p><p>In the present study, we have shown that <italic>Pten</italic> ablation in OPCs also leads to the inhibitory GSK3β phosphorylation (at Ser9). Therefore, it is likely that PTEN inactivation results in GSK3β inhibition in OL lineage cells. Finally, we show that OPC-specific <italic>Gsk3b</italic> deletion also promotes OL development in the brain similar to that of <italic>Pten</italic> ablation. Interestingly, it has been shown that PTEN-inhibition (or PI3K activation) induces sensory axon regeneration, not via mTORC1 signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Christie et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Saijilafu et al., 2013</xref>), but via GSK3α/β activity inhibition <italic>in vitro</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Saijilafu et al., 2013</xref>). Moreover, Akt-dependent CNS axon regeneration is further promoted by GSK3β inhibition, in addition to mTORC1 signaling-dependent mechanisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Miao et al., 2016</xref>), suggesting an important role of Akt-GSK3β signaling in axonal regeneration. A recent study has shown that a local delivery of GSK3β inhibitors promoted OL development from stem cells in the subventricular zone (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Azim and Butt, 2011</xref>), although opposite <italic>in vitro</italic> results have also been also reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Zhou et al., 2014</xref>). Therefore, an effective OPC-targeted PTEN or GSK3β inhibition may have therapeutic potential and benefit for expedited remyelination.</p><p>In summary, our study reveals that OPC-resident PTEN persistently regulates OL lineage progression, and demonstrates a beneficial potential of PTEN inhibition for better OL regeneration. Moreover, it suggests that mTORC1-dependent signaling is not the only major downstream player for these positive responses, but that PTEN-Akt-GSK3β signaling poses a negative balance, and plays an important role in OL lineage progression. These results support the idea that OPC-targeted cell-specific genetic approaches are powerful tools for identifying and evaluating cell-intrinsic molecules for the promotion of OL regeneration.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table

Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, one of whom, Beth Stevens is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors and the evaluation has been overseen by a Senior Editor. The following individuals involved in review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Teresa Wood (Reviewer #2).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>Gonzalez-Fernandez and colleagues examine the role of PTEN signaling in oligodendrocyte progenitor proliferation and differentiation into mature oligodendrocytes during development and early adulthood, both in the context of a healthy CNS and during remyelination. These data are important to the myelin field as recent research has focused on the role of PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling in myelination. Their findings point to an mTOR-independent role for PTEN through GSK3β. Mice lacking PTEN specifically in OPCs exhibited continued differentiation of OPCs into mature OLs, even in early adulthood. This corresponds with increased myelin production, which is also observed in OL-specific deletion of PTEN. Interestingly, loss of mTOR did not abrogate these effects of PTEN deletion, suggesting an mTOR-independent mechanism. Additional data demonstrate instead that the effects of PTEN deletion require GSK3β.</p><p>The data are clearly presented and make important and novel contributions; however, there are several experiments which would strengthen the conclusions as summarized in essential revisions below. In addition to these revisions, there are several additional points raised by each reviewer that need to be clarified and addressed in a revised paper as summarized at the end.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The authors state that their Tsc1 data indicate decreased OL survival, yet do not show the data to support this statement. Is the decreased mature OL number is a result of decreased proliferation and/or differentiation? To distinguish these possibilities the authors could co-stain for NG2/caspase, CC1/caspase, and/or NG2/Ki67</p><p>2) In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>, the authors examine PLP and MBP by Western blotting, and find that PLP is significantly increased but MBP is not. Given the different results, it would be more convincing of the structural integrity of increased myelin thickness if other myelin proteins were examined such as MOG, CNP, and MAG.</p><p>3) The authors show that increased mature OL numbers in PTEN cKO mice correspond to increased myelin thickness and number of myelinated axons. Is there any evidence to suggest that decreased OL numbers in TSC1 cKO mice correlate with decreased myelination, either by immuostaining or Western Blot techniques?</p><p>4) Is GSK3 responsible only for the differentiation enhancement that was observed in PTEN cKO mice, or is it also responsible for myelin production by mature OLs? Performing either immunostaining/Western blotting for myelin proteins in GSK3 cKO mice could address this. Is it possible that PTEN mediates differentiation via GSK3 but myelin production via a different mTOR independent mechanism?</p><p>5) Much of the data in the paper is based on the calculations of EYFP positive cells, which is taken as a reporter of Cre-recombinase activity. Another possibility is that knockout of the gene of interest in each could affect expression levels of EYFP protein. One can imagine a scenario where Cre-recombinase is active but EYFP is not detected. The authors could stain for Cre expression and see if they see it in cells with no EYFP.</p><p>6) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>: Tsc1 deletion (which hyperactivates mTOR) in OPCs resulted in a decrease in the number of CC1+ cells, in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>, the deletion of mTOR in OPCs had the same effect – less number of CC1+ cells. How do the authors interpret the result that Tsc1 deletion and mTOR deletion have the same effect? Moreover, how does the g-ratio and number of myelinated axons change with the deletion of mTOR alone?</p><p>7) The effect of GSK3β on OL development and myelination is shown nicely; however, the connection between PTEN-Akt and Gsk3β still needs to be clarified. The authors also mention this missing information in the Discussion section. In order to support this link more with the resources they have, they can check how the Gsk3β activity (phosphorylation by Akt) and the activity/level of the proteins downstream of Gsk3β change in Pten<sup>f/f</sup> mouse.</p><p>8) Validation of the GSK3β<sup>f/f</sup> mouse doesn't appear in the paper and should be included.</p><p>9) For the g-ratio calculations the authors should perform statistics on the biological replicates and not the individual axons counted. Can the authors please confirm that this is the case?</p><p>Reviewer #1:</p><p>Fernandez and colleagues investigate a well-known pathway that regulates myelin formation and thickness in the white matter development, mTOR. It has been known for some time that mTOR signaling regulates developmental myelination, but most experiments have examined this pathway in the context of development and not in the adult or injured brain. Here the authors performed experiments where they ablated upstream negative regulators of mTOR signaling, Tsc1 and PTEN, and examined their effects on OPC differentiation in the adult brain and following focal demyelination using lysolecithin.</p><p>The authors show that deletion of Tsc1 in OPCs leads to decreased numbers of oligodendrocyte-lineage cells (EYFP+) in the adult white matter as well as a reduction of the percentage of OLs and increase in the percentage of OPCs. Deletion of Pten lead to modest increases in oligodendrocyte lineage cell number as well as modest increases in OL generation at the expense of OPCs when induced with tamoxifen at P45. This was accompanied by increases in myelin production, but none of these effects were observed in an oligodendrocyte Pten conditional knockout. OPC ablation of Pten also leads to accelerated OL regeneration after LPC demyelination. Finally, the authors show that mTOR signaling is dispensable for these phenotypes in the Pten OPC cKO and that deletion of another downstream signaling pathway, GSK3, phenocopies the Pten OPC cKO.</p><p>These experiments show a critical divergence of Pten/mTOR signaling in OPCs versus OLs which could be important in demyelinating diseases where OPC differentiation is delayed or inefficient. This study offers a mechanistic look at the effects of different pathway components on OPC differentiation and myelination using several different conditional knockout lines. Overall the data are clearly communicated and support the conclusions. The study would be further strengthened by a few additional controls demonstrating that the cKO mice are targeting the genes as expected.</p><p>Specific comments:</p><p>The authors show validation of the Tsc1 f/f mouse using p-56 staining as a proxy for mTOR activation. These controls are performed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref> but should be moved to an earlier figure for the Pten f/f mouse. Also, validation of the GSK3b f/f mouse doesn't appear in the paper and should be included.</p><p>For the g-ratio calculations the authors should perform statistics on the biological replicates and not the individual axons counted. Can the authors please confirm that this is the case?</p><p>Reviewer #2:</p><p>Gonzalez-Fernandez and colleagues examine the role of PTEN signaling in oligodendrocyte progenitor proliferation and differentiation into mature oligodendrocytes during development and early adulthood, both in the context of a healthy CNS and during remyelination. These data are important to the myelin field as recent research has focused on the role of PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling in myelination. The data presented here specifically point to an mTOR independent role for PTEN through GSK3β. Mice lacking PTEN specifically in OPCs exhibited continued differentiation of OPCs into mature OLs, even in early adulthood.

Additional data demonstrate instead that the effects of PTEN deletion require GSK3β. The data are clearly presented and make important and novel contributions. However, there are several experiments which would strengthen the conclusions.</p><p>Additionally, it is not totally clear why the TSC1 data are included, other than to suggest that TSC1 mediates effects on proliferation/differentiation via mTOR, in contrast to PTEN. However, there is a much more complete story shown for PTEN than TSC1, which fails to examine myelination, OPC proliferation, and OL survival.</p><p>1) The authors state that their Tsc1 data indicate decreased OL survival, yet do not show the data to support this statement. It is possible (as is mentioned earlier in the Results section) that the decreased mature OL number is a result of decreased proliferation and/or differentiation. Would it be possible to distinguish these possibilities by co-staining for NG2/caspase, CC1/caspase, and/or NG2/Ki67?</p><p>2) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref> – The authors examine PLP and MBP by Western blotting and find that PLP is significantly increased but MBP is not. Given the different results, it would be more convincing of the structural integrity of increased myelin thickness if other myelin proteins were examined such as MOG, CNP, and MAG. Alternatively, the authors could show representative high magnification EMs showing ultrastructure.</p><p>3) The authors show that increased mature OL numbers in PTEN cKO mice correspond to increased myelin thickness and number of myelinated axons. Is there any evidence to suggest that decreased OL numbers in TSC1 cKO mice correlate with decreased myelination, either by immuostaining, Western, or EM techniques?</p><p>4) Did the mice lacking PTEN during remyelination exhibit thicker myelin or more remyelinated axons comparable to that seen during development? It is suggested in the discussion that targeting PTEN and/or GSK3B would enhance remyelination yet the increase in cell number alone does not necessarily correspond to enhanced repair.</p><p>5) With the data provided, it is difficult to assess whether GSK3B is responsible only for the differentiation enhancement that was observed in PTEN cKO mice, or if it is also responsible for myelin production by mature OLs. In the GSK3B cKO mice, would it be possible to perform either immunostaining/Western blotting for myelin proteins, or to perform EM analysis? Is it possible that PTEN mediates differentiation via GSK3B but myelin production via a different mTOR independent mechanism?</p><p>Reviewer #3:</p><p>In this manuscript Gonzalez-Fernandez and colleagues report mTOR-independent effects of PTEN loss on the development of oligodendrocytes (OLs). The role of mTOR in oligodendrocyte and Schwann cell development and myelination has been thoroughly studied in the recent years, and the research so far shows that a delicate balance of mTOR activity is required at distinct steps of OL maturation. The authors focus here on whether mTOR activity is necessary for the transition of oligodendrocyte progenitors (OPCs) to myelinating oligodendrocytes (OLs) and whether PTEN deletion has an mTOR-independent effect in this process.</p><p>The authors have done a large number of experiments using conditional and inducible knockouts of Tsc1, Pten, mTOR and GSK3b. The approach taken is elegant and the findings could be important if validated. While the quantity of the data is large, the amount of analysis of each model is not sufficiently thorough. The conclusions are based on consideration of limited possibilities and some important controls are missing. Furthermore, interpretation of the results in comparison to previously published literature makes certain assumptions that are not well supported, raising doubts about the significance of the findings.</p><p>1) A recent publication from Suter lab shows the dual function of the PI3K-Akt-mTORC1 in myelination of the PNS. They suggest a molecular mechanism where mTORC1 regulates radial sorting (high mTOR activity), and mTOR and AKT act synergistically on myelin growth and myelination. The authors should cite and discuss these results in comparison to theirs briefly in the Discussion section.</p><p>2) A previous paper reported on the loss of Tsc2 gene expression in oligodendrocytes under the Olig-2 Cre promoter (DOI:10.1002/acn3.254). The authors should include this reference as well.</p><p>3) The authors use inducible Pdgfr-CreER mice with EYFP reporter to visualize the OLs. They first knockout Tsc1 to check the effect of mTORC1 hyperactivation. They find that the number of EYFP+ cells decrease significantly in CC, but not in cortex. On the other hand, EYFP+CC1+ cells (mature OLs) decrease in both areas. In cortex then, not the OPCs but pre-OL number increases, whereas in CC both increased OPC and pre-OL numbers compensate the loss in mature OL number (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1K</xref>). The similar phenomenon is seen in WM of spinal cord. Can the authors comment on this distinct effect of mTOR activity on OL development in CC and cortex? Does high mTOR activity arrest OL maturation at different stages in CC and cortex?</p><p>4) Much of the data in the paper is based on the calculations of EYFP positive cells, which is taken as a reporter of Cre-recombinase activity. Another possibility is that knockout of the gene of interest in each could affect expression levels of EYFP protein. One can imagine a scenario where Cre-recombinase is active but EYFP is not detected.</p><p>5) The authors then examine whether deletion of PTEN affects the process of OL maturation and find that PTEN deletion increases the number of EYFP+ cells. In contrast to the Tsc1 deletion, they show that not in CTX but this time in CC, the number of EYFP+ OPCs do not change (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2J</xref>).

Even though our study did not further investigate this issue, we agree with Lebrun-Julien et al., (2014) who suggested that overactivation of mTORC1 leads to hypomyelination in CNS, and that precisely balanced mTORC1 activity is critical for proper myelination. Alternatively, different levels of mTORC1 activities are required for different aspect of OL maturation/ myelination processes, as recently demonstrated in the case of PNS myelination (Figlia et al., 2017). However, along with the negative outcomes for myelin formation shown by other <italic>Tsc1/ Mtor</italic> cKO studies, our results also point to the notion that mTORC1 activity manipulation (i.e., overactivation or inhibition) may not be an effective approach for better CNS myelin repair.

It has been known for some time that mTOR signaling regulates developmental myelination, but most experiments have examined this pathway in the context of development and not in the adult or injured brain. Here the authors performed experiments where they ablated upstream negative regulators of mTOR signaling, Tsc1 and PTEN, and examined their effects on OPC differentiation in the adult brain and following focal demyelination using lysolecithin.</p><p>The authors show that deletion of Tsc1 in OPCs leads to decreased numbers of oligodendrocyte-lineage cells (EYFP+) in the adult white matter as well as a reduction of the percentage of OLs and increase in the percentage of OPCs. Deletion of Pten lead to modest increases in oligodendrocyte lineage cell number as well as modest increases in OL generation at the expense of OPCs when induced with tamoxifen at P45. This was accompanied by increases in myelin production, but none of these effects were observed in an oligodendrocyte Pten conditional knockout. OPC ablation of Pten also leads to accelerated OL regeneration after LPC demyelination. Finally, the authors show that mTOR signaling is dispensable for these phenotypes in the Pten OPC cKO and that deletion of another downstream signaling pathway, GSK3, phenocopies the Pten OPC cKO.</p><p>These experiments show a critical divergence of Pten/mTOR signaling in OPCs versus OLs which could be important in demyelinating diseases where OPC differentiation is delayed or inefficient. This study offers a mechanistic look at the effects of different pathway components on OPC differentiation and myelination using several different conditional knockout lines. Overall the data are clearly communicated and support the conclusions. The study would be further strengthened by a few additional controls demonstrating that the cKO mice are targeting the genes as expected.</p><p>Specific comments:</p><p>1) The authors show validation of the Tsc1 f/f mouse using p-56 staining as a proxy for mTOR activation.

These data are important to the myelin field as recent research has focused on the role of PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling in myelination. The data presented here specifically point to an mTOR independent role for PTEN through GSK3β. Mice lacking PTEN specifically in OLPs exhibited continued differentiation of OLPs into mature OLs, even in early adulthood. This corresponds with increased myelin production, which is also observed in OL specific deletion of PTEN. Interestingly, loss of mTOR did not abrogate these effects of PTEN deletion, suggesting an mTOR independent mechanism. Additional data demonstrate instead that the effects of PTEN deletion require GSK3β. The data are clearly presented and make important and novel contributions. However, there are several experiments which would strengthen the conclusions.</p><p>Additionally, it is not totally clear why the TSC1 data are included, other than to suggest that TSC1 mediates effects on proliferation/differentiation via mTOR, in contrast to PTEN.

The role of mTOR in oligodendrocyte and Schwann cell development and myelination has been thoroughly studied in the recent years, and the research so far shows that a delicate balance of mTOR activity is required at distinct steps of OL maturation. The authors focus here on whether mTOR activity is necessary for the transition of oligodendrocyte progenitors (OPCs) to myelinating oligodendrocytes (OLs) and whether PTEN deletion has an mTOR-independent effect in this process.</p><p>The authors have done a large number of experiments using conditional and inducible knockouts of Tsc1, Pten, mTOR and GSK3b. The approach taken is elegant and the findings could be important if validated. While the quantity of the data is large, the amount of analysis of each model is not sufficiently thorough. The conclusions are based on consideration of limited possibilities and some important controls are missing.

On the other hand, EYFP+CC1+ cells (mature OLs) decrease in both areas. In cortex then, not the OPCs but pre-OL number increases, whereas in CC both increased OPC and pre-OL numbers compensate the loss in mature OL number (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1K</xref>).

To make it clear, we added two graphs (showing EYFP<sup>+</sup> preOL numbers) to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1H</xref> (for the brain) and to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C</xref> (for the spinal cord).

The almost all EYFP<sup>-</sup> OPCs are Olig2<sup>+</sup> as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3H</xref>.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7) In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>, they show that Tsc1 deletion (which hyperactivates mTOR) in OPCs resulted in a decrease in the number of CC1+ cells, in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>, the deletion of mTOR in OPCs had the same effect – less number of CC1+ cells. How do the authors interpret the result that Tsc1 deletion and mTOR deletion have the same effect? Moreover, how does the g-ratio and number of myelinated axons change with the deletion of mTOR alone?</p></disp-quote><p>Our response to this comment is in essential revision section.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>8) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref> is missing data: the information written in the text (subsection “OPC-targeted GSK3β inactivation enhances OL development and new myelination”) is not shown in the Figure. in vitro OPC culture – stainings with Pdgfr, O4, GalC?

The authors also mention this missing information in the Discussion section. In order to support this link more with the resources they have, they can check how the Gsk3b activity (phosphorylation by Akt) and the activity/level of the proteins downstream of Gsk3b change in Pten(f/f) mouse.</p></disp-quote><p>This is an important suggestion. For this, we performed several new western blot analysis, and provide results in new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8E–H</xref>.

In the Discussion section, the authors argue that non-cell specific KO of PTEN does not show the same results as theirs because of non-autonomous mechanisms. There is no data to support this interpretation at this point. Importantly, if the difference is due to non-cell autonomous effect, it is going to be extremely difficult to utilize this PTEN-Akt-GSK3b axis as a means of treatment.</p></disp-quote><p>Utilizing Cre mice (not CreER) for loss of function studies often lead to long-term genetic inactivation through development depending on activity of the used promoter. As consequences, it is possible that there is compensation, but also it amplifies or induces secondary damages. Although we have not further sought to identify the exact causes of the phenotypic differences, our inducible Cre-based PTEN inactivation for three weeks or a month may mimic the short-term molecular inactivation, which maybe also clinically reasonable.</p></body></sub-article></article>
