pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.38689.001</object-id><p>We recently reported that the inward-rectifier Kir2.1 channel in brain capillary endothelial cells (cECs) plays a major role in neurovascular coupling (NVC) by mediating a neuronal activity-dependent, propagating vasodilatory (hyperpolarizing) signal. We further demonstrated that Kir2.1 activity is suppressed by depletion of plasma membrane phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP<sub>2</sub>). Whether cECs express depolarizing channels that intersect with Kir2.1-mediated signaling remains unknown. Here, we report that Ca<sup>2+</sup>/Na<sup>+</sup>-permeable TRPV4 (transient receptor potential vanilloid 4) channels are expressed in cECs and are tonically inhibited by PIP<sub>2</sub>. We further demonstrate that depletion of PIP<sub>2</sub> by agonists, including putative NVC mediators, that promote PIP<sub>2</sub> hydrolysis by signaling through G<sub>q</sub>-protein-coupled receptors (G<sub>q</sub>PCRs) caused simultaneous disinhibition of TRPV4 channels and suppression of Kir2.1 channels. These findings collectively support the concept that G<sub>q</sub>PCR activation functions as a molecular switch to favor capillary TRPV4 activity over Kir2.1 signaling, an observation with potentially profound significance for the control of cerebral blood flow.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.38689.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Capillaries form branching networks that surround all cells of the body. They allow oxygen and nutrient exchange between blood and tissue, but this is not their only role. Capillaries in the brain form a tight barrier that prevents components carried in the blood from easily reaching the brain compartment. They also detect the activity of neurons and trigger on-demand increases in blood flow to active regions of the brain. This role, revealed only recently, depends upon ion channels on the surface of the capillary cells. Active neurons release potassium ions, which open a type of ion channel called Kir2.1 that allows potassium inside the cell to flow out. This process is repeated in neighboring capillary cells until it reaches an upstream vessel, where it causes the vessel to relax and increase the blood flow.</p><p>Kir2.1 channels sit astride the membranes of capillary cells, where they can interact with other membrane molecules. One such molecule, called PIP<sub>2</sub>, plays several roles in relaying signals from the outside to the inside of cells. It also physically interacts with channels in the membrane, including Kir2.1 channels. If PIP<sub>2</sub> levels are low, Kir2.1 channel activity decreases.</p><p>Here, Harraz et al. discovered that capillary cells contain another type of ion channel, called TRPV4, which is also regulated by PIP<sub>2</sub>. But unlike Kir2.1, its activity increases when PIP<sub>2</sub> levels drop. Moreover, TRPV4 channels allow sodium and calcium ions to flow into the cell, which has an effect opposite to that of potassium flowing out of the cell.</p><p>Capillary cells also have receptor proteins called G<sub>q</sub>PCRs that are activated by chemical signals released by active neurons in the brain. G<sub>q</sub>PCRs break down PIP<sub>2</sub>, so their activity turns Kir2.1 channels off and TRPV4 channels on. This resets the system so that it is ready to respond to new signals from active neurons. G<sub>q</sub>PCRs work as molecular switches to control the balance between Kir2.1 and TRPV4 channels and turn brain blood flow up and down.</p><p>G<sub>q</sub>PCRs and ion channels that depend on PIP<sub>2</sub> can also be found in other types of cells. These findings could reveal clues about how signals are switched on and off in different cells. Understanding the role of PIP<sub>2</sub> in signaling could also unveil what happens when signaling go wrong.</p></abstract><kwd-group

id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Endothelial cells (ECs) line the lumen of all blood vessels and are important regulators of artery and arteriole smooth muscle contractility. In capillaries, which lack an overlying smooth muscle cell layer, this regulatory function is absent. In these smallest of all blood vessels, ECs instead support the nutrient- and gas-exchange function characteristic of capillary beds generally. In the brain, capillary ECs (cECs) also constitute the blood-brain barrier, reflecting the presence of tight junctions between adjacent cECs. Not surprisingly given these differing cellular missions, the molecular repertoire of brain cECs and arterial/arteriolar ECs exhibit some marked differences. Notably, intermediate and small-conductance Ca<sup>2+</sup>-activated K<sup>+</sup> channels (IK and SK, respectively), which are important in transducing elevations in intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentration ([Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub>) into membrane potential hyperpolarization in artery/arteriolar ECs to cause relaxation of electrically coupled smooth muscle cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Ledoux et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Sonkusare et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Taylor et al., 2003</xref>), are absent in brain cECs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Longden et al., 2017</xref>). However, signaling through G protein–coupled receptors of the Gα<sub>q/11</sub>-subtype (G<sub>q</sub>PCRs)—an important component of this smooth muscle regulatory axis—is robust in brain cECs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Harraz et al., 2018</xref>). In the canonical pathway of G<sub>q</sub>PCR signaling, Gα<sub>q</sub> released upon agonist binding activates phospholipase C (PLC), which hydrolyzes the minor inner leaflet phospholipid, phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP<sub>2</sub>). Breakdown of PIP<sub>2</sub> yields diacylglycerol (DAG) and inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP<sub>3</sub>), the latter of which increases [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> by acting on its cognate receptor (IP<sub>3</sub>R) on the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) to promote Ca<sup>2+</sup> release from intracellular stores.</p><p>Blood delivery within the brain is mediated by an ever-narrowing vascular tree comprising surface arteries, penetrating (parenchymal) arterioles and a vast network of capillaries, which enormously extend the territory of perfusion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Blinder et al., 2013</xref>). Because the brain lacks substantial energy reserves, it relies on an on-demand mechanism for redistributing oxygen and nutrients to regions of higher neuronal activity, a process in which products released by active neurons trigger a local increase in blood flow. This use-dependent increase in local blood flow (functional hyperemia), mediated by a process termed neurovascular coupling (NVC), is essential for normal brain function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Iadecola and Nedergaard, 2007</xref>) and represents the physiological basis for functional magnetic resonance imaging (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Raichle and Mintun, 2006</xref>).</p><p>We recently reported that brain capillaries act as a neuronal activity-sensing network, demonstrating that brain cECs are capable of initiating an electrical (hyperpolarizing) signal in response to neuronal activity that rapidly propagates upstream to dilate feeding parenchymal arterioles and increase blood flow locally at the site of signal initiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Longden et al., 2017</xref>). We also established the molecular mechanism underlying this process, showing that extracellular K<sup>+</sup>—a byproduct of every neuronal action potential—is the critical mediator and identifying the Kir2.1 channel as the key molecular player (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Longden et al., 2017</xref>). Kir2.1 channels are activated by external K<sup>+</sup> and exhibit steep activation by hyperpolarization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Hibino et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Longden and Nelson, 2015</xref>), characteristics that facilitate regenerative K<sup>+</sup> conductance in neighboring cECs and enable long-range propagation of the hyperpolarizing signal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Longden et al., 2017</xref>). Intriguingly, we have since discovered that decreases in capillary endothelial PIP<sub>2</sub> levels induced by G<sub>q</sub>PCRs agonists suppress Kir2.1 channel currents, reflecting the fact that PIP<sub>2</sub> is required for Kir2.1 channel activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Harraz et al., 2018</xref>). Importantly, this suppressive effect of PIP<sub>2</sub> depletion exerts a major modulatory influence on K<sup>+</sup>-evoked hyperemic responses in vivo. In addition to regulating Kir2 family members, PIP<sub>2</sub> has been shown to bind to and regulate a diverse array of ion channels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Hille et al., 2015</xref>). Notable in this context, PIP<sub>2</sub> binding has been shown to inhibit several members of the transient receptor potential (TRP) family of non-selective cation channels, including the vanilloid subtype TRPV4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Nilius et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Rohacs, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Takahashi et al., 2014</xref>), which we and others have shown is an important Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx pathway in arterial and arteriolar ECs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Earley and Brayden, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Sonkusare et al., 2014</xref>;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Sonkusare et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">White et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>The Kir2.1 channel appears to be the major K<sup>+</sup> channel type in brain cECs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Longden et al., 2017</xref>). However, the identity of depolarizing (Na<sup>+</sup>/Ca<sup>2+</sup>-permeable) channels in cECs is not known. Here, we show that TRPV4 channels are present in cECs and exhibit an exceedingly low open probability under basal conditions due to tonic inhibition by PIP<sub>2</sub>. We have further found that this inhibition is relieved through PIP<sub>2</sub> depletion, independent of the action of the PIP<sub>2</sub> hydrolysis products, DAG and IP<sub>3</sub>. These findings provide a counterpoint to our recent demonstration that Kir2.1 channel activity is sustained by basal levels of PIP<sub>2</sub> and suppressed by G<sub>q</sub>PCR-mediated PIP<sub>2</sub> depletion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Harraz et al., 2018</xref>). Collectively, our findings indicate that PIP<sub>2</sub> exerts opposite effects on TRPV4 and Kir2.1 channels in brain cECs, demonstrating that a single regulatory pathway governs the balance between two divergent signaling modalities—one depolarizing and the other hyperpolarizing—in the capillary endothelium.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>TRPV4 channels in brain cECs are inhibited by intracellular ATP</title><p>We previously reported that the selective TRPV4 agonist GSK1016790A (hereafter GSK101) is a potent activator of TRPV4 currents in mesenteric artery ECs that induces maximal arterial dilation at concentrations in the low nanomolar range (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Sonkusare et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Sonkusare et al., 2012</xref>). To assess TRPV4 channel expression and function in brain cECs, we first performed patch-clamp electrophysiology experiments on freshly isolated cECs from C57BL/6J mouse brain slices, prepared as described in Materials and methods. Specifically, we recorded outward K<sup>+</sup> currents mediated by TRPV4 channels in the cytoplasm-intact, perforated whole-cell configuration using a 300 ms ramp protocol (−100 to +100 mV, from a holding potential of −50 mV). Recordings were made in the presence of the voltage-dependent pore blocker ruthenium red (RuR; 1 µM), an approach we have previously used to assess TRPV4 currents in mesenteric artery ECs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Sonkusare et al., 2012</xref>). Under these conditions, depolarizing ramps rapidly displace RuR, allowing unimpeded outward K<sup>+</sup> currents to be detected while preventing Na<sup>+</sup>/Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx and associated Ca<sup>2+</sup> overload and cell death (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Sonkusare et al., 2012</xref>). Unexpectedly, we found that GSK101 was unable to evoke a detectable whole-cell TRPV4 current in cECs at concentrations that maximally activate TRPV4 channels in mesenteric artery ECs; in fact, even GSK101 concentrations as high as 100 nM failed to stimulate a detectable TRPV4 current in isolated cECs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). However, we serendipitously found that breaking through the cell membrane from a perforated patch in the presence of an otherwise ineffective GSK101 concentration (100 nM) resulted in the gradual (~5 min) development of a robust TRPV4 current, suggesting that a factor that suppresses TRPV4 channels had been washed out of the cell.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.38689.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Intracellular ATP suppresses TRPV4 currents in cECs.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Representative traces of TRPV4 currents recorded from freshly isolated cECs using voltage ramps (−100 to 100 mV, from a holding potential −50 mV; inset) and different patch-clamp configurations before (black) and after (blue) the application of 100 nM GSK101 and 1 µM RuR. <italic>Top</italic>: Currents recorded in the perforated whole-cell configuration. <italic>Middle</italic>: Currents recorded in the conventional whole-cell configuration (dialyzed cytoplasm, 1 mM Mg-ATP in the pipette solution). <italic>Bottom</italic>: Currents recorded in the conventional whole-cell configuration (0 mM Mg-ATP in the pipette solution) developed gradually over ~4 min.

In striking contrast, this same concentration of GSK101 caused the gradual (~4–5 min) development of a robust outward current in the conventional whole-cell configuration when Mg-ATP was omitted from the pipette solution (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Collectively, these observations suggest that ATP is the suppressive factor in question. Consistent with this interpretation, intracellular Mg-ATP (1 mM) caused a dramatic shift in the sensitivity of cEC TRPV4 channels to GSK101: at a potential of 100 mV, the EC<sub>50</sub> of GSK101 for TRPV4 channels in the presence of Mg-ATP was 415 nM. However, in the absence of Mg-ATP, the EC<sub>50</sub> was reduced ~23 fold to 18 nM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A,B</xref>), a value comparable to that observed in mesenteric artery ECs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Sonkusare et al., 2014</xref>). The suppressive effect of ATP was specific for adenosine nucleotides, as inclusion of 1 mM GTP in the patch pipette did not alter currents (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C</xref>). GSK101-induced currents were completely abolished by the selective TRPV4 channel antagonist HC-067047 (1 µM) and were absent in cECs from TRPV4-knockout (TRPV4<sup>-/-</sup>) mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig1sdata1">Figure 1—source data 1</xref>), confirming that these currents are attributable to TRPV4 channels. The inhibitory effect of intracellular Mg-ATP (1 mM) was not limited to GSK101-activated TRPV4 currents. As shown (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>), it also suppressed both inward and outward currents in cECs activated by the TRPV4 agonist 4α-phorbol 12,13-didecanoate (4α-PDD; 5 µM, in the absence of RuR).</p><p>There was no detectable whole-cell TRPV4 current in the absence of a TRPV4 activator (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>), suggesting that these channels have a very low basal open probability. To further investigate this, we monitored single TRPV4 channel openings using dialyzed cECs in the conventional whole-cell configuration, an approach that should allow detection of openings of all channels throughout the cEC plasma membrane while controlling intracellular composition. First, we measured TRPV4 unitary currents in dialyzed cECs (0 mM Mg-ATP) held at +50 mV before and after the application of 100 nM GSK101. The unitary current amplitude in the presence of GSK101, estimated from amplitude histograms, was 4.6 ± 0.3 pA (n = 3) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3A</xref>). This value corresponds to a single-channel conductance of 92 ± 6 pS, in line with values reported in an earlier investigation of TRPV4 channels in native arterial ECs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Watanabe et al., 2002</xref>) and heterologous expression systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Loukin et al., 2010</xref>). Extending these results, we next performed a series of single-channel recordings in the absence of GSK101. cECs held at +50 mV and dialyzed with Mg-ATP (1 mM) displayed infrequent openings (NP<sub>O</sub> = 0.038 ± 0.006), but removing ATP increased single-channel opening by ~6 fold (NP<sub>O</sub> = 0.209 ± 0.044) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig1sdata3">Figure 1—source data 3</xref>). Single-channel openings in the absence of agonist exhibited a unitary current of 4.5 ± 0.3 pA at +50 mV (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3B</xref>), similar to that evoked using a specific TRPV4 agonist (4.6 pA) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3A</xref>) and corresponding to a conductance of 90 ± 6 pS. Single-channel currents recorded in the absence of GSK101 were inhibited by the TRPV4 blocker HC-067047 (NP<sub>O</sub> = 0.063 ± 0.028) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig1sdata3">Figure 1—source data 3</xref>), confirming their identity as TRPV4 channel-mediated currents. Based on our estimate of ~225 functional TRPV4 channels per cEC (see Materials and methods), we calculate that capillary TRPV4 channels have a basal open probability (P<sub>O</sub>) of ~0.0002. These observations collectively indicate that capillary TRPV4 channels exhibit a low open probability under basal conditions, and that both constitutive and agonist-induced TRPV4 activities are suppressed by intracellular ATP and recover following ATP washout/dialysis.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>TRPV4 channel suppression is dependent on ATP hydrolysis, but independent of protein kinase A, G or C</title><p>The Mg<sup>2+</sup> salt of ATP is readily hydrolyzable and can be utilized by kinases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">O'Rourke, 1993</xref>). To test whether TRPV4 suppression requires ATP hydrolysis, we replaced ATP in the patch pipette with the poorly hydrolyzable analog, ATP-γ-S (1 mM). Under these conditions, GSK101 (100 nM) increased TRPV4 currents to same extent as observed in cells dialyzed with 0 mM Mg-ATP, indicating that ATP hydrolysis is required for channel inhibition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A,B</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig2sdata1">Figure 2—source data 1</xref>).

It is thus conceivable that G<sub>q</sub>PCR-mediated signaling could shift the balance between TRPV4 and Kir2.1 signaling in brain capillaries through perturbation of endothelial PIP<sub>2</sub> levels. To test this, we designed an experiment that allowed simultaneous monitoring of TRPV4 and Kir2.1 currents in the context of G<sub>q</sub>PCR-mediated changes in endothelial PIP<sub>2</sub> levels. Using the perforated-patch configuration to maintain physiological levels of ATP and PIP<sub>2</sub>, and bathing cECs in a solution containing an extracellular K<sup>+</sup> concentration ([K<sup>+</sup>]<sub>o</sub>) of 60 mM to facilitate monitoring of Kir2.1 currents, we evoked TRPV4 currents with 2 µM GSK101, a concentration sufficient to sub-maximally activate an outward current in this configuration (in the presence of 1 µM RuR to block inward TRPV4 current). In this setting, application of PGE<sub>2</sub> (2 µM) enhanced TRPV4 currents and simultaneously inhibited Kir2.1 currents (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A,B</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig6sdata1">Figure 6—source data 1</xref>) compared with matching time controls, which showed no significant change in either current (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>). The onset of changes in TRPV4 and Kir2.1 currents in response to PGE<sub>2</sub> was rapid (&lt;60 s). A kinetic analysis revealed that TRPV4 activation and Kir2.1 suppression were kinetically comparable, with times for half-maximal change in activity (<italic>t</italic><sub>0.5</sub>) of 3.4 min for TRPV4 and 4.4 min for Kir2.1 channels, and corresponding time constants (τ) of 4.9 and 6.4 min, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig6sdata2">Figure 6—source data 2</xref>).

We have also shown that G<sub>q</sub>PCR-mediated PIP<sub>2</sub> depletion inhibits capillary electrical signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Harraz et al., 2018</xref>), identifying a point of intersection between electrical signaling and endothelial G<sub>q</sub>PCR activity. In the present study, we show that cECs express TRPV4 channels, and demonstrate that these channels are tonically suppressed by basal levels of PIP<sub>2</sub>. Furthermore, we show that G<sub>q</sub>PCR activation relieves TRPV4 channel inhibition through PIP<sub>2</sub> depletion. This paradigm introduces the phosphoinositide PIP<sub>2</sub> as a master regulator of TRPV4 and Kir2.1 signaling in the capillary endothelium and highlights the ability of G<sub>q</sub>PCR activity to tune the balance of these signaling modalities to favor TRPV4 signaling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>).</p><p>The repertoire of functional ion channels in brain cECs remains incompletely characterized, although certain molecular features have recently come into focus. For instance, our evidence suggests that the inward rectifier Kir2.1 channel is the major K<sup>+</sup> channel type in brain cECs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Longden et al., 2017</xref>), whereas Ca<sup>2+</sup>-sensitive SK and IK channels, which are present in arterial and arteriolar ECs and play a prominent role in regulating vascular tone (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Ledoux et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Sonkusare et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Taylor et al., 2003</xref>), are not expressed in brain cECs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Longden et al., 2017</xref>). Notably, the identity of depolarizing (Na<sup>+</sup> and/or Ca<sup>2+</sup>-permeable) channels in cECs, which we predict must be present to allow the membrane potential to reset to support repeated operation of our previously reported Kir2.1-dependent electrical signaling-based NVC mechanism, is not known. Our demonstration that the highly selective TRPV4 agonist, GSK101, induced currents in brain cECs that were eliminated by the TRPV4-specific antagonist, HC-067047, and were absent in cECs from TRPV4<sup>-/-</sup> mice firmly establishes the presence of this non-selective cation channel in capillaries. In arterial and arteriolar ECs, TRPV4 channel-mediated Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx is closely linked to activation of Ca<sup>2+</sup>-sensitive SK and IK channels and subsequent membrane potential hyperpolarization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Sonkusare et al., 2012</xref>). However, because cECs lack functional Ca<sup>2+</sup>-activated K<sup>+</sup> channels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Longden et al., 2017</xref>), TRPV4-mediated influx of Na<sup>+</sup>/Ca<sup>2+</sup> in these cells instead would lead to membrane potential depolarization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Behringer et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Earley and Brayden, 2015</xref>). Collectively, these observations suggest that the TRPV4 channel is a major depolarizing element in cECs, although we cannot rule out the possibility that other, as yet unidentified, cation channels may contribute to membrane depolarization, as suggested by earlier studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Csanády and Adam-Vizi, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Popp and Gögelein, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Csanády and Adam-Vizi, 2003</xref>). Our observations also highlight the fact that the functional role of TRPV4 channels is critically dependent on the expression and function of key associated proteins.</p><p>Intriguingly, and in striking contrast to the case in peripheral arterial ECs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Sonkusare et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Sonkusare et al., 2012</xref>), the open probability of capillary TRPV4 channels in cECs was remarkably low under basal conditions and was increased by dialyzing out intracellular contents—the first link in the chain leading to our discovery that TRPV4 channels in cECs are intrinsically inhibited by intracellular ATP. It is well established that lipid kinases involved in PIP<sub>2</sub> synthesis require millimolar ATP for their activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Balla and Balla, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Hilgemann, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Knight and Shokat, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Suer et al., 2001</xref>), and it has been amply demonstrated that PIP<sub>2</sub> maintenance is dependent on ATP in multiple cell types (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Suh and Hille, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Ye et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Zakharian et al., 2011</xref>), including cECs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Harraz et al., 2018</xref>). Three major lines of evidence presented here support the conclusion that cytosolic ATP-dependent maintenance of sustained, basal levels of PIP<sub>2</sub> suppresses TRPV4 channel activity. First, millimolar concentrations of hydrolyzable ATP suppressed capillary TRPV4 channel activity. Second, inclusion of PIP<sub>2</sub> analogs in the patch pipette inhibited TRPV4 currents. Third, scavenging PIP<sub>2</sub> or inhibiting its synthesis abrogated ATP-mediated inhibition. Notably, PIP<sub>2</sub> has been reported to directly interact with different residues on the TRPV4 N-terminus in heterologous expression systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Garcia-Elias et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Takahashi et al., 2014</xref>). However, these studies reached discrepant conclusions, with one suggesting that direct binding of PIP<sub>2</sub> to the ankyrin repeat domain of the TRPV4 channel inhibits different modes of TRPV4 activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Takahashi et al., 2014</xref>) and the other reporting that PIP<sub>2</sub> is necessary for heat-, hypotonicity- or epoxyeicosatrienoic acid (EET)-induced channel activation by facilitating structural rearrangements of the channel (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Garcia-Elias et al., 2013</xref>). These discrepancies may reflect divergent effects of PIP<sub>2</sub> on channel behavior through binding to multiple sites in the channel. Intriguingly, the putative endogenous TRPV4 channel activator (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Earley and Brayden, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Watanabe et al., 2003</xref>) 11,12-epoxyeicosatrienoic acid (11,12-EET, 1 µM) evoked currents in cECs even in the absence of dialyzed PIP<sub>2</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>). In any case, our results are the first to report PIP<sub>2</sub>-mediated suppression of TRPV4 channels in the endothelium and more broadly in native cells and are congruent with the results of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Takahashi et al., 2014</xref>. Interestingly, a recent study provided structural evidence that lipid molecules are tightly bound to the selectivity filter of the TRPV4 channel pore, although the identity and function of these lipids were not characterized (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Deng et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>Canonical G<sub>q</sub>PCR signaling involves PLC activation and subsequent PIP<sub>2</sub> breakdown into DAG and IP<sub>3</sub>. Receptor agonists that activate G<sub>q</sub>PCRs can dramatically lower PIP<sub>2</sub> by promoting its hydrolysis at rates that exceed those of PIP<sub>2</sub> re-synthesis. We show here that PGE<sub>2</sub>, which has previously been postulated to act as an NVC agent through actions on G<sub>s</sub>-coupled EP<sub>2</sub>/EP<sub>4</sub> receptors in arteriolar smooth muscle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Lacroix et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Zonta et al., 2003</xref>), activates TRPV4 channels in cECs independent of the action of the PIP<sub>2</sub> metabolites, DAG and IP<sub>3</sub>, by relieving PIP<sub>2</sub>-mediated suppression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). In contrast, we recently showed that G<sub>q</sub>PCR agonists exert the opposite effect on capillary Kir2.1 channels, inhibiting their ability to mediate capillary-to-arteriole electrical signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Harraz et al., 2018</xref>). In keeping with these previous findings and our current observations, simultaneous monitoring of TRPV4 and Kir2.1 channel currents confirmed the bidirectional effects of G<sub>q</sub>PCR agonists on the two channels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). This two-way modulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>) is unique as it indicates that a single G<sub>q</sub>PCR signaling cascade is capable of altering the balance between electrical Kir2.1 signaling (<italic>inhibition</italic>) and TRPV4 signaling (<italic>facilitation</italic>). Given the absence of Ca<sup>2+</sup>-activated K<sup>+</sup> channels in cECs, noted above, G<sub>q</sub>PCR signaling-induced PIP<sub>2</sub> depletion would likely depolarize cECs through the simultaneous disinhibition of depolarizing TRPV4 channels (this study) and deactivation of hyperpolarizing Kir2.1 channels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Harraz et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>Based on our direct Kir2.1 current measurements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Harraz et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Longden et al., 2017</xref>) and the known voltage- and K<sup>+</sup>-dependence of Kir2.1 channels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Longden and Nelson, 2015</xref>), we estimate that the outward current through these channels at physiological membrane potentials (about −40 mV) and external K<sup>+</sup> (3 mM) is ~6 fA. Elevation of external K<sup>+</sup> to 10 mM would increase Kir2 current at this voltage to ~260 fA. Though seemingly miniscule, such small membrane currents are precisely what is needed to ensure conduction fidelity. We have measured a sustained and profound hyperpolarization of about −25 mV in arteriolar smooth muscle in response to capillary stimulation with 10 mM K<sup>+</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Longden et al., 2017</xref>). Our computational modeling indicates that a stable membrane hyperpolarization of 25 mV requires the outward (hyperpolarizing) current to greatly exceed the inward (depolarizing) current. Our estimate of basal, PIP<sub>2</sub>-suppressed TRPV4 current at −40 mV is about −80 fA. G<sub>q</sub>PCR activation increases open probability ~6 fold, producing a current (400–500 fA) sufficient to effectively short circuit K<sup>+</sup>-induced hyperpolarization and cripple this key Kir2.1-based NVC mechanism. In conclusion, the low level of TRPV4 channel activity aligns with the functional role of capillaries.</p><p>Activation of capillary G<sub>q</sub>PCRs should also trigger Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals in cECs, presumably through IP<sub>3</sub>-mediated Ca<sup>2+</sup> release from intracellular stores as well as disinhibition of TRPV4 channels (as described here) and subsequent Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx. Such capillary Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals should positively influence hemodynamics—and thus functional hyperemia—providing a plausible explanation for the role of G<sub>q</sub>PCR agonists in the NVC process, presumably through the Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent activation of nitric oxide synthase (NOS) and subsequent release of the vasodilator, NO (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Förstermann et al., 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Marziano et al., 2017</xref>). Capillary Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling might also serve an entirely different purpose in functional hyperemia: because local Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals represent sites of PIP<sub>2</sub> depletion (through G<sub>q</sub>PCR signaling), and thus membrane potential depolarization (through TRPV4 disinhibition and Kir2.1 deactivation), they are likely to interfere with the progression of electrical signals generated further down the vascular tree. Accordingly, these signals may represent ‘stop signs’ or ‘speed bumps’ that play a role in redirecting hyperpolarizing (vasodilatory) signals away from certain brain areas, in addition to their role in resetting the capillary membrane potential, noted above.</p><p>Given the role of PIP<sub>2</sub> in negatively regulating TRPV4 channels, the exceedingly low basal TRPV4 activity and diminished sensitivity to GSK101 in cECs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>) compared with mesenteric artery ECs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Sonkusare et al., 2012</xref>) suggest differences in the PIP<sub>2</sub> ‘set point’ in these two vascular beds. This supposition has important physiological implications for electrical signaling in the brain. Our data suggest that PIP<sub>2</sub> levels in brain cECs are sufficient to saturate Kir2.1 channels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Harraz et al., 2018</xref>) and tune TRPV4 channel currents to levels that prevent inappropriate depolarization of the membrane potential (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). In the absence of PIP<sub>2</sub> suppression of TRPV4 channel-mediated inward currents, it is unlikely that increased outward K<sup>+</sup> currents through Kir2.1 channels in response to elevated K<sup>+</sup> would be sufficient to cause membrane potential hyperpolarization. The mechanistic basis for the apparently higher PIP<sub>2</sub> set point in brain cECs is currently unknown, but could include lower constitutive G<sub>q</sub>PCR activity, lower microenvironmental levels of G<sub>q</sub>PCR agonists and/or decreased G<sub>q</sub>PCR expression—and thus diminished PIP<sub>2</sub> breakdown. Along these lines, a recent single-cell transcriptomics analysis showed that Gα<sub>q</sub> (<italic>Gnaq</italic>) transcript levels in the mouse brain endothelium are reduced compared with those in peripheral pulmonary ECs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Vanlandewijck et al., 2018</xref>). Alternatively, differences in the set point could be indicative of more robust PIP<sub>2</sub> synthesis in brain capillaries, a speculation that is supported by the higher mitochondrial content—and hence ATP synthesis—in highly active brain cECs compared with other ECs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Oldendorf and Brown, 1975</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Oldendorf et al., 1977</xref>).</p><p>In conclusion, this study provides compelling evidence that brain capillaries express TRPV4 channels and further shows that the activity of these channels is physiologically suppressed by basal levels of PIP<sub>2</sub>. This introduces PIP<sub>2</sub> and its modulation by G<sub>q</sub>PCR agonists as major regulators of brain capillary signaling. When maintained at sufficient levels, PIP<sub>2</sub> inhibits TRPV4 channels and supports capillary-to-arteriole electrical signaling, but in response to G<sub>q</sub>PCR activation, PIP<sub>2</sub> levels are reduced, enhancing TRPV4 signaling and inhibiting retrograde electrical signaling via Kir2.1 channels. Capillary G<sub>q</sub>PCRs can therefore be envisioned as molecular switches that dictate the signaling modality in the brain microvasculature.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th valign="top">Reagent type (species) or resource</th><th valign="top">Designation</th><th valign="top">Source or reference</th><th valign="top">Identifiers</th><th valign="top">Additional information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td valign="top">Strain, strain background <break/>(<italic>Mus musculus</italic>, males)</td><td valign="top">TRPV4 Knockout <break/>(TRPV4<sup>-/-</sup>) mice, <break/>C57BL/6J background</td><td valign="top"><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Thorneloe et al.

Slices were homogenized in ice-cold artificial cerebrospinal fluid (124 mM NaCl, 3 mM KCl, 2 mM CaCl<sub>2</sub>, 2 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 1.25 mM NaH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>, 26 mM NaHCO<sub>3</sub>, 4 mM glucose), and debris was removed by passing the homogenate through a 62 µm nylon mesh. Retained capillary fragments were eluted into dissociation solution composed of 55 mM NaCl, 80 mM Na-glutamate, 5.6 mM KCl, 2 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 4 mM glucose and 10 mM HEPES (pH 7.3), containing neutral protease (0.5 mg/mL) and elastase (0.5 mg/mL) (Worthington, USA) plus 100 µM CaCl<sub>2</sub>, and incubated for 24 min at 37°C. Thereafter, 0.5 mg/ml collagenase type I (Worthington) was added and the sample was incubated for an additional 2 min at 37°C. The cell suspension was filtered and the residue was washed to remove enzymes. Single cells and small capillary fragments were dispersed by triturating 4–6 times with a fire-polished glass Pasteur pipette. Cells were stored in ice-cold isolation medium for use the same day (within ~6 hr).</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>Electrophysiology</title><p>All patch-clamp electrophysiological recordings were performed at room temperature (∼22°C) in either the conventional or perforated whole-cell configuration. Currents were amplified using an Axopatch 200B amplifier, filtered at 1 kHz, digitized at 10 kHz, and stored on a computer for offline analysis with Clampfit 10.5 software. Recording pipettes were fabricated by pulling borosilicate glass (1.5 mm outer diameter, 1.17 mm inner diameter; Sutter Instruments, USA) using a Narishige puller. Pipettes were fire-polished to reach a tip resistance of ~4–6 MΩ. The bath solution consisted of 80 or 134 mM NaCl, 60 or 6 mM KCl, 1 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 10 mM HEPES, 4 mM glucose, and 2 mM CaCl<sub>2</sub> (pH 7.4). For the conventional whole-cell configuration, pipettes were backfilled with a solution consisting of 10 mM NaOH, 11.4 mM KOH, 128.6 mM KCl, 1.1 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 2.2 mM CaCl<sub>2</sub>, 5 mM EGTA, and 10 mM HEPES (pH 7.2). A subset of experiments utilized a Mg<sup>2+</sup>-free solution, obtained by excluding MgCl<sub>2</sub> from the pipette solution. In another group of cells, EGTA was replaced with BAPTA (5.4 mM). For perforated-patch electrophysiology, the pipette solution was composed of 10 mM NaCl, 26.6 mM KCl, 110 mM K<sup>+</sup> aspartate, 1 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub> and 10 mM HEPES; amphotericin B (200–250 µg/ml) was freshly added on the day of the experiment. Whole-cell capacitance, measured using the cancellation circuitry in the voltage-clamp amplifier, averaged 8.6 pF.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Calculation of TRPV4 channel numbers</title><p>TRPV4 membrane currents were measured using the conventional whole-cell configuration and physiological concentrations of salts. Ruthenium red (RuR; 1 µM) was used to block Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx and thereby prevent Ca<sup>2+</sup> overload. We have shown previously that RuR causes a voltage-dependent block of TRPV channels and is rapidly driven out of the pore by membrane depolarization; at +100 mV, RuR (1 µM) blocks approximately 19% of the TRPV4 current (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Sonkusare et al., 2012</xref>). The number of TRPV4 channels activated by 100 nM GSK101 was estimated by dividing the GSK101-induced current at +100 mV by the unitary current at this voltage (i.e. 10 pA) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Loukin et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Watanabe et al., 2002</xref>) and correcting for the degree of RuR block.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Data analysis</title><p>Data are expressed as means ± standard error of the mean (SEM). Effects of a given condition/treatment on whole-cell current were compared using paired or unpaired <italic>t</italic> tests or analysis of variance (ANOVA), as appropriate, using Graphpad Prism 7.01 software. p values≤0.05 were considered statistically significant. Additional patch-clamp data analyses were performed using Clampfit 10.5 software.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgement</title><p>This study was supported by a postdoctoral fellowship (17POST33650030 to OFH) and a scientist development grant (17SDG33670237 to TAL) from the American Heart Association, and grants from the Totman Medical Research Trust (to MTN), Fondation Leducq (to MTN), European Union's Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme (grant agreement No 666881, SVDs@target, to MTN), and National Institutes of Health (4P20 GM103644/4-5 to the Vermont Center on Behavior and Health (TAL); P30-GM-103498 to the COBRE imaging facility at UVM College of Medicine; and P01-HL-095488, R01-HL-121706, R37-DK-053832, 7UM-HL-1207704 and R01-HL-131181 to MTN).</p></ack><sec id="s5" sec-type="additional-information"><title>Additional information</title><fn-group content-type="competing-interest"><title>Competing interests</title><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf1"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="author-contribution"><title>Author contributions</title><fn fn-type="con" id="con1"><p>Conceptualization, Data curation, Formal analysis, Funding acquisition, Investigation, Methodology, Writing—original draft, Writing—review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con2"><p>Funding acquisition, Investigation, Methodology, Writing—review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con3"><p>Writing—original draft, Writing—review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con4"><p>Conceptualization, Resources, Supervision, Funding acquisition, Writing—original draft, Writing—review and editing</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="ethics-information"><title>Ethics</title><fn fn-type="other"><p>Animal experimentation: This study was performed in strict accordance with the recommendations in the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals of the National Institutes of Health.

Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, including László Csanády as the Reviewing Editor and Reviewer #1, and the evaluation has been overseen by Richard Aldrich as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Tibor Rohacs (Reviewer #2).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>The work by Harraz et al. investigates regulation of TRPV4 channel activity in brain capillary endothelial cells. The authors show that dialysis of the cells with hydrolyzable (Mg salt), but not with non-hydrolyzable (Na salt, ATP-γ-S) forms of ATP tonically suppresses TRPV4 currents. Using specific inhibitors of various protein and lipid kinases they demonstrate that the inhibition requires the activity of phosphatidyl inositol kinases, suggesting that it is mediated by PIP<sub>2</sub>. Indeed, cell dialysis with PIP<sub>2</sub> causes TRPV4 inhibition even in the absence of Mg-ATP, and dialysis with the PIP<sub>2</sub>-scavenger polylysine reduces tonic inhibition by endogenous PIP<sub>2</sub> even in the presence of ATP. Finally, they show that extracellular application of the G<sub>q</sub>PCR agonists PGE<sub>2</sub> or carbachol potentiates TRPV4 activity, and this effect can be specifically abolished by pharmacological agents that inhibit individual components of the G<sub>q</sub>PCR-PLC pathway. Given the contradictory earlier reports of the effects of PIP<sub>2</sub> on TRPV4 (activating vs. inhibiting), the use of complementary approaches is important. Another strength of the manuscript is that they study exclusively native cells, and use both TRPV4 inhibitors and a TRPV4 -/- mouse to demonstrate that the currents they measure are indeed mediated by TRPV4.</p><p>The data are of high quality, and support the authors' conclusions. Together with previous work by the authors (Harraz et al., 2018) the present work suggests that PIP<sub>2</sub> depletion reciprocally regulates the hyperpolarizing Kir2.1 and the depolarizing TRPV4 current in brain capillary endothelial cells, identifying these as molecular players involved in the initiation and/or propagation of the vasodilation observed during functional hyperemia. All in all, this is a beautiful study which promotes mechanistic understanding of the process of neurovascular coupling in the brain, and is highly suitable for publication in <italic>eLife</italic>.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Experimental:</p><p>What is the natural activator of TRPV4 in brain cECs? Even upon PIP<sub>2</sub> depletion whole-cell NP<sub>o</sub> is only ~0.2 (amounting to a single-channel P<sub>o</sub> of ~0.001), which is negligible channel activity. Thus, there must be a natural activator to induce TRPV4 currents in vivo. The authors use exclusively GSK101 as an agonist. In an earlier paper Garcia-Elias et al. (2013) showed that TRPV4 currents induced by heat and osmotic swelling (but not by 4aPDD) were inhibited by selective depletion of PIP<sub>2</sub> using a chemically inducible lipid phosphatase. Given these contradictory results on positive vs. negative effects of PIP<sub>2</sub> on TRPV4 channels it would be important to test whether the differential effects of PIP<sub>2</sub> are due to different modes of activation, or to different cellular environments. e.g., are native TRPV4 channels activated by heat (Garcia-Elias used 38<sup>o</sup>C as stimulus), swelling, or epoxyeicosatrienoic acids (EETs; see Discussion, fifth paragraph) also suppressed by PIP<sub>2</sub>? Specifically, we would like to see experiments similar to those in Figure 5, but in the absence of GSK101, using a more &quot;natural&quot; way to activate TRPV4: e.g., body temperature+PGE<sub>2</sub>, or body temperature+EET – preferably both with and without diC8-PIP<sub>2</sub> in the pipette.</p><p>2) Discussion:</p><p>In a previous study, the group demonstrated that extracellular K<sup>+</sup> increases activate cEC Kir channels resulting in an upstream hyperpolarizing current which mediated capillary-to-arteriole dilation (Nat. Neurosci, 2017). In a follow up study, the authors showed that PIP<sub>2</sub> is a molecular regulator of Kir2.1 channels and that G<sub>q</sub>PCR activation impairs capillary-to-arteriole electrical signaling by depleting PIP<sub>2</sub> (PNAS, 2018). In the current study the idea that G<sub>q</sub>PCR signaling can regulate (via PIP<sub>2</sub>) the activation of opposing signaling pathways suggests that activation of these receptors stops neuronal activity-evoked changes in blood flow. However, this is contradictory to earlier evidence by Lacroix et al. (2015), demonstrating an important role for COX-2 derived PGE<sub>2</sub> in the NVC response. The authors cite this work, but do not explain how their proposed mechanism relates to the published findings on PGE2 and/or other G<sub>q</sub>PCR agonists. Would all G<sub>q</sub>PCR impair or retard the upstream hyperpolarization initiated by K<sup>+</sup>? Would this pathway be more relevant during pronounced ischemia? Or is it relevant under physiologic conditions? A thorough investigation of this question is beyond the scope of the present work, but a more detailed discussion of unresolved issues would be appreciated.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.38689.041</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Experimental:</p><p>What is the natural activator of TRPV4 in brain cECs?

The question itself requires a bit of unpacking:</p><p>1) “What is the natural activator of TRPV4 in brain cECs?”</p><p>Given that G<sub>q</sub>PCR signaling is the main mechanism for decreasing membrane PIP<sub>2</sub> levels and our evidence that PIP<sub>2</sub> depletion increases TRPV4 channel activity (~6-fold) in the absence of a TRPV4 agonist, we would argue that G<sub>q</sub>PCR agonists are the major physiological activators of TRPV4 in brain cECs. This aligns well with our ongoing studies using transgenic mice expressing a genetically encoded Ca<sup>2+</sup> indicator, which show that G<sub>q</sub>PCR-stimulated TRPV4 channel activity is responsible for ~50% of the large, transient cEC Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals induced by neural activity in vivo (Longden et al., World Congress of Microcirculation 2018). These data support the concept that low levels of TRPV4 channel activity induced by G<sub>q</sub>PCR agonists in the brain microenvironment can cause significant increases in intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup>. Thus, although there may be endogenous direct activators of TRPV4 channels in the brain in addition to G<sub>q</sub>PCR agonists, they are not needed to support the physiological function of these channels.</p><p>2) “Even upon PIP<sub>2</sub> depletion whole-cell NP<sub>o</sub> is only ~0.2 (amounting to a single-channel P<sub>o</sub> of ~0.001), which is negligible channel activity.”</p><p>The idea that a natural activator of TRPV4 currents in vivo is needed because NP<sub>o</sub> is so low – even with PIP<sub>2</sub> depletion – misses the very important point that even “negligible” TRPV4 activity is sufficient for this channel to exert its physiological functions. In fact, in a very real sense, mechanisms that <italic>suppress</italic> TRPV4 activity may be more important to the role of this channel in endothelial cells than those that activate it. Our previous studies highlight this point, demonstrating that exceedingly low levels of endothelial TRPV4 channel activity – equivalent to that produced by activation of 1–2 channels per cell – are capable of causing maximal dilation of systemic arteries (Sonkusare et al., 2012; 2014). Moreover, our computational modeling efforts show that the increase in TRPV4 current induced by G<sub>q</sub>PCR stimulation—from ~80 fA in the PIP<sub>2</sub>-suppressed state (at -40 mV) to ~400–500 fA with G<sub>q</sub>PCR stimulation – would effectively short circuit K<sup>+</sup>-induced hyperpolarization, reinforcing the importance of constraints on TRPV4 activation for the operation of this key neurovascular coupling (NVC) mechanism. Importantly, our results described in response to comment 1.1, above, also confirm that PIP<sub>2</sub> depletion alone is sufficient to produce physiologically meaningful TRPV4 channel activation. We have clarified these quantitative aspects in the revised manuscript.</p><p>3) “Is PIP<sub>2</sub> required for some modes of channel activation?”</p><p>As the reviewers indicate, one group (Suetsugu and colleagues, Nat Commun) reported that PIP<sub>2</sub> is inhibitory towards all modes of activation, whereas another group (Valverde and colleagues, PNAS) reported that PIP<sub>2</sub> is required for heat-, hypotonicity- and epoxyeicosatrienoic (EETs)-induced activation, but not for 4-αPDD–induced activation. Our results indicate that, in the absence of any agonist, PIP<sub>2</sub> depletion increases TRPV4 channel open probability about 6-fold. In the presence of either of two distinct synthetic agonists, GSK101 or 4-αPDD (new supplementary figure), PIP<sub>2</sub> depletion also increases TRPV4 channel activity about 6-fold. In response to the reviewers’ comment, we tested the purported physiological activator of TRPV4 channels, 11,12-EET, and found that it activated TRPV4 currents even in the absence of any dialyzed PIP<sub>2</sub> (Figure 3—figure supplement 2 in the revised manuscript), a result that contrasts with that of Garcia-Elias et al. (2013). We chose 11,12-EET because it has been implicated in NVC and is thought to transduce the effects of osmolarity (Garcia-Elias et al., 2013). (We did not test heat in excised patches because giga-ohm seals on cECs are unable to withstand temperature elevation.) Collectively, our results support the concept that PIP<sub>2</sub> suppresses TRPV4 channel activity independent of the mode of activation, and are congruent with the results of Takahashi et al., (2014).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Discussion:</p><p>In a previous study, the group demonstrated that extracellular K<sup>+</sup> increases activate cEC Kir channels resulting in an upstream hyperpolarizing current which mediated capillary-to-arteriole dilation (Nat.

On theoretical grounds, our current and previous (Harraz et al., 2018) findings support the idea that G<sub>q</sub>PCR signaling in capillary endothelial cells impedes electrical signaling through PIP<sub>2</sub>-depletion–mediated deactivation of Kir2.1 channels and enhancement of depolarizing currents through TRPV4 channels. In this sense, local G<sub>q</sub>PCR signals would act as “stop signs” in the pathway of electrical signaling, and could thereby conceivably sculpt the extent and directionality of signaling. However, we also have evidence that direct application of PGE<sub>2</sub> to capillary extremities in an ex vivo capillary-parenchymal arteriole preparation acts via an as-yet unidentified mechanism to cause dilation of the upstream arteriolar segment, consistent with a contribution of PGE<sub>2</sub> to NVC at the capillary level (Dabertrand, Brayden &amp; Nelson, 2015 - Society of General Physiologists Symposium, abstract published in J Gen Physiol 146(3): 264). (As we reported previously (Dabertrand et al. J Cereb Blood Flow Metab. 2013; 33(4):479-82), direct application of PGE<sub>2</sub> to arterioles causes arteriolar constriction.) Thus, we would suggest that these two functions – NVC mediator and “stop sign” - are not necessarily mutually exclusive. We would also note that G<sub>q</sub>PCR activation would lead to an elevation of capillary endothelial cell [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub>, which should activate nitric oxide (NO) synthase to cause the production of NO, providing an additional mechanism by which PGE<sub>2</sub> signaling might relax adjacent smooth muscle or contractile pericytes and contribute to NVC.</p><p>As indicated in Figure 5—figure supplement 2 in the original manuscript, the G<sub>q</sub>PCR agonist carbachol exerts an effect comparable to that of PGE<sub>2</sub>, whereas the PAR-2 ligand SLIGRL and the purinergic receptor agonist ATP had no effect. The absence of an effect of SLIGRL may reflect the absence of PAR-2 in brain capillary endothelial cells, as suggested by a previous transcriptomic study (Vanlandewijck et al., 2018). The inability of ATP to enhance TRPV4 channel activity is more difficult to explain, but is apparently not attributable to the absence of an appropriate P2Y receptor in capillary endothelial cells since ATP is capable of inhibiting Kir currents in these cells (Harraz et al., 2018). Thus, although there is some degree of generalizability, there may be more to the story than the simple ability to signal through a G<sub>q</sub>PCR.</p><p>In terms of the physiological context in which this pathway operates, our working assumption is that this stop sign-like function acts to shape Kir-mediated electrical signaling under physiological conditions. We would further predict that ischemia acts through a reduction in intracellular ATP to favor TRPV4 signaling over Kir2.1 signaling.</p></body></sub-article></article>
