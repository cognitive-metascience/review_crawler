While anti-estrogens/aromatase inhibitors are initially effective, resistance to these drugs commonly develops. Therapy-resistant tumors often retain ER signaling, via interaction with critical oncogenic coregulator proteins. To address these mechanisms of resistance, we have developed a novel ER coregulator binding modulator, ERX-11. ERX-11 interacts directly with ER and blocks the interaction between a subset of coregulators with both native and mutant forms of ER. ERX-11 effectively blocks ER-mediated oncogenic signaling and has potent anti-proliferative activity against therapy-sensitive and therapy-resistant human breast cancer cells. ERX-11 is orally bioavailable, with no overt signs of toxicity and potent activity in both murine xenograft and patient-derived breast tumor explant models. This first-in-class agent, with its novel mechanism of action of disrupting critical protein-protein interactions, overcomes the limitations of current therapies and may be clinically translatable for patients with therapy-sensitive and therapy-resistant breast cancers.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.26857.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.26857.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.26857.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Around 70% of breast cancers in women need one or both of the female hormones (estrogen and progesterone) to grow. To treat these 'hormone-dependent' cancers, patients receive drugs that either block the production of estrogen or directly target a receptor protein that senses estrogen in the cancer cells. Unfortunately, many breast cancers develop resistance to these drugs. This resistance is often caused by genetic mutations that alter the estrogen receptor; for example, the receptor may develop the ability to interact with other proteins in the cell known as coregulators to promote tumor growth.</p><p>Developing new drugs that prevent estrogen receptors from interacting with coregulators may provide more options for treating hormone-dependent breast cancers. Here, Raj et al. developed a new small molecule named ERX-11 that is able to inhibit the growth of human breast cancer cells that are sensitive to existing drugs as well as cells that have become drug-resistant.</p><p>For the experiments, hormone-dependent breast cancer cells from humans were transplanted into mice. This procedure usually causes the mice to develop tumors, but giving the mice ERX-11 by mouth stopped estrogen receptors from interacting with coregulators and blocked the growth of tumors. Furthermore, ERX-11 does not appear to have any toxic effects on the mice, indicating that it may also be safe for humans.</p><p>The findings of Raj et al. suggest that ERX-11 is a promising new drug candidate for treating some breast cancers. The next steps are to examine the effects of ERX-11 on mice and other animals in more detail before deciding whether this molecule is suitable for clinical trials. In the longer term, molecules similar to ERX-11 could also be developed into drugs to treat other types of cancer that are also caused by abnormal interactions of coregulator proteins.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.26857.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.26857.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group

estrogen receptor alpha (ER)-positive breast cancer involve modulation of ER signaling using either antiestrogens (AE) or aromatase inhibitors (AI). However, most patients develop resistance to these drugs, and disease progression is common, with progression to metastases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Musgrove and Sutherland, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Ma et al., 2015</xref>). ER signaling is complex and involves coregulators (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">McDonnell and Norris, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">O'Malley and Kumar, 2009</xref>). Therapy-resistant tumors often retain ER-expression and ER-signaling. While multiple mechanisms maintain ER signaling in therapy-resistant tumors, ER signaling is mediated by the interactions between activated ER and critical coregulator proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Dasgupta and O'Malley, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Lonard et al., 2007</xref>).</p><p>Alterations in the concentration or activity of selective coregulators enable ER-signaling from AE-ER complexes, effectively converting the antagonist to an agonist (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">O'Hara et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Kurebayashi, 2003</xref>). Over a third (38%) of ER coregulators identified in breast cancer are over-expressed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Lonard et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Lonard and O'Malley, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Cortez et al., 2014</xref>), such as SRC3 (AIB1) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">List et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Azorsa et al., 2001</xref>), SRC2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Kurebayashi et al., 2000</xref>), and PELP1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Habashy et al., 2010</xref>). These deregulated coregulators contribute to mammary tumorigenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Cortez et al., 2014</xref>), therapy resistance and metastases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Kumar et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Shou et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Burandt et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Girard et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>Recent studies revealed that breast tumors acquire mutations in the ER ligand binding domains (L536N, Y537S, Y537N and D538G) that facilitate constitutive activity of these mutant ER (MT-ER) in the absence of ligand (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Toy et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Robinson et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Jeselsohn et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Merenbakh-Lamin et al., 2013</xref>). Tumors with MT-ER interact with oncogenic coregulators to drive ER-dependent transcriptional programs and proliferation and are poorly responsive to AEs and AIs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Toy et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Robinson et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Jeselsohn et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Merenbakh-Lamin et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Toy et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>Thus, there is a strategic need for drugs that disrupt interactions between ER and critical coregulators to block ER signaling. In this study, we have synthesized a series of small organic molecules to emulate the nuclear receptor (NR) box motif, important for ER coregulator interactions. We have identified a small molecule named as ER coregulator binding modulator-11 (<bold>ERX-11</bold>), with potent anti-proliferative activity against ER-driven breast tumors. ERX-11 interacts with ER and blocks the interaction between ER and coregulators. In ER-expressing breast cancer cells, ERX-11 blocks the proliferation and induces apoptosis. ERX-11 has no activity against ER-negative breast cancer cells.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Screening and identification of ER coregulator binding modulator 11 (ERX-11)</title><p>The peptidomimetic D2 blocks the interaction between the androgen receptor (AR) and NR-box containing coregulators, such as PELP1, with an IC50 of 40 nM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Ravindranathan et al., 2013</xref>). String analyses of the PELP1 interactome suggested an equally robust interaction between PELP1 and ER as that between PELP1 and AR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>). However, D2 was unable to block the interaction between PELP1 and ER (data not shown) and required much higher concentrations (µM range) to block the proliferation of ER-driven MCF-7 breast cancer cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref>).</p><p>Since sequences flanking the NR-box may influence the affinity and selectivity of coregulator interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">McInerney et al., 1998</xref>), we hypothesized that a longer oligo-benzamide scaffold may more effectively target the interaction between ER and coregulators. This strategy generated a series of tris-benzamides (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Appendix 1—chemical structures 1</xref>—<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig29">22</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>) that added a functional group (R) to the D2 bis-benzamide, corresponding to the amino acid side chain groups found at the i-3/4 or i + 7 position surrounding the NR-box sequences (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2G</xref>). Importantly, each of these small molecules were named as ER coregulator binding modulators (ERXs, where X refers to their multiple potential and unknown targets) had differential activities in ER-positive breast cancer cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C</xref>), confirming our hypothesis that the sequences flanking the core LXXLL motif could determine specificity and activity. The ERXs maintained the structural requirement for mimicking helices (confirmed by molecular modeling (MacroModel, Schrodinger, NY) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2A</xref>, shown for ERX-11).<fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.26857.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Derivation and characterization of ERX-11.</title><p>Structure of ERX-11, as a derivative of the D2 peptidomimetic with a hydroxyethyl moiety in the flanking position to mimic a Serine (<bold>A</bold>, left panel).

In contrast, no effect of ERX-11 was noted in 11/12 ER-negative cells, with modest activity in the MDA-MB-157 cell line (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). ERX-11 was as effective as tamoxifen or ICI in reducing the growth of ZR-75 and MCF-7 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplements 1E</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">2C,D,E</xref>), and the combination of ERX-11 and tamoxifen was not additive (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2F</xref>). While several compounds, including selective estrogen receptor modulators, have been shown to have similar activity against ER-positive breast cancers, the novel chemical structure, potential for a unique mechanism of action led to the designation of ERX-11 as a lead compound. We then established a protocol for large-scale batch synthesis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3A–C</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>ERX-11 interacts with ER</title><p>Since ERX-11 mimics the NR-box, we expected its direct binding to ER. Modeling studies using Autodock (The Scripps Research Institute, La Jolla, CA) indicated that ERX-11 could bind to the AF-2 domain of ER (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). Using biotinylated ERX-11 (synthesis described in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3D</xref>), we showed that ERX-11 interacts in vitro with purified ER protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). Addition of ‘cold’ ERX-11 efficiently competed for the binding of purified ER protein to biotinylated ERX-11 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>). Further, short 15mer peptides, corresponding to NR box sequences within the SRC1, SRC2, AIB1 and PELP1 proteins, efficiently disrupted the interaction between biotinylated ERX-11 and purified ER (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>). However, not all LXXLL peptides interfere ERX-11 interaction with ER, as only peptide surrounding the third PELP1 LXXLL motif, but not the first PELP1 LXXLL motif blocked ERX-11 interaction suggesting ERX-11 can only block some LXXLL interactions (<italic><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>, last two panels</italic>). Further, pre-incubation of the purified ER protein with selective estrogen receptor degraders (SERDs) GDC-0810 or AZD-9496, or fulvestrant (ICI) was unable to block the interaction between ER and ERX-11 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1H</xref>). In contrast, tamoxifen was able to block the interaction between purified ER and ERX-11 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1H</xref>), suggesting similarities in the ER-binding pockets of ERX-11 and tamoxifen.</p><p>We then demonstrated that biotinylated ERX-11 could pull down endogenous ER in ZR-75 nuclear extracts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). These data indicate that ERX-11 directly interact with ER, both as purified protein and within a cellular context. Unbiased evaluation, using immunoprecipitation mass spectrometric (IPMS) analyses of the biotinylated ERX-11 pulldown in MCF-7 cells, identified ER as one of the top ERX-11 interactors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>). Pathways analysis revealed that ERX-11-binding proteins were involved in the activation of transcriptional regulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). Importantly, ERX-11 pulldown included a number of proteins other than ER, including a weak affinity for the progesterone receptor (PGR) and several ER-associated proteins (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>). Immunoprecipitation analyses in MCF-7 cells validated the strong affinity of ERX-11 for ER, and weak affinity for the PR-A isoform but not GR, AR or PR-B isoforms (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>).<fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.26857.007</object-id><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>ERX-11 interacts with ER and blocks its interactome.</title><p>Interaction with endogenous ER was evaluated in nuclear lysates prepared from ZR-75 cells stimulated with E2, incubated with biotin-control or biotin-ERX-11 and analyzed by avidin pull-down assay (<bold>A</bold>).

The fold-enrichment in binding over basal is depicted for two independent replicates (x axis = replicate one and y axis = replicate 2). Relative binding of ER and PGR are shown (<bold>B</bold>). MCF-7 nuclear lysates were incubated with biotinylated ERX-11 and then subject to a streptavidin column.

ZR-75 cells were incubated with tamoxifen and its ability to interfere ERX-11 binding to ER was analyzed by immunoprecipitation followed by western blotting (<bold>D</bold>). To confirm ERX-11 binding to ER-ligand-binding domain (AF2), a GST pull-down assay was performed. Biotinylated ERX-11 interacted with the GST-AF2 domain of ER but not with the GST-AF1- or GST- DNA-binding domain of ER (<bold>E</bold>). Purified ER-AF2 domain was incubated with biotin-ERX-11 in the presence of E2 ±ICI or tamoxifen (1 µM).

Venn diagram shows the overlap between the ER-binding proteins immunoprecipitated from nuclear lysates from E2-stimulated MCF-7 cells following treatment with vehicle or ERX-11 or tamoxifen (<bold>G</bold>). Co-immunoprecipitation analyses show the effect of ERX-11 on the interaction of ER with coregulators PELP1, SRC1, TIF1α in MCF-7 cells (<bold>H</bold>). Proximity ligation assay validated the ability of ERX-11 and tamoxifen to disrupt the interactions between ER and coregulators such as PELP1, SRC1, SRC3/AIB1 and ARID1B in MCF-7 cells (<bold>I</bold>). NanoBiT assay: expression plasmids were created to express either ER or PELP1 in conjunction with the large bit or the small bit of the NanoBiT luciferase enzyme. If the proteins directly interact within the cell, the two parts of the NanoBiT luciferase enzyme come together and create a quantifiable luminescent signal. The effect of ERX-11 on the interaction between the two sets of ER and PELP1 constructs is shown (<bold>J</bold>). Validation of the binding of ERX-11 to the ER-AF2 domain was further explored using AF2-domain mutants of ER stably transfected in ER-negative MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cell lines. Biotinylated ERX-11 was then used to pull-down ER from these cell lines (<bold>K</bold>).

Using an in vivo structural complementation NanoBiT assay, we found that the direct interaction between ER and PELP1 was enhanced by E2 treatment and that ERX-11 significantly reduced the interaction between ER and PELP1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2J</xref>).</p><p>To confirm the specificity of ERX-11 for the ER AF-2 domain, we demonstrated using reporter-based assays, that ERX-11 failed to reduce the ERE-Luc reporter activity driven by a ERα-VP16 chimera that does not require AF-2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s4">Figure 2—figure supplement 4C</xref>). As expected, tamoxifen, did not affect the ERα-VP16 chimera-induced reporter activity, while ICI reduced the ERE-Luc reporter activity. Evaluation with an endometrial cancer cell line Ishikawa, which exhibits agonist activity via AF1, revealed that ERX-11 lacks AF1 agonist activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s4">Figure 2—figure supplement 4D</xref>). Collectively, these results confirm that the ERX-11 block signaling driven by functional AF2 domain but not by AF1 domain.</p><p>We then specifically evaluated whether interactions through the ER LXXLL motif was responsible for ERX-11 activity. Biotinylated ERX-11 was able to pull down both the wild-type ER and the L540Q point mutant ER (which retains E2 binding and does not interact with SRC1) and these interactions were not affected by tamoxifen (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2K</xref>). Using ER L540Q point mutant, we showed that the mutant ER still interacts with biotinylated ERX-11 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2K</xref>). Interestingly, the ERX-11 binds strongly to ER▲12 mutant (helix 12 deleted ER) and this binding is blocked efficiently by tamoxifen (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2K</xref>). These data suggest that the presence of helix 12 may regulate the conformation of the binding pocket and account for differences in the binding of ERX-11 and tamoxifen to ER. Our data would suggest that removal of helix 12 enables access of ERX-11 to the same binding pocket as tamoxifen and may reflect the in vitro data, where tamoxifen and ERX-11 compete efficiently for ER binding. In contrast, neither GDC-0810 nor AZD-9496 were able to block ERX-11 binding to ER or its mutants, suggesting that their binding to ER occurs through distinct pockets (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s5">Figure 2—figure supplement 5A and B</xref>).</p><p>In competition assays, tamoxifen fails to dislodge ERX-11 from ER (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s5">Figure 2—figure supplement 5C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3E</xref>). Increasing concentrations of tamoxifen is only able to dislodge ERX-11 from ER▲12 mutant at higher concentrations, suggesting that ERX-11 interaction with ER is through a second binding site (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s5">Figure 2—figure supplement 5D</xref>).</p><p>Further, using an ER restoration model, MTT cell viability assays revealed that introduction of either ER, ER▲12 or ER-L540Q into MDA-MB-231 cells, restored ERX-11 growth inhibitory activity in non-responsive MDA-MB-231 cells. These results further underscore the importance of ER in ERX-11 mode of action (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s5">Figure 2—figure supplement 5E</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>Docking simulations model ERX-11 binding to ER</title><p>We have modeled ERX-11 interaction with ER using docking simulations of ERX-11 using known crystal structures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s6">Figure 2—figure supplement 6</xref>). In the agonist-bound conformation (3ERD.pdb), helix 12 is relocated and forms a hydrophobic cleft (i.e. AF2-binding site) that is surrounded by helices 3, 4, 5 and 12: ERX-11 can be modeled to make hydrophobic contact with the AF2 site with its two isobutyl side chain groups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s6">Figure 2—figure supplement 6A(A)</xref>). In addition, the hydroxyl group of ERX-11 may interact with a residue near AF2 domain. These data suggest that ERX-11 interacts with ER LBD differently than the agonist.</p><p>In the antagonist-bound conformation (3ERT.pdb), 4-hydroxytamoxifen induces conformational change and makes helix 12 occupy the AF2-binding site, blocking both coactivator and corepressor binding: here, ERX-11 may interact with an alternate pocket formed by helices 5, 11 and 12, as shown in the <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s6">Figure 2—figure supplement 6A(B)</xref>. These data could explain why the interaction between ERX-11 and purified ER could be blocked by tamoxifen. However, in a cellular context, tamoxifen cannot block ERX-11 binding to ER suggesting that the secondary binding site of ERX-11 on ER may be stabilized by coregulators. Docking simulation of ERX-11 on human ERα with affinity-tagged corepressor peptide (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s6">Figure 2—figure supplement 6A(C)</xref>)(2JFA.pdb) or rat ERβ crystal structure with ICI bound (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s6">Figure 2—figure supplement 6A(D)</xref>)(1HJ1.pdb) showed that ERX-11 can still bind to the AF2 domain, in a similar manner as it does when the ligand is bound. These data further support our biochemical findings that ICI does not block ERX-11 interaction with ER.</p><p>Detailed evaluation showed that (1L2I.pdb) two isobutyl groups of ERX-11 may dock into the AF2 binding site (black dashed box) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s6">Figure 2—figure supplement 6B</xref>). The hydroxyl group of ERX-11 may interact with Gln375 of the helix five through a hydrogen bond. The carboxamide group of ERX-11 was docked into a pocket formed with Gln542, Asp545 and Ala546 on the helix 12. Additional docking experiment on ER crystal structures without helix 12 (3ERT.pdb and 5ACC.pdb) showed that ERX-11 was found to bind to the tamoxifen-binding site in the ER▲12 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s6">Figure 2—figure supplement 6C(A)</xref>). The superimposition of tamoxifen (red) and ERX-11 (green) clearly shows the overlap of their binding sites (3ERT.pdb) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s6">Figure 2—figure supplement 6C(B)</xref>). This may explain our experimental results showing the competition of tamoxifen with ERX-11 on ER▲12. In the presence of SERDs, ERX-11 can bind to the AF2 domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s6">Figure 2—figure supplement 6C(C)</xref>, which do not overlap with the binding site of SERDs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s6">Figure 2—figure supplement 6C(D)</xref>) (5ACC.pdb).

Therapeutic agents that suppress oncogenic ER activation by depletion of hormone-driven growth signaling or by blocking synthesis of hormone have become the mainstay of systemic treatment for breast cancer. However, both de novo and acquired therapy resistance are major clinical challenges. Importantly, ER signaling is intact in these therapy-resistant tumors. ER interaction with critical coregulator proteins appears to mediate ER signaling in these therapy-resistant and ER-positive metastatic tumors. While AIs and AEs may disrupt some of these ER-coregulator interactions, their ability to target these interactions is limited in therapy-resistant cells. In this study, we described the development of a novel inhibitor that targets ER interactions with coregulators. Using in vitro and in vivo assays, we demonstrated that (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Musgrove and Sutherland, 2009</xref>) ERX-11 blocks both ligand-dependent and ligand-independent ER signaling, (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Ma et al., 2015</xref>) ERX-11 effectively blocks ER signaling in both therapy-sensitive and therapy-resistant cells and (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">McDonnell and Norris, 2002</xref>) disruption of ER signaling by ERX-11 has biological activity against both therapy-sensitive and therapy-resistant cells, with minimal overt signs of toxicity in vitro and in vivo.</p><p>Until recently, protein–protein interactions have been viewed as undruggable. However, the recent advent of a transformative class of compounds (peptidomimetics) allowed us to rationally design and synthesize small organic molecules that structurally emulate target protein sequences in defined conformations. We have developed a novel oligo-benzamide scaffold for mimicking helical protein segments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Ravindranathan et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Ahn and Han, 2007</xref>). The rigid framework of the oligo-benzamide scaffold can present functional groups mimicking amino acid residues in a helical conformation (e.g. ones in i, i-3/4, and i + 7 positions). Furthermore, we have established efficient synthetic routes to make bis- and tris-benzamides as alpha-helix mimetics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Lee and Ahn, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Marimganti et al., 2009</xref>). Based on the helix mimicking tris-benzamide scaffold, we designed ERX-11 to block the interactions between ER and a subset of its coregulator proteins containing the NR box in a helical structure.</p><p>The unbiased IPMS analyses suggest that ERX-11 interacts with ER and blocks the interactions of ER with multiple coregulators. While the broad effect of ERX-11 protein–protein interactions raises potential concerns about off-target activities, they are largely mitigated by the lack of overt signs of toxicity in cell culture models and multiple animal models tested to date. In addition, the multiplicity of targeted protein-protein interactions makes the development of resistance to the ERX-11 less likely. Thus, ERX-11 represents an exciting new mechanism to attenuate ER oncogenic functions.</p><p>Like tamoxifen, ERX-11 potently blocks the proliferation of therapy-sensitive cells. Unlike tamoxifen, ERX-11 has activity in multiple therapy-resistant models, including those driven by ER ligand-binding domain mutants. Unlike a classic SERD, ERX-11 does not cause immediate ER degradation, but appears to affect <italic>ESR1</italic> levels over several days, by blocking its transcription.</p><p>Our data clearly indicate that ERX-11 binds to AF2 domain of ER. However, the exact interface between ERX-11 and ER has not been established. The ability of tamoxifen to compete efficiently for ERX-11 binding to purified ER in vitro and to ER within the cell suggests a significant overlap between the tamoxifen and ER-binding site on ER. In addition, the inability of the SERDs and ICI to disrupt the interaction between ER and ERX-11 suggests that ERX-11 may also interact with a secondary tamoxifen-binding site within ER. As shown for ER beta, tamoxifen has two distinct binding sites- one in the consensus ligand-binding pocket, and another in the hydrophobic groove of the coactivator recognition surface (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Wang et al., 2006</xref>). Published studies using LXXLL peptide probes showed ER undergo distinct conformational changes as a result of binding with different ligands and such changes expose distinct surfaces on ER facilitating interaction with various coregulators (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Paige et al., 1999</xref>). These studies also reported that tamoxifen binding can create unique surface on ER that facilitate binding of unique LXXLL-binding peptides (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Tamrazi et al., 2002</xref>). Further investigations of the ERX-11- ER interface with co-crystallization studies are ongoing and are likely to clarify the precise nature of the interaction.</p><p>Our studies also suggest that ERX-11 can interact with ER, even in therapy-resistant cells. While therapy resistance can be attributed to multiple mechanisms, structural changes in ER via post-translational modifications or point mutations may create new binding surfaces on ER for coregulator interactions and potentially for ERX-11 interactions. The interaction between ERX-11 and ER-MTs in therapy-resistant cells supports a model for ERX-11 interaction with ER at an alternate secondary site distinct from the site of tamoxifen binding. These findings may explain the differences between ERX-11 and tamoxifen in their activity in both therapy-sensitive and therapy-resistant breast cancer cells.</p><p>The ability of ERX-11 to block ER dimerization may be responsible for its disruption of ER DNA binding and these findings are supported by published reports that LXXLL peptides may affect ER dimerization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Tamrazi et al., 2002</xref>). We have noted that ERX-11 has a weak affinity for the A-isoform of PGR but not for the B-isoform. We have also found that ERX-11 does not interact with other steroid receptors like GR or AR. In addition, ERX-11 failed to show activity on AR-expressing prostate cancer cells.</p><p>Disruption of multiple protein–protein interactions by ERXs may result in significant toxicity. To evaluate this, we have initially tested toxicity using a dose of 100 mg/kg in immune competent C57BL/6 mice for 14 days. We did not observe any uterotropic activity or immune effects. Further, no overt signs of toxicity was found in various E2-responsive organs including the liver, lung, heart, and kidney. Similarly, in five separate studies using a dose of 10 mg/kg in tumor-bearing mice, we did not find any overt signs of toxicity; however, ERX-11 treatment significantly limited ER expression in the tumors and reduced tumor growth. To address potential issues with immunogenicity of these tris-benzamides, we also evaluated ERX-11 treatment in syngeneic models and found no overt signs of toxicity.</p><p>While the ER coregulator protein levels are tightly regulated under normal conditions, many coregulators are over-expressed in breast cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Lonard et al., 2007</xref>), substantially contribute to ER-signaling, drive disease progression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Singh and Kumar, 2005</xref>) and correlate with a poor prognosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">List et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Azorsa et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Tamrazi et al., 2002</xref>). The differential coregulator milieu within breast tumors and the dependence of breast tumors on ER and coregulator-driven signaling may explain why ERX-11 has potent antiproliferative activity within the tumor but does not have any overt signs of toxicity. Since ERX-11 blocked some but not all ER coregulator interactions, ERX-11 may function as a polypharmacology agent, and its activity may depend on the concentration and repertoire of coregulators present in a tumor cell.</p><p>Importantly, using ex vivo culture of patient-derived tumor tissues, we demonstrated that ERX-11 is effective in limiting proliferation of ER-positive but not ER-negative tumors. We also discovered that ERX-11 treatment of primary tumors within their native microenvironment also reduced ER levels within the tumor. None of the primary ER-negative tumors responded to ERX-11 therapy. These explant studies represent the first evaluation of a drug effect using tissues from primary breast cancer patients and are likely to show biologically relevant outcomes.</p><p>In response to hormone binding, ER interacts with multiprotein complexes containing coregulators and transcriptional regulators to activate transcription (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">McKenna et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Collingwood et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Tsai and O'Malley, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Torchia et al., 1998</xref>). Even though coregulators modulate ER functions, each coregulator protein appears to play an important but not overlapping function in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Han et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Xu et al., 1998</xref>). Accordingly, the ERX-mediated blockage of coregulator interactions with ER resulted in both inactivation and activation of unique sets of genes and pathways modulated by ER oncogenic signaling, leading to tumor suppression. The pathways/genes modulated by ERX-11 can be used to correlate with the outcome of its therapy, and they may serve as biomarkers that prognosticate response to these agents.</p><p>The biology of E2- ER signaling is complex and context dependent. Elegant studies have shown that ER, depending on the ligand and presence of unique set of coregulators can promote apoptosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Jordan, 2015</xref>). In that scenario, antiestrogen and SERM are shown to inhibit apoptosis, hence, many of these drugs exhibit cytostatic response. Estrogen-induced apoptosis is shown to cause an increase in Fas receptor associated with the extrinsic pathway of apoptosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Lewis-Wambi and Jordan, 2009</xref>). Similarly, a recent study found that inhibition of SRC family coregulators using small molecule inhibitor promote significant apoptosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Song et al., 2016</xref>). We consistently observed activation of apoptosis by ERX-11 but failed to observe any apoptosis by tamoxifen or ICI in our assays. We believe that activation of apoptosis is not due to elimination of ER rather due to unique mechanism of action of ERX-11. Specifically, we predict that changes in the ER signaling is due to alterations in coregulator binding to ER. Accordingly, our RNAseq data showed that alterations in genes that contribute activation of apoptosis. However, further studies are needed to clearly identify the mechanisms by which ERX-11 promotes apoptosis.</p><p>Currently used drugs (AEs and AIs) are associated with an initial period of clinical response; however, most patients develop resistance with cancer progression. Recent studies suggested that selective estrogen receptor downregulators (SERDs), molecules that eliminate ER expression, may have utility for treating breast cancers that have progressed on AE and/or AIs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">McDonnell et al., 2015</xref>). Several orally available SERDs (GDC-0810, AZD9496) were recently developed and shown to have utility in treating resistant tumors using preclinical models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Lai et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Weir et al., 2016</xref>). However, it is important to note that each of the SERDs are only in phase I clinical trials (clinical trials.gov) and none of them are either FDA approved or have proven efficacy in patients. The only FDA-approved agent is Fulvestrant (ICI), which has known pharmacologic limitations as evidenced by its dosing regimen of intramuscular injections every 14 days. Recent studies also showed <italic>ESR1</italic> mutations lead to constitutive activity and reduced sensitivity to ER antagonists, and mutations such as Y537S contribute to fulvestrant resistance in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Toy et al., 2017</xref>). Since ERXs are small, stable, orally bioavailable small molecular inhibitors, their use as an alternative therapeutic approach may decrease therapy resistance and reduce side effects, which are the current limitations of AEs or AIs.</p><p>In summary, we have developed and tested the utility of ERX-11 as a novel therapeutic agent for ER-positive, therapy-sensitive and therapy-resistant breast cancers. Since ERX-11 is orally available and is well tolerated with fewer side effects, ERX-11 can be readily extended to clinical use as a therapeutic agent, and may enhance the survival of advanced breast cancer patients.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Cell lines</title><p>Human breast cancer cells MCF-7, ZR-75, T-47D, MDA-MB-231, BT474, BT549, BT453, SUM159, 4T1, MM468, HCC1937, HCC1187, HCC70, MDA-MB-157, MDA-MB-453, MDA-MB-468 and HEK293T cells were either obtained from American Type Culture Collection (ATCC, Manassas, VA) or a kind gift from Dr. John Minna at UT Southwestern.

The searches were done using MM3 force field (chosen for its accuracy with organic molecules) combined with the GB/SA water solvation model with standard settings and the following cut-offs: van der Waals, 8.0 Å; electrostatic, 20.0 Å; and hydrogen bond, 4.0 Å. The observed conformations were minimized by 500 iterations of Polak-Ribiere Conjugate Gradient (PRCG) algorithm (a conjugate gradient minimization scheme that uses the Polak-Ribiere first derivative method with restarts every 3N iterations) (0.05 kJ/mol).</p></sec><sec id="s4-10"><title>Molecular docking of ERX-11 to ER</title><p>AutoDock 4.2 software package, as implemented through the graphical user interface called AutoDockTools (ADT), was used to create input PDBQT files of a receptor and a ligand. The input file of ER was prepared using the published coordinates (PDB 1L2I). Water molecules were removed from the protein structure and hydrogen was added. All other atom values were generated automatically by ADT. The docking area was assigned visually around the peptide ligand. A grid box of 24 Å x 20 Å x 24 Å was calculated around the docking area using AutoGrid. The x,y,z coordinates of the center of the grid box were set to x = −9.0, y = 14.0 and z = 26.0, respectively. The input file of ERX-11 was created from its energy-minimized conformation using ADT. Docking calculations were performed with AutoDock Vina 1.1.2. A search exhaustiveness of 16 was used and all other parameters were left as default values.</p></sec><sec id="s4-11"><title>Reporter gene assays</title><p>Briefly, cells were transiently co-transfected with 200 ng of ERE-Luc reporter with 100 ng of ER-WT, ER-MT, PELP1, SRC1, SRC2, SRC3 or control vectors using Turbofect transfection reagent (Thermo Scientific, Waltham, MA). After 24 hr, cells were treated with either vehicle or ERX-11 for an additional 24 hr. β-galactosidase reporter (50 ng) plasmid was co-transfected and used for data normalization.

Large BiT (LgBiT; 18 kDa) and Small BiT (SmBiT; 1 kDa) subunits of NanoLuc Luciferase were optimized for the analysis of protein interaction dynamics. When LgBiT and SmBiT subunits are separated, the Large BiT part loses the majority of luciferase activity. However, when the direct interaction between fusion proteins on LgBiT and SmBiT occurred, the interaction promotes structural complementation between LgBiT and SmBiT and results in full luciferase activity. Protein–protein interaction are then monitored in living cells following addition of the Nano-Glo Live Cell Reagent, a non-lytic detection reagent containing the cell-permeable furimazine substrate and observed luminescent signals.</p><p>To generate different NanoBiT fusion constructs, human ER and PELP1 coding sequences were amplified by PCR and separately subcloned into NB-MCS vectors (Promega). To test the protein–protein interaction between ER and PELP1 by using the NanoBiT assay, C-LgBit-<italic>ESR1</italic> paired with C-SmBit-<italic>PELP1</italic> or C-LgBit-<italic>PELP1</italic> with C-SmBit-<italic>ESR1</italic> constructs were transiently transfected into HEK-293T cells by using Fugene HD transfection reagent (Promega).

After starvation, the cells were treated with vehicle or 10 µM ERX-11 for 2 hr followed by a 2 hr treatment with vehicle or 10 nM E2. Then, the cells were washed using PBS and incubated with Pierce IP Lysis Buffer (Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc.) at 4°C for 20 min. The cell lysates were centrifuged at 14,000 rpm at 4°C for 10 min, and the supernatants were used for IPMS analysis.</p><p>Dynabeads Protein G (Invitrogen) are pre-coupled with anti- ER antibody (Santa Cruz, sc-8002) and then incubated with 1.5 mg cell lysate over night at 4°C. Then the Dynabeads were washed using PBS and PBST (0.01% Tween 20) and eluted in 30 µL NuPAGE LDS sample buffer at 95°C for 15 min. The final eluents containing ER and associated proteins were separated by using SDS-PAGE. The obtained proteins were proteolytically digested and subjected to mass spectrometry (MS) analysis.</p><p>Gel band samples were digested overnight with trypsin (Promega) following reduction and alkylation with DTT and iodoacetamide (Sigma). The samples then underwent solid-phase extraction cleanup with Oasis HLB plates (Waters) and the resulting samples were analyzed by LC/MS/MS, using an Orbitrap Fusion Lumos (Thermo Electron) coupled to an Ultimate 3000 RSLC-Nano liquid chromatography systems (Dionex). Samples were injected onto a 75 μm i.d., 50 cm long Easy Spray column (Thermo) and eluted with a gradient from 0% to 28% buffer B over 60 min. Buffer A contained 2% (v/v) ACN and 0.1% formic acid in water, and buffer B contained 80% (v/v) ACN, 10% (v/v) trifluoroethanol, and 0.08% formic acid in water. The mass spectrometer operated in positive ion mode with a source voltage of 2.2 kV and capillary temperature of 275°C. MS scans were acquired at 120,000 resolution and up to 10 MS/MS spectra were obtained in the ion trap for each full spectrum acquired using higher-energy collisional dissociation (HCD) for ions with charge 2–7. Dynamic exclusion was set for 25 s.</p><p>Raw MS data files were converted to a peak list format and analyzed using the central proteomics facilities pipeline (CPFP), version 2.0.3. Peptide identification was performed using the X!Tandem and open MS search algorithm (OMSSA) search engines against the human protein database from Uniprot, with common contaminants and reversed decoy sequences appended. Fragment and precursor tolerances of 20 ppm and 0.1 Da were specified, and three missed cleavages were allowed. Carbamidomethylation of Cys was set as a fixed modification and oxidation of Met was set as a variable modification.

A proliferative index was calculated as the percentage of Ki-67-positive cells in five randomly selected microscopic fields at 40X per slide. TUNEL analysis was done using the in situ Cell Death Detection Kit (Roche, Indianapolis, IN) as per the manufacturer’s protocol, and five randomly selected microscopic fields in each group were used to calculate the relative ratio of TUNEL-positive cells.</p><p>For the PDEx samples, 5-µm sections were de-waxed, rehydrated and endogenous peroxidases were blocked with hydrogen peroxide. Sections were then boiled in citrate and blocked in 5% serum for 1 hr. Primary antibodies were incubated overnight at 4°C at 1:200 for Ki67 (Vector Laboratories Burlingame, CA) and at 1:400 for ER (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, CA). Biotinylated anti-rabbit secondary antibodies (DAKO Carpentaria, CA) were incubated for 60 min at room temperature after slides were washed for 1 hr in PBS. Slides were incubated in ABC-HRP complex (Vector Laboratories Burlingame, CA) for 30 min. Bound antibodies were then visualized by incubation with 3,3’ diaminobenzidine tetrahydrochloride (liquid DAB, DAKO). Slides were then rinsed in tap water and counterstained with hematoxylin, and then cover slide were mounted. Tumor cells with nuclear staining were recorded as positive manually per tissue core, by a reviewer who was blinded to the clinical data. The numbers of Ki67-positive tumor cells were counted in three high-power fields (x40). The ER immunostaining was registered semi-quantitatively in two ways. Staining intensity (0, no staining; 1, weak staining; 2, moderate staining; and 3, intense staining) and the proportion of stained cells (0, no staining; 1, 1–25% staining; 2, 26–50%; 3, 51–75%; and 4, if more than 75% of the tumor cells were positive.</p></sec><sec id="s4-18"><title>Statistics</title><p>GraphPad Prism 6 software (GraphPad Software, SanDiego, CA) was used to analyze all data.

DMF, DCM, THF, and chloroform were dried over activated 4 Å molecular sieves before use. Other solvents were used without further purification. Thin-layer chromatography (TLC) was performed on silica gel plates (250 mm, Sorbent Technologies, Atlanta, GA) and the plates were visualized under UV at 254 nm. Standard grade silica gel (230–400 mesh, Sorbent Technologies, Atlanta, GA) was used for flash column chromatography. HPLC analyses were carried out on Agilent 1100 series HPLC system (Foster City, CA) equipped with a diode-array UV detector and a C18-bounded HPLC column (Vydac 218TP104, 4.6 mm ×250 mm, 10 μm) by using a 40 min-gradient elution from 10% to 90% acetonitrile in water (0.1% TFA) and a flow rate of 1.0 mL/min. Eluents were monitored at 220 nm. <sup>1</sup>H and <sup>13</sup>C NMR spectra were recorded on Bruker AVANCE III 500 (500 MHz) NMR spectrometer. Chemical shifts were reported in ppm from tetramethylsilane (TMS) as an internal standard. Data were expressed as follows: chemical shift (d), multiplicity (s, singlet; d, doublet; dd, doublet of doublet; t, triplet; dt, doublet of triplet, q, quartet; brs, broad singlet; m, multiplet), coupling constants (Hz). Solid-phase reactions were carried out in 12 mL polypropylene cartridges with 20 m PE frit (Applied Separations, Allentown, PA) and a labquake tube shaker (Fisher Scientific, Pittsburgh, PA) was used for mixing.

Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Kevin Struhl as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal his identity: Kendall W Nettles (Reviewer #1).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>As you will see below, the reviewers have a number of concerns that require considerable work and explanation.</p><p>The estrogen receptor-alpha (ESR1) continues to be an important target in luminal breast cancer. Whereas the currently used endocrine therapies (e.g. aromatase inhibitors, tamoxifen and more recently fulvestrant) have had considerable success, the effectiveness of these therapies is limited by de novo and acquired resistance, and in the case of fulvestrant, suboptimal pharmaceutical properties. These newly described findings strongly support a novel first in class therapeutic for breast cancer, and a design strategy that can be readily applied to other nuclear receptors. However, the reviewers agree that some of these findings have been misinterpreted and additional information is required to support some of the key claims.</p><p>Specific comments:</p><p>1) The focus in the manuscript is on blocking the active conformation of the receptor, and especially the constitutively active mutants found in metastatic treatment resistant disease, but it Ignores the role of corepressors that are required for efficacy of tamoxifen (see PMID:12482846, 12145334, 17283072). It also ignores that their compound binds better to an antagonist conformation of the receptor, upon deletion of helix 12. There is a literature on CBI's as coactivator binding inhibitors. This group is now calling them coregulator binding inhibitors, which is confusing. The authors are encouraged to propose an alternative terminology. Perhaps coregulator binding modulator? Such a change would highlight that these compounds are distinct from previous CBIs in binding with higher affinity to an antagonist conformation surface in addition to the AF2 surface, which only exists with the agonist conformer, and that ECBI-11 uniquely activates apoptotic genes.</p><p>2) Crystal structures have shown that the LBD can adopt three major conformations, with helix 12 docked to form one side of the AF2 coactivator binding surface (diethylstilbesterol, 3ERD.pdb); 2) docked into the coregulator binding surface, blocking both coactivator and corepressor binding (tamoxifen, 3ERT.pdb); 3) or in solution (fulvestrant analog, 1HJ1.pdb), allowing binding of a corepressor peptide to a longer groove than seen in the AF2 surface (2JFA.pdb). Another important consideration is that the ligands can also directly contact corepressors (visualized in PMID 17283072, 2JFA.pdb). The identification of binding sites and discussion of the mechanism needs further clarification.</p><p>3) If ECBI-11 blocks corepressor binding one would expect AF1 activity. The coactivator binding data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2D</xref> suggests some residual binding with ECBI-11, similar to tamoxifen, so it will be important to determine the degree of AF1 activity of the compound, compared to tamoxifen. ECBI vs tamoxifen should be tested with an ERE-luc reporter assay in HepG2 cells, which show high tamoxifen agonist activity, or some other cell line with tamoxifen agonist activity.</p><p>4) In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B-C</xref>, even though ER+ cell lines are more sensitive to ECBI-11 than ER- cell lines, the maximum reduction of viability varies dramatically. The authors should show a graph displaying the% maximum inhibition, and can they also include data comparing activity of ECBI-11 in these ER+ lines to fulvestrant or tamoxifen.</p><p>5) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>: This model ignores the fact that the compound binds more strongly to an antagonist conformer, when helix 12 is deleted. Please model ECBI-11 to the LBD in the absence of helix 12, with tamoxifen versus SERD bound LBD. Use pdb files 3ERT and 5ACC and delete residues 531+. Please also describe whether the compound is interacting with helix 12 in the current model. Please make another figure panel showing side-chains and identify key molecular interactions, which could be supplemental.</p><p>6) The data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1H</xref> are confusing. Firstly, a control to evaluate the interaction of ECBI-11 with apo-ESR1 is missing. However, more puzzling is the fact that GDC-810 and AZD9494, both of which disrupt the AF-2 packet of ESR1, do not block the interaction of ECBI-11 with ESR-1. Tamoxifen does this, as expected. The authors note this discrepancy and suggest that maybe the activity of tamoxifen relates to a second tamoxifen binding site ESR1, as suggested several years ago by Elwood Jensen. This may be the case but if so it puts a significant hole in the mechanistic model that ECBI-11 is working through the canonical AF-2 pocket. Resolution of this issue is needed in light of the authors' proposed model.</p><p>7) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>. The analysis is entirely focused on which coregulators are dismissed, and ignores the potential coregulators required for induction of apoptosis or transcriptional repression. Please provide additional analyses of the ECBI-recruited coregulators. This is one area where focusing on &quot;binding inhibitor&quot; is misrepresenting the results, and in doing so underselling the significance. By treating it as a binding inhibitor, the data reveals only a partial inhibition. By focusing on coregulator binding modulation, the authors can point out the novel ensemble of proteins that are driving new biology such as efficacy in treatment resistance models.</p><p>8) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2K</xref>. This is a key experiment that addresses whether tamoxifen competition derives from its positioning of helix 12, its side chain interaction with ECPI-11 or whether tamoxifen displaces ECBI-11 through a putative second binding site, overlapping with the corepressor binding site (PMID: 16782818). These data suggest that it is one of the latter two explanations. This needs to be further clarified using either transfected or recombinant protein. Tamoxifen binds in the pocket with single digit nanomolar affinity, and to the second site with &quot;greatly reduced&quot; affinity. The authors should perform a dose curve to determine which is more likely.</p><p>9) The Discussion needs revision to reflect the fact that the compound binds more tightly to an antagonist conformer, but also the agonist AF2 surface. This is a feature that is significantly different from previous CBIs, and likely contributes to the improved efficacy. The authors should include a more balanced Discussion that is less focused on inhibition of binding. There appear to be several contributions to the unique mechanism of action, including altered coregulator binding, inhibition of dimerization and DNA binding, induction of apoptotic genes, and a reduction in ESR1 expression.</p><p>10) It is not entirely convincing that the observed anti-tumor activities are on-target. The central premise of the work is that the ESR1 coregulator binding pocket that forms upon binding 17-β estradiol (E2) allows the interaction of specific LXXLL motifs within coregulators to engage the receptor and that this interaction can be targeted with peptidomimetics. In support of this mechanism the authors show that their lead compound ECBI-11 inhibits E2-dependent transcriptional activity, ESR1-coregulator binding, and the growth of ESR1 expressing cell lines. However, there are several pieces of inconsistent data that the authors themselves acknowledge (somewhat) that they cannot reconcile with this simple model. The authors should modify the messaging of the manuscript to present a new, potentially very important molecule (ECBI-11), whose activities are partially ESR1-dependent.</p><p>11) Does ECBI-11 inhibit the activity of an ERα-VP16 chimera? This receptor derivative does not require AF-2 as the VP16 activator overrides the activity of AF1 and AF-2. If the drug does indeed inhibit this chimera then the primary mechanistic hypothesis is unlikely to be correct. This, or a similar experiment that is specifically designed to &quot;disprove&quot; the authors mechanistic hypothesis, is needed.</p><p>12) Whereas it is interesting that the activity of ECBI-11 was restricted to ESR1 positive cells it cannot be concluded that the inhibition observed results from the inhibition of ESR1. Not all of the cells tested require E2/ESR1 for growth. Maybe it's just being a luminal breast cancer that defines responsively.</p><p>13) It is not clear why ZR75 cells were used for the in vivo studies when MCF-7 cell derived tumors are the gold standard. Did ECBI-11 not work in MCF-7 cells in vivo? There is data showing efficacy in the MCF-7 LTLT model although it's not clear how these cells were derived and a positive control (fulvestrant) was not included. Thus, although ECBI-11 works in this model, the role of ESR1 is not clear.</p><p>14) The data generated in the D2A1 model are problematic. The authors present this as a model of ESR-1 positive luminal cancer. However, a literature search revealed that it is used as a model of TNBC! Is the subline the authors using different from that used by others? Have they shown that ESR1 is expressed in these cells/tumors? This data is only of value (with respect to implicating ESR1) if they show that the tumors can be inhibited by more standard drugs (tamoxifen and/or fulvestrant).</p><p>15) The authors note that ECBI-11 treatment induces apoptosis in cells in which fulvestrant does not. Given that fulvestrant eliminates ESR1, expression it is unclear why ECBI-11 can induce this activity unless the apoptosis is due to an off-target activity.</p><p>16) The authors should include additional controls to demonstrate the specificity of ECBI-11 in cells.</p><p>a) In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2H</xref> authors should include western analysis of more proteins that are immuno-precipitated by ER (e.g. SRC's, MED, TIF1, p300).</p><p>b) A negative control (a protein whose binding to ER is not reduced by ECBI-11 e.g. TIF1) should be included in their proximity ligation assays shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2I</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2D</xref>. A similar negative control needs to be included in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figures 4C-D</xref>.</p><p>17) If the authors want to examine effects of ECBI-11 on AR binding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1A</xref>), why not include an AR agonist to stimulate AR activity? E2 is not an AR agonist and will not induce AR activity. In the absence of this control it is difficult to conclude that ECBI-11 does not modulate AR activity. This experiment should also include an AR antagonist to demonstrate that disruption of AR binding can be detected in their assay.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.26857.081</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>Specific comments:</italic> </p><p><italic>1) The focus in the manuscript is on blocking the active conformation of the receptor, and especially the constitutively active mutants found in metastatic treatment resistant disease, but it Ignores the role of corepressors that are required for efficacy of tamoxifen (see PMID:12482846, 12145334, 17283072).

Our mechanistic studies do indeed confirm that the activity of our compound is due to multiple mechanisms of action,including its abilityto bind to ER,modulate coregulator binding to ER, inhibit ER dimerization and induce apoptotic genes. To reflect its multiple mechanisms of action, we will use the nomenclature ERX, for Estrogen Receptor coregulator binding modulators where X refers to multiple mode of actions of ERX-11 on ER functions. We have modified the figures and the manuscript to reflect the new terminology.</p><p><italic>2) Crystal structures have shown that the LBD can adopt three major conformations, with helix 12 docked to form one side of the AF2 coactivator binding surface (diethylstilbesterol, 3ERD.pdb); 2) docked into the coregulator binding surface, blocking both coactivator and corepressor binding (tamoxifen, 3ERT.pdb); 3) or in solution (fulvestrant analog, 1HJ1.pdb), allowing binding of a corepressor peptide to a longer groove than seen in the AF2 surface (2JFA.pdb). Another important consideration is that the ligands can also directly contact corepressors (visualized in PMID 17283072, 2JFA.pdb). The identification of binding sites and discussion of the mechanism needs further clarification.</italic> </p><p>As suggested by the reviewer, we have now performed docking simulations of ERX-11 on four crystal structures corresponding to 3ERD, 3ERT, 1HJ1, and 2JFA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s6">Figure 2—figure supplement 6</xref>).</p><p>In 3ERD, binding of the agonist leads to a rearrangement of helix 12 and forms a hydrophobic cleft (i.e., AF2 binding site) that is surrounded by helix 3, 4, 5, and 12: we found that ERX-11 makes hydrophobic contact with the AF2 site with its two isobutyl side chain groups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s6">Figure 2—figure supplement 6AA</xref>). In addition, the hydroxyl group of ERX-11 interacts with a residue near AF2 domain. These data indicate that ERX-11 interacts with ER LBD differently than the agonist.</p><p>The crystal structure of 3ERT shows that 4-hydroxytamoxifen (antagonist) induces conformational change and makes helix 12 occupy the AF2 binding site, blocking both coactivator and corepressor binding. This makes ERX-11 change its binding site to a nearby pocket formed by helix 5, 11, and 12, as shown in the <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s6">Figure 2—figure supplement 6AB</xref>. These data show that ERX-11 could only interact with ER in the presence of tamoxifen, through an alternate binding site. These data could explain why the interaction between ERX-11 and purified ER could be blocked by tamoxifen. However, within the cell, tamoxifen cannot block ERX-11 binding to ER:, suggesting that the secondary binding site of ERX-11 on ER may be stabilized by coregulators.</p><p>Docking simulation of ERX-11 on human ERα with affinity tagged corepressor peptide (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s6">Figure 2—figure supplement 6AC</xref>) (2JFA.pdb) or rat ERβ crystal structure with ICI bound<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s6">Figure 2—figure supplement 6AD</xref> (1HJ1.pdb) showed that ECBI-11 can still bind to the AF2 domain, in a similar manner as it does when the ligand is bound. These data support our biochemical findings that ICI does not block ERX-11 interaction with ER.</p><p><italic>3) If ECBI-11 blocks corepressor binding one would expect AF1 activity. The coactivator binding data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2D</xref> suggests some residual binding with ECBI-11, similar to tamoxifen, so it will be important to determine the degree of AF1 activity of the compound, compared to tamoxifen. ECBI vs tamoxifen should be tested with an ERE-luc reporter assay in HepG2 cells, which show high tamoxifen agonist activity, or some other cell line with tamoxifen agonist activity.</italic> </p><p>We have now tested whether ERX-11 has any residual activity via AF1 domain using endometrial Ishikawa cell line, which exhibit agonist activity via AF1. As expected, tamoxifen treatment promoted agonist activity in this model. However, in this assay we failed to detect any agonist activity of ERX-11. These results suggest that ERX-11 lacks AF1 activity. We have included this data as <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s4">Figure 2—figure supplement 4D</xref>.</p><p><italic>4) In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B-C</xref>, even though ER+ cell lines are more sensitive to ECBI-11 than ER- cell lines, the maximum reduction of viability varies dramatically. The authors should show a graph displaying the% maximum inhibition, and can they also include data comparing activity of ECBI-11 in these ER+ lines to fulvestrant or tamoxifen.</italic> </p><p>We have included a graph displaying the% maximum inhibition mediated by ERX-11 (1μM) in a number ER+ and ER- cell lines as a waterfall graph in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1D</xref>. We have also included data comparing the activity of ERX-11 in ER+ cell lines to fulvestrant or tamoxifen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1D, E</xref>.</p><p><italic>5) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>: This model ignores the fact that the compound binds more strongly to an antagonist conformer, when helix 12 is deleted. Please model ECBI-11 to the LBD in the absence of helix 12, with tamoxifen versus SERD bound LBD. Use pdb files 3ERT and 5ACC and delete residues 531+. Please also describe whether the compound is interacting with helix 12 in the current model. Please make another figure panel showing side-chains and identify key molecular interactions, which could be supplemental.</italic> </p><p>We have created a model showing the side chains and interactions of ERX-11 with residues in the ER protein using 1L2I.pdb structure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s6">Figure 2—figure supplement 6B</xref>).</p><p>We also have carried out additional docking experiment without helix 12 with the crystal structures of 3ERT.pdb and 5ACC.pdb as suggested by the reviewer. The deletion of the helix 12 destroys the AF2 binding site and this makes ERX-11 look for another binding site. It is interesting to note that ERX-11 was found to bind to the tamoxifen binding site when the helix 12 was deleted in the crystal structure of 3ERT.pdb (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s6">Figure 2—figure supplement 6CA</xref>). The superimposition of tamoxifen (red) and ERX-11 (green) clearly shows the overlap of their binding sites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s6">Figure 2—figure supplement 6CB</xref>). This may explain our experimental results showing the competition of tamoxifen with ERX-11 on ER-▲12. On the other hand, the deletion of the helix 12 of the crystal structure of 5ACC.pdb still allows ERX-11 to bind to the AF2 domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s6">Figure 2—figure supplement 6C</xref>), which does not overlap with the binding site of SERD in the crystal structure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s6">Figure 2—figure supplement 6D</xref> 2—figure supplement C). This also confirms our experimental results of the inability of the SERDS to compete with ERX-11 binding to ER-▲12.</p><p><italic>6) The data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1H</xref> are confusing. Firstly, a control to evaluate the interaction of ECBI-11 with apo-ESR1 is missing. However, more puzzling is the fact that GDC-810 and AZD9494, both of which disrupt the AF-2 packet of ESR1, do not block the interaction of ECBI-11 with ESR-1. Tamoxifen does this, as expected. The authors note this discrepancy and suggest that maybe the activity of tamoxifen relates to a second tamoxifen binding site ESR1, as suggested several years ago by Elwood Jensen. This may be the case but if so it puts a significant hole in the mechanistic model that ECBI-11 is working through the canonical AF-2 pocket. Resolution of this issue is needed in light of the authors' proposed model.</italic> </p><p>We have now repeated this experiment and included apo-ER control. The results showed that ERX-11 has weak interaction with apo-ER and addition of E2 significantly increased ERX-11 ability to interact with ER. Further, addition of tamoxifen interfered with ERX-11 interaction with ER, while SERDs only slightly reduced ERX-11 binding. New data replaced old <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1H</xref>. Further, using crystal structures, we have refined our models, that explain why ERX-11 interaction with ER could be affected by tamoxifen but not by SERD. We thank the reviewers for their suggestions to model the interaction using existing structures, as it potentially explains our findings(<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s6">Figure 2—figure supplements 6</xref>,<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s7">7</xref>).</p><p><italic>7) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>. The analysis is entirely focused on which coregulators are dismissed, and ignores the potential coregulators required for induction of apoptosis or transcriptional repression. Please provide additional analyses of the ECBI-recruited coregulators. This is one area where focusing on &quot;binding inhibitor&quot; is misrepresenting the results, and in doing so underselling the significance. By treating it as a binding inhibitor, the data reveals only a partial inhibition. By focusing on coregulator binding modulation, the authors can point out the novel ensemble of proteins that are driving new biology such as efficacy in treatment resistance models.</italic> </p><p>Based on the reviewer’s suggestions, we have now reanalyzed the ERX-11-recruited binding proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). Pathways analysis in terms of either biological processes or molecular functions revealed that ERX-11 binding proteins were involved in the activation of multiple pathways leading to transcriptional regulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). Based on these studies, and the finding that our compound mediates apoptosis, we have revised the terminology of our compounds to ERX to reflect its biological activity.</p><p><italic>8) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2K</xref>. This is a key experiment that addresses whether tamoxifen competition derives from its positioning of helix 12, its side chain interaction with ECPI-11 or whether tamoxifen displaces ECBI-11 through a putative second binding site, overlapping with the corepressor binding site (PMID: 16782818). These data suggest that it is one of the latter two explanations. This needs to be further clarified using either transfected or recombinant protein. Tamoxifen binds in the pocket with single digit nanomolar affinity, and to the second site with &quot;greatly reduced&quot; affinity. The authors should perform a dose curve to determine which is more likely.</italic> </p><p>We have added a dose response experiment that suggests that ERX-11 binding to a putative seconding binding site on ER in the presence of tamoxifen. Increasing concentrations of tamoxifen fail to dislodge ERX-11 from ER (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s5">Figure 2—figure supplement 5C</xref>). However, for the ER▲12 mutant, increasing concentrations of tamoxifen is only able to dislodge ERX-11 from ER at higher concentrations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s5">Figure 2—figure supplement 5D</xref>), suggesting that ERX-11 interaction with the primary binding site of ER is through the second binding site of tamoxifen with greatly reduced affinity. We have also added a model to explain the potential interaction between ER and ERX-11 or between ER▲12 mutant and ERX-11 in the absence or presence of agonist, SERDs or tamoxifen (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s7">Figure 2—figure supplement 7</xref>). Importantly, these data indicate that tamoxifen displaces ERX-11 from its binding site.</p><p><italic>9) The Discussion needs revision to reflect the fact that the compound binds more tightly to an antagonist conformer, but also the agonist AF2 surface. This is a feature that is significantly different from previous CBIs, and likely contributes to the improved efficacy. The authors should include a more balanced Discussion that is less focused on inhibition of binding. There appear to be several contributions to the unique mechanism of action, including altered coregulator binding, inhibition of dimerization and DNA binding, induction of apoptotic genes, and a reduction in ESR1 expression.</italic> </p><p>We agree with reviewer’s suggestion. We have now modified the Discussion and renamed our compound as ERX-11 to reflect several contributions to its unique mode of action.</p><p><italic>10) It is not entirely convincing that the observed anti-tumor activities are on-target. The central premise of the work is that the ESR1 coregulator binding pocket that forms upon binding 17-β estradiol (E2) allows the interaction of specific LXXLL motifs within coregulators to engage the receptor and that this interaction can be targeted with peptidomimetics. In support of this mechanism the authors show that their lead compound ECBI-11 inhibits E2-dependent transcriptional activity, ESR1-coregulator binding, and the growth of ESR1 expressing cell lines. However, there are several pieces of inconsistent data that the authors themselves acknowledge (somewhat) that they cannot reconcile with this simple model. The authors should modify the messaging of the manuscript to present a new, potentially very important molecule (ECBI-11), whose activities are partially ESR1-dependent.</italic> </p><p>We agree with reviewers’ suggestions. We have now modified our model and softened the discussion reflecting ERX-11 has complex mode of activity on ER and that its effects are only partially ER-dependent.</p><p><italic>11) Does ECBI-11 inhibit the activity of an ERα-VP16 chimera? This receptor derivative does not require AF-2 as the VP16 activator overrides the activity of AF1 and AF-2. If the drug does indeed inhibit this chimera then the primary mechanistic hypothesis is unlikely to be correct. This, or a similar experiment that is specifically designed to &quot;disprove&quot; the authors mechanistic hypothesis, is needed.</italic> </p><p>We have now conducted suggested experiment usingERα-VP16 chimera receptor that does not require AF-2 as the VP16 activator overrides the activity of AF1 and AF-2. In these reporter-based assays, ERX-11 failed to reduce the ERE-luc reporter activity driven by ERα-VP16 chimera. In this assay, we have used tamoxifen and ICI as controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s4">Figure 2—figure supplement 4C</xref>). As expected tamoxifen that signals via AF2, and AF1 also did not affected the ERα-VP16 chimera reporter activity, while ICI that degrades ER significantly reduced the reporter activity.</p><p>Collectively, these results confirm that the ERX-11 block signaling specifically driven by AF2 domain.</p><p><italic>12) Whereas it is interesting that the activity of ECBI-11 was restricted to ESR1 positive cells it cannot be concluded that the inhibition observed results from the inhibition of ESR1. Not all of the cells tested require E2/ESR1 for growth. Maybe it's just being a luminal breast cancer that defines responsively.</italic> </p><p>As suggested by the reviewer, it is possible that ERX-11 target will be luminal breast cancer cells. However, our mechanistic studies support that ER as the primary target for this ERX-11 activity. To further support the importance of ER in ERX-11 activity, we have used restoration model cells where ER was introduced into ER-negative breast cancer model MDA-MB-231. MTT assays revealed that introduction of WT ER into MDA-MB-231 cells, restored ERX-11 growth inhibitory activity in non-responsive MDA-MB-231 cells. Similarly, introduction of the ER▲12 mutant into these cells restored responsiveness to ERX-11. These results further underscore the importance of ER in ERX-11 mode of action(<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s5">Figure 2—figure supplement 5E</xref>).</p><p><italic>13) It is not clear why ZR75 cells were used for the in vivo studies when MCF-7 cell derived tumors are the gold standard. Did ECBI-11 not work in MCF-7 cells in vivo? There is data showing efficacy in the MCF-7 LTLT model although it's not clear how these cells were derived and a positive control (fulvestrant) was not included. Thus, although ECBI-11 works in this model, the role of ESR1 is not clear.</italic> </p><p>We have used two different models (MCF-7 and ZR-75) for in vivo studies to avoid any artifacts due to genetic background. Further, ERX-11 showed efficacy in both MCF-7 based xenografts tested in this study (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>, MCF-7-PELP1, and 6E, MCF-7-LTLT). MCF-7-LTLT cells were widely used cells we received from Dr. Angela Brodie lab, exhibit-resistance to letrozole. MCF-7-LTLT cells were developed by continuous exposure of letrozole over a long period of time. We have now conduced an in vivo experiment showing the efficacy of fulvestrant on this xenograft. Further, we have also treated these tumors with ERX-11 as comparison with fulvestrant. Results showed that fulvestrant was able to reduce the growth of MCF-7-LTLT tumors. Further, ERX-11 exhibited similar potency in this model as fulvestrant. New data was included as <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1A</xref>.</p><p><italic>14) The data generated in the D2A1 model are problematic. The authors present this as a model of ESR-1 positive luminal cancer. However, a literature search revealed that it is used as a model of TNBC! Is the subline the authors using different from that used by others? Have they shown that ESR1 is expressed in these cells/tumors? This data is only of value (with respect to implicating ESR1) if they show that the tumors can be inhibited by more standard drugs (tamoxifen and/or fulvestrant).</italic> </p><p>D2A1 cells were initially characterized by Dr. Tekmal (coauthor of this manuscript) for hormonal therapy response (PMID 9310256). In D2A1 model cells, cellular gene int-5/aromatase in BALB/c mammary alveolar hyperplastic nodule (D2 HAN/D2 tumor cells) is activated as a result of mouse mammary tumor virus integration within the 3' untranslated region of the aromatase gene. Thus, these models also have ability to synthesize local estrogen via aromatase induction. Further, this model expresses estrogen receptor (ER) and represents a model of intra-tumoral estrogen driven mammary cancer. D2A1 cells are shown to be useful model for evaluating the effects of aromatase inhibitors and antiestrogens. To address the reviewers’ concerns, we have now conducted western blot analysis of D2A1 cells. Results showed that D2A1 cells express ER. Mammary gland lysates as well as murine ER positive cells E0771 were used as positive controls. Tamoxifen was able to reduce the growth of D2A1 cells. Further, IHC analysis confirmed that D2A1 tumors express ER and ERX-11 treatment substantially reduced ER expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1B</xref>).</p><p><italic>15) The authors note that ECBI-11 treatment induces apoptosis in cells in which fulvestrant does not. Given that fulvestrant eliminates ESR1, expression it is unclear why ECBI-11 can induce this activity unless the apoptosis is due to an off-target activity.</italic> </p><p>We consistently observed activation of apoptosis by ERX-11 but failed to observe any apoptosis by tamoxifen or ICI in our assays. We believe that activation of apoptosis is not due to elimination of ER rather due to unique mechanism of action of ERX-11. Specifically, we predict that changes in the ER signaling due to alterations in coregulator binding to ER. Accordingly, our RNAseq data showed that alterations in genes that contribute activation of apoptosis. However, further studies are needed to clearly identify the mechanisms by which ERX-11 promotes apoptosis.</p><p><italic>16) The authors should include additional controls to demonstrate the specificity of ECBI-11 in cells.</italic> </p><p> <italic>a) In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2H</xref> authors should include western analysis of more proteins that are immuno-precipitated by ER (e.g. SRC's, MED, TIF1, p300).</italic> </p><p> <italic>b) A negative control (a protein whose binding to ER is not reduced by ECBI-11 e.g. TIF1) should be included in their proximity ligation assays shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2I</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2D</xref>. A similar negative control needs to be included in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figures 4C-D</xref>.</italic> </p><p>We have modified our figures to reflect the IP western blot analysis of additional proteins affected by ERX-11 as well as proteins that are not. We have also included a negative control for the PLA in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2I</xref>. We have also added negative control quantification in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s4">Figure 2—figure supplement 4B</xref>.</p><p><italic>17) If the authors want to examine effects of ECBI-11 on AR binding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1A</xref>), why not include an AR agonist to stimulate AR activity? E2 is not an AR agonist and will not induce AR activity. In the absence of this control it is difficult to conclude that ECBI-11 does not modulate AR activity. This experiment should also include an AR antagonist to demonstrate that disruption of AR binding can be detected in their assay.</italic> </p><p>We have now conducted requested experiment with control AR agonist. Results showed ERX-11 has no activity on AR binding induced by DHT.</p></body></sub-article></article>
