Psychophysical studies show that perceptual sensitivity to rapidly varying inputs differs for signals originating in S cones versus L and M cones; notably, S-cone signals appear perceptually delayed relative to L- and M-cone signals. These differences could originate in the cones themselves or in the post-cone circuitry. To determine if the cones could contribute to these and related perceptual phenomena, we compared the light responses of primate S, M, and L cones. We found that S cones generate slower light responses than L and M cones, show much smaller changes in response kinetics as background-light levels increase, and are noisier than L and M cones. It will be important to incorporate these differences into descriptions of how cone signaling shapes human visual perception.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>retina</kwd><kwd>cones</kwd><kwd>retinal circuitry</kwd><kwd>blue cones</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Rhesus macaque</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>EY011850</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Rieke</surname><given-names>Fred</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000011</institution-id><institution>Howard Hughes Medical Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Investigator</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Rieke</surname><given-names>Fred</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000893</institution-id><institution>Simons Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Fellowship</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Rieke</surname><given-names>Fred</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100008227</institution-id><institution>ARCS Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Scholar</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Baudin</surname><given-names>Jacob</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>EY028111</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Rieke</surname><given-names>Fred</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>EY026070</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Sinha</surname><given-names>Raunak</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Heterogeneity in perceptual sensitivity of human cone-mediated vision across wavelength originates in the cone photoreceptors, where S cones exhibit distinct functional properties in comparison to L and M cones.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Sensory receptors pose fundamental limits to perception. Perceptual sensitivity to flickering lights, for example, is dramatically different at low- and high-light levels, and much of this dependence on light level can be traced to differences in the kinetics of responses of the rod and cone photoreceptors themselves. Under many conditions, perceptual sensitivity to flickering lights is also lower for signals originating in short- (S) wavelength-sensitive cones than for signals originating in middle- (M) or long- (L) wavelength-sensitive cones (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Brindley et al., 1966</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Green, 1969</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Smithson and Mollon, 2004</xref>). Responses mediated by S vs L and M cones (hereafter LM cones) differ similarly in higher brain centers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Cottaris and De Valois, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Tailby et al., 2008</xref>). These differences appear to originate before cone signals are combined to create color-opponent pathways, perhaps as early as in the cones themselves (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Lee et al., 2009</xref>).</p><p>Several considerations suggest that signaling could differ in S vs LMÂ cones. First, responses of salamander and goldfish SÂ cones are considerably slower than those of LÂ cones (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Rieke and Baylor, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Howlett et al., 2017</xref>), and salamander SÂ cones exhibit lower noise than LÂ cones (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Rieke and Baylor, 2000</xref>). Second, the kinetics of responses of primate cones differ across retinal regions, providing a precedent for systematic variations in signaling in primate cones (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Sinha et al., 2017</xref>). Third, the evolutionary split between SÂ cones and LMÂ cones is estimated to have occurred more than 500 million years ago (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Nathans et al., 1986</xref>), providing ample opportunity for differences in signaling to emerge. Although previous recordings from primate cones find similar kinetics across responses of different cone types (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Baylor et al., 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Schnapf et al., 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Hornstein et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Cao et al., 2014</xref>), the small number of recorded S cones in these studies precludes a definitive comparison.</p><p>Here, we directly compare response kinetics, sensitivity to background light, and noise properties of primate S and LMÂ cones. By learning to identify SÂ cones based on their morphological features (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Ahnelt et al., 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Curcio et al., 1991</xref>), we mitigated the challenges associated with their relative scarcity and collected a set of SÂ cone recordings many times larger than those previously used to analyze their response properties. These data revealed that SÂ cones differ from LMÂ cones in kinetics, adaptation and noise. We show further that the differences in cone signaling impact retinal output signals and hence likely contribute to perception.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>The results below are divided into four sections: (1) comparison of the response kinetics of S and LMÂ cones; (2) characterization of how the kinetics of S- and LM-cone responses depend on background-light level; (3) comparison of S- and LM-cone responses in retinal ganglion cells; and (4) comparison of noise in S and LMÂ cones.</p><sec id="s2-1"><title>S-cone responses are slower than those of L- and M- cones</title><sec id="s2-1-1"><title>Peripheral cones</title><p>To compare the kinetics of cone responses across spectral types, we recorded voltage responses to brief flashes delivered in the presence of background light that produced matched photon-absorption rates (R*/s) in each cone type.

Two features are apparent in these averaged responses: (1) S-cone responses reach a peak amplitude later than L- or M-cone responses, particularly at the higher background-light levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>); and (2) the kinetics of S-cone responses change less with background than those of L- and M-cone responses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>).

One concern is that light responses can vary across cones (e.g. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>) and across different retinas, potentially biasing our measured cone responses. To control for such potential bias, we compared S-cone responses with those of LM cones from the same piece of retina. Each light purple point in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E and F</xref> plots the average time to peak of all LM-cones recorded in a given piece of retina against the average time to peak of all recorded S cones in the same retinal piece. S-cone responses were distinctly slower than LM-cone responses across 14 retinas at 5000 R*/cone/s and 12 retinas at 50,000 R*/cone/s. Differences similarly persisted when we compared responses of individual S cones to those of LM cones measured immediately before or afterwards in the same retina (not shown).</p><p>We used the same procedure to compare L- and M-cone responses, including checking the validity of grouping them as a reference for S-cone kinetics. When we compared the average L-cone time to peak to the average M-cone time to peak in each piece of retina, the pairs clustered close to unity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2âfigure supplement 1</xref>). At 5000 R*/s, there was no measurable difference in the paired average L- and M-cone times to peak (â2.0 toÂ +2.2 ms, 95% CI), while the difference in the paired average S-cone and LM-cone times to peak was 8.5 ms (+6.4 to+10.6 ms, 95% CI). At 50,000 R*/s, these differences were 1 ms for L vs M cones (â2.0 toÂ +4.2 ms, 95% CI) and 11.5 ms for S vs LM cones (+9.3 to+13.7 ms, 95% CI). Thus, L-and M-cone response kinetics differ minimally whereas S-cone responses are substantially slower than those of LM cones at these light levels.</p><p>Do the slower S-cone responses reflect slowed response onset, recovery or both? To answer this question, we normalized the time to peak of the average responses for each cone type. These normalized responses superimposed more closely than the unnormalized responses throughout both response onset and recovery (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2âfigure supplement 2</xref>). Hence the slower S-cone responses compared to LM-coneÂ responses appear to reflect a slowing of both response onset and recovery rather than a preferential slowing of one or the other (see Discussion).</p></sec><sec id="s2-1-2"><title>Foveal cones</title><p>L- and M-cone responses are slower in the fovea than the periphery (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Sinha et al., 2017</xref>). To determine whether S cones exhibit similar regional differences in kinetics, we compared responses of S cones in foveal (within 500 Î¼m of foveal pit) and peripheral (&gt;5,000 Î¼m from foveal pit) retina. Similar to foveal LM cones, responses of foveal S cones were slower than those of their peripheral counterparts at background light levels of both 5000 and 50,000 R*/cone/s (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G and H</xref>).</p><p>Slower kinetics of foveal S cones relative to peripheral S cones do not mandate that foveal S cones will be slower than foveal LM cones. Because of the importance of the fovea for perception, we also directly compared foveal S-cone responses with those of foveal LMÂ cones to determine if the differences in kinetics observed in peripheral retina held in the fovea. S-cone responses, averaged across all cells that we could reference to a L or M cone in the same fovea, were slower than LM-cone responses at both 5000 and 50,000 R*/cone/s (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E and F</xref>; S cones, 63.5Â Â±Â 1.8 ms at 5000 R*/s and 59.1Â Â±Â 2.1 ms at 50,000 R*/s; LM cones, 56.1Â Â±Â 1.1 ms at 5000 R*/s and 53.6Â Â±Â 1.3 ms at 50,000 R*/s).

A direct comparison of the kinetics of ganglion cell responses mediated by signals originating in different cone types is confounded by the potential for kinetic changes introduced within the circuits conveying the cone signals. Specifically, circuits conveying S-cone signals to ganglion cells could introduce different kinetic changes than circuits conveying LM-cone signals.

Previous measurements from primate LM cones showed that as light levels increased from darkness, noise in the flash-response range increasedÂ ~2 fold and then fell sharply (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Angueyra and Rieke, 2013</xref>). This was attributed to the background light introducing Poisson noise in photon absorption while being too dim to engage adaptation. At higher backgrounds, response adaptation appeared to outweigh the increased noise in photon absorption, leading to decreased noise in the flash-response range. L, M and S cones all followed this behavior, but the increase in noise in S cones was significantly smaller than that in LM cones at 500 R*/s (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D</xref>; S-cone noise increases by factor of 1.4Â Â±Â 0.1, M-cone noise by 1.94Â Â±Â 0.17, and L-cone noise by 2.10Â Â±Â 0.14, meanÂ Â±sem). Such a difference could arise if the S-cone response to a single-photon absorption was smaller relative to noise compared to the LM-cone single photon response; a smaller single photon response would in turn mean less noise due to Poisson fluctuations and less of a dependence of noise on background. Two predictions can be made if a smaller single-photon response is the main source of differences in the noise properties across cone types: (1) adaptation of S-cone noise in the high-frequency range, where noise in photon absorption should have little effect, should be similar to that in LM cones; and (2) the number of isomerizations required to match the noise power should be higher in S-cones at these backgrounds. Both predictions held true (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7E</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7âfigure supplement 1</xref>).</p><p>The increased noise relative to the flash response in S cones at 0 and 500 R*/s suggests that detection thresholds may also be higher in SÂ cones. Although noise-effective isomerizations and detection thresholds are closely linked, we calculated brief-flash detection thresholds in each cone type to facilitate comparison with previous work. The detection threshold was defined as the flash-response strength needed to match the noise power in a 200 ms integration window (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7F</xref>). As expected, S-cone detection thresholds were higher than those of LM cones both in darkness (3.7Â Â±Â 0.3 R* in 9 S cones vs 1.7Â Â±Â 0.1 R* in 24 L and M cones) and at 500 R*/s (8Â Â±Â 1 R* for S cones vs 4.1Â Â±Â 0.5 R* for LM cones). Thresholds were similar across cone types at 5000 and 50,000 R*/s.</p><p>The results described here show that, relative to their respective flash responses, S-cone noise is higher than LM-cone noise at low-light levels and comparable at higher-light levels. This is contrary to predictions if noise was dominated by thermal activation of the photopigment and the thermal-activation rate scaled with wavelength of peak sensitivity. The difference in cone noise is sufficiently large to impact cone detection thresholds and other perceptual tasks based on the cone signals (see Discussion).</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Visual sensitivity to time-varying signals originating in S vs LM cones differs, and this difference has been suggested to originate in the cones themselves (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Lee et al., 2009</xref>). Due to limited intracellular recordings from primate cones, this suggestion has not been well tested. Motivated by studies of cones across spectral types in other species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Rieke and Baylor, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Howlett et al., 2017</xref>) as well as recently reported differences in primate cones across eccentricity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Sinha et al., 2017</xref>), we aimed to test this suggestion. We find that S-cone responses differ from those of LM cones in three ways. First, S-cone responses are slower than LM-cone responses in both peripheral and foveal retina. Second, the kinetics of S-cone responses adapt minimally across background light levels, unlike responses of LM cones. Third, S cones have a lower signal-to-noise ratio at low-light levels compared to LM cones, resulting in higher S-cone flash-detection thresholds. These differences shape the output of the retina and are predicted to affect perception.</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>Different kinetics of signals in S- vs LM-cone pathways begin at the first neuron of the visual system</title><p>S cones produce slower flash responses and respond less robustly to high-frequency sinusoidal stimuli than LM cones. The similarity of these differences in the cone current and voltage responses indicates that they originate at least in large part within the phototransduction cascade. These differences likely contribute to our lower perceptual sensitivity to rapidly modulated signals that preferentially stimulate S cones compared to those that preferentially stimulate LM cones (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Brindley et al., 1966</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Marks and Bornstein, 1973</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Smithson and Mollon, 2004</xref>). Furthermore, the kinetics of S-cone responses changed minimally with increasing light level, while responses of LM cones sped considerably (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). Perceptual experiments find a similar difference in the dependence of flicker-fusion frequencies on background-light level for chromatic stimuli encoded by S vs LM cones (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Brindley et al., 1966</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Marks and Bornstein, 1973</xref>); specifically, over a sizable range of light levels, the flicker-fusion frequency remains near constant at short wavelengths while increasing at long wavelengths. Further, perceptual chromatic-discrimination experiments indicate that S-cone responses are effectively delayed byÂ ~12 ms relative to opposing LM-cone responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Lee et al., 2009</xref>); this delay applies to discrimination in many different color directions, consistent with an origin prior to the combination of cone signals into cone-opponent pathways. This perceptual delay compares closely with the 8â10 ms difference in the time to peak of S- vs LM-cone responses that we observe (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>).</p><p>The relevance of the kinetic differences across cones types for retinal output signals is supported by the differences we found in the response kinetics of SBCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). Previous measurements of SBC-response kinetics at similar background-light levels found that LM-cone responses are slower than S-cone responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Field et al., 2007</xref>); this is consistent with the extra synapse in the circuitry conveying LM-cone signals to SBCs compared to that conveying S-cone signals. These differences in circuitry, however, mean that absolute response kinetics may not reflect the cone kinetics. We relied instead on the dependence of the response kinetics on background-light level. We found that the kinetics of SBC responses to S-cone-isolating stimuli changed less with increasing backgrounds than responses to LM-cone-isolating stimuli. Thus, differences in response kinetics across cone types appear to be propagated through the retinal circuitry subserving SBCs. It remains to be seen whether these differences are preserved in the other parallel pathways carrying S-cone signals. This approach also demonstrates that differences in the background dependence of response kinetics across cone types can be used to probe the contributions of different cone types to downstream circuitry and to perception.</p><p>S cones also contribute to luminance perception, and these contributions differ in several ways from the S-cone contributions to color perception (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Lee and Stromeyer, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Stockman et al., 1991</xref>). Notably, S-cone contributions to high-frequency luminance flicker increase in strength with increasing light level, indicating a speeding of the kinetics of the underlying neural responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Stockman et al., 2007</xref>). This speeding is similar to that observed for M-cone contributions to luminance perception (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Stockman et al., 2006</xref>) as well as that observed in L- and M-cone inputs to H1 horizontal cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Smith et al., 2001</xref>). The change in kinetics observed perceptually and in horizontal cells, however, exceeds the change we measure in the cone responses. Together these observations suggest that processes downstream of the cone photovoltage substantially shape cone responses, and that these circuit mechanisms differentially shape S-cone responses in chromatic and luminance pathways. Perception is also shaped by interactions between signals initiated in different cone types - forÂ example perceptual sensitivity to S-cone-mediated signals is reduced by activity of L and M cones (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Wisowaty and Boynton, 1980</xref>). It will be interesting to determine the contributions of retinal circuits to these additional processes shaping S-cone-mediated responses.</p><p>In addition to comparing S cones to LM cones, we directly compared a large dataset of L and M cones. Their responses were identical within the resolution of our measurements. Recent work similarly shows minimal differences in gene expression between L and M cones (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Peng et al., 2018</xref>). Given that S cones diverged evolutionarily from the common ancestor of LM cones far earlier than L and M cones diverged from each other, it is not surprising that S cones differ more from LM cones than L and M cones differ from each other (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Nathans et al., 1986</xref>). Differences in photopigment stability, however, could cause L and M cones to differ in adaptational state and hence in kinetics. Our results tightly constrain any such differences.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Noise differs across cone spectral types</title><p>The origin of noise in cone photoreceptors differs between salamander and primate.

Compared to L cones, salamander S cones have much lower noise, consistent with a more stable photopigment. This is consistent with the expected wavelength dependence of photopigment stability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Luo et al., 2011</xref>). Unlike the situation in salamander, the effective noise of primate S cones exceeds that of LM cones at low background-light levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). This results in higher flash-detection thresholds for S vs LM cones.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Possible mechanistic origins of differences in cone signals</title><p>S- vs LM-cone photocurrents and voltages exhibited similar differences in kinetics (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1</xref>â<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">4</xref>), suggesting an origin largely from differences in the cone phototransduction machinery. This is similar to salamander S vs L cones (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Rieke and Baylor, 2000</xref>), but different from goldfish S vs LM cones, in which kinetic differences originate from the expression of a hyperpolarization-activated cyclic nucleotide-gated (HCN) channel in LM but not S cones (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Howlett et al., 2017</xref>). Mammalian rod photoreceptors evolved from S cones and the two photoreceptor types share several phototransduction components (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Craft et al., 2014</xref>). For instance, primate rods and S cones share the same arrestin isoform (arrestin1) responsibleÂ for photopigment inactivation and hence recovery of the light response. S cones also express the cone arrestin isoform (arrestin3), but the expression is lower than that in LM cones (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Craft et al., 2014</xref>). Based on these and other biochemical differences, S cones are thought to share functional features with both rods and LM cones.</p><p>Both the rising and recovery phases differ between S- and LM-cone responses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2âfigure supplement 2</xref>). These two phases of the light responses are primarily controlled by different aspects of the phototransduction cascade. Hence, this analysis suggests that multiple components of the phototransduction cascade differ between S and LM cones, much like the differences observed between mammalian rods and cones (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Ingram et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>Responses of both rods and cones typically speed with increasing background-light level. This speeding can largely be explained by the increase in the rate of cGMP turnover produced by background light (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Nikonov et al., 2000</xref>). The constancy of the kinetics of the S-cone responses with increasing background (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>) suggests that either the cGMP-turnover rate contributes minimally to response kinetics, or one or more components of the phototransduction cascade must slow with background to compensate the expected increase in cGMP-turnover rate.</p></sec><sec id="s3-4"><title>Implications of cone differences in interpreting visual system function</title><p>Considerable effort has gone into understanding retinal circuits due to their importance in explaining human vision as well as their experimental accessibility.

While recording, the photoreceptor array was visualized using DIC microscopy, making all cones appear similar. Initially, we attempted to label S cones in in vitro retina using an antibody directed against the S-opsin molecule (anti-OPN1SW, sc-14363, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Dallas, TX). Although we did not use this approach to collect any of the data reported here, it did help us learn to identify S cones based on their morphology and position within the photoreceptor array (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Ahnelt et al., 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Packer et al., 2010</xref>).

For current-clamp recordings, data was collected only from cones with a maximal response exceeding 10 mV. For voltage-clamp recordings, this criterion was 100 pA (at a holding voltage of â60 mV). The assumption underlying these criteria is that the cells with the largest responses most closely resemble cells in vivo. We controlled for three additional factors that could potentially bias our results. First, cone responses slow over time during whole-cell recordings, likely due to washout of intracellular components essential for phototransduction. We collected data for no longer than 4 min after initiating a recording to minimize this source of bias; time to peak and response amplitude changed minimally during this time, and the response waveform did not noticeably change. Second, the data reported here was collected between 1 and 15 hr after collecting the retina, and cone responses could change over this time. To check this possibility, we grouped the cells into periods of 1â6, 6â10, and 10â15 hr post-retina collection. The time-to-peak of S-cone responses was significantly different from that of LM cones in each time window (data not shown). Third, responses can differ from one retina to the next. To control for such retina-to-retina differences, we referenced each recorded S cone to L and/or M cones recorded in the same retina. The differences we observe in responses collected across all recorded cones (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>) were also present in responses of cells within a given piece of retina (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E and F</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>).

Following a successful recording from peripheral retina, we moved to a location on the retina outside the region exposed to light before attempting another recording; this ensured that all recorded cells were fully dark adapted at the start of the recording. This was limited to 2â3 locations per fovea given its small size.

Furthermore, cone collecting areas estimated for light delivered from above and below the retina (i.e. directly to the outer segment vs first traversing the inner segment) were similar; thus, focusing of light via the inner segment contributes minimally in our preparations, and hence differences in inner segment size between S and LM cones are unlikely to affect the collecting area.</p><p>Cone-isolating stimuli were constructed using a matrix that mapped from LED input to our calculated isomerizations in each cone type.

For the first, we fit a truncated Gaussian distribution spanningÂ ~20 ms to the peak region of the average flash response or linear filter. The time to peak was taken to be the time at which the Gaussian fit reached its maximal value. The final approach involved fitting a function previously shown (Angueyra and Rieke, 2013) to capture the structure of the flash response (<xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="equ1">Equation 1</xref>). We found this function to have the representational power necessary to fit both cone flash responses and SBC linear filters and we defined the time to peak as the time at which this fit function reached its maximal value. For cones, all times-to-peak response reported here were calculated using the truncated Gaussian fitting technique. Small bistratified cell linear filter times to peak were calculated using fits from <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="equ1">Equation 1</xref>.<disp-formula id="equ1"><label>(1)</label><mml:math id="m1"><mml:mi>f</mml:mi><mml:mo>(</mml:mo><mml:mi>t</mml:mi><mml:mo>)</mml:mo> <mml:mi/><mml:mo>=</mml:mo> <mml:mi/><mml:mi>Î±</mml:mi><mml:mo>Ã</mml:mo><mml:mfenced close="]" open="[" separators="|"><mml:mrow><mml:mfrac><mml:mrow><mml:msup><mml:mrow><mml:mo>(</mml:mo><mml:mfrac><mml:mrow><mml:mi>t</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mi>t</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>r</mml:mi><mml:mi>i</mml:mi><mml:mi>s</mml:mi><mml:mi>e</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub></mml:mrow></mml:mfrac><mml:mo>)</mml:mo></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mn>4</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:msup></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mn>1</mml:mn> <mml:mi/><mml:mo>+</mml:mo> <mml:mi/><mml:msup><mml:mrow><mml:mo>(</mml:mo><mml:mfrac><mml:mrow><mml:mi>t</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mi>t</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>r</mml:mi><mml:mi>i</mml:mi><mml:mi>s</mml:mi><mml:mi>e</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub></mml:mrow></mml:mfrac><mml:mo>)</mml:mo></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mn>4</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:msup></mml:mrow></mml:mfrac></mml:mrow></mml:mfenced><mml:mo>Ã</mml:mo><mml:mfenced close="]" open="[" separators="|"><mml:mrow><mml:msup><mml:mrow><mml:mi>e</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mo>-</mml:mo><mml:mfenced separators="|"><mml:mrow><mml:mfrac><mml:mrow><mml:mi>t</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mi>t</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>d</mml:mi><mml:mi>e</mml:mi><mml:mi>c</mml:mi><mml:mi>a</mml:mi><mml:mi>y</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub></mml:mrow></mml:mfrac></mml:mrow></mml:mfenced></mml:mrow></mml:msup></mml:mrow></mml:mfenced><mml:mo>Ã</mml:mo><mml:mfenced close="]" open="[" separators="|"><mml:mrow><mml:mi>c</mml:mi><mml:mi>o</mml:mi><mml:mi>s</mml:mi><mml:mo>(</mml:mo><mml:mfrac><mml:mrow><mml:mn>2</mml:mn><mml:mi>Ï</mml:mi><mml:mi>t</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mi>t</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>o</mml:mi><mml:mi>s</mml:mi><mml:mi>c</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub></mml:mrow></mml:mfrac><mml:mo>+</mml:mo><mml:mi>Ï</mml:mi><mml:mo>)</mml:mo></mml:mrow></mml:mfenced></mml:math></disp-formula></p></sec><sec id="s4-6-2"><title>Spectral analysis</title><p>Noise and flash-response power spectra were calculated using MATLABâs built-in fast Fourier transform and converted to two-sided power spectral densities with units of pA<sup>2</sup>/Hz.

A lightly edited version of the letter sent to the authors after peer review is shown, indicating the most substantive concerns; minor comments are not usually included.</p></boxed-text><p>Thank you for submitting your manuscript &quot;S cone photoreceptors in the primate retina are functionally distinct from L and M cones&quot; to <italic>eLife</italic>. The manuscript has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, and their assessments, together with those of the Reviewing Editor, form the basis of this letter.</p><p>The reviewers and Reviewing Editor think that this body of work fills a niche and that it would be of interest to the human color vision psychophysics community. However, all three reviewers had very substantial questions relating to the data, its analysis, and its presentation that would need to be addressed before we could reconsider the manuscript.</p><p>If you would like proceed with submission of a revised manuscript, we ask that you first submit a point-by-point response to the three reviews (appended here, with minor edits). This will allow both you and us to assess the feasibility of that path.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic></p><p>For over half a century, psychophysicists have gathered evidence that the time constants of the short-wave cones of the retina are longer than those of long- and middle-wave cones. So the direct measurements of primate cones now provided by Reike and colleagues are very welcome and are of great interest for understanding human perception. In principle the work is very suitable for publication in <italic>eLife</italic>. I have three primary comments:</p><p>1) The paper very much rests on the estimates of isomerization rates in the different types of cone. In paragraph one of subsection âLight stimulationâ, the authors say that they assumed an effective collecting area of 0.37 Î¼m2 â for all cones. Yet short-wave cones are reported to be smaller, and certainly, since smaller cones were deliberately selected for testing, there must be a difference in collecting area in those measured. Isn't this a problem?</p><p>2) Clinical psychophysics suggest that short-wave cones are less robust than other cones. One can imagine that time constants increase and noise levels increase for all cones the longer the interval between removal of the eye and the moment of recording. An analysis of the authors' existing records might offer a check on whether the properties of short-wave cones simply deteriorate more rapidly.</p><p>3) At the end of the Materials and methods and in the Supplementary Material, there's a long section on modelling wavelength discrimination. This detracts from the primary material and would be best excluded. There's a large literature, empirical and theoretical, on wavelength discrimination, and we know that post-receptoral effects are probably at least as important as receptoral factors. A separate modelling paper might recommend itself to the authors.</p><p>If the authors would like to show relevance to perception in the present paper, it might be more appropriate to consider something more fundamental (which goes unmentioned in the paper): the larger psychophysical Weber fraction for short-wave cones. See Wyszecki and Stiles, 2nd ed, Table 1(7.4.1).</p><p>Subsection âS cone identificationâ. Doesn't this go back to Anhelt, Kolb and Pflug, 1987?</p><p>In reference to the psychophysical literature, it might be worth citing, and considering, the rather good paper by Wisowaty and Boynton (1980), Vision Research. During that era, there were many demonstrations that sensitivity to signals originating in the short-wave cones (including time constants) are influenced by signals originating in the L and M cones.</p><p>It would be handy for the reader to have a rough conversion from isomerization rates to trolands.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>In this manuscript, the authors add their results and conclusions to an old but perplexing issue which is the comparably slow speed of the blue sensitive channel in the visual system relative to the L/M channel. Psychophysically it is well known that flicker sensitivity is slower in the blue, but it remains to be shown specifically wherein the retinal or cortical circuits the temporal fidelity is limited. This issue is attacked along many vectors in the manuscript, and overall the efforts are very solid. The noise analysed in S-cone behavior is excellent. Because the results on S-cones are few in the published records, it is a pity these authors have not done more to expound on their unique resource.</p><p>The main issues with the papers are the cursory review and presentation of their results and lack of detailed information by which to judge their data set. The authors purport to be presenting a new large data set on S cone responses and only in the supplementary figures do we see it is 28 or 18 cells. At the minimum, we must see the families of responses after those of Cao et al. and Baylor and colleagues. The exact filtering and averaging processing of the linear range responses needs to be clear and less of it would be better. It is not clear if the results shown are average linear range responses, or average modelled fits. Showing the averaged normalized linear filters is disloyal and too many steps removed from the actual data.</p><p>1) None of the data collected is in dark adapted tissues whereas most of the published comparators are dark adapted. Cannot these tissues be bathed in chromophore to reinstate a dark adapted conditions</p><p>a) The noise recordings show dark and low light responses, were and flashes or flash families recorded under these conditions?</p><p>b) Were the antibody directed S-cone recordings excluded from the summaries?</p><p>2) Show families of responses for S-cone and L vs. M cones. Do the S-cone time-to-peaks shift in a similar manner with increases in stimulus strength?</p><p>a) Was the undershoot in the recovery phase ever-present or the same size in S vs. L/M cones? (a zero line in Figure 1A, B, E and F; Figure 1âfigure supplement 2A and others would help here).</p><p>3) What were the Rmax values of the cone populations, and the variability? Were they similar with respect to spectral type?</p><p>4) Perform a phototransduction gain analysis to measure the rising phase of the S vs LM cones and ascertain whether it is the activation or inactivation phases of the responses which are driving the overall slower responses.</p><p>5) A measure of the recovery rate, or full-width at half height of the linear range responses. This information would speak to the rate of recovery of the responses as well to the variability of the populations. Integration times of the cone population responses is another important characteristic left out.</p><p>a) Did the cone recordings change in their kinetic responses over time? If so, in what direction and how much? Where the changes noted in S-cones similar to those in the M/L cone recordings?</p><p>6) In your supplementary figures show the readers the fastest S-cone and the slowest M-L cone response. What were the selection criteria applied for inclusion to the data set? What was the filtering applied to these signals? Since the s-cone sample is large why not show a group of the &quot;fastest 6&quot; and slowest 6 responses as individual traces for each spectral type of cone.</p><p>7) Cao et al. demonstrate a calcium dependent undershoot in cone responses suggesting an altered physiological status of isolated cells and tissues. If the S-cones are indeed a fragile cone then it is not a great leap to consider the isolation of these cells in the dish could have a greater impact the S-cone population. Thus, your inclusion/exclusion criteria are of import, as are judgements of the quality and duration of the recordings. Did an undershoot appear in the basal state (not dark adapted) of your recordings over time.?</p><p>8) The results of the in vitro ganglion cell recordings and the non-linear kinetic models of the cone responses here should be more carefully compared to the kinetics of the driving forces in for the SBC and P and M ganglion cells in the 2007 Field et al. paper.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic> </p><p>Baudin and colleagues measure cone photoreceptor and blue-on ganglion cell responses in an intact choroid-detached preparation of macaque monkey retina. A three channel LED stimulator is used. Responses to flashes and sinewave temporal modulation are presented. Ideal observer modelling is also presented. The data appear to have been competently collected and mostly accurately analysed following many similar and excellent productions from the Rieke lab. The main result is that under many conditions S cones lag LM cones, for example by 8.5 ms at 5000 isomerizations/s; consistent results from the periodic stimulus are shown. The S cones also show more intrinsic noise at low light levels. The cone latency difference appears swamped by synaptic circuitry on the way to blue-on ganglion cells, but the basic demonstration of delay should be of interest within the field.</p><p>There appear to be some useful observations here but the manuscript and results are so tendentiously treated and difficult to follow that one is left feeling more puzzled at the end of reading than at the beginning.</p><p>Some examples follow.</p><p>1) Abstract: &quot;Models for cone vision often assume that these three cone</p><p>11 types are functionally identical aside from differences in their spectral sensitivity.&quot; This and related statements made throughout the manuscript do not hold water. Here, for example, is an authoritative and prominent statement (last sentence of Abstract) from the leaders of the field in S cone psychophysics (Lee et al., 2009): &quot;The data imply that the S-cone signal is delayed by approximately 12 ms.â¦ we suggest that the delay arises before the S-opponent channels are constructed, possibly in the S-cones themselves.&quot; The physiological and psychophysical literature is replete with these sorts of statements. The demonstration here that S cones are under many conditions slower than M and L cones is an interesting and useful confirmation of what many (probably most) workers have assumed. Writing as if the result is a paradigm-shifter is not very helpful.</p><p>2) Figure 1C, D, other figure panels and associated text. It seems very strange to be presented with scatterplots where each point in fact shows two (?) independent (?) observations from unstated numbers of repeat (?) measurements on two different cones. Without information on how many cones were sampled in each piece of retina, and how an example of each class was (one hopes) randomly(?) selected for comparison it is all very opaque. The Materials and methods do not even tell us how many monkeys were used, how many pieces were sampled, how many pieces contribute how many points to each scatterplot. Animals could be distinguished by different symbols for example. Readers also deserve an introductory figure showing raw examples or at very least some inset traces to get a feel for the quality of the data, please.</p><p>3) The reader needs to work through to Figure 2 to find that at 1000 R*/s the S and M curves show perfect overlap. This is interesting but is not addressed squarely, and is papered over by the normalized latency plots. All the information presented to this point has been on higher intensities where there is a difference in latency, with no forward reference to intensity-dependence.</p><p>4) 1000 R*/s would correspond roughly to high mesopic (indoor lighting) levels, yes? As rods are not clamped by the three-channel stimulator the reader deserves data indicating lack of rod intrusion to the cone and ganglion cell recordings. Forgive me if I have missed something, but the manuscript seems to be written as if recordings were made from isolated cones, not cones embedded in (hopefully) intact retinal circuitry.</p><p>5) Subsection âDifferences in cone response properties shape the retinal outputâ: &quot;Directly testing this prediction is difficult due to a lack of efficiently targetable ganglion cells that receive S and LM cone signals via identical pathways.&quot; This statement is very strange: the retina is the retina, not a computer chip. The following descriptions and analysis in this section is circumlocutory. The ganglion cell S cone kinetics appear faster than the ML cone kinetics, this result is not consistent with previous reports from retina (macaque) or LGN (macaque, marmoset). The discrepancy needs to be addressed squarely please and the latency measures presented.</p><p>6) The ideal observer analysis is not even mentioned in the results and seems quite disconnected from the data.</p><p>7) Many passages are presented with only reference to figure parts and no numerical support in the text. Paras L57ff and L179ff are glaring example but there are many others.</p><p>8) For the authors consideration. The delay should be manifest as phase shift in the Fourier transformed data, yes? The analysis appears to take only amplitude spectra.</p><p>9) Subsection &quot;Noise in S cones is unique from that in LM cones&quot; [meaning unclear].</p><p>10) Regarding n=18 cones, I make out only 14 data points in the scatterplot in Figure 1âfigure supplement 2, perhaps there were some piece(s?) where an S cone but no M/L cone was measured.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.39166.020</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p>Reviewer #1:</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>For over half a century, psychophysicists have gathered evidence that the time constants of the short-wave cones of the retina are longer than those of long- and middle-wave cones.

Isn't this a problem?</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for highlighting this issue. Collecting areas could indeed differ for S vs L/M cones, but we believe that such differences are unlikely to account for our results for several reasons. First, the differences in collecting area are expected to be relatively small. S cone responses at 50,000 R*/s are slower than those of L/M cones at 5,000 R*/s; hence, to account for our results, collecting areas would need to differ at least than 10-fold. Second, the difference in cone collecting areas is expected to be small in the fovea (Anhelt et al., 1987), but the differences in S vs L/M cone kinetics persists in foveal cones. Third, focusing of light through the inner segment does not appear to make a large contribution to the collecting area in our preparations â i.e. collecting areas estimated for light that traverses or does not traverse the cone inner segment were similar (as now noted in the Materials and methods). We have added a discussion of the potential difference in collecting area and why we think it does not have a large impact on interpretation of our results (subsection âLight stimulationâ).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Clinical psychophysics suggest that short-wave cones are less robust than other cones.

Our recordings were made from 2 to 15 hours after collecting the retinas. We have compared kinetics across this time period and find that the difference in S vs L/M kinetics persists in different time windows throughout this range (i.e. 2-6 hours, 6-10 hours, 10-15 hours). Overall, we see at most small differences in the kinetics of cone responses or in noise over time, although we only test cones that have maximal responses that meet our criteria for inclusion. We have added information about the consistency of the slower S cone responses over time as part of new âCell-selection criteriaâ section in Materials and methods.</p><p>One aspect of the cone responses that can change (particularly decline) over time is the maximal light response (and hence the proportion of recorded cells from which we collect data). However, we use the response amplitude to select cells to record from, with the aim of selecting against cells with small, potentially abnormal, light responses. The assumption underlying this selection is that the largest responses we observe most closely resemble those in vivo, and have added this assumption to the Materials and methods.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) At the end of the Materials and methods and in the Supplementary Material, there's a long section on modelling wavelength discrimination.

We have added example cells throughout the paper. This includes: (1) a new Figure 1 showing all recorded flash responses from peripheral cones; (2) example L, M and S cones in Figure 3; and, (3) adding example L, M and S cone responses to noise stimuli and showing filters from all recorded cells in Figure 4.</p><p>The displayed traces are minimally filtered; we record the original data with a 3 kHz bandwidth and do not apply any additional filtering to the displayed traces, except that responses to noise stimuli in Figure 4A. We have clarified this in the Materials and methods. All of the traces shown are averaged recorded responses rather than model fits; the linear filters in Figure 4 (previously Figure 1âfigure supplement 2) are computed directly from measured responses to Gaussian-noise stimuli. We have added information about the number of recorded cells for each experiment in the main text, including the total number of recorded cells of each type (subsection âCell-selection criteriaâ).</p><p>Because our recordings are quite short in duration (3-5 minutes maximum), we do not record full flash families.

After isolating the eyecup, we dark-adapt the retina attached to the pigment epithelium for a period of at least 1 hour before starting to record. This is sufficient time to achieve complete dark adaptation, as indicated by the ability to measure single photon responses from rods and downstream retinal ganglion cells (e.g. Ala-Laurila and Rieke, 2014). We initiate our cone recordings from darkness and then measure responses at different background luminances. We chose to emphasize cone responses in the presence of a background rather than from darkness both to saturate rods (see reviewer 3 point 4) and to more closely replicate the operation of cones under photopic conditions. Following a successful recording from a peripheral cone, we move to a location on the retina that was outside the region exposed to light before attempting another recording; this ensures that all recorded cells are fully dark adapted at the start of the recording. Given the small size of the fovea we were limited to fewer new regions after recording from a foveal cone. We have clarified these issues in the Materials and methods.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>a) The noise recordings show dark and low light responses, were and flashes or flash families recorded under these conditions?</p></disp-quote><p>Noise recordings were based on light steps (3 seconds) from darkness to different background luminance. We have added a description of the exact stimulus protocol to the Materials and methods. We also recorded flash responses at each background at which noise was measured in a subset of the cells. We did not record full flash families because of the time required to make noise measurements and the short duration over which we could be confident that the light response was stable.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>b) Were the antibody directed S-cone recordings excluded from the summaries?</p></disp-quote><p>None of the data reported is from cells targeted with antibodies.

We did record families to a few contrasts in some cases. An example flash family (over a limited range of contrasts) and analysis of the dependence of the time-to-peak on flash strength are shown below; we opted not to include this figure in the paper, but are happy to do so if the reviewer feels that it is important.

We started by comparing the rising and recovery phases of the responses. To do so, we scaled the responses to a time-to-peak of one and a peak amplitude of one (Figure 2âfigure supplement 2). With this scaling, the response shapes were quite similar. This indicates that the slowing of the S cone response is not restricted to the rising or recovery phases, which we now note in the Results (subsection âS-cone responses are slower than those of L- and M- conesâ, fifth paragraph) and in the Discussion (subsection âPossible mechanistic origins of differences in cone signalsâ, second paragraph).

This is clear from the (new) Figure 2âfigure supplement 2, which shows that the responses across cone types superimpose closely when their time axes are normalized. We also added results from the full-width-at-half-max analysis to Figure 2C and D and the main text (subsection âS-cone responses are slower than those of L- and M- conesâ, second paragraph).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>a) Did the cone recordings change in their kinetic responses over time? If so, in what direction and how much?

Stability of kinetics is one of the criteria we used to determine the duration of a recording (we can maintain a good recording from a cell for much longer than 3-4 minutes, but the responses clearly start to change after ~5 min). We have added this information to the Materials and methods in describing the recordings and selection criteria. Also see reviewer 1 point 2 on stability of cone responses at various times after isolation of the retina.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) In your supplementary figures show the readers the fastest S-cone and the slowest M-L cone response. What were the selection criteria applied for inclusion to the data set? What was the filtering applied to these signals? Since the s-cone sample is large why not show a group of the &quot;fastest 6&quot; and slowest 6 responses as individual traces for each spectral type of cone.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate the push to show less derived responses, and considered several possibilities for how to do this. We decided that, rather than show a selection of responses, it was better show all the recorded cells in Figures 1 and 4. We felt that this gave an immediate sense of the full data set and the degree of consistency of the responses across cells of a given type.</p><p>The selection criteria used for inclusion of data was based on response amplitudes to light flashes at the start of every recording. All cells included in analysis of voltage clamp data had maximal light responses &gt;100 pA, and nearly all cells included in analysis of current clamp data had responses of &gt;10 mV, with 15 mV more typically. Occasionally we retained a cell with a smaller response if the noise was low and sensitivity was otherwise good. We have added a section to the Materials and methods detailing these response criteria. The same criteria were used across cone types.</p><p>We filtered the responses during recording at 3 kHz, but did not perform any filtering of flash responses post-recording. Linear filters in Figure 4 were filtered at 60 Hz. We have clarified these issues in the Materials and methods.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7) Cao et al. demonstrate a calcium dependent undershoot in cone responses suggesting an altered physiological status of isolated cells and tissues. If the S-cones are indeed a fragile cone then it is not a great leap to consider the isolation of these cells in the dish could have a greater impact the S-cone population. Thus, your inclusion/exclusion criteria are of import, as are judgements of the quality and duration of the recordings. Did an undershoot appear in the basal state (not dark adapted) of your recordings over time.?</p></disp-quote><p>This is an important concern and we have now included several analyses to compare the susceptibility of S cone kinetics and amplitude vs L/M cones over time. First, in response to reviewer 1 point 2, we have included an analysis of response kinetics and amplitude of all our cone recordings as a function of time of recording after collecting the retina (Materials and methods, subsection âCell-selection criteriaâ). This analysis shows that the difference in kinetics is present during our earliest recordings. Second, as mentioned above, we now show responses from all peripheral cones in which we recorded flash responses in Figure 1 so the reader can judge the consistency of the responses. We also added a section to the Materials and methods describing our cell selection criteria.</p><p>The extracellular calcium concentration of 1.15 mM used in this study is similar to that of Cao et al., 2014 (1.2 mM). The cone responses are largely in accordance with Cao et al., 2014 in that they have only a small undershoot. We never observed undershoots as pronounced as those shown in a few cells in Cao et al., 2014 or those from earlier primate cone recordings. As mentioned above, we do not observe any systematic difference in this undershoot across cone types (see Figure 2âfigure supplement 2).</p><p>All the recordings in our study were performed in an intact whole mount retina where the photoreceptor array and the underlying retinal circuits are preserved as much as possible. A retinal region that had L/M cones with good light sensitivity also contained S cones that had good light sensitivity â and similarly poor L/M cone responses were predictive of poor S cone responses. To control for systematic differences in the health of the retina from which recordings were made, we referenced all recorded S cones to nearby L/M cones (Figure 2E, F; Figure 4C)</p><p><italic>8) The results of the</italic> in vitro <italic>ganglion cell recordings and the non-linear kinetic models of the cone responses here should be more carefully compared to the kinetics of the driving forces in for the SBC and P and M ganglion cells in the 2007 Field et al. paper.</italic> </p><p>In our recordings, the time to peak of the S cone-mediated response at 1000 R*/s is ~40 ms and the time to peak of the L/M response is ~55 ms. Field et al., 2007, report a time to peak for the S cone response of just over 50 ms, and a time to peak of the L+M response of 70 ms; light levels in their experiments were comparable to our low-light condition (i.e. 1000 R*/s). The parasol responses in that study are also somewhat slower to peak than ours. Most importantly, Field et al. observe considerably slower L+M responses than S responses (70 vs 50 ms), and this is consistent with the extra synapse required for the L+M responses. We note this comparison now in subsection âDifferences in cone response properties shape the retinal outputâ, paragraph four. We have also added the absolute numbers for the time to peak of the S and LM SBC filters to the text.</p><p>Reviewer #3:</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Baudin and colleagues measure cone photoreceptor and blue-on ganglion cell responses in an intact choroid-detached preparation of macaque monkey retina. A three channel LED stimulator is used. Responses to flashes and sinewave temporal modulation are presented. Ideal observer modelling is also presented. The data appear to have been competently collected and mostly accurately analysed following many similar and excellent productions from the Rieke lab. The main result is that under many conditions S cones lag LM cones, for example by 8.5 ms at 5000 isomerizations/s; consistent results from the periodic stimulus are shown. The S cones also show more intrinsic noise at low light levels. The cone latency difference appears swamped by synaptic circuitry on the way to blue-on ganglion cells, but the basic demonstration of delay should be of interest within the field.</p><p>There appear to be some useful observations here but the manuscript and results are so tendentiously treated and difficult to follow that one is left feeling more puzzled at the end of reading than at the beginning.</p><p>Some examples follow.</p><p>1) Abstract: &quot;Models for cone vision often assume that these three cone</p><p>11 types are functionally identical aside from differences in their spectral sensitivity.&quot; This and related statements made throughout the manuscript do not hold water. Here, for example, is an authoritative and prominent statement (last sentence of Abstract) from the leaders of the field in S cone psychophysics (Lee et al., 2009): &quot;The data imply that the S-cone signal is delayed by approximately 12 ms.â¦ we suggest that the delay arises before the S-opponent channels are constructed, possibly in the S-cones themselves.&quot; The physiological and psychophysical literature is replete with these sorts of statements. The demonstration here that S cones are under many conditions slower than M and L cones is an interesting and useful confirmation of what many (probably most) workers have assumed. Writing as if the result is a paradigm-shifter is not very helpful.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for the constructive feedback. We have replaced the statement about functional similarity of cones with a short summary of the physiological and psychophysical literature (first paragraph of the Introduction). This paragraph mentions previous studies that demonstrated differences or delays in S cone vs L/M signals in the retina (Field et al., 2007), LGN (Tailby et al., 2008) and visual cortex (Cottaris and De Valois, 1998). In addition, we mention S cone psychophysical studies that have observed slower responses to S cone isolating stimuli (Lee et al., 2009; Smithson and Mollon 2004; Shinomori and Werner 2008; Stromeyer et al., 1991). As the reviewer points out, and as mentioned in the above reference (Lee et al. 2009), although the delay in S cone signals was hypothesized to originate in the S cones, previous recordings from S cones have not revealed a clear difference in kinetics (Schnapf et al., 1990). We also return to the issue of the relation of our findings with psychophysics in the Discussion. We hope that these changes provide a fairer and more complete treatment of how our work fits in with previous findings.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Figure 1 C, D, other figure panels and associated text. It seems very strange to be presented with scatterplots where each point in fact shows two (?) independent (?) observations from unstated numbers of repeat (?) measurements on two different cones. Without information on how many cones were sampled in each piece of retina, and how an example of each class was (one hopes) randomly(?) selected for comparison it is all very opaque. The Materials and methods do not even tell us how many monkeys were used, how many pieces were sampled, how many pieces contribute how many points to each scatterplot. Animals could be distinguished by different symbols for example. Readers also deserve an introductory figure showing raw examples or at very least some inset traces to get a feel for the quality of the data, please.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you â our description of those plots was not sufficiently clear. To help control for possible bias in comparing S vs L/M cone responses across retinas, we chose to compare the mean time to peak of S cones from a single piece of retina to the mean time to peak of L and M cones in the same retinal piece. Each point in the scatter plots reflects these mean times to peak; no selection was made of which cells to include, except the general cell-selection criteria mentioned now in the Materials and methods (which focus on response amplitude). We have revised the text to clarify this comparison. We have also included details about the number of retinal pieces from which data was collected (&gt;10 for most data; mentioned in the figure legend) as well as the total number of cells that contribute to each panel. The Materials and methods now include information about the total number of recorded cells across experiments and the minimum number of animals.</p><p>The suggestion of an introductory figure that orients a reader to the data is a very good one. We followed this by adding a figure (Figure 1) that shows flash responses from each measured cone along with averages across the lighting conditions studied.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) The reader needs to work through to Figure 2 to find that at 1000 R*/s the S and M curves show perfect overlap. This is interesting but is not addressed squarely, and is papered over by the normalized latency plots. All the information presented to this point has been on higher intensities where there is a difference in latency, with no forward reference to intensity-dependence.</p></disp-quote><p>That is a good point. We now start the paper with a new figure (following the suggestion above) that provides a complete view of the flash response data set (Figure 1). This figure includes averages from different cone types at each mean light level, and averages within a cone type across light levels. This allows us to anticipate the difference in kinetics and the greater dependence of kinetics of LM cone responses on background (subsection âS-cone responses are slower than those of L- and M- conesâ). We refer back to this figure to directly note the similarity of the kinetics across cone types at 1,000 R*/cone/s.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) 1000 R*/s would correspond roughly to high mesopic (indoor lighting) levels, yes? As rods are not clamped by the three-channel stimulator the reader deserves data indicating lack of rod intrusion to the cone and ganglion cell recordings. Forgive me if I have missed something, but the manuscript seems to be written as if recordings were made from isolated cones, not cones embedded in (hopefully) intact retinal circuitry.</p></disp-quote><p>Experiments for a separate project specifically on mesopic conditions indicate that the upper end of mesopic vision is closer to 300-500 R*/s, at least under our experimental conditions. This conclusion comes from direct measurements in rods and spectral measurements in RGCs. We now specifically mention this conclusion and reference the paper (Grimes et al., <italic>eLife</italic>, 2018) that it is based on in the Materials and methods. We have also clarified that all of the recordings in the paper were made from cones in intact retinas rather than from isolated cones.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) Subsection âDifferences in cone response properties shape the retinal outputâ: &quot;Directly testing this prediction is difficult due to a lack of efficiently targetable ganglion cells that receive S and LM cone signals via identical pathways.&quot; This statement is very strange: the retina is the retina, not a computer chip. The following descriptions and analysis in this section is circumlocutory. The ganglion cell S cone kinetics appear faster than the ML cone kinetics, this result is not consistent with previous reports from retina (macaque) or LGN (macaque, marmoset). The discrepancy needs to be addressed squarely please and the latency measures presented.</p></disp-quote><p>As mentioned by the reviewer, latencies to cone isolating stimuli have been measured at several stages of the visual pathway i.e. in the retina, LGN and visual cortex. In the retina, faster S cone kinetics compared to L/M cone kinetics have been seen previously in small bistratified ganglion cells at comparable light levels (Field et al., 2007). This has been attributed to L/M cone signals traversing an additional synapse on their way to SBCs. This is why we refrained from a direct comparison of the kinetics. Therefore, we compared another distinguishing feature of the S cone signals -- the weak dependence of S cone response kinetics on background compared to that of LM cones. This is what we tested in the SBC ganglion cells and not the absolute kinetic differences. We have revised the introduction to the section on SBCs to help clarify these issues (subsection âDifferences in cone response properties shape the retinal outputâ), and mention the similarity of the absolute kinetics of the responses we observe to those measured previously at comparable light levels (paragraph four).</p><p>Previous work at higher light levels did not see the difference in kinetics of S vs LM responses that we observe and reported in Field et al., 2007. This is consistent with our observations that the difference in kinetics decreases with increasing light level.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) The ideal observer analysis is not even mentioned in the results and seems quite disconnected from the data.</p></disp-quote><p>We removed this analysis from the paper based on this comment and similar concerns from the first reviewer.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7) Many passages are presented with only reference to figure parts and no numerical support in the text. Paras L57ff and L179ff are glaring example but there are many others.</p><p>8) For the authors consideration. The delay should be manifest as phase shift in the Fourier transformed data, yes? The analysis appears to take only amplitude spectra.</p></disp-quote><p>We originally relegated most of the statistical analyses to the figure captions in the original paper. We have added statistics for key points to the main text (see Results section).</p><p>Thank you â we looked at the phase spectra but found them difficult to interpret. This may in part be because the difference in kinetics is not a straight delay but a slowing of the entire response (see new Figure 2âfigure supplement 2 which normalizes the time-to-peak). Because the phase plots were difficult to interpret we have not included them in the paper, but they are below in case the reviewer is interested or sees something in them that we missed.
