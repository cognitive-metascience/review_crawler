We have characterized the structure and function of a new member of the ferritin superfamily that is sequestered within an encapsulin capsid. We show that this encapsulated ferritin (EncFtn) has two main alpha helices, which assemble in a metal dependent manner to form a ferroxidase center at a dimer interface. EncFtn adopts an open decameric structure that is topologically distinct from other ferritins. While EncFtn acts as a ferroxidase, it cannot mineralize iron. Conversely, the encapsulin shell associates with iron, but is not enzymatically active, and we demonstrate that EncFtn must be housed within the encapsulin for iron storage. This encapsulin nanocompartment is widely distributed in bacteria and archaea and represents a distinct class of iron storage system, where the oxidation and mineralization of iron are distributed between two proteins.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.18972.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.18972.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.18972.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Iron is essential for life as it is a key component of many different enzymes that participate in processes such as energy production and metabolism. However, iron can also be highly toxic to cells because it readily reacts with oxygen. This reaction can damage DNA, proteins and the membranes that surround cells.</p><p>To balance the cell’s need for iron against its potential damaging effects, organisms have evolved iron storage proteins known as ferritins that form cage-like structures. The ferritins convert iron into a less reactive form that is mineralised and safely stored in the central cavity of the ferritin cage and is available for cells when they need it.</p><p>Recently, a new family of ferritins known as encapsulated ferritins have been found in some microorganisms. These ferritins are found in bacterial genomes with a gene that codes for a protein cage called an encapsulin. Although the structure of the encapsulin cage is known to look like the shell of a virus, the structure that the encapsulated ferritin itself forms is not known. It is also not clear how encapsulin and the encapsulated ferritin work together to store iron.</p><p>He et al. have now used the techniques of X-ray crystallography and mass spectrometry to determine the structure of the encapsulated ferritin found in some bacteria. The encapsulated ferritin forms a ring-shaped doughnut in which ten subunits of ferritin are arranged in a ring; this is totally different from the enclosed cages that other ferritins form.</p><p>Biochemical studies revealed that the encapsulated ferritin is able to convert iron into a less reactive form, but it cannot store iron on its own since it does not form a cage. Thus, the encapsulated ferritin needs to be housed within the encapsulin cage to store iron.</p><p>Further work is needed to investigate how iron moves into the encapsulin cage to reach the ferritin proteins. Some organisms have both standard ferritin cages and encapsulated ferritins; why this is the case also remains to be discovered.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.18972.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.18972.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>encapsulin</kwd><kwd>encapsulated ferritin</kwd><kwd>ferritin</kwd><kwd>Rhodospirillum rubrum</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd>Other</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004543</institution-id><institution>China Scholarship Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>He</surname><given-names>Didi</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000848</institution-id><institution>University Of Edinburgh</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Hughes</surname><given-names>Sam</given-names></name><name><surname>Altenbach</surname><given-names>Kirsten</given-names></name><name><surname>Clarke</surname><given-names>David J</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100004440</institution-id><institution>Wellcome Trust</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>098375/Z/12/Z</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name> <surname>Tarrant</surname><given-names>Emma</given-names></name><name><surname>Waldron</surname><given-names>Kevin J</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000268</institution-id><institution>Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>BB/N005570/1</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Clarke</surname><given-names>David J</given-names></name><name><surname>Marles-Wright</surname><given-names>Jon</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000288</institution-id><institution>Royal Society</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>RG130585</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Marles-Wright</surname><given-names>Jon</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Encapsulin-associated ferritin proteins form metal-dependent decamers that are active as ferroxidase enzymes, but require encapsulation to form an iron store.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Encapsulin nanocompartments are a family of proteinaceous metabolic compartments that are widely distributed in bacteria and archaea (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Sutter et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Akita et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">McHugh et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Contreras et al., 2014</xref>). They share a common architecture, comprising an icosahedral shell formed by the oligomeric assembly of a protein, encapsulin, that is structurally related to the HK97 bacteriophage capsid protein gp5 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Helgstrand et al., 2003</xref>). Gp5 is known to assemble as a 66 nm diameter icosahedral shell of 420 subunits. In contrast, both the <italic>Pyrococcus furiosus</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Akita et al., 2007</xref>) and <italic>Myxococcus xanthus</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">McHugh et al., 2014</xref>) encapsulin shell-proteins form 32 nm icosahedra with 180 subunits; while the <italic>Thermotoga maritima</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Sutter et al., 2008</xref>) encapsulin is smaller still with a 25 nm, 60-subunit icosahedron. The high structural similarity of the encapsulin shell-proteins to gp5 suggests a common evolutionary origin for these proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">McHugh et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>The genes encoding encapsulin proteins are found downstream of genes for dye-dependent peroxidase (DyP) family enzymes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Roberts et al., 2011</xref>), or encapsulin-associated ferritins (EncFtn) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">He and Marles-Wright, 2015</xref>). Enzymes in the DyP family are active against polyphenolic compounds such as azo dyes and lignin breakdown products; although their physiological function and natural substrates are not known (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Roberts et al., 2011</xref>). Ferritin family proteins are found in all kingdoms and have a wide range of activities, including ribonucleotide reductase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Aberg et al., 1993</xref>), protecting DNA from oxidative damage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Grant et al., 1998</xref>), and iron storage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Bradley et al., 2014</xref>). The classical iron storage ferritin nanocages are found in all kingdoms and are essential in eukaryotes; they play a central role in iron homeostasis, where they protect the cell from toxic free Fe<sup>2+</sup> by oxidizing it and storing the resulting Fe<sup>3+</sup> as ferrihydrite minerals within their central cavity.</p><p>The encapsulin-associated enzymes are sequestered within the icosahedral shell through interactions between the shell’s inner surface and a short localization sequence (Gly-Ser-Leu-Lys) appended to their C-termini (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Sutter et al., 2008</xref>). This motif is well-conserved, and the addition of this sequence to heterologous proteins is sufficient to direct them to the interior of encapsulins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Rurup et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Cassidy-Amstutz et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>A recent study of the <italic>Myxococcus xanthus</italic> encapsulin showed that it sequesters a number of different EncFtn proteins and acts as an ‘iron-megastore’ to protect these bacteria from oxidative stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">McHugh et al., 2014</xref>). At 32 nm in diameter, it is much larger than other members of the ferritin superfamily, such as the 12 nm 24-subunit classical ferritin nanocage and the 8 nm 12-subunit Dps (DNA-binding protein from starved cells) complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Grant et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Andrews, 2010</xref>); and is thus capable of sequestering up to ten times more iron than these ferritins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">McHugh et al., 2014</xref>). The primary sequences of EncFtn proteins have Glu-X-X-His metal coordination sites, which are shared features of the ferritin family proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Andrews, 2010</xref>). Secondary structure prediction identifies two major α-helical regions in these proteins; this is in contrast to other members of the ferritin superfamily, which have four major α-helices (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Supplementary file 1</xref>). The ‘half-ferritin’ primary sequence of the EncFtn family and their association with encapsulin nanocompartments suggests a distinct biochemical and structural organization to other ferritin family proteins. The <italic>Rhodospirillum rubrum</italic> EncFtn protein (Rru_A0973) shares 33% protein sequence identity with the <italic>M. xanthus</italic> (MXAN_4464), 53% with the <italic>T. maritima</italic> (Tmari_0787), and 29% with the <italic>P. furiosus</italic> (PF1192) homologues. The GXXH motifs are strictly conserved in each of these species (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Supplementary file 1</xref>).</p><p>Here we investigate the structure and biochemistry of EncFtn in order to understand iron storage within the encapsulin nanocompartment. We have produced recombinant encapsulin (Enc) and EncFtn from the aquatic purple-sulfur bacterium <italic>R. rubrum</italic>, which serves as a model organism for the study of the control of the bacterial nitrogen fixation machinery (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Pope et al., 1985</xref>), in <italic>Escherichia coli</italic>. Analysis by transmission electron microscopy (TEM) indicates that their co-expression leads to the production of an icosahedral nanocompartment with encapsulated EncFtn. The crystal structure of a truncated hexahistidine-tagged variant of the EncFtn protein (EncFtn<sub>sH</sub>) shows that it forms a decameric structure with an annular ‘ring-doughnut’ topology, which is distinct from the four-helical bundles of the 24meric ferritins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Lawson et al., 1991</xref>) and dodecahedral DPS proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Grant et al., 1998</xref>). We identify a symmetrical iron bound ferroxidase center (FOC) formed between subunits in the decamer and additional metal-binding sites close to the center of the ring and on the outer surface. We also demonstrate the metal-dependent assembly of EncFtn decamers using native PAGE, analytical gel-filtration, and native mass spectrometry. Biochemical assays show that EncFtn is active as a ferroxidase enzyme. Through site-directed mutagenesis we show that the conserved glutamic acid and histidine residues in the FOC influence protein assembly and activity. We use our combined structural and biochemical data to propose a model for the EncFtn-catalyzed sequestration of iron within the encapsulin shell.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Assembly of <italic>R. rubrum</italic> EncFtn encapsulin nanocompartments in E. coli</title><p>We produced recombinant <italic>R. rubrum</italic> encapsulin nanocompartments in <italic>E. coli</italic> by co-expression of the encapsulin (Rru_A0974) and EncFtn (Rru_A0973) proteins, and purified these by sucrose gradient ultra-centrifugation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Sutter et al., 2008</xref>).

In both cases the elution profile from size-exclusion chromatography (SEC) displayed two peaks (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). SDS-PAGE analysis of fractions from these peaks showed that the high molecular weight peak was partially resistant to SDS and heat-induced denaturation; in contrast, the low molecular weight peak was consistent with monomeric mass of 13 kDa (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). MALDI peptide mass fingerprinting of these bands confirmed the identity of both as EncFtn. Inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) analysis of the SEC fractions showed 100 times more iron in the oligomeric fraction than the monomer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>, blue scatter points; <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>), suggesting that EncFtn oligomerization is associated with iron binding. In order to determine the iron-loading stoichiometry in the EncFtn complex, further ICP-MS experiments were performed using selenomethionine (SeMet)-labelled protein EncFtn (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>).

Size-exclusion chromatography with multi-angle laser light scattering (SEC-MALLS) analysis of samples taken from each peak gave calculated molecular weights consistent with a decamer for the high molecular weight peak and a monomer for the low molecular weight peak (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl2">Table 2</xref>).<fig id="fig2" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.18972.005</object-id><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Purification of recombinant <italic>R. rubrum</italic> EncFtn<sub>sH</sub>.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Recombinant SeMet-labeled EncFtn<sub>sH</sub> produced with 1 mM Fe(NH<sub>4)2</sub>(SO<sub>4</sub>)<sub>2</sub> in the growth medium was purified by nickel affinity chromatography and size-exclusion chromatography using a Superdex 200 16/60 column (GE Healthcare).

Inspection of this map showed two 10-sigma peaks between residues Glu32, Glu62 and His65 of two adjacent chains, and a statistically smaller 5-sigma peak between residues Glu31 and Glu34 of the two chains. Modeling metal ions into these peaks and refinement of the anomalous scattering parameters allowed us to identify these as two iron ions and a calcium ion respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>). An additional region of asymmetric electron density near the di-iron binding site in the mFo-DFc map was modeled as glycolic acid, presumably a breakdown product of the PEG 3350 used for crystallization.

The fact that the protein does not multimerize in solution in the presence of Fe<sup>3+</sup> may indicate that these metal binding sites have a lower affinity for the ferric form of iron, which is the product of the ferroxidase reaction.

As described above, by recombinant production of EncFtn<sub>sH</sub> in minimal media we were able to limit the bioavailability of iron. Native MS analysis of EncFtn<sub>sH</sub> produced in this way displayed a charge state distribution consistent with an EncFtn<sub>sH</sub> monomer (blue circles, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A1</xref>) with an average neutral mass of 13,194 Da, in agreement with the predicted mass of the EncFtn<sub>sH</sub> protein (13,194.53 Da). Under these conditions, no significant higher order assembly was observed and the protein did not have any coordinated metal ions. Titration with Fe<sup>2+</sup> directly before native MS analysis resulted in the appearance of a new charge state distribution, consistent with an EncFtn<sub>sH</sub> decameric assembly (+22 to +26; 132.65 kDa) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A2/3</xref>). After instrument optimization, the mass resolving power achieved was sufficient to assign iron-loading in the complex to between 10 and 15 Fe ions per decamer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>, inset top right), consistent with the presence of 10 irons in the FOC and the coordination of iron in the Glu31/34-site occupied by calcium in the crystal structure (<italic>Δ</italic>mass observed ~0.67 kDa). MS analysis of EncFtn<sub>sH</sub> after addition of further Fe<sup>2+</sup> did not result in iron loading above this stoichiometry. Therefore, the extent of iron binding seen is limited to the FOC and Glu31/34 secondary metal binding site. These data suggest that the decameric assembly of EncFtn<sub>sH</sub> does not accrue iron in the same manner as classical ferritin, which is able to sequester around 4500 iron ions within its nanocage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Mann et al., 1986</xref>). Ion mobility analysis of the EncFtn<sub>sH</sub> decameric assembly, collected with minimal collisional activation, suggested that it consists of a single conformation with a collision cross section (CCS) of 58.2 nm<sup>2</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>). This observation is in agreement with the calculated CCS of 58.7 nm<sup>2</sup>derived from our crystal structure of the EncFtn<sub>sH</sub> decamer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Marklund, 2015</xref>). By contrast, IM-MS measurements of the monomeric EncFtn<sub>sH</sub> at pH 8.0 under the same instrumental conditions revealed that the metal-free protein monomer exists in a wide range of charge states (+6 to +16) and adopts many conformations in the gas phase with collision cross sections ranging from 12 nm<sup>2</sup> to 26 nm<sup>2</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1</xref>). These observations are indicative of an unstructured protein with little secondary or tertiary structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Beveridge et al., 2014</xref>). Thus, IM-MS studies highlight that higher order structure in EncFtn<sub>sH</sub> is mediated/stabilized by metal binding, an observation that is in agreement with our solution studies. Taken together, these results suggest that di-iron binding, forming the FOC in EncFtn<sub>sH</sub>, is required to stabilize the 4-helix bundle dimer interface, essentially reconstructing the classical ferritin-like fold; once stabilized, these dimers readily associate as pentamers, and the overall assembly adopts the decameric ring arrangement observed in the crystal structure.<fig-group><fig id="fig7" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.18972.018</object-id><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><title>Native mass spectrometry and ion mobility analysis of iron loading in EncFtn<sub>sH</sub>.</title><p>All spectra were acquired in 100 mM ammonium acetate, pH 8.0 with a protein concentration of 5 µM.

The resulting CID mass spectrum (<bold>A</bold>) revealed that dissociation of the holo- EncFtn<sub>sH</sub> decamer primarily occurred via ejection of a highly charged monomer (blue circles), leaving the ‘stripped’ complex (a 9mer; 118.7 kDa; yellow circles). The mass of the ejected-monomer is consistent with apo- EncFtn<sub>sH</sub> (13.2 kDa), suggesting unfolding of the monomer (and loss of Fe) occurs during ejection from the complex. This observation of asymmetric charge partitioning of the sub-complexes with respect to the mass of the complex is consistent with the 'typical' pathway of dissociation of protein assemblies by CID, as described by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Hall et al. (2013)</xref>. In addition, a third, lower abundance, charge state distribution is observed which overlaps the EncFtn ejected monomer charge state distribution; this region of the spectrum is highlighted in (<bold>B</bold>). This distribution is consistent with an ejected EncFtn<sub>sH</sub> dimer (orange circles). Interestingly, closer analysis of the individual charge state of this dimeric CID product shows that this sub-complex exists in three forms – displaying mass consistent with an EncFtn<sub>sH</sub> dimer binding 0, 1, and 2 Fe ions. This is highlighted in (<bold>C</bold>), where the 15+ charge state of the EncFtn<sub>sH</sub> dimer is shown; 3 peaks are observed with <italic>m/z</italic> 1760.5, 1763.8, and 1767.0 Th – the lowest peak corresponds to neutral masses of 26392.5 Da [predicted EncFtn<sub>sH</sub> dimer, (C<sub>572</sub>H<sub>884</sub>N<sub>172</sub>O<sub>185</sub>S<sub>2</sub>)<sub>2</sub>; 26388.6 Da]. The two further peaks have a delta-mass of ~+50 Da, consistent with Fe binding. We interpret these observations as partial ‘atypical’ CID fragmentation of the decameric complex – i.e. fragmentation of the initial complex with retention of subunit and ligand interactions. A schematic summary of these results is displayed in (<bold>D</bold>). We postulate the high stability of this iron-bound dimer sub-complex is due to the metal coordination at the dimer interface, increasing the strength of the dimer interface.

For EncFtn<sub>sH</sub>, this atypical dissociation pathway was clearly evident; CID of the EncFtn<sub>sH</sub> decamer resulted in the appearance of a dimeric EncFtn<sub>sH</sub> subcomplex containing 0, 1, or 2 iron ions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s2">Figure 7—figure supplement 2</xref>). In light of the crystal structure, this observation can be rationalized as dissociation of the EncFtn<sub>sH</sub> decamer by disruption of the non-FOC interface with at least partial retention of the FOC interface and the FOC-Fe. Thus, this observation supports our crystallographic assignment of the overall topology of the EncFtn<sub>sH</sub> assembly as a pentameric assembly of dimers with two iron ions located at the FOC dimer interface. In addition, this analysis provides evidence that the overall architecture of the complex is consistent in the crystal, solution and gas phases.</p></sec><sec id="s2-6"><title>Ferroxidase activity</title><p>In light of the identification of an iron-loaded FOC in the crystal structure of EncFtn and our native mass spectrometry data, we performed ferroxidase and peroxidase assays to demonstrate the catalytic activity of this protein.

Negative stain TEM of these samples revealed that upon addition of iron, the EncFtn<sub>sH </sub>protein showed significant aggregation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s1">Figure 8—figure supplement 1F</xref>); while the encapsulin, EncFtn-Enc system, and apoferritin are present as distinct nanocompartments without significant protein aggregation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s1">Figure 8—figure supplement 1G–I</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-7"><title>Iron storage in encapsulin nanocompartments</title><p>The results of the ferroxidase assay and micrographs of the reaction products suggest that the oxidation and mineralization function of the classical ferritins are split between the EncFtn and encapsulin proteins, with the EncFtn acting as a ferroxidase and the encapsulin shell providing an environment and template for iron mineralization and storage. To investigate this further, we added Fe<sup>2+</sup> at various concentrations to samples of apo-ferritin, EncFtn, isolated encapsulin, and the EncFtn-Enc protein complex, and subjected these samples to a ferrozine assay to quantify the amount of iron associated with the proteins after three hours of incubation. The maximum iron loading capacity of these systems was calculated as the quantity of iron per biological assembly (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8C</xref>). In this assay, the EncFtn<sub>sH </sub>decamer binds a maximum of around 48 iron ions before excess iron induces protein precipitation. The encapsulin shell protein can sequester about 2200 iron ions before significant protein loss occurs, and the reconstituted EncFtn-Enc nanocompartment sequestered about 4150 iron ions. This latter result is significantly more than the apoferritin used in our assay, which sequesters approximately 570 iron ions in this assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8C</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl5">Table 5</xref>).</p><p>Consideration of the functional oligomeric states of these proteins, where EncFtn is a decamer and encapsulin forms an icosahedral cage, and estimation of the iron loading capacity of these complexes gives insight into the role of the two proteins in iron storage and mineralization. EncFtn decamers bind up to 48 iron ions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8C</xref>), which is significantly higher than the stoichiometry of fifteen metal ions visible in the FOC and E31/34-site of the crystal structure of the EncFtn<sub>sH</sub> decamer and our MS analysis. The discrepancy between these solution measurements and our MS analysis may indicate that there are additional metal-binding sites on the interior channel and exterior faces of the protein; this is consistent with our identification of a number of weak metal-binding sites at the surface of the protein in the crystal structure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>). These observations are consistent with hydrated Fe<sup>2+</sup> ions being channeled to the active site from the E31/34-site and the subsequent exit of Fe<sup>3+</sup> products on the outer surface, as is seen in other ferritin family proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Pesek et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Behera and Theil, 2014</xref>). While the isolated encapsulin shell does not display any ferroxidase activity, it binds around 2200 iron ions in our assay (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl5">Table 5</xref>). This implies that the shell can bind a significant amount of iron on its outer and inner surfaces. While the maximum reported loading capacity of classical ferritins is approximately 4500 iron ions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Mann et al., 1986</xref>), in our assay system we were only able to load apoferritin with around 570 iron ions. However, the recombinant EncFtn-Enc nanocompartment was able to bind over 4100 iron ions in the same time period, over seven times the amount seen for the apoferritin. We note we do not reach the experimental maximum iron loading for apoferritin and therefore the total iron-loading capacity of our system may be significantly higher than in this experimental system.</p><p>Taken together, our data show that EncFtn can catalytically oxidize Fe<sup>2+</sup> to Fe<sup>3+</sup>; however, iron binding in EncFtn is limited to the FOC and several surface metal binding sites. In contrast, the encapsulin protein displays no catalytic activity, but has the ability to bind a considerable amount of iron. Finally, the EncFtn-Enc nanocompartment complex retains the catalytic activity of EncFtn, and sequesters iron within the encapsulin shell at a higher level than the isolated components of the system, and at a significantly higher level than the classical ferritins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Andrews, 2010</xref>). Furthermore, our recombinant nanocompartments may not have the physiological subunit stoichiometry, and the iron-loading capacity of native nanocompartments is potentially much higher than the level we have observed.</p></sec><sec id="s2-8"><title>Mutagenesis of the EncFtn<sub>sH</sub>ferroxidase center</title><p>To investigate the structural and biochemical role played by the metal binding residues in the di-iron FOC of EncFtn<sub>sH</sub> we produced alanine mutations in each of these residues: Glu32, Glu62, and His65.

This gas-phase observation is consistent with SEC measurements, which indicate both of these variants were also decamers in solution.

At neutral pH the glutamic acid residues are negatively charged, while the histidine residues are predominantly in their uncharged state. In the wild-type (WT) EncFtn<sub>sH</sub> this leads to electrostatic repulsion between subunits in the absence of iron. Coordination of Fe<sup>2+</sup> in this site stabilizes the dimer and reconstitutes the active FOC. The geometric arrangement of Glu32 and Glu62 in the FOC explains their behavior in solution and the gas phase, where they both favor the formation of decamers due to the loss of a repulsive negative charge. The FOC in the H65A mutant is destabilized through the loss of this metal coordinating residue and potential positive charge carrier, thus favoring the monomer in solution and the gas phase.</p><p>To understand the impact of the mutants on the organization and metal binding of the FOC, we determined the X-ray crystal structures of each of the EncFtn<sub>sH</sub> mutants (See <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl4">Table 4</xref> for data collection and refinement statistics). The crystal packing of all of the mutants in this study is essentially isomorphous to the EncFtn<sub>sH</sub> structure.

By studying the EncFtn from <italic>R. rubrum</italic> we demonstrate that iron binding results in assembly of EncFtn decamers, which display a unique annular architecture. Despite a radically different quaternary structure to the classical ferritins, the four-helical bundle scaffold and FOC of EncFtn<sub>sH</sub> are strikingly similar to ferritin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>). A sequence-based phylogenetic tree for proteins in the ferritin family was constructed; in addition to the classical ferritins, bacterioferritins and Dps proteins, our analysis included the encapsulin-associated ferritin-like proteins (EncFtns) and a group related to these, but lacking the encapsulin sequence (Non-EncFtn). The analysis revealed that the EncFtn and Non-EncFtn proteins form groups distinct from the other clearly delineated groups of ferritins, and represent outliers in the tree (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig13">Figure 13</xref>). While it is difficult to infer ancestral lineages in protein families, the similarity seen in the active site scaffold of these proteins highlights a shared evolutionary relationship between EncFtn proteins and other members of the ferritin superfamily that has been noted in previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Andrews, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Lundin et al., 2012</xref>). From this analysis, we propose that the four-helical fold of the classical ferritins may have arisen through gene duplication of an ancestor of EncFtn. This gene duplication would result in the C-terminal region of one EncFtn monomer being linked to the N-terminus of another and thus stabilizing the four-helix bundle fold within a single polypeptide chain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>). Linking the protein together in this way relaxes the requirement for the maintenance of a symmetrical FOC and thus provides a path to the diversity in active-site residues seen across the ferritin family (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>, residues Glu95, Gln128 and Glu131 in PmFtn, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Supplementary file 1</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Andrews, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Lundin et al., 2012</xref>).<fig id="fig13" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.18972.033</object-id><label>Figure 13.</label><caption><title>Phylogenetic tree of ferritin family proteins.</title><p>The tree was built using the Neighbor-Joining method (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Saitou and Nei, 1987</xref>) based on step-wise amino acid sequence alignment of the four-helical bundle portions of ferritin family proteins (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Supplementary file 1</xref>).

The oxidation and mineralization of iron must be spatially separated from the host cytosol to prevent the formation of damaging hydroxyl radicals in the Fenton and Haber-Weiss reactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Honarmand Ebrahimi et al., 2012</xref>). This is achieved in all ferritins by confining the oxidation of iron to the interior of the protein complex, thus achieving sequestration of the Fe<sup>3+</sup> mineralization product. A structural alignment of the FOC of EncFtn with the classical ferritin PmFtn shows that the central ring of EncFtn corresponds to the external surface of ferritin, while the outer circumference of EncFtn is congruent with the inner mineralization surface of ferritin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1A</xref>). This overlay highlights the fact that the ferroxidase center of EncFtn faces in the opposite direction relative to the classical ferritins and is essentially inside out regarding iron storage space (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1B</xref>, boxed region). Analysis of each of the single mutations (E32A, E62A and H65A) made in the FOC highlights the importance of the iron-coordinating residues in the catalytic activity of EncFtn. Furthermore, the position of the calcium ion coordinated by Glu31 and Glu34 seen in the EncFtn<sub>sH</sub> structure suggests an entry site to channel metal ions into the FOC; we propose that this site binds hydrated iron ions <italic>in vivo</italic> and acts as a selectivity filter and gate for the FOC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Haldar et al., 2011</xref>). The constellation of charged residues on the outer circumference of EncFtn (His57, Glu61 and Glu64) could function in the same way as the residues lining the mineralization surface within the classical ferritin nanocage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Le Brun et al., 2010</xref>), and given their proximity to the FOC these sites may be the exit portal and mineralization site (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Honarmand Ebrahimi et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>The absolute requirement for the spatial separation of oxidation and mineralization in ferritins suggests that the EncFtn family proteins are not capable of storing iron minerals due to the absence of an enclosed compartment in their structure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1B</xref>). Our biochemical characterization of EncFtn supports this hypothesis, indicating that while this protein is capable of oxidizing iron, it does not accrue mineralized iron in an analogous manner to classical ferritins. While EncFtn does not store iron itself, its association with the encapsulin nanocage suggests that mineralization occurs within the cavity of the encapsulin shell (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">McHugh et al., 2014</xref>). Our ferroxidase assay data on the recombinant EncFtn-Enc nanocompartments, which accrue over 4100 iron ions per complex and form regular nanoparticles, are consistent with the encapsulin protein acting as the store for iron oxidized by the EncFtn enzyme. TEM analysis of the reaction products shows the production of homogeneous iron nanoparticles only in the EncFtn-Enc nanocompartment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s1">Figure 8—figure supplement 1</xref>).</p><p>Docking the decamer structure of EncFtn<sub>sH</sub> into the pentamer of the <italic>T. maritima</italic> encapsulin Tmari_0786 (PDB ID: 3DKT) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Sutter et al., 2008</xref>) shows that the position of the C-terminal extensions of our EncFtn<sub>sH</sub> structure are consistent with the localization sequences seen bound to the encapsulin protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig14">Figure 14A</xref>). Thus, it appears that the EncFtn decamer is the physiological state of this protein. This arrangement positions the central ring of EncFtn directly above the pore at the five-fold symmetry axis of the encapsulin shell and highlights a potential route for the entry of iron into the encapsulin and towards the active site of EncFtn. A comparison of the encapsulin nanocompartment and the ferritin nanocage highlights the size differential between the two complexes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig14">Figure 14B</xref>) that allows the encapsulin to store significantly more iron. The presence of five FOCs per EncFtn<sub>sH</sub> decamer and the fact that the icosahedral encapsulin nanocage can hold up to twelve of decameric EncFtn between each of the internal five-fold vertices means that they can achieve a high rate of iron mineralization across the entire nanocompartment. This arrangement of multiple reaction centers in a single protein assembly is reminiscent of classical ferritins, which has 24 FOCs distributed around the nanocage.<fig id="fig14" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.18972.034</object-id><label>Figure 14.</label><caption><title>Model of iron oxidation in encapsulin nanocompartments.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Model of EncFtn<sub>sH</sub> docking to the encapsulin shell.

In order to obtain Fe-bound EncFtn, 100 µM or 300 µM of freshly prepared FeCl<sub>2</sub> was added to apo-EncFtn<sub>sH</sub> (monomer peak) immediately prior to buffer exchange into 100 mM ammonium acetate (pH 8.0). Samples were analyzed on a quadrupole ion-mobility time of flight instrument (Synapt G2, Waters Corp., Manchester, UK), equipped with a nanomate nanoelectrospray infusion robot (Advion Biosciences, Ithaca, NY). Instrument parameters were tuned to preserve non-covalent protein complexes. After optimization, typical parameters were: nanoelectrospray voltage 1.54 kV; sample cone 50 V; extractor cone 0 V; trap collision voltage 4 V; source temperature 80°C; and source backing pressure 5.5 mbar. For improved mass resolution the sample cone was raised to 155 V. Ion mobility mass spectrometry (IM-MS) was performed using the travelling-wave mobility cell in the Synapt G2, employing nitrogen as the drift gas. Typically, the IMS wave velocity was set to 300 m/s; wave height to 15 V; and the IMS pressure was 1.8 mbar. All native MS experiments were performed on samples from two independent protein preparations. For collision cross section determination, IM-MS data was calibrated using denatured equine myoglobin and data was analyzed using Driftscope v2.5 and MassLynx v4.1 (Waters Corp., UK). Theoretical collision cross sections (CCS) were calculated from pdb files using IMPACT software v. 0.9.1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Marklund, 2015</xref>).

The widespread nature of these compartments and their potential physiological roles have only been appreciated recently. While the structure of the encapsulin shell has been determined, that of its cargo, the ferritin-like protein (EncFer), has remained elusive. Here, the authors provide the structure of one such cargo and show that it assembles in a manner that is topologically distinct from ferritin. Additionally, the authors provide evidence that metal binding promotes the assembly of the EncFer and that it does act as a ferroxidase. Altogether, there is a substantial amount of work here that will likely be viewed as a major step forward in understanding these unique bacterial organelles. I have a few suggestions and questions that are listed below:</p><p>1) The authors grow <italic>E. coli</italic> in minimal media with and without added iron to show that assembly is iron dependent. The output of these experiments is the ratio of decamer vs. monomer. However, we don't have information on whether the growth conditions altered either the total amount of protein produced or the total amount soluble complex/monomer. Perhaps, lower protein concentrations lead to less efficient assembly (a critical concentration is needed).</p><p>2) There is no information regarding the reason for the use of <italic>R. rubrum</italic> encapsulins. As far as I can tell, these have not been a model for either in vivo or in vitro work. Is there even evidence that they are produced by <italic>R. rubrum</italic>? What is their size/appearance in that organism? Do they have a physiological role?</p><p>3) Also, how similar are the Enc and EncFer to those of <italic>M. xanthus</italic>? Are the putative iron-binding sites conserved?</p><p>4) I would have liked to see some mutagenesis experiments to test the models of assembly, iron binding and ferroxidase activity. These do not have to be in vivo and can be performed in vitro with the available system.</p><p>5) I would like some more phylogenetic data for the model that ferritin evolved from EncFer. Perhaps, EncFer evolved from ferritin? Do any of the existing phylogenetic analyses support one model over another.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.18972.049</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p>[Editors’ note: the author responses to the first round of peer review follow.]</p><p><italic>In this manuscript the authors characterize the iron binding and oxidation mechanisms of bacterial encapsulins.

If the latter, it could easily generate reactive oxygen species in air under physiological conditions.</italic> </p><p>The reviewer makes an excellent point here. To ascertain whether the iron in the assays forms ‘balls of rust’ we performed transmission electron microscopy on the ferroxidase reaction mixtures after completion of the reaction to assess the formation of free, or encapsulated iron minerals. We provide an additional supplemental figure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s1">Figure 8—figure supplement 1</xref>) and discuss the observation of iron mineral crystals and nanoparticles in the main text, subsection “Ferroxidase activity”, last paragraph. We also attempted to use a commercial luminescence-based ROS detection kit on the reactions to address the possibility that H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> is produced as a reaction intermediate by the EncFtn protein. We found that the results from this particular kit were inconsistent between repeats, but for the benefit of the reviewer we provide a graph of the results obtained (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig15">Author response image 1</xref>). These results show the production of ROS by apoferritin, which is consistent with the published data on the reaction mechanism of certain ferritins; however, no significant ROS were detected for the EncFtn or encapsulin proteins.</p><p>We acknowledge that the reaction mechanism of the EncFtn merits further investigation in a follow up study.<fig id="fig15" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.18972.037</object-id><label>Author Response Image 1.</label><caption><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.18972.037">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.18972.037</ext-link></p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="x-tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-18972-resp-fig1-v3"/></fig></p><p><italic>2) Results:</italic></p><p><italic>A) Critical data, such as the comparison of maximum amount of iron bound by a monomer in the dodocamer is in the Supplementary information.</italic> </p><p>We acknowledge that the data for iron loading merits inclusion in the main text, we have now moved this data and other supplementary data tables to the main text.</p><p><italic>B) The data in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2-data">Supplementary file 2</xref>, shows that the amount of iron bound by an ENCFTN decamer monomer is sub -stoichiometric, ranging from 0.18 to 0.64. In a bona fide ferritin, with ~ 2000 iron atoms/ protein cage (24 subunits), the same parameter is much, much higher.</italic> </p><p>One of the central arguments of our paper is the fact that the EncFtnsH monomer must dimerize to produce a functional ferroxidase active site and that its iron binding properties are highly divergent from those of the classical ferritin nanocages. We have added additional text to the manuscript to highlight these differences (Introduction, last paragraph, and Mass spectrometry section) and discuss the functional consequences at length.</p><p><italic>Even an experimental situation: 24 subunit (monomer) ferritin with a biomineral prepared experimentally from apoferritin and containing, on average, only 1000 iron atoms/24 subunit cage, the equivalent parameter appears to be 1000/24 = 42.

Moreover, in nature, some ferritin protein cages contain as much as 4500 Fe atoms, several hundred times higher than the test system! Thus the significance of the experimental results in the paper are unclear.</italic> </p><p>We have clarified this key difference in the discussion of the iron storage function of the encapsulin nanocompartment (subsection “Iron storage in encapsulin nanocompartments”, second paragraph).

Additionally, the authors provide evidence that metal binding promotes the assembly of the EncFer and that it does act as a ferroxidase. Altogether, there is a substantial amount of work here that will likely be viewed as a major step forward in understanding these unique bacterial organelles. I have a few suggestions and questions that are listed below:</italic> </p><p><italic>1) The authors grow E. coli in minimal media with and without added iron to show that assembly is iron dependent. The output of these experiments is the ratio of decamer vs. monomer. However, we don't have information on whether the growth conditions altered either the total amount of protein produced or the total amount soluble complex/monomer. Perhaps, lower protein concentrations lead to less efficient assembly (a critical concentration is needed).</italic> </p><p>The reviewer makes an interesting point about growth conditions and we acknowledge that production of the protein in LB medium leads to varying protein yields and monomer/decamer proportions. We therefore adopted the use of M9 minimal medium throughout the study to give better reproducibility, which also enables better control of metal ion availability than the complex LB medium. Given the fact that the protein is produced recombinantly in <italic>E. coli</italic> it is not particularly instructive to prove the in vivoproduction of the EncFtn multimer in this host. We have added a panel to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref> to show the effect of protein concentration on multimerization in vitro(<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). Our mass spectrometry results show that the protein spontaneously multimerized in the presence of iron in vitroto form decameric species and that this is metal ion concentration dependent (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>).</p><p><italic>2) There is no information regarding the reason for the use of R. rubrum encapsulins. As far as I can tell, these have not been a model for either in vivo or in vitro work. Is there even evidence that they are produced by R. rubrum? What is their size/appearance in that organism? Do they have a physiological role?</italic> </p><p>We have put a comment in the Introduction to introduce <italic>R. rubrum</italic> (last paragraph). A preliminary study in the laboratory identified encapsulins in a preparation of lipid vesicles from <italic>R. rubrum</italic> containing chromatophores. We chose to follow up on these structures in this study. We do not feel this particular information is key to the central argument of the paper.</p><p><italic>3) Also, how similar are the Enc and EncFer to those of M. xanthus? Are the putative iron-binding sites conserved?</italic> </p><p>We have noted this in the Introduction of the manuscript.</p><p><italic>4) I would have liked to see some mutagenesis experiments to test the models of assembly, iron binding and ferroxidase activity. These do not have to be</italic> in vivo <italic>and can be performed</italic> in vitro <italic>with the available system.</italic> </p><p>To address this question we have produced three FOC mutants of the EncFtn protein and characterized these in solution, by mass spectrometry, and crystallographically (section: Mutagenesis of the EncFtnsH Ferroxidase center). We thank the reviewer for this suggestion as it highlighted the importance of the FOC residues for assembly and activity, and our new data has provided interesting insights into the EncFtn protein.</p><p><italic>5) I would like some more phylogenetic data for the model that ferritin evolved from EncFer. Perhaps, EncFer evolved from ferritin? Do any of the existing phylogenetic analyses support one model over another.</italic> </p><p>We now include a phylogenetic tree (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig13">Figure 13</xref>) and consider the question of ferritin evolution in the Discussion (first paragraph). None of the authors of this study are evolutionary biologists but we appreciate the difficulty inherent in tracing the history of protein folds, especially in bacterial lineages. We refer to previous studies in this section and make a suggestion that can be followed up in subsequent studies.</p></body></sub-article></article>
