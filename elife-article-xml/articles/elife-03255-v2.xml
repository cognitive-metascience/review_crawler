Here we report that the homologous voltage-gated potassium (Kv) channels also exhibit high temperature sensitivity comparable to that of TRPV1, which is detectable under specific conditions when the voltage sensor is functionally decoupled from the activation gate through either intrinsic mechanisms or mutations. Interestingly, mutations could tune Shaker channel to be either heat-activated or heat-deactivated. Therefore, high temperature sensitivity is intrinsic to both TRP and Kv channels. Our findings suggest important physiological roles of heat-induced variation in Kv channel activities. Mechanistically our findings indicate that temperature-sensing TRP channels may not contain a specialized heat-sensor domain; instead, non-obligatory allosteric gating permits the intrinsic heat sensitivity to drive channel activation, allowing temperature-sensitive TRP channels to function as polymodal nociceptors.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.03255.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.03255.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.03255.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>If you touch something too hot, it can cause you pain and damage your skin. Sensing the heat given off by an object or the temperature of the environment is possible, at least in part, because of proteins called temperature-sensitive TRP ion channels. These proteins are found in the cell membranes of nerve endings that are underneath the skin; and they open in response to heat, allowing ions to flow into the nerve cell. This in turn triggers a nerve impulse that is sent to our central nervous system and is perceived as heat and/or pain.</p><p>The ability to sense heat was thought to be unique to these TRP ion channels, and it was believed that these ion channels contained an as-yet unidentified temperature-sensing domain. However, Yang and Zheng now report that similar ion channels, which open in response to changes in the voltage that exists across a cell's membrane, are also sensitive to changes in temperature.</p><p>The temperature response of these ‘voltage-gated channels’ had largely eluded the attention of researchers in the past. This is because parts of the ion channel—which act like a ‘voltage sensor’ and only shift when the membrane voltage changes—normally keep the channel closed and directly open the channel when they move. Like all other proteins, ion channels are made from smaller building blocks called amino acids; and by changing some of the amino acids in the voltage-gated channel Yang and Zheng could decouple these normally linked actions. The changes to the channel meant that it did not immediately open when the voltage sensor moved; and decreasing the concentration of calcium ions inside the cell had the same effect as changing these amino acids. Both approaches revealed that, after a change in membrane voltage caused the voltage sensor to move, the ion channel remained closed until a high temperature caused it to open. Yang and Zheng revealed that the response of the modified voltage-gated channel to temperature was comparable to that of a typical heat-sensitive TRP ion channel.</p><p>Further experiments showed that replacing some of the amino acids in the voltage-gated potassium ion channel with different amino acids could cause the channel to be either opened or closed by heat.</p><p>The findings of Yang and Zheng indicate that temperature-sensing TRP channels may not contain a specialized heat-sensor domain. Instead, as these TRP ion channels do not require other parts of the protein to move in order to open the channel, they can be activated by their own inherent sensitivity to heat.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.03255.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.03255.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author keywords</title><kwd>TRP channel</kwd><kwd>potassium channel</kwd><kwd>temperature sensing</kwd><kwd>gating</kwd><kwd>conformational change</kwd><kwd>allosteric coupling</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>None</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000065</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01NS072377</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Zheng</surname><given-names>Jie</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000968</institution-id><institution>American Heart Association</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>10PRE4170142</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Yang</surname><given-names>Fan</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Highly temperature-sensitive behavior of voltage-gated potassium channels provides a mechanistic model for how heat-activated TRP channels serve as temperature and pain sensors.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Sensitive detection and discrimination of temperature cues are fundamental to the survival and prosperity of humans and animals. While Hodgkin and Huxley showed more than 60 years ago that temperature could profoundly influence membrane excitability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Hodgkin and Huxley, 1952</xref>), it is in general not well understood how heat affects membrane excitability and how temperature-dependent changes in neuronal activity contribute to physiology. Neuronal action potentials are generated and modulated by a precise combination of ionic currents produced by the activity of ion channels. Activation of ion channels in turn is the result of complex conformational rearrangements in channel protein controlled by specific physical or chemical stimuli (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Hille, 2001</xref>). Heat contributes to activation energy for channel conformational changes, through which it regulates channel activity and the shape of action potential (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Rodriguez et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Liang et al., 2009</xref>). For most ion channels, thermal energy affects the rate of conformational transitions by 2-to-5 folds per 10°C (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Pusch et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Rodriguez et al., 1998</xref>). Within the physiological temperature range, thermal energy alone was found to be generally insufficient to initiate channel activation. Among the exceptions are a group of transient receptor potential (TRP) channels including TRPV1-4, TRPM8, TRPM3, TRPM4, TRPM5, TRPC5, and TRPA1. These channels are potently activated by heat in the absence of another stimulus and hence serve as key cellular temperature sensors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Clapham, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Zheng, 2013</xref>). How these TRP channels respond to heat with exquisite sensitivity, however, remains mysterious.</p><p>To understand the molecular mechanism underlying high temperature sensitivity of the TRP channels, we conducted a comparative investigation of the voltage-gated potassium (Kv) channels. As members of the tetrameric cation channel superfamily, TRP channels and Kv channels are structurally similar. They all have six transmembrane segments, with the S1 to S4 segments forming an isolated peripheral domain surrounding the ion-permeating pore composed of S5, S6, and the loop between them. Comparison of the crystal structures of Kv channels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Long et al., 2005</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">2007</xref>) and the cryo-EM structures of TRPV1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Cao et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Liao et al., 2013</xref>) further shows that detailed structural features of these two types of channels are also very similar. However, the two types of channels are functionally distinct. Kv channels are activated by membrane depolarization with a steep voltage dependence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Sigworth, 1994</xref>), while TRP channels are only weakly activated at highly depolarized voltages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Zheng, 2013</xref>). More importantly, unlike the temperature-sensitive TRP channels, Kv channels cannot be directly activated by changes in temperature, and the activity of Kv channels are generally considered to be not very heat-sensitive (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Rodriguez et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Cui et al., 2012</xref>). The differences lead to the widely accepted assumption that through evolution some TRP channels have acquired specific protein structures that serve as a ‘heat sensor’. In the present study we tested this hypothesis by examining the temperature response of Kv channels.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>TRPV1 is an archetypical temperature-sensitive TRP channel (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Caterina et al., 1997</xref>). Heat strongly activates the channel, which could be observed at a broad voltage range using a ramp protocol (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, upper panel). A common way to characterize temperature sensitivity is the <italic>Q</italic><sub><italic>10</italic></sub> value (defined as the folds increase in current amplitude upon a 10°C increase in temperature). For TRPV1, the <italic>Q</italic><sub><italic>10</italic></sub> value is above 20 over a more than 200 mV voltage range (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, lower panel) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Benham et al., 2003</xref>), reflecting outstanding sensitivity of channel activation to heat. Having high temperature sensitivity at a wide voltage range is crucial for the channel's physiological role as a temperature sensor—it allows TRPV1-expressing sensory neurons to detect heat no matter the neurons are in the resting state or excited state.<fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.03255.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Heat sensitivity of TRPV1 and Shaker channel exhibits distinct voltage dependence.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) TRPV1 current was elicited by a voltage ramp at varying temperatures (upper panel). <italic>Q</italic><sub><italic>10</italic></sub>, quantified between 36.6°C and 46.0°C, remains high across the entire voltage range from −100 mV to +150 mV (lower panel).

Simplified gating schemes involving two transitions are shown on the bottom. The C→C′ transition is weakly voltage-dependent for TRPV1 but highly voltage-dependent for Shaker.

As a voltage-gated channel, Shaker activates upon depolarization to about −60 mV (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). The threshold voltage for activation was only slightly shifted by raising temperature. The average <italic>Q</italic><sub><italic>10</italic></sub> value remained low, at below 4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>, lower panel). Low temperature sensitivity is anticipated for Shaker and many other Kv channels, because opening and closing of the ion permeation pore in these channels is obligatorily coupled to movement of the voltage-sensor controlled by the membrane potential (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Sigworth, 1994</xref>). At hyperpolarized voltages, the channel is locked in the initial closed state (C, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>), in which the voltage-sensor is kept in the down conformation. A strongly voltage-dependent transition, involving the movement of ∼13 e<sub>0</sub> gating charges across the transmembrane electric field (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Schoppa et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Zagotta et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Aggarwal and MacKinnon, 1996</xref>), moves the channel to another closed state, C′, from which it can transition to the open state, O, with little voltage dependence. Since thermal energy is insufficient to supply the activation energy for voltage-sensor to overcome transmembrane voltage, opening of the channel is dictated by the membrane potential. The high fidelity of Shaker and other voltage-gated channels in reporting changes in membrane potential at variable environmental conditions is the basis for reliable electrical signaling of the nervous system.</p><p>A closer inspection of the Shaker channel <italic>Q</italic><sub><italic>10</italic></sub> measurement, however, revealed that it did increase modestly around −80 to −60 mV (arrow in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>, lower panel), approaching 10 at its peak. It is intriguing that this is the voltage range at which the voltage-sensor starts to move, permitting the C→C′ transition. This can be seen in the voltage dependence of gating charge movement (Q-V curve, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). Since it has been previously suggested that the voltage-dependent transition in TRPV1 is highly temperature-sensitive (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Voets et al., 2004</xref>), we wondered whether the transient <italic>Q</italic><sub><italic>10</italic></sub> increase in Shaker might reflect temperature sensitivity of the voltage-sensor movement. To test this possibility, we conducted similar measurements with the voltage-gated Ca<sup>2+</sup>-modulated BK potassium channel, because for this channel the separation between the G-V curve and the Q-V curve can be conveniently controlled by intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup>.</p><p>We observed that, like Shaker, BK in the presence of intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> also exhibited a transient <italic>Q</italic><sub><italic>10</italic></sub> increase at the voltage range where voltage-sensor started to be activated by depolarization, around −80 mV (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). Removing Ca<sup>2+</sup> shifts the voltage range for channel activation, substantially increasing the separation between G-V and Q-V curves (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Horrigan and Aldrich, 1999</xref>). The change is achieved mainly through a dual-allosteric coupling between the C′→O transition and the Ca<sup>2+</sup> and voltage induced transitions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Horrigan and Aldrich, 1999</xref>). We observed two interesting effects of Ca<sup>2+</sup> removal on the transient <italic>Q</italic><sub><italic>10</italic></sub> increase. First, it substantially shifted the voltage range at which the transient <italic>Q</italic><sub><italic>10</italic></sub> increase occurred, to around +100 mV (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). This large shift mirrored the substantial shift of the G-V curve. More importantly, in the absence of Ca<sup>2+</sup> the extent of the <italic>Q</italic><sub><italic>10</italic></sub> increase was enhanced dramatically even though the total gating charge movement remained unchanged (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Horrigan and Aldrich, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). These observations suggest that the <italic>Q</italic><sub><italic>10</italic></sub> increase may not be associated with the voltage-sensor movement (as reflected by the Q-V curve) but rather associated with the activation gate opening (as reflected by the G-V curve), that is, instead of the C→C′ transition, it seemed to be the C′→O transition that yielded the <italic>Q</italic><sub><italic>10</italic></sub> increase.<fig id="fig2" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.03255.004</object-id><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Voltage dependence of BK channel temperature sensitivity shifts with intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup>.</title><p><italic>Q</italic><sub><italic>10</italic></sub> (blue trace, right axis) calculated from temperature-dependent changes in the G-V curves at labeled temperatures (left axis) measured in the absence of Ca<sup>2+</sup> (lower panel) are larger in value and shifted more to the right in voltage dependence compared to those measured in presence of saturating Ca<sup>2+</sup> (200 μM, upper panel).</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.03255.004">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.03255.004</ext-link></p></caption><graphic xlink:href="elife-03255-fig2-v2.tif"/></fig></p><p>The possibility of a voltage-sensor associated <italic>Q</italic><sub><italic>10</italic></sub> increase was further ruled out when we tested additional Kv channels.

Highly temperature-sensitive activation could be observed when either a voltage ramp or a voltage step was applied. As these channels have similar voltage dependence to Shaker and BK channels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Islas and Sigworth, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Dougherty et al., 2008</xref>), the substantially higher <italic>Q</italic><sub><italic>10</italic></sub> values cannot come from the voltage-sensor movement. This conclusion is reinforced by the fact that the activity of TRPV1 (and other temperature-sensitive TRP channels) is minimally voltage-sensitive (with less than 1 e<sub>0</sub> gating charge; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Voets et al., 2004</xref>).

Interestingly, we observed that instead of heat activation, the channel exhibited a heat-induced deactivation behavior (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6G–J</xref>).

It remains to be determined whether the heat-induced deactivation process in V2 reflects a reversal of the heat-induced activation process in wild-type Kv channels and ILT. It is nonetheless important to note that V2 and ILT differ by only a few amino acids (V2 contains L382V in the S4–S5 linker; ILT contains V369I, I372L, and S376T in the S4 segment). Given that these mutations appear to alter gating transition rates and equilibriums without changing the fundamental voltage-dependent activation mechanism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Schoppa and Sigworth, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Smith-Maxwell et al., 1998</xref>), we speculate that the same gating process may yield the opposite <italic>Q</italic><sub><italic>10</italic></sub> changes.

Potentially this transient increase in temperature sensitivity may have important functional consequences, especially since a change in the Kv channel activity at slightly depolarized membrane potentials would substantially alter action potential frequency and neuronal coding. Similarly, any temperature-dependent change in activity of the voltage-gated sodium and calcium channels may also have important consequence in membrane excitability. However, while it has been demonstrated that temperature-dependent changes in Kv channel activity profoundly affect neuronal excitability and coding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Vandenberg et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Graham et al., 2008</xref>) as well as secretion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">MacDonald et al., 2003</xref>), how dynamic changes in temperature sensitivity of ion channels affect physiology remains poorly understood, partially because most studies of ion channel behaviors have been carried out at the room temperature instead of around the body temperature.<fig id="fig7" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.03255.010</object-id><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><title>Comparison of <italic>Q</italic><sub><italic>10</italic></sub> (<bold>A</bold>) and thermodynamic measurements (<bold>B</bold>) between TRPV1, Kv and CLC-0 channels.</title><p>Data for CLC-0 are reproduced from published results (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Yang et al., 2010</xref>). <italic>n</italic> = 3-to-6; *p&lt;0.05; **p&lt;0.01; ***p&lt;0.001; n.s., no significance.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.03255.010">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.03255.010</ext-link></p></caption><graphic xlink:href="elife-03255-fig7-v2.tif"/></fig></p></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>A central observation of the present study is that there is a transient increase in temperature sensitivity of Kv channels, which occurs when the voltage-sensor is partially decoupled from the activation gate. Our study revealed an intrinsically heat-sensitive gating process in these voltage-gated channels. Interestingly, a previous study of Shaker channel activation indeed identified a late transition preceding channel opening that exhibits higher temperature sensitivity than all the other transitions (including the voltage-sensor movements) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Rodriguez et al., 1998</xref>). In agreement of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Clapham and Miller (2011)</xref>, these observations indicate that there may not be a specialized ‘heat sensor’ to support the heat activation process. Generally speaking, an equilibrium process A←→B would be highly temperature-sensitive if the transition is associated with a large enthalpic change. This can be seen from the temperature dependence of the probability function<disp-formula id="equ1"><mml:math id="m1"><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mi>P</mml:mi><mml:mi>B</mml:mi></mml:msub><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mfrac><mml:mn>1</mml:mn><mml:mrow><mml:mn>1</mml:mn><mml:mo>+</mml:mo><mml:mtext>exp</mml:mtext><mml:mrow><mml:mo>(</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:mfrac><mml:mrow><mml:mtext>Δ</mml:mtext><mml:mi>H</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>R</mml:mi><mml:mi>T</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:mfrac><mml:mo>−</mml:mo><mml:mfrac><mml:mrow><mml:mtext>Δ</mml:mtext><mml:mi>S</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mi>R</mml:mi></mml:mfrac></mml:mrow><mml:mo>)</mml:mo></mml:mrow></mml:mrow></mml:mfrac><mml:mo>,</mml:mo></mml:mrow></mml:math></disp-formula>in which <italic>P</italic><sub><italic>B</italic></sub> is the probability of the system to reside in the B state, Δ<italic>H</italic> and Δ<italic>S</italic> are enthalpic and entropic changes associated with the transition, respectively, T is temperature, and <italic>R</italic> is the gas constant. For temperature-sensitive TRP channels, a large enthalpic change during channel activation was indeed observed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Brauchi et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Voets et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Yang et al., 2010</xref>). The observation of an associated large entropic change comes from the requirement for the heat-induced transition to occur at physiological temperatures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Yang et al., 2010</xref>). A simple interpretation of the large enthalpic and entropic changes is that they represent the occurrence of a substantial conformational rearrangement in the channel protein. We showed in the present study that in Kv channels this conformational rearrangement is not the voltage-sensor movement but rather the process following voltage-sensor movement.</p><p>Kv channels and TRP channels are known to function as an allosteric protein. Observations from the present study can be understood using the following simple allosteric gating scheme:<fig id="fig8" position="float"><graphic xlink:href="elife-03255-fig8-v2.tif"/></fig>in which the vertical transition represents voltage-sensor movement driven by membrane depolarization, and the horizontal transition represents pore opening. Because for Shaker and many other Kv channels voltage-sensor movement is very strongly coupled to pore opening, activation gating occurs in the sequence C←→C′←→O′. At hyperpolarized voltages, the strong voltage dependence of the C←→C′ equilibrium ensures that the channel resides in the initial C state, so that the temperature-sensitive transition C′→O′ cannot occur. (According to allosteric principles, the C′→O′ transition is strongly favored over the C→O transition because of the large activation energy associated with the vertical transition.) Only when the channel moves from C to C′ upon mild depolarization can the C′→O′ transition be observed upon temperature changes. CSI in Kv2.1 and Kv4.3 as well as mutations in Shaker ILT and V2 weaken the allosteric coupling between the voltage-sensor and the pore, allowing the temperature-sensitive horizontal transition to occur.</p><p>Realizing that Kv channels are intrinsically highly temperature-sensitive has important mechanistic implications for how some TRP channels serve as temperature sensors and nociceptors. The high temperature sensitivity of TRP channels originates from exceptionally large enthalpic and entropic changes associated with the activation process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Brauchi et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Voets et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Yang et al., 2010</xref>). From the Gibbs equation, Δ<italic>G</italic> = Δ<italic>H</italic> − <italic>T</italic>Δ<italic>S</italic>, it is clear that large Δ<italic>H</italic> and Δ<italic>S</italic> values make free energy change associated with the activation process, Δ<italic>G</italic>, to be highly temperature-dependent. It is generally assumed that the large enthalpic and entropic changes come from a substantial conformational rearrangement in the TRP channels. The existence of large conformational rearrangements has been directly detected using fluorescent tags in TRPV1 as well as the CLC chloride channels (whose common gating process is also highly temperature-sensitive) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Pusch et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Bykova et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Yang et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39a">Ma et al., 2011</xref>). Nonetheless, the structural and mechanistic basis for large conformational rearrangements in temperature-sensitive TRP channels remains unknown. Consequently, it has been highly controversial how these TRP channels sense heat. Here we show that in Kv channels the voltage-dependent C→C′ transition, representing movements of the voltage-sensor, is not specially temperature sensitive, in agreement with a previous study of the Shaker channel (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Rodriguez et al., 1998</xref>). Instead, the C′→O′ transition, representing later activation transitions of the channel protein, yields the transient increase in <italic>Q</italic><sub><italic>10</italic></sub> when the obligatory voltage-sensor control is alleviated. We and others showed that temperature-sensitive TRP channels also behave like an allosteric protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Latorre et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Matta and Ahern, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Jara-Oseguera and Islas, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Yang et al., 2014</xref>). High temperature sensitivity of TRP channels may also originate from the C′→O′ transition. A previous study demonstrated, based on a simple two-state C←→O gating scheme, that heat strongly shifts the gating equilibrium by deferentially affecting the forward and backward transitions which are also weakly voltage-sensitive (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Voets et al., 2004</xref>). The origin of the voltage-sensitive process in TRPV1 and other TRP channels remains unclear. It is nonetheless becoming clear that an S4-type voltage-sensor seen in Kv channels does not exist in TRP channels. Since voltage is a poor activator for TRPV1 but heat is a strong activator, it is unlikely heat solely works through the voltage-dependent process to open TRPV1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Matta and Ahern, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Yang et al., 2010</xref>). In the context of Scheme I, it appears that the observation by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Voets et al. (2004)</xref> is applicable to the horizontal transition instead of the vertical transition. Our study indicates that TRPV1 is heat-sensitive at a broad voltage range because the C→C′ transition is weakly voltage-dependent and not obligatory.</p><p>A recent cryo-EM structural study of TRPV1 provided direct evidence that the peripheral S1–S4 domains remain stationary while the pore domains undergo substantial structural rearrangements when the channel is activated by agonists (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Cao et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Liao et al., 2013</xref>). It is thus possible that the highly temperature-sensitive process of TRPV1 may come from the pore opening process. Indeed, nearly all the known TRPV1 agonists interact directly or indirectly with the pore domain: H<sup>+</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Jordt et al., 2000</xref>), spider toxin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bohlen et al., 2010</xref>), and divalent cations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Ahern et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Luebbert et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Cao et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Yang et al., 2014</xref>) from the extracellular side, and capsaicin and resiniferatoxin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Szallasi et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Jordt and Julius, 2002</xref>) from the intracellular side. While capsaicin and resiniferatoxin bind to sites adjacent to the pore-forming domains, the cryo-EM data indicate that they induce channel activation by altering the pore conformation while leaving the S1–S4 peripheral domains mostly unchanged (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Cao et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Liao et al., 2013</xref>).

Results from the cryo-EM study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Cao et al., 2013</xref>) and fluorescence study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Yang et al., 2010</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">2014</xref>) of TRPV1 clearly support this possibility.</p><p>To serve as biological heat sensors, temperature-sensitive TRP channels need to fulfill two fundamental requirements. First, its activity must be highly sensitive to changes in temperature. Second, heat-induced activity cannot be dependent on the presence of another stimulus; specifically, heat activation must be able to occur when the sensory neuron is in the resting state (at hyperpolarized membrane potentials). As discussed above, the first requirement is fulfilled because channel activation is associated with large Δ<italic>H</italic> and Δ<italic>S</italic> originated from a substantial conformational rearrangement. Results from the present study argue that the second requirement is fulfilled because the occurrence of heat-induced conformational rearrangements is not controlled by the voltage-dependent transition (or other stimulus-induced transitions). Allosteric but non-obligatory coupling of multiple stimuli to the opening of channel pore allows TRP channels to serve as polymodal cellular sensors.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>cDNA constructs and cell transfection</title><p>The following cDNA constructs were used in this study: murine TRPV1 (a gift from Dr Michael X Zhu, University of Texas Health Science Center at Houston), Kv2.1, Shaker IR channel (with N terminal inactivation ball removed, used as WT) and Shaker IR L382V (V2 mutant) (all gifts from Dr Jon Sack, University of California at Davis), Shaker IR-based V369I, I372L, and S376T triple mutant (ILT mutant) (a gift from Dr Kenton Swartz, National Institutes of Health at Bethesda), Kv4.3 (a gift from Dr Kewei Wang, Peking University in China), and murine Slo1 construct for BK channel pore-forming subunit (a gift from Dr Jim Trimmer, University of California at Davis).

Your article has been favorably evaluated by Eve Marder (Senior editor) and 3 reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors.</p><p>The following individuals responsible for the peer review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Richard Aldrich (Reviewing editor); David Clapham, and Haoxing Xu (peer reviewers).</p><p>The Reviewing editor and the other reviewers discussed their comments before we reached this decision, and the Reviewing editor has assembled the following comments to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Yang and Zheng present very interesting results on the temperature dependence of potassium channel activation. They find that several different potassium channels have the high temperature dependence characteristic of thermosensitive TRP channels, but only in certain voltage ranges where, the authors argue, activation is partially “decoupled” to voltage sensors. The results are convincing and the similar behavior of several wild type and mutant channels gives considerable strength to the general principles. The overall conclusion is that high temperature sensitivity is not unique to TRP channels and in Kv channels becomes apparent when focusing on the activation transition (reflected in G-V) rather than the voltage sensor movement (Q-V).</p><p>The recordings are of high quality and the results are carefully interpreted. Overall, this is a study of general interest, especially to the investigators working on ion channels and sensory transduction.</p><p>However, it is important for the authors to establish the specificity of their Q10 measurement and calculation.</p><p>1) Additional control experiments are necessary to show that the voltage-dependence of Q10 change is not sensitive to the experimental conditions, such as the rates of the voltage ramp. This is important because the voltage ramps are not ideal for studying voltage-gated channels, and it appears that the kinetics of channel activation and fast inactivation are also highly temperature-sensitive (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figures 3C-G</xref>). For Kv4.3, the outward current is heat-deactivated while the inward current is heat-activated (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>)! Note that the heat-deactivation of V2 mutant channels was only shown with the outward current. In this regard, the authors may wish to verify their major conclusion by investigating the temperature sensitivity of the outward currents at depolarizing voltages above Ek using physiological concentrations of extracellular K+ (i.e., 3-5 mM).

Specific temperature ranges for Q10 calculation are given in figure legends.</p><p>1) Additional control experiments are necessary to show that the voltage-dependence of Q10 change is not sensitive to the experimental conditions, such as the rates of the voltage ramp. This is important because the voltage ramps are not ideal for studying voltage-gated channels, and it appears that the kinetics of channel activation and fast inactivation are also highly temperature-sensitive (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figures 3C-G</xref>). For Kv4.3, the outward current is heat-deactivated while the inward current is heat-activated (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>)! Note that the heat-deactivation of V2 mutant channels was only shown with the outward current. In this regard, the authors may wish to verify their major conclusion by investigating the temperature sensitivity of the outward currents at depolarizing voltages above Ek using physiological concentrations of extracellular K+ (i.e., 3-5 mM). Note that extracellular K+ would also have profound effects on C-type inactivation, which could be temperature-sensitive. We anticipate that these additional control experiments should be easily accomplished.</p><p>Our conclusions were based on observations from both voltage ramps and voltage steps experiments. With voltage steps experiments channel gating achieves equilibrium. At such equilibrium state significant heat activation was observed for Kv2.1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3 B&amp;C</xref>), Kv4.3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3 F&amp;G</xref>) and Shaker ITL (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6 D&amp;E</xref>). The ramp protocol indeed does not guarantee equilibrium gating, but it is very effective in illustrating the transient nature of Q10 changes over a wide voltage range. In response to the critique, we have now conducted the ramp experiments at a substantially slower ramping speed. We also repeated the experiments under condition that yielded an outward current, as suggested. Neither operation eliminated the large transient Q10 increase. These results are now included in the revised manuscript as <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3–figure supplement 1</xref>.</p><p>2) The authors' explanation in terms of uncoupling makes sense, but they stop short of a more sophisticated, and perhaps clearer, mechanistic explanation.

Indeed, only a few TRP and non-TRP channels have been carefully examined for heat-induced activation. Observations of the present study suggest that perhaps heat-induced channel activation is more common than anticipated. It is likely not obvious in channels specialized in detecting other particular stimuli, since in such cases allosteric coupling between the stimulus-driven process and channel opening is expected to be strong. The Kv channels we examined in the present study serve as examples (at various degrees) of this type of specialized channels.</p><p>4) We suggest you rewrite the Introduction with more precision and regard for the sophistication of likely readers.

Our observations are fully consistent with the idea discussed in the Clapham and Miller article, that it is possible TRP channels operate in the absence of a contained heat sensor. The article is now cited in the revised manuscript; thanks for pointing out this oversight in the first submission.</p><p>5) You should refrain from stating “it is prohibited in Kv channels by the tight coupling of activation to the voltage-controlled gating process”. You can say that this is inferred. If you do want to state this, you will have to say how tight coupling of activation to voltage affects temperature sensitivity of gating in some mechanistic way, which means knowing the energies of interactions in detail.</p><p>We have removed the statement from the Abstract. While the coupling between the voltage sensor and the gate is intensively studied in Kv channels, that of TRPV1 is much less clear. Existing studies (including our recently published study, JGP 2014) demonstrated that allosteric coupling between the voltage-dependent transition and the closed-to-open transition of the pore can be used to satisfactorily describe voltage-dependent gating of TRPV1. In particular, the coupling between voltage and channel activation is much weaker in TRPV1 than that in most Kv channels. This is evident in the low open probability TRPV1 can reach upon strong depolarization, as well as the fact that the channel can be activated by ligand and heat at hyperpolarized voltages. This difference and its potential implication in the activation mechanism are discussed in the revised manuscript in a speculative manner.</p><p>6) The authors may wish to comment on the strong voltage-dependence of Q10 reported for thermoTRPs by Voets et al (Nature 2004).</p><p>In the revised manuscript we discussed this previous study and pointed out that the origin of voltage sensitivity in temperature-sensitive TRP channels remains unknown.</p></body></sub-article></article>
