However, interactions between LN stroma and pioneer metastatic cells during metastatic colonization remain largely uncharacterized. Here we studied mice implanted with GFP-expressing melanoma cells to decipher early LN colonization events. We show that Siglec1-expressing subcapsular sinus (SCS) macrophages provide anchorage to pioneer metastatic cells. We performed in vitro co-culture to demonstrate that interactions between hypersialylated cancer cells and Siglec1 drive the proliferation of cancer cells. When comparing the transcriptome profile of Siglec1-interacting cancer cells against non-Siglec1-interacting cancer cells, we detected enrichment in positive regulators of cell cycle progression. Further, knockout of <italic>St3gal3</italic> sialyltransferase compromised the metastatic efficiency of tumor cells by reducing α−2,3-linked sialylation. Thus, the interaction between Siglec1-expressing SCS macrophages and pioneer metastatic cells drives cell cycle progression and enables efficient metastatic colonization.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><title>eLife digest</title><p>Cancer cells can leave the site where they arise and travel to other organs. Very few of the cancer cells that make this journey will survive long enough to form new tumors (also known as ‘metastases’). However, melanoma cells – the most aggressive type of skin cancer cells – are an exception. These cells will often colonize their nearest lymph nodes and melanoma patients with metastases in the lymph nodes are less likely to survive than those patients without them.</p><p>Previous studies have shown that melanoma cells arrive at a lymph node and first proliferate in the region at the edge of this organ, known as the subcapsular sinus, before moving to the center. However, it was not understood how melanoma cells manage to survive in the subcapsular sinus.</p><p>Now, Singh and Choi have tracked fluorescent melanoma cells to observe how they interact with the cells in the lymph nodes in mice. Melanoma cells have ‘sticky’ proteins coated with sugars on their surface. The results show that when the cells arrive in the subcapsular sinus these proteins bind to a receptor called Siglec1 located on the surface of immune cells called macrophages, which are also present. In this way, the melanoma cells anchor themselves in the lymph node. Moreover, binding Siglec1 helps melanoma cells survive and proliferate. In a last set of experiments, Singh and Choi deleted the enzyme responsible for making the sugar molecules in melanoma cells. Without the sugar coat, melanoma cells were less able to anchor themselves and grow within the mouse lymph nodes.</p><p>Lymph nodes are often the first stop for melanoma cells on the way to other organs. Therefore, understanding the interaction between melanoma cells and macrophages might be useful for developing therapies that could disrupt this process and treat this aggressive cancer.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>lymph node</kwd><kwd>metastasis</kwd><kwd>melanoma</kwd><kwd>Siglec1</kwd><kwd>sialylation</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100003645</institution-id><institution>National Cancer Center</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>1810102</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Choi</surname><given-names>Beom K.</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100003645</institution-id><institution>National Cancer Center</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>1910050</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Choi</surname><given-names>Beom K.</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>When pioneer metastatic cells enter a sentinel lymph node through afferent lymphatics subcapsular sinus, macrophages provide them soil to proliferate and colonize lymph node.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Lymphatic dissemination is a common metastasis route in solid cancers and LN metastasis is often associated with the severity of the disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Nathanson, 2003</xref>). Although the clinical consequences of LN metastasis are debatable, recent reports have described clinically relevant events that take place during LN colonization by tumor cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Werner-Klein et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Pereira et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Brown et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Lee et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Naxerova et al., 2017</xref>). Melanoma metastasizes to LNs very early in cancer progression and metastatic cells acquire driver genetic changes during colonization of LNs, suggesting the important role that LNs have in tumor evolution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Werner-Klein et al., 2018</xref>). These evolved post-LN-colonizing cancer cells with acquired colonization signatures show superior xenograft formation in mice compared with pre-colonizing cancer cells, suggesting a possible reason as to why metastasis-positive LNs are linked to disease severity in cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Werner-Klein et al., 2018</xref>). Moreover, LNs provide a foothold for metastatic cells to disseminate further. Besides lymphatic dissemination to downstream LNs, during LN colonization metastatic cells gain access to the blood vessels in LNs and take a hematogenous route to colonize peripheral organs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Pereira et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Brown et al., 2018</xref>). Despite all clinically important roles that LNs have in the systemic spread of evolved cancer cells, our knowledge of the early events of LN colonization by pioneer metastatic cells is very limited (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Naxerova et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>The distal organ metastatic colonization process is organ-specific and requires interactions between disseminated tumor cells (DTCs; seed) and distal organs (soil) to reinitiate growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Peinado et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Massagué and Obenauf, 2016</xref>). Although primary tumors release many early DTCs into the circulation, which are the precursors of metastasis, very few eventually form distal metastasis. The majority of DTCs that land in unfamiliar distal sites fail to survive the hostile microenvironment of the new-found stroma. This inefficiency of metastasis suggests that distal organ colonization is a bottleneck of the metastasis colonization process. To gain a foothold in new landing sites, pioneer metastatic cells require active participation of the host stroma to obtain survival and viability signals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Mehlen and Puisieux, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Buchheit et al., 2014</xref>). A better understanding of the events that define this interaction between metastatic cells and host organ stroma is needed to identify actionable vulnerabilities of the metastatic colonization process. The current paradigm posits that LN metastatic colonization begins with the arrest of metastatic cells in the LN subcapsular sinus (SCS) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Das et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Jeong et al., 2015</xref>). However, in LN metastasis, focus is often given to post-metastatic colonization events, whereas the interactions between metastatic cells and host stroma that leads to LN colonization by tumor cells remains largely uncharacterized (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Nathanson, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Lee et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Das et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Jeong et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Olmeda et al., 2017</xref>). Therefore, using enhanced green fluorescent protein (GFP)-expressing mouse melanoma cells, we investigated the early LN metastatic colonization events and how LN supports the newly arrived DTCs.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>LN metastatic colonization begins with interactions between pioneer metastatic cells and Siglec1<sup>+</sup> SCS macrophages</title><p>To decipher the earliest metastatic events in LN, we first defined the stage at which melanoma LN metastasis formation takes place. Enhanced green fluorescent protein-expressing B16F10 (B16-GFP) melanoma cells were injected into mouse footpads to form primary tumor (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>). The advantage of this model is that it mimics the natural course of metastasis, that is, primary tumor growth, pre-metastatic conditioning of draining LNs, and dissemination of tumor cells followed by LN colonization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Jeong et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Harrell et al., 2007</xref>), while GFP enables us to track cancer cells even as single cells. Pioneer metastatic cells could be observed in the SCS of sentinel popliteal LNs lined by Lyve-1<sup>+</sup> lymphatic endothelial cells as early as 2 weeks after inoculation and before the appearance of any visible macroscopic metastatic foci (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref>). Given the cell composition of the LN SCS and prominent presence of SCS macrophages in the sinus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Gray and Cyster, 2012</xref>), we reasoned that pioneer metastatic cells may use SCS macrophages to find an initial anchorage point. Therefore, we stained the LN sections positive for B16-GFP cells with anti-Siglec1 (CD169) antibody, the surface protein highly expressed on macrophages on the floor of the SCS and in the LN medullary region (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Gray and Cyster, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Nakamura et al., 2002</xref>). Of note, by depleting LN-resident macrophages through injecting clodronate liposomes into the mouse footpads, we confirmed that Siglec1 is primarily expressed on SCS and medullary sinus macrophages in LNs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>). We found the pioneer metastatic cells in close contact with SCS macrophages within the LN SCS, suggesting they interact with each other right after metastastic cells enter the SCS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A and B</xref>; <xref ref-type="video" rid="video1">Video 1</xref>). Likewise, we confirmed this SCS macrophage–tumor cell interaction using another cell surface marker expressed on SCS macrophages, CD11b (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C</xref>). We analyzed the sections from day 17 to day 21, and found that after initial cancer cell attachment to SCS macrophages, small metastatic foci developed within the SCS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). With the increase in size, the foci exerted pressure on the SCS macrophage–lymphatic lining, which eventually lead to disruption of the sinus lining and metastatic cells entering the LN cortex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). Of note, to test the generalizability of our observations, we implanted an EGFP-expressing 4T1 mouse breast cancer cell line into mouse footpads and found that breast cancer cells also used SCS macrophages to find a foothold in LNs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref>). Taken together with previous observations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Das et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Jeong et al., 2015</xref>), where LN metastatic cells from different tumor types remain in the SCS and form a metastatic focus before invading into the LN cortex, our observations indicate that other tumors metastasizing to LNs may also use a LN colonization mechanism similar to melanoma.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Steps of lymph node (LN) metastatic colonization.</title><p>B6 mice were implanted with B16-GFP cancer cells in footpads.

Furthermore, treatment with sialidase abolished the Siglec1 binding to cancer cells while removing the α2,3‐ sialylation completely and α2,6- sialylation by one third, suggesting Siglec1 preferentially binds to α2,3‐sialylated protein on cancer cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s5">Figure 1—figure supplement 5A–F</xref>).

Mouse Siglec1 was transiently expressed in HEK293T cells and B16-GFP cells were co-cultured with these Siglec1-expressing cells (hereafter referred to as HEK<sup>Siglec1</sup> and HEK<sup>Mock</sup> for cells transfected with plasmid expressing mouse <italic>Siglec1</italic> and empty plasmid, respectively; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A</xref>). Of note, Siglec1 expression did not affect the proliferation status of HEK293T cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1B</xref>). To mimic the non-adherent nature of DTCs, we co-cultured cells in low binding culture plates. Of note, we observed that cancer cells cultured in non-adherent conditions showed significantly reduced Ki67 expression, similar to DTCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1C,D</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Pantel and Brakenhoff, 2004</xref>).

To exclude the possibility that expression of Siglec1 may induce HEK293T cells to secrete some pro-proliferation factors and in turn induce B16-GFP cell proliferation, we prepared conditioned media from HEK<sup>Mock</sup> and HEK<sup>Siglec1</sup> cells and treated the B16-GFP cells in a similar setting as the co-culture experiments. Conditioned media did not affect the proliferation of B16-GFP cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1E,F</xref>). We next tested the role of Siglec1 in the survival of cancer cells. We assessed Annexin V staining in B16-GFP cells after co-culturing B16-GFP cells with HEK<sup>Mock</sup> and HEK<sup>Siglec1</sup> cells. B16-GFP cells co-cultured with HEK<sup>Siglec1</sup> cells had significantly lower Annexin V-positive apoptotic cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2H,I</xref>). We further validated these results using a mouse macrophage cell line, J774A.1, which expresses Siglec1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2A</xref>). We used siRNA to knockdown <italic>Siglec1</italic> expression in J774A.1 cells and performed co-culture experiments with B16-GFP cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2B–D</xref>).

After co-culturing B16-GFP cells with HEK<sup>Siglec1</sup> or HEK<sup>Mock</sup> for 18 hr, we performed intracellular Phosflow analysis. Siglec1 engagement with cancer cells induced AKT phosphorylation at S473, which is a PI3K-mediated AKT-activating event (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2J,K</xref>).

To this end, we revisited our RNA sequencing results to identify important molecular events that regulate mitotic entry. Gene expression data showed significant upregulation in cell cycle master regulator PLK1 expression in co-culture experiments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig3sdata1">Figure 3—source data 1</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Paschal et al., 2012</xref>). This prompted us to compare PLK1 activation in primary tumor and early LN metastatic cells. We used Phosflow to compare PLK1 phosphorylation in primary tumor and LN metastatic cells. PLK1 phosphorylation at T210 is a mitosis-specific G2/M transition-activating event (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Paschal et al., 2012</xref>). We found 1.8-fold higher activation of PLK1 in LN metastatic cells in comparison with primary tumor cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A,B</xref>). Consistently, in in vitro experiments, we found marked increase in mitosis-committed cancer cells when B16-GFP cells were co-cultured with HEK<sup>Siglec1</sup> in comparison with HEK<sup>Mock</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C,D</xref>).

Taken together, Siglec1-interacting tumor cells showed higher PLK1 phosphorylation than those that did not interact with Siglec1. This strong mitotic induction observed in Siglec1-interacting tumor cells and confirmed by high PLK1 phosphorylation during early LN metastatic colonization supports our model whereby Siglec1 confers a growth advantage to pioneer metastatic cells.

In previous experiments, we established that Siglec1 preferentially binds to α−2,3-linked sialylation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s5">Figure 1—figure supplement 5A–F</xref>). One sialyltransferase, ST3 beta-galactoside alpha-2,3-sialyltransferase 3 (St3gal3) is known to produce Siglec-binding α−2,3 sialylation in mice and is linked to metastasis and poor prognosis in several cancer types (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Guo et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Pérez-Garay et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Cui et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chang et al., 2006</xref>).

Additionally, <italic>St3gal3</italic> knockout (KO) cells showed approximately 70% reduced cell surface binding of Siglec1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1E,F</xref>). Of note, <italic>St3gal3</italic> KO did not affect the proliferation of B16-GFP cells in culture, in vitro adhesion and migration, or growth as primary tumors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1G–K</xref>), but it abrogated the ability of B16-GFP to adhere to a Siglec1-expressing HEK293T cell monolayer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A,B</xref>). Notably, <italic>St3gal3</italic> KO severely reduced the LN metastasis burden (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C–E</xref>). To explore the possibility of Siglec1 expression on primary tumor lymphatic vessels, which might have affected the initial egress of cancer cells from the primary tumor, we searched for Siglec1 expression on primary tumor lymphatic vessels and found none (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2</xref>). Next, we sought to explain the reduced metastasis by comparing the morphological features of early metastatic foci and quantifying the proliferation and survival of metastatic cells in the LN SCS. Immunohistological analysis at an early metastasis stage (day 17) revealed that although <italic>St3gal3</italic> KO B16-GFP cells are present in the LN SCS, they did not form foci and were not in contact with SCS macrophages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F</xref>). Whereas, WT B16-GFP cells formed tight-knit foci in contact with SCS macrophages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F</xref>). We further investigated whether this deprivation of Siglec1-derived signals from SCS macrophages affected the proliferation and survival of <italic>St3gal3</italic> KO metastatic cells during early colonization. Ki67 staining revealed that <italic>St3gal3</italic> KO B16-GFP cells showed severely reduced proliferation in the SCS in comparison with WT B16-GFP cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5G,H</xref>). Furthermore, early metastatic cells originating from <italic>St3gal3</italic> KO cells showed significantly decreased survival in the SCS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5I,J</xref>). Three weeks after tumor cell implantation, a large metastatic focus had formed in the LN, which disrupted the SCS macrophages lining the LN sinus, but <italic>St3gal3</italic> KO tumors only formed small cell clusters, which crossed the SCS without growing in size in the SCS, suggesting a lack of ability to adhere to the SCS macrophages and hence reduced metastatic growth (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s3">Figure 5—figure supplement 3</xref>). Thus, overall α−2,3-sialylation abundance on tumor cells affects the efficiency of LN metastasis formation. Combined, these results suggest that the survival and proliferation of pioneer metastatic cells in the LN SCS is crucial process of metastatic colonization, and abrogation of SCS macrophage–tumor cell binding slowed down the metastatic colonization considerably.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig5" position="float"><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><title>α−2,3-linked sialylation and melanoma LN metastasis.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) In vitro adhesion assay of wildtype (WT) and <italic>St3gal3-</italic>knockout (KO) B16-GFP cell lines to a Siglec1-expressing HEK293T monolayer.

The high prevalence of LN metastasis early during tumor progression suggests the presence of a metastasis-permissive environment in LNs. Our data provide a possible explanation for this. We propose a model whereby lymphatic disseminated metastatic cells directly interact with SCS macrophages just after landing in the LN SCS. The overall abundance and continuous presence of Siglec1<sup>+</sup> macrophages in the SCS facilitates efficient metastatic seeding by providing adherence and promoting cell cycle progression in otherwise vulnerable DTCs. Our model is in agreement with the sequence of events leading to metastatic colonization of LN observed by Das et al. and Jeong et al. using in vivo imaging, whereby they observed that pioneer metastatic cells remain in the LN SCS to form metastatic foci that grow in size and disrupts the SCS to invade the LN cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Das et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Jeong et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>LN SCS macrophages have been implicated in anti-tumor responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Asano et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Pucci et al., 2016</xref>). We show here another facet of Siglec1<sup>+</sup> SCS macrophages where they physically interact with hypersialylated metastatic cells, conferring growth advantages upon them. Genes affected by Siglec1-cancer cell interactions were not only involved in cell cycle progression and DNA replication, but also in apoptosis and tumor suppression. Accordingly, reduced sialylation in tumor cells reduced the efficiency of metastasis. Our findings also suggest how the organ-specific LN metastasis trait of melanoma arises, and countering hypersialylation may therefore prove to be therapeutically beneficial in preventing LN metastasis and subsequent spread to distal organs.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key

After 1 hr, cells were washed in lectin staining buffer and stained with lectin or mouse Siglec1(ECD)-mFc.</p></sec><sec id="s4-12"><title>Transwell migration assay</title><p>Wild type and <italic>St3gal3</italic> knockout B16F10-GFP cells were serum-starved overnight in DMEM medium. The next day, a single cell suspension was prepared using enzyme-free cell dissociation buffer and 5 × 10<sup>4</sup> cells were added in 100 μl to the upper chambers of 24-well transwell permeable supports with 8 μm pores (Corning). The lower chambers were filled with 650 μl DMEM medium supplemented with 10% FBS as a chemoattractant. Control chambers were filled with DMEM without FBS. After 8 hr of incubation, the upper chambers were washed with PBS and non-migrated cells from the upper side of transwell chambers were removed gently using cotton swabs. Then cells on the lower side of the membranes were fixed with methanol for 10 min. Cells were stained with crystal violet solution for 10 min and thoroughly rinsed with water. After drying the membranes, images were captured on a Zeiss Axio Imager M1 (Carl Zeiss) microscope using a 10 × objective. The number of total migrated cells was counted using the following formula: (average number on cells per image/image area) × 0.33 cm<sup>2</sup>. Next, the percentage of migrated cells was counted using the following formula: (number of migrated cells/50,000) × 100.</p></sec><sec id="s4-13"><title>Metastatic burden of LNs</title><p>To calculate the total number of GFP<sup>+</sup> metastatic cells in LNs, the total number of LN cells was counted after tissue digestion. The number of metastatic cells was determined by gating around GFP<sup>+</sup> cells and the following formula was used to calculate the final number of metastatic cells in LNs: (number of cells in GFP<sup>+</sup> gate/total number of FACS analyzed cells) × total number of LN cells.</p></sec><sec id="s4-14"><title>Transcriptome analysis</title><p>After 18 hr of co-culture of GFP-expressing cancer cells with Siglec1-expressing or mock HEK293T cells in low binding plates, B16-GFP cells were sorted using a BD FACS Aria II or a BD FACS Aria SORP based on GFP expression. Total RNA from samples was isolated using a RNeasy Plus Mini kit (Qiagen). Library preparation for RNA sequencing and data analysis was performed by Macrogen (Macrogen Inc, Korea). Briefly, a TruSeq RNA library (Illumine) was constructed according to the manufacturer’s instructions and RNA-seq was performed on a HiSeq4000 (Illumina). Processed trimmed reads were mapped to known reference genomes through the TopHat program (version 2.0.13) and then aligned to UCSC mm10 using Bowtie aligner (bowtie2 v2.2.3), which allows splice junction processing. After read mapping, transcript assembly work was performed through the cufflinks program (version 2.2.1). As a result, the expression profile values for each sample were obtained for each transcript, and the FPKM (Fragment per Kilobase of Transcript per Million mapped reads) values were compiled based on the gene transcripts. <italic>Siglec1</italic> and <italic>Dhfr</italic> were not included in the differential expressed gene counting and pathway analysis due to their plasmid origin. KEGG pathway analysis of unregulated genes was performed using the database for annotation, visualization and integrated discovery (DAVID) v6.8 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Huang et al., 2009a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Huang et al., 2009b</xref>). GO enrichment analysis of unregulated genes was performed using the Gene Ontology (GO) knowledgebase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Mi et al., 2017</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-15"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>All data are expressed as mean ±s.d. and data points are shown as scatter plots.

requests and the accompanying author responses.</p></boxed-text><p><bold>Acceptance summary:</bold></p><p>In this study, the authors attempt to understand the mechanisms underlying lymph node metastasis, a common site for metastasis for disease such as melanoma. They demonstrate that GFP tagged pioneer metastatic cells interact with Siglec1+ subcapsular sinus macrophages, and that this interaction promotes their proliferation. Importantly, knockout of the St3gal3 sialyltransferase compromised the metastatic efficiency of tumor cells by reducing α-2,3-linked sialylation. These results suggest a mechanism by which tumor cells can coopt a hypersialylated mechanism to promote distant colonization, which may be a paradigm for how other tumors do this as well.</p><p><bold>Decision letter after peer review:</bold></p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Siglec1-expressing subcapsular sinus macrophages provide soil for melanoma lymph node metastasis&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by two peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Päivi Ojala as the Senior Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>In this manuscript, Singh and Choi present data that macrophages in the lymph nodes express Siglec1/CD169, which interacts with sialylated proteins on the surface of B16F10 cells. These data may provide further information as to the mechanism by which melanoma cells colonize lymph nodes, an important initial site of metastasis in this disease. Overall, the data are of interest and will open the way for further investigations. There are several areas the reviewers felt would heighten the impact/generalizability of the data and solidify its importance for the field. Specifically:</p><p>Major requests:</p><p>1) Signaling downstream of Siglec1</p><p>Confocal microscopy shows close association between Siglec1+ macrophages and tumour cells. However, this does not itself prove that signalling mediated by Siglec1/sialylated protein interaction is occurring directly between these cell types. The in vitro experiments showing the responses of B16F10 cells to Siglec1 signalling are weakened by the fact that they are conducted using HEK-293 cells to express Siglec1. Mouse macrophages and human HEK-293 cells would express very different ranges of secreted and cell-surface molecules that could modulate the outcome of Siglec1 signalling.

Also, it appears that the 4T1 breast cancer cells were grown subcutaneously and not in the mammary fat pad. Why was this done? Is the Siglec mediated binding only a result of tumors that are grown in the skin? Were 4T1 only used in one experiment, with no further verification of the proposed mechanism? It seems none of the co-culture experiments with Siglec overexpressing human macrophages or Siglec downregulated murine macrophages were performed with another cell line like 4T1 to determine whether the signaling is specific only to B16 cells. The presented experiments with 4T1 do not address the reviewer's questions about how generalizable the hypersialation and Siglec mechanism would be to other cell lines.</p><p>In Figure 1, examples of cancer cells sitting on SCS macrophages are shown. Are there examples where cancer cells are directly on LECs? The staining seems to show that the SCS macrophages form an almost complete barrier, suggesting that interaction of cancer cells on the SCS layer is not an active process but just result of the density of SCS macrophages.</p><p>Figure 1—figure supplement 3 is missing a LEC stain identify the SCS floor?</p><p>Figure 1—figure supplement 4 A and B.

Further, the author use the term pioneering metastatic cells frequently, but the term should only be used for the earliest arriving cells to the lymph node in vivo, and not to cells in a cell culture dish.</p><p>Figure 2: Why are the SSC-A values so different for panels F and H?

We had no such established protocol/timeline for the mammary fat pad injection experiments from which to determine the appropriate time point that pioneer metastatic cells may land in LNs. As subcutaneous injection of 4T1 cells is reported in the study of LN metastasis, we opted for this route and used our melanoma metastasis timeline as a guide [Hu et al., <italic>Theranostics</italic> 8(3), 3597-3610 (2018)]. We believe 4T1 metastatic cells originating from subcutaneous or mammary fat pad primary tumors colonize the LNs through lymphatic dissemination in a similar fashion, although the timeline might differ due to the different primary tumor growth rates. Of note, Brown et al. [Science 359, 1408-1411 (2018); reference 4 in the main manuscript] demonstrated that 4T1 mammary carcinoma cells even directly injected into popliteal LN afferent lymphatics by intralymphatic microinfusion show a normal lymph node colonization sequence.</p><p>Since we have examined the whole LN colonization process in the context of melanoma (which is reflected in the title of the manuscript), we performed detailed experiments with melanoma cell lines. In response to the reviewer’s query regarding the generalizability of the observations, we examined the initial event at which the metastatic cells landed in the LNs using GFP-expressing 4T1 mouse mammary carcinoma cells to determine whether breast cancer cells, which also frequently metastasize to LNs, also use SCS macrophages for anchorage. In the revised manuscript, we have strictly confined our statement to the similarity of the initial LN metastatic colonization step. We draw from the observations made by Das et al. and Jeong et al. (references 11 and 12 in manuscript, respectively) whereby used intravital microscopy and different tumor cells in mice to observe that LN metastatic cells stay and proliferate in LN SCS before invading the LN sinus, we speculated that breast cancer may also use a similar mechanism to melanoma. We have edited the manuscript text to reflect this inference. Further study is warranted to ascertain that other tumor types also use a similar mechanism.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In Figure 1, examples of cancer cells sitting on SCS macrophages are shown.

The in vivo observations of the SCS macrophage–pioneer metastatic cell interactions, combined with in vitro adhesion assays of Siglec1-overexpressing HEK293T and cancer cells, supports the active contact between Siglec1-expressing SCS macrophages and cancer cells.

Although the data were from a similar co-culture experimental setting, the sample staining procedure and FACS analysis strategy was different. For the Ki67 analysis, we fixed and permeabilized the cells before staining, and for the FACS analysis, cells were gated on forward scatter (FSC) and side scatter (SSC) to eliminate debris. Whereas, for Annexin V staining, live cells were stained (without fixation and permeabilization) and no gating was applied. This was performed to include all live, apoptotic, and dead cells (application note: https://www.bdbiosciences.com/documents/BD_FACSVerse_Apoptosis_Detection_AppNote.pdf). As apoptotic cells show increased granularity, it was important to include high SSC-A cells in the analysis. Therefore, the SSC-A axis in the plots in Figure 2H and Figure 2—figure supplement 2G (Annexin V staining) shows more cells than that in the plots in Figure 2F and Figure 2—figure supplement 2E (Ki67 staining).</p><p>We would like to draw the reviewer’s attention to the fact that the Phosflow product data available on BD Biosciences’ website details a specific procedure, whereby cells are first serum-starved and then stimulated with strong AKT or ERK phosphorylation inducers to generate maximum changes in their phosphorylation status. In contrast in our experiments, at no point were the cells serum-starved, and there was a constant presence of FBS-derived growth factors in the culture media. This would not produce extreme changes in the phosphorylation status of AKT and ERK.

This suggests that the SCS macrophage–lymphatic endothelial cell lining is flexible and keeps the foci in the SCS sinus until it increases in size. Similarly, Das et al., 2013, observed that there was no disruption of the lymphatic lining of SCS when metastatic foci were present within the sinus. When the foci were big enough to invade, we observed that the normal arrangement of the “SCS macrophage–lymphatic endothelial cell lining” was lost at the foci front where cells enter the LN cortex (Figure 1D). We could see gaps in the lymphatic lining at this stage and some of the frontline metastatic cells invading the LN cortex were still attached to the Siglec1<sup>+</sup> macrophages that had lost their place in the SCS lining.

There does appear to be faint Siglec staining on LYVE1+ LECs in the medullary sinuses of macrophage-depleted LNs in Figure 1—figure supplement 2B; however the new experiments performed do indicate that the vast majority of Siglec1 in LNs is expressed on sinusoidal macrophages. The results text should describe the macrophage depletion experiment – currently this appears not to be specifically mentioned.</p></disp-quote><p>We have added the following text to the revised manuscript:</p><p>“Of note, by depleting LN resident macrophages through injecting clodronate liposomes into the mouse footpads, we confirmed that Siglec1 is primarily expressed on SCS and medullary sinus macrophages in LNs (Figure 1—figure supplement 2).”</p></body></sub-article></article>
