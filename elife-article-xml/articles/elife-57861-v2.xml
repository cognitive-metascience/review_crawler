ubiquitous class of protein lipidation across eukaryotes and <italic>N</italic>-myristoyl transferase (NMT) has been proposed as an attractive drug target in several pathogens. Myristoylation often primes for subsequent palmitoylation and stable membrane attachment, however, growing evidence suggests additional regulatory roles for myristoylation on proteins. Here we describe the myristoylated proteome of <italic>Toxoplasma gondii</italic> using chemoproteomic methods and show that a small-molecule NMT inhibitor developed against related <italic>Plasmodium spp</italic>. is also functional in <italic>Toxoplasma</italic>. We identify myristoylation on a transmembrane protein, the microneme protein 7 (MIC7), which enters the secretory pathway in an unconventional fashion with the myristoylated N-terminus facing the lumen of the micronemes. MIC7 and its myristoylation play a crucial role in the initial steps of invasion, likely during the interaction with and penetration of the host cell. Myristoylation of secreted eukaryotic proteins represents a substantial expansion of the functional repertoire of this co-translational modification.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><title>eLife digest</title><p>A microscopic parasite known as <italic>Toxoplasma gondii</italic> infects around 30% of the human population. Most infections remain asymptomatic, but in people with a compromised immune system, developing fetuses and people infected with particular virulent strains of the parasite, infection can be fatal. <italic>T. gondii</italic> is closely related to other parasites that also infect humans, including the one that causes malaria. These parasites have complex lifecycles that involve successive rounds of invading the cells of their hosts, growing and then exiting these cells. Signaling proteins found at specific locations within parasite cells regulate the ability of the parasites to interact with and invade host cells. Sometimes these signaling proteins are attached to membranes using lipid anchors, for example through a molecule called myristic acid.</p><p>An enzyme called NMT can attach myristic acid to one end of its target proteins. The myristic acid tag can influence the ability of target proteins to bind to other proteins, or to membranes. Previous studies have found that drugs that inhibit the NMT enzyme prevent the malaria parasite from successfully invading and growing inside host cells. The NMT enzyme from <italic>T. gondii</italic> is very similar to that of the malaria parasite. Broncel et al. have shown that the drug developed against <italic>P. falciparum</italic> also inhibits the ability of <italic>T. gondii</italic> to grow. These findings suggest that drugs against the NMT enzyme may be useful to treat diseases caused by <italic>T. gondii</italic> and other closely-related parasites.</p><p>Broncel et al. also identified 65 proteins in <italic>T. gondii</italic> that contain a myristic acid tag using an approach called proteomics. One of the unexpected ‘myristoylated’ proteins identified in the experiments is known as MIC7. This protein was found to be transported onto the surface of <italic>T. gondii</italic> parasites and is required in its myristoylated form for the parasite to successfully invade host cells. This was surprising as myristoylated proteins are generally thought to not enter the pathway that brings proteins to the outside of cell.</p><p>These findings suggest that myristic acid on proteins that are secreted can facilitate interactions between cells, maybe by inserting the myristic acid into the cell membrane.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>toxoplasma</kwd><kwd>myristoylation</kwd><kwd>proteomics</kwd><kwd>host cell invasion</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Other</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100010438</institution-id><institution>Francis Crick Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>FC001189</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Broncel</surname><given-names>Malgorzata</given-names></name><name><surname>Dominicus</surname><given-names>Caia</given-names></name><name><surname>Nofal</surname><given-names>Stephanie D</given-names></name><name><surname>Hunt</surname><given-names>Alex</given-names></name><name><surname>Wallbank</surname><given-names>Bethan A</given-names></name><name><surname>Young</surname><given-names>Joanna C</given-names></name><name><surname>Treeck</surname><given-names>Moritz</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000052</institution-id><institution>NIH Office of the Director</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01AI123457</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Broncel</surname><given-names>Malgorzata</given-names></name><name><surname>Dominicus</surname><given-names>Caia</given-names></name><name><surname>Treeck</surname><given-names>Moritz</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000275</institution-id><institution>Leverhulme Trust</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>RPG-2018-107</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Matthews</surname><given-names>Stephen</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000289</institution-id><institution>Cancer Research UK</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>C29637/A20183</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Bartlett</surname><given-names>Edward J</given-names></name><name><surname>Tate</surname><given-names>Edward W</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100010438</institution-id><institution>Francis Crick Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>FC001999</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Federico</surname><given-names>Stefania</given-names></name><name><surname>Young</surname><given-names>Joanna C</given-names></name><name><surname>Treeck</surname><given-names>Moritz</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Institute for Advanced Biosciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Prevention and Therapy of Chronic Diseases grant</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Tardieux</surname><given-names>Isabelle</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Myristoylation of a secreted protein, identified in a global myristoylation analysis of the eukaryotic parasite <italic>Toxoplasma gondii</italic>, is important for host cell invasion.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Toxoplasmosis currently affects approximately one third of the world’s population (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Robert-Gangneux and Dardé, 2012</xref>). It is caused by the obligate protozoan parasite <italic>Toxoplasma gondii</italic> originating from the phylum Apicomplexa. While the majority of human infections are asymptomatic, the disease manifests its severity in immunocompromised individuals, such as those receiving chemotherapy and transplants or in HIV/AIDS patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Montoya and Liesenfeld, 2004</xref>). Key steps in the successful propagation of <italic>Toxoplasma</italic> infection in the acute phase are orchestrated cycles of invasion and egress of tachyzoites from host cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Black and Boothroyd, 2000</xref>). These crucial processes are regulated by several post-translational modifications (PTMs), such as phosphorylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Gaji et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Jacot and Soldati-Favre, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Lourido et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Treeck et al., 2014</xref>), ubiquitination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Silmon de Monerri et al., 2015</xref>), and also protein lipidation, such as palmitoylation and myristoylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Alonso et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Frénal et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>While the extent of protein palmitoylation in <italic>Toxoplasma</italic> has been investigated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Caballero et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Foe et al., 2015</xref>), the myristoylated proteome remains largely uncharacterised. <italic>N</italic>-myristoylation is an irreversible, predominantly co-translational covalent addition of myristic acid to an N-terminal glycine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Boutin, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Gordon et al., 1991</xref>). Functionally, myristoylation often primes proteins for subsequent palmitoylation and a stable protein-membrane association (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Martin et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Wright et al., 2010</xref>), however, it has also been shown to facilitate protein-protein interactions (PPIs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Chow et al., 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Mousnier et al., 2018</xref>), affect protein activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Zhu et al., 2019</xref>) as well as structure and stability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Zheng et al., 1993</xref>). It is catalysed by <italic>N</italic>-myristoyl transferase (NMT), which is conserved across many organisms, including <italic>Toxoplasma</italic>, and has been reported to be a prominent drug target in fungal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Devadas et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Nagarajan et al., 1997</xref>), <italic>Trypanosome</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Frearson et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Wright et al., 2016</xref>) and <italic>Leishmania</italic> infections (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Hutton et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Wright et al., 2015</xref>). In <italic>Plasmodium falciparum</italic> (the major causative agent of malaria), inhibition of NMT leads to severe pleiotropic consequences affecting parasite development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Schlott et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Wright et al., 2014</xref>), highlighting the importance of myristoylation for parasite survival and progression.</p><p>An N-terminal glycine (MG motif) is a requirement, but not a predictor of myristoylation. Approximately 6% of all gene products in <italic>Toxoplasma</italic> contain an N-terminal glycine and an in silico prediction of myristoylation suggests that ~ 1.8% of all <italic>T. gondii</italic> gene products are modified (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Alonso et al., 2019</xref>). The functional significance of myristoylation has been described for only a few <italic>T. gondii</italic> proteins, and mainly in conjunction with adjacent palmitoylation that promotes stable membrane attachment. These proteins include key signal mediators in parasite egress and invasion, for example CDPK3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Garrison et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">McCoy et al., 2012</xref>), PKG (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Brown et al., 2017</xref>), PKAr (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Jia et al., 2017b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Uboldi et al., 2018</xref>); proteins involved in invasion, for example IMP1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Jia et al., 2017a</xref>); parasite gliding, for example GAP45 and GAP70 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Frénal et al., 2010</xref>); division, for example F-box protein 1 and ISP1, 2, 3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Baptista et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Beck et al., 2010</xref>); and correct rhoptry positioning required for invasion, for example ARO (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Cabrera et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Mueller et al., 2013</xref>). Collectively, these studies show key roles for myristoylation throughout the parasite’s lytic cycle, but the function of myristoylation in the absence of palmitoylation and its relationship to other PTMs remains poorly described.</p><p>By combining several chemoproteomic tools for substrate identification with a small-molecule NMT inhibitor, we provide experimentally-validated libraries of myristoylated as well as glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) anchored proteins in <italic>T. gondii</italic>. We identify all the previously reported myristoylated proteins, as well as novel substrates with heterogeneous localisations and variable functions across the lytic cycle. Furthermore, by analysing substrate orthology in other Apicomplexans we provide new clues to the identity of previously uncharacterized myristoylated proteomes across the phylum. We validate the presence and elucidate the functional importance of myristoylation for the microneme protein MIC7, a predicted type I transmembrane protein. Utilizing conditional substrate depletion and complementation with wild-type (cWT) and myristoylation mutant (cMut) versions, we demonstrate that myristoylation of MIC7 is functionally important in host cell invasion. Taken together, our study identifies a large proportion of the <italic>Toxoplasma</italic> myristoylated proteome and points to unexpected and novel functions of myristoylation in <italic>Toxoplasma</italic> that extend beyond priming for palmitoylation and stable membrane attachment.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Metabolic labelling allows for enrichment and visualisation of myristoylated and GPI-anchored proteins in <italic>Toxoplasma</italic></title><p>To visualise the extent of myristoylation in <italic>Toxoplasma,</italic> we adapted a metabolic labelling approach that has previously been applied to mammalian cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Broncel et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Thinon et al., 2014</xref>) and protozoan parasites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Wright et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Wright et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Wright et al., 2015</xref>). In this workflow, a myristic acid (Myr) analogue containing a terminal alkyne group (YnMyr) is added to cell culture upon infection with <italic>Toxoplasma</italic> tachyzoites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). The hydrophobic nature of YnMyr allows for optimal biomimicry of myristate and conversion into the active co-substrate YnMyr-CoA in situ, while the alkyne tag allows for NMT-mediated metabolic labelling of both host and parasite substrate proteins. Upon cell lysis, labelled proteins are liberated and conjugated to azide-bearing multifunctional capture reagents by a click reaction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Heal et al., 2012</xref>). The conjugation process introduces secondary labels, like biotin and fluorophores, allowing for substrate enrichment on streptavidin beads and visualisation via in-gel fluorescence (igFL), respectively. To investigate the extent of YnMyr incorporation, intracellular tachyzoites were treated with either Myr or increasing concentrations of YnMyr for 16 hr. Within this timeframe protein labelling in vivo did not appear to exert any toxic effects on <italic>Toxoplasma</italic> parasites. Labelled proteins were then conjugated to a capture reagent and resolved by SDS-PAGE. As visualised by igFL, the labelling was concentration-dependent with only negligible background (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>). In addition, the extent of labelling did not seem to depend on parasite localisation inside or outside the host cell, and was efficiently out-competed by excess myristate, indicating that YnMyr is an effective mimic of myristate in <italic>Toxoplasma</italic> parasites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref>). To estimate the efficiency of substrate enrichment, we took advantage of the biotin moiety that enables a streptavidin-based pull down.

These two distinct types of labelling can be readily distinguished by their different sensitivity to base treatment; amide bonds are stable in basic conditions, whereas ester bonds are hydrolysed. To visualise the extent of YnMyr incorporation into GPI anchors in <italic>Toxoplasma</italic>, we performed base treatment prior to enrichment of substrate proteins and observed a reduction of igFL signal for selected enriched bands (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). To further validate the base treatment approach, we probed known <italic>N</italic>-myristoylated and GPI-anchored <italic>Toxoplasma</italic> proteins, GAP45 and SAG1, for their ability to be enriched in a base-dependent manner. In the absence of treatment, both proteins were robustly pulled down with YnMyr, while upon base treatment, only GAP45 remained enriched, confirming that it is a true myristoylation substrate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>).

We started with a small-scale pilot experiment to test our workflow and differentiate between <italic>N</italic>-myristoylation-based enrichment and GPI-anchored substrates. We metabolically labelled intracellular tachyzoites of the RH strain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Huynh and Carruthers, 2009</xref>) with either YnMyr or Myr each at 25 µM for 16 hr. We then lysed the infected cell monolayers and performed the click reaction with the azido biotin capture reagent (reagent <bold>1</bold>) to facilitate YnMyr-dependent enrichment of labelled proteins. To distinguish myristoylated from GPI-anchored substrates, we applied base treatment prior to the streptavidin-based pull down. Following trypsin digestion, we analysed samples by LC-MS/MS and performed label free quantification (LFQ) of enriched proteins. We quantified 2363 human and <italic>Toxoplasma</italic> proteins, 349 of which were parasite proteins with YnMyr intensities irrespective of base treatment (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>). To identify GPI-anchored proteins, we calculated log<sub>2</sub> fold changes between base-treated and untreated samples. To threshold we utilised the least extreme negative value (log<sub>2</sub> fold change &lt; −1) quantified from all Surface Antigen Proteins (SAGs) detected in our study, which are known to be GPI-anchored (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1B</xref>). This selection strategy yielded 52 substrates, that included known and predicted GPI-anchored proteins (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>). To identify myristoylated proteins we utilised a stringent selection method based on three criteria: a) robust YnMyr/Myr enrichment (log<sub>2</sub> fold change &gt; 2) with threshold selected based on known myristoylated proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1C</xref>), b) the presence of an MG motif and c) insensitivity to base treatment. 56 proteins met these criteria, including those previously reported as myristoylated (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>). Analysis of post enrichment supernatants did not reveal any substantial changes between proteomes of the YnMyr- and Myr-treated samples, confirming that the observed enrichment is not due to globally altered protein abundance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1D</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>).</p><p>After successful testing of the metabolic labelling workflow, we performed a more elaborate MS experiment using cleavable capture reagents bearing either trypsin (reagent <bold>2</bold>) or TEV (reagent <bold>3</bold>) cleavable linkers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A</xref>). In contrast to a non-cleavable reagent (e.g. reagent <bold>1</bold>) that provides only indirect proof of substrate myristoylation, cleavable reagents allow for detection of myristoylated peptides in addition to peptides that originate from the enriched proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). This additional layer of confidence in MS-based substrate identification is especially important given the high level of non-myristoylation dependent background reported for metabolic labelling with YnMyr (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Broncel et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Wright et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Wright et al., 2015</xref>). While reagent <bold>2</bold> has been validated as a tool for myristoylated protein and peptide discovery (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Broncel et al., 2015</xref>), reagent <bold>3</bold> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Speers and Cravatt, 2005</xref>), which is expected to produce less background and improve myristoylated peptide discovery, has not previously been applied to study protein myristoylation. We therefore first tested reagent <bold>3</bold> in terms of YnMyr-dependent protein enrichment and observed robust pull down of potential NMT substrates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1E</xref>). We next generated samples for the MS workflow as described above but, instead of conjugating reagent <bold>1,</bold> we conjugated either <bold>2</bold> or <bold>3</bold>, each in biological triplicate, to labelled proteins via click reaction to enable myristoylation-dependent pull down. As depicted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>, reagent <bold>2</bold> requires only a single trypsin digestion step to liberate both unmodified and myristoylated peptides in one pool. By contrast, reagent <bold>3</bold> requires both trypsin and TEV protease digestion and, depending on the enzyme combination, releases unmodified and myristoylated peptides in either one (TEV I) or two (TEV II) separate fractions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). In the TEV I strategy TEV protease is used to cleave proteins from beads followed by trypsin digestion of proteins into peptides. The cleavage will only occur for proteins bound via the TEV linker and not for the non-specifically bound ones, which should significantly reduce background. In the TEV II strategy, trypsin is used first to remove most proteins from the beads, only retaining the captured myristoylated peptides. These are then specifically released using TEV protease cleavage resulting in much reduced sample complexity, which increases the myristoylated peptide discovery by MS. Following digestion, all samples were subjected to LC-MS/MS, and LFQ was performed to identify proteins robustly enriched in YnMyr-dependent manner. This yielded 206 human and 117 <italic>T. gondii</italic> proteins bearing an N-terminal MG motif (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref>). Within the parasite protein pool, we obtained statistically significant (FDR 1%, log<sub>2</sub> fold change &gt;2) enrichment in YnMyr over Myr controls for 72 potential substrates using reagent <bold>2</bold> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref>). For reagent <bold>3,</bold> which was used in two different scenarios (TEV I and TEV II) resulting in larger variability between replicates, we utilised a fold change based threshold (log<sub>2</sub> fold change &gt;2) and obtained 48 robustly enriched proteins (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref>). Reassuringly, we observed a ~ 5 and~8 fold reduction in background in TEV I vs TEV II and TEV I vs reagent <bold>2</bold>, respectively, as shown by the number of proteins quantified in Myr controls (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref>).

A further seven proteins for which we obtained myristoylated peptides were not quantified at the highest concentration of IMP-1002 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp3">Supplementary file 3</xref>), suggesting that their myristoylation state, and therefore enrichment, is most affected by NMT inhibition.</p><p>A significant response to NMTi was also observed for seven proteins that did not contain the MG motif (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp3">Supplementary file 3</xref>).

Stable attachment at membranes may require a double acylation, that is both myristoylation and palmitoylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Wright et al., 2010</xref>), however, only 30% of our substrates were previously reported to be palmitoylated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Caballero et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Foe et al., 2015</xref>) and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp4">Supplementary file 4</xref>). Since palmitoylation is frequently enriched at the protein N-terminus, in close proximity to the myristate, we analysed the first 20 amino acid sequences of our substrates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1A</xref>) and found that approximately half possessed cysteine residues (sites of palmitoylation) and, hence, the potential for double acylation. This number correlated well with the 54% palmitoylation prediction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Ren et al., 2008</xref>) for our substrate pool (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp4">Supplementary file 4</xref>). The reported and predicted palmitoylation data suggested that 12 of the 18 PM substrates likely utilise double acylation for stable membrane attachment while the remaining six may be targeted to the PM via alternative mechanisms. Of the 9 IMC localised substrates, 8 are reported or predicted as palmitoylated as well as 4 of the 5 Golgi-localised ones. This indicates that double acylation is a strong predictor for membrane targeting, albeit to different localisations within the cell, suggesting that further signals are required for their definitive subcellular localisation.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig4" position="float"><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><title>The myristoylated proteome of <italic>Toxoplasma gondii</italic>.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Distribution of the subcellular localisation across our substrate list.

Consistent with this, all cytosolic and proteasome localised substrates were deprived of any palmitoylation and only 3 of the 12 nuclear proteins were shown to be palmitoylated. Within this varied group were CDPK1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Ojo et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Pomel et al., 2008</xref>), the two phosphatases PPM2A and PPM2B (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Yang et al., 2019</xref>) and, surprisingly, the microneme protein MIC7 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Meissner et al., 2002</xref>).

TGGT1_249970 was recently described as a protein on the microneme surface where dual acylation is important for its anchoring into the membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Bullen et al., 2016</xref>). The second protein (TGGT1_309990) is annotated as a multi-pass transmembrane protein of unknown function. The third, and perhaps the most interesting, was the microneme protein MIC7 (TGGT1_261780). MIC7 has been reported to be a putative type I transmembrane protein, comprising an N-terminal signal peptide, five EGF-like domains, a membrane-spanning region, and a short cytoplasmic tail (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Meissner et al., 2002</xref>). As MIC signal peptides are typically co-translationally cleaved upon entry into the ER (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Soldati et al., 2001</xref>), the presence of a myristate within the classical signal sequence of MIC7 was unusual. In addition, MIC7 has been suggested to be predominantly expressed in bradyzoites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Meissner et al., 2002</xref>), the lifecycle stage responsible for the chronic phase of <italic>T. gondii</italic> infection. As our experiments were performed exclusively in tachyzoites, the stage responsible for acute infection, the presence of MIC7 within our dataset could represent a potential false positive identification. To exclude this possibility, we mined MS-based quantification data from an experiment comparing bradyzoite and tachyzoite proteomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Young et al., 2020</xref>; PXD019729).

While cWT rescued the iKO phenotype upon RAPA treatment, cMut parasites formed substantially smaller plaques under equivalent conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E</xref>). This demonstrates that myristoylation indeed plays a key role in MIC7 function. Given the well-established role of microneme proteins in facilitating host cell penetration, we explored whether myristoylation of MIC7 may be important for invasion. We treated iKO, cWT and cMut parasites with RAPA and performed a red/green assay (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Huynh et al., 2003</xref>) which can distinguish invaded from attached parasites. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6F</xref>, we observed efficient invasion of host cells by the cWT parasites. This was not the case in the iKO and cMut lines, where invasion was reduced by 57% and 32%, respectively. Compared to the cWT line, we also observed a consistent 61% drop in the total number of iKO parasites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6G</xref>), which suggests a defect in the attachment to host cells. A modest but non-significant reduction of 15% in attachment was observed in the cMut strain. Collectively, these results indicate that MIC7 plays an important role in <italic>Toxoplasma</italic> propagation by facilitating parasite attachment and subsequent entry into host cells. Furthermore, myristoylation is not required for sorting MIC7 to the micronemes but appears to be important for its function in invasion of host cells.</p></sec><sec id="s2-7"><title>Generation of double tagged MIC7 lines for in depth characterisation of MIC7 myristoylation</title><p>To monitor MIC7 N-terminus, and thus the fate of the myristate, we generated double tagged MIC7 variants bearing a Myc tag in the ectodomain and a Ty1 tag at the C-terminus. Placing a Myc tag in the region between the MIC7 transmembrane (TM) domain and the last predicted EGF domain (EGF5) yielded non-functional protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1A</xref>). To select a likely suitable position for the tag, we resorted to structural predictions. The region between EGF5 and the TM domain (EGF5-TM, residues 230–284) possesses two pairs of cysteine residues and may represent either an extension of EGF5, or a non-canonical/truncated EGF6. This could explain the inability to place an epitope tag in this region and yield functional MIC7. We also excluded EGF3 and EGF4, that possess the strongest signatures for calcium-binding motifs (PFAM database domain entry PF07645), which normally imparts a rigid domain arrangement with its neighbours. Finally, we considered possible locations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>) where some degree of structural flexibility would be most likely. The loop between the last two cysteine residues is variable amongst EGF domains, therefore locations were chosen between C38 and C53 of EGF1 and between C86 and C97 of EGF2 as well as within the linker between EGF1 and EGF2. Using ectopic expression, we tested all these positions in terms of protein expression and localisation. All three double tagged protein variants localised to micronemes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1B</xref>), but the most abundant protein levels were observed when the Myc tag was placed within the EGF2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1C</xref>). This indicated that the tag is well tolerated in this position, readily detected by western blot and could be used for further experiments. Myc tagged cWT and cMut (hereafter called <sup>Myc</sup>cWT and <sup>Myc</sup>cMut, respectively) were then inserted into the <italic>Uprt</italic> locus of the iKO line. Both inserts correctly integrated, the new lines retained efficient RAPA-induced <italic>Mic7</italic> excision and depletion of MIC7<sup>HA</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1D–F</xref>). After verifying equivalent and RAPA independent expression of the <sup>Myc</sup>cWT and <sup>Myc</sup>cMut (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1F</xref>), we confirmed their micronemal localisation by IFA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1G</xref>). Several microneme proteins have been shown to dimerise (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Cérède et al., 2002</xref>), which harbours the potential that any additional copy of a protein in a merodiploid strain, even when lacking trafficking information, could piggy back as a heterodimer into the micronemes. Indeed, when testing co-IPs in the absence of RAPA, we observed that both complements can co-IP with MIC7<sup>HA</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>), which is independent of the myristate. We therefore repeated the localisation experiments in the presence of RAPA to delete MIC7<sup>HA</sup>.

This slightly reduced ability to form plaques is likely due to the effect of Myc tag insertion on the MIC7 function. However, since the tag is present in both complemented lines and the ability to form plaques was substantially more impeded in the <sup>Myc</sup>cMut parasites, these lines are still suitable to investigate the specific function of MIC7 myristoylation.</p></sec><sec id="s2-8"><title>MIC7 and its myristoylation are important for the initiation of host cell invasion</title><p>In order to shed some light on MIC7 topology within the micronemes as well as the fate of its N-terminal myristate, we performed proteinase K protection assays (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D</xref>). In these experiments, proteins/domains that are accessible to proteinase K after digitonin-mediated plasma membrane permeabilisation are digested, while those retained within organelles, such as the micronemes, are protected from this proteolytic digest. We treated tachyzoites from both <sup>Myc</sup>cWT and <sup>Myc</sup>cMut lines with RAPA to deplete MIC7<sup>HA</sup> and fed with YnMyr to allow for myristoylation-dependent pull down of the complements. We then subjected parasites to digitonin and proteinase K treatment, followed by detection of Myc and Ty1 tags. As a control we used antibodies against the ectodomain of MIC2, as it should be protected (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Bullen et al., 2016</xref>). Under these conditions the MIC7 C-terminus was digested, while the N-terminus was protected as visualised by the Ty1 and the Myc antibodies, respectively. As the parasites were treated with YnMyr prior to the experiment, we could use a YnMyr-dependent pull down to demonstrate that the protected N-terminus of MIC7 remains myristoylated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D</xref>). These results strongly suggest that MIC7 is indeed a transmembrane protein with a myristoylated N-terminus facing the microneme lumen and a short C-terminal cytoplasmic tail that faces the parasite cytoplasm.</p><p>Having established the presence of MIC7 N-terminal myristoylation within the micronemes, we aimed to perform a more detailed characterisation of its function. First, we repeated invasion assays in large scale as described in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Touquet et al., 2018</xref>. We performed three independent experiments with a total of 15 replicates per tested parasite line (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7E</xref>). Taking into account the phenotypic effect for the Myc tag insertion in complemented parasite lines we used untreated iKO parasites as a parental control. Parasites that no longer expressed MIC7<sup>HA</sup> displayed a 78% decrease in invasiveness when compared to the control. Complementation with <sup>Myc</sup>cWT copy can restore the invasiveness to 61%, while <sup>Myc</sup>cMut reach only 30% invasion capacity. These results are largely consistent with our previous observations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6F</xref>) and further confirm the critical role for MIC7 and its myristoylation in the invasion process.</p><p>To gain a better understanding of the function of MIC7 during host cell penetration, we filmed invasion of the DMSO and RAPA-treated iKO and the complemented lines into GFP-GPI expressing host cells (<xref ref-type="video" rid="fig7video1">Figure 7—videos 1</xref>–<xref ref-type="video" rid="fig7video4">4</xref>). We calculated times of successful and failed invasions for each genetic background and observed that despite different success rates between lines, the parasites that did enter the host cell proceed with a similar speed as the control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7F</xref>, <xref ref-type="video" rid="fig7video1">Figure 7—videos 1</xref>–<xref ref-type="video" rid="fig7video4">4</xref>). This suggests a potential failure to initiate invasion. In several failed invasion events we also observed a notable membrane invagination (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s2">Figure 7—figure supplement 2A</xref>, <xref ref-type="video" rid="fig7video2">Figure 7—videos 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="video" rid="fig7video4">4</xref>), which normally occurs after secretion of the rhoptry neck components required for the formation of the tachyzoite-host cell junction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bichet et al., 2016</xref>). It is worth noting, that the immunofluorescent analysis of likely aborted invasion events in the RAPA treated iKO line revealed more than half of extracellular parasites (45 of 68) show a strong arch-shaped morphology while associated with a host cell (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7G</xref>). This is indicative of MIC7 KO parasites exerting force during the attempt to invade, possibly leading to the zoite deformation.</p><p>The inability to initiate invasion in the iKO and <sup>Myc</sup>cMut lines could be caused by a general defect in gliding motility or a failure to secrete micronemes. However, both circular and helical trails were detected with no obvious differences between parasites (<xref ref-type="video" rid="fig7video1">Figure 7—videos 1</xref>–<xref ref-type="video" rid="fig7video4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s2">Figure 7—figure supplement 2B</xref>). We also observed no reduction in microneme secretion, as shown by efficient MIC2 processing in MIC7 KO parasites, even in the presence of 5-benzyl-3-isopropyl-1H-pyrazolo[4,3-d]pyrimidin-7(6H)-one (BIPPO), a phosphodiesterase inhibitor that triggers signalling pathways leading to increased parasite motility and microneme secretion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s2">Figure 7—figure supplement 2C</xref>).</p><p>To get a better understanding of MIC7 distribution in parasites before and during invasion, we co-localised MIC7 with SAG1, a well characterized surface marker, which can be used to delineate the intra- and extracellular part of invading parasites. This revealed that MIC7 partially redistributes around the periphery of extracellular and invading parasites, but appears absent from the tachyzoite-host cell junction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7H</xref>), a constriction through which the parasite moves as it enters the host cell (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Pavlou et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Tyler et al., 2011</xref>). This redistribution suggests, but is not proof, that MIC7, as many other microneme proteins, is secreted onto the parasite surface during or after egress from the host cell. Most transmembrane microneme proteins undergo proteolytic maturation near or within the transmembrane domain after egress and during invasion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Soldati et al., 2001</xref>). This process is facilitated by subtilisin or rhomboid proteases and is thought to relieve the high affinity interactions between the parasite and host cell receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Carruthers, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Dowse and Soldati, 2005</xref>). We analysed if MIC7 could undergo similar processing and found that while MIC2 was efficiently cleaved and released into the culture supernatant, this was not the case for MIC7, even in the presence of BIPPO (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7I</xref>). We also tested whether MIC7 could be shed during invasion by analysing the culture supernatant as well as parasite and host material of freshly invaded cells. Again, no MIC7 shedding was observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s2">Figure 7—figure supplement 2D</xref>). These results are in agreement with previously reported observations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Meissner et al., 2002</xref>), and confirm that MIC7 is not subject to a proteolytic cleavage.</p></sec><sec id="s2-9"><title>MIC7 and its myristoylation may be important for efficient secretion of rhoptry contents into the host cell</title><p>The live imaging data of the iKO parasites suggested that MIC7 plays an important role in the onset of invasion, potentially after the establishment of the tachyzoite-host cell junction. In one instance we could observe a membrane swirl formation at the apex of the parasite attempting invasion, suggesting that rhoptry contents may have been secreted (<xref ref-type="video" rid="fig7video2">Figure 7—video 2</xref>). Rhoptries are apical organelles which contain a number of kinases the parasite injects into the host cell upon invasion. These effector kinases modulate many important functions in host-microbe interaction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Boothroyd and Dubremetz, 2008</xref>). One of these kinases, the rhoptry kinase 16 (ROP16) acts as a JAK mimetic leading to rapid and direct phosphorylation of STAT6 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Ong et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Saeij et al., 2007</xref>). Accordingly, we used STAT6 phosphorylation as a reporter for efficient rhoptry secretion and ROP16 translocation into the host cell (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7J</xref>). RAPA-treated <sup>Myc</sup>cWT parasites showed 45% pSTAT6 positive nuclei. RAPA-treated iKO and <sup>Myc</sup>cMut parasites showed a significant reduction of pSTAT6 positive nuclei (11% and 21%, respectively). No significant differences in pSTAT6 positive cells between tested parasite lines were observed when treated with DMSO. This indicates that iKO and <sup>Myc</sup>cMut parasites can still secrete ROP16 into the host cell and induce STAT6 phosphorylation, although at significantly reduced levels.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Our understanding of myristoylation and its functional consequences in <italic>Toxoplasma</italic> is hampered by the limited knowledge of NMT substrates. Using an integrated MS-approach we describe here the first experimentally validated myristoylated proteome in <italic>T. gondii</italic>. We combine two orthogonal chemoproteomic techniques, that is quantitative response to NMT inhibition with direct MS/MS evidence for substrate modification, which allows for high confidence in substrate identification as well as substantial substrate coverage. Despite the complex nature of our samples, consisting of both human and parasite proteins, our discovery includes all proteins previously reported to be myristoylated in <italic>Toxoplasma</italic> as well as novel and unexpected <italic>Tg</italic>NMT substrates. The fact that these proteins are functionally diverse, and involved in all steps of the lytic cycle highlights the importance of myristoylation in <italic>Toxoplasma</italic> biology. Consistent with this, treatment with NMTi resulted in dose dependent parasite killing. Although we cannot exclude small off-target effects of IMP-1002 that was originally designed for <italic>Plasmodium spp.</italic>, we predict that this severe phenotype was largely due to pleiotropic effects of <italic>Tg</italic>NMT inhibition on the <italic>Toxoplasma</italic> lytic cycle. Potent and selective <italic>Tg</italic>NMT inhibitors are yet to be reported, however extensive work in other protozoan parasites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Ritzefeld et al., 2018</xref>) demonstrates that selective NMT inhibition could provide an attractive strategy to combat infection. Moreover, results presented here indicate that related parasites, with high structural conservation of their NMTs, could be inhibited by a single compound, which may allow for the development of a pan-parasite inhibitor in the future.</p><p>Our substrates showed heterogeneous localisation with ca. 50% localised to PM or membrane bound compartments. Palmitoylation analysis confirmed that for the majority of these substrates stable attachment to membranes is likely driven by double acylation. Although we cannot exclude the presence of other secondary signals which could aid in PM targeting within our substrate pool, such as polybasic regions and PPI sites, our analysis and the predicted localisation suggest that many of our substrates may be myristoylated only, indicating that their myristoylation can serve more discrete functions than just a priming site for the palmitate. Such alternate functions could include reversible membrane binding by the conformation regulated exposure of the myristate as shown for mammalian ARF1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Goldberg, 1998</xref>), regulation of protein activity as demonstrated for GPAT4 during glycerolipid synthesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Zhu et al., 2019</xref>), or involvement in PPIs, as shown for the viral capsid assembly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Chow et al., 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Mousnier et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>Here we identified unexpected myristoylation of the <italic>Toxoplasm</italic>a microneme protein 7 (MIC7). Microneme proteins are key factors in <italic>Toxoplasma</italic> propagation involved in parasite egress, motility and host cell invasion. They are trafficked into the secretory pathway by virtue of an N-terminal signal peptide that is cleaved during ER import (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Soldati et al., 2001</xref>). We show that MIC7 is an important, yet not essential protein and we unequivocally demonstrate that MIC7 is myristoylated at its N-terminus, excluding the existence of an N-terminal signal sequence. While it is known that proteins can enter the secretory pathway by virtue of a recessed signal or leader peptide, this has not been reported for microneme proteins. Furthermore, many known microneme proteins are type I transmembrane proteins, where an N-terminal PPI or carbohydrate binding domain faces the microneme lumen and a short cytoplasmic domain faces the parasite cytosol. Upon microneme secretion the protein is transferred to the parasite PM, with the interacting domain exposed to bind to host cell receptors. Because MIC7 lacks a signal peptide but otherwise mimics this domain structure, it most likely enters the secretory pathway as a type III transmembrane protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Goder and Spiess, 2001</xref>). Although we have not specifically tested this here, this is supported by several features in the MIC7 primary amino acid sequence. That is: a transmembrane domain of &gt; 20 amino acids in length (22 in MIC7) and positive charges on the C-terminal side of the transmembrane domain.</p><p>We demonstrated that MIC7 and its myristoylation are important in host cell invasion. Live imaging of the invasion process further revealed a potential defect in initiating invasion in the MIC7 KO and myristoylation defective parasites. This phenomenon was not caused by a fault in microneme secretion itself or parasite gliding. The live video analysis suggests that the parasites may be able to initiate the tachyzoite-host cell junction (supported by some rhoptry content secretion as measured by STAT6 phosphorylation), but then fail to progress beyond the initiation. This phenotype is similar to <italic>Toxoplasma</italic> Myosin A knockout parasites, that are also able to initiate invasion, but then fail to invade given the lack of a functional actin-myosin system. However, the strong arch-shaped deformation of extracellular MIC7 KO parasites in live invasion assays is substantially different from the MyoA knockouts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bichet et al., 2016</xref>). While we could not unequivocally show that MIC7 is secreted to the zoite surface to engage with host cell receptors via its EGF domains, the fact that it redistributes around the periphery of the cell shortly after egress and during invasion supports this scenario. When secreted, the myristate could contribute to specific PPIs with other surface proteins or potentially host ligands to support attachment and initiate invasion.</p><p>It is also tempting to speculate that alternatively, the myristate could be inserted into the lipid bilayer of the host cell. It has been shown that HBV viruses can utilise a myristoylated protein on their surface to enter host cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Maurer-Stroh and Eisenhaber, 2004</xref>). In <italic>Toxoplasma</italic> this mechanism could contribute to host cell attachment, for which we observed a measurable defect upon MIC7 deletion, but also to the earliest events of invasion, that is rhoptry secretion or host-cell penetration. This is reminiscent of MIC8, another microneme protein, that has been implicated in a signalling cascade leading to rhoptry discharge (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Kessler et al., 2008</xref>). Our experiments to probe secretion of ROP16, which rapidly phosphorylates STAT6 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Ong et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Saeij et al., 2007</xref>), indicate that rhoptry secretion per se is not affected upon MIC7 deletion, but reduced ROP16 mediated STAT6 phosphorylation is observed. We cannot currently distinguish whether the decrease in ROP16 injected cells is due to decreased invasion efficiency of MIC7 KO and <sup>Myc</sup>cMut lines, or whether equal amounts of cells have been attempted to be invaded but ROP16 has not been efficiently transferred. However, the attachment phenotype observed for MIC7 myristoylation mutants is less profound than the reduction of pSTAT6 induction, suggesting that the major cause of the rhoptry secretion phenotype is independent of attachment and most likely due to an inefficient translocation of rhoptry contents into the host cell. Whether the failure to progress beyond the initiation of the tachyzoite-host cell junction lies in a failure to properly secrete rhoptry contents, or to form the junction itself remains to be clarified.</p><p>In summary we provide a useful resource of experimentally validated myristoylated and GPI-anchored proteins, as well as first clues to the identity of so far uncharacterized myristoylated proteomes across the phylum. We show that an NMT inhibitor that was generated against <italic>Plasmodium spp.</italic> also inhibits <italic>Toxoplasma</italic> growth. The presence of several essential <italic>N</italic>-myristoylated proteins conserved across many Apicomplexa indicates that NMT inhibition by a single compound may be a viable strategy to target several pathogens. We have identified N-terminal myristoylation on a <italic>Toxoplasma</italic> protein that uses an unconventional mode of trafficking to the parasite secretory pathway and the micronemes, and displays a novel use of myristoylation in parasite biology. This unexpected discovery, which can likely be found in other organisms, demonstrates how our dataset can serve as a tool in target-specific investigations that can ultimately help to unravel the exciting biology of host-microbe or more broadly, cell-cell interactions.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource"

Peptides were identified from the MS/MS spectra searched against <italic>Toxoplasma gondii</italic> (combined TG1, ME49 and VEG proteomes, ToxoDB) and <italic>Homo sapiens</italic> (UniProt) proteomes using Andromeda (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Cox et al., 2011</xref>) search engine. Cysteine carbamidomethylation was selected as a fixed modification and methionine oxidation was selected as a variable modification. The enzyme specificity was set to trypsin with a maximum of 2 missed cleavages. The precursor mass tolerance was set to 20 ppm for the first search (used for mass re-calibration) and to 4.5 ppm for the main search. The datasets were filtered on posterior error probability (PEP) to achieve a 1% false discovery rate on protein, peptide and site level. Other parameters were used as pre-set in the software. ‘Unique and razor peptides’ mode was selected to allow identification and quantification of proteins in groups (razor peptides are uniquely assigned to protein groups and not to individual proteins). Label-free quantification (LFQ) in MaxQuant was performed using a built-in label-free quantification algorithm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Cox and Mann, 2008</xref>) enabling the ‘Match between runs’ option (time window 0.7 min) within replicates. Each experiment comprised of replicates treated with YnMyr and the same number of replicates treated with Myr control or NMTi. The LFQ is based on intensities of proteins calculated by MaxQuant from peak intensities and based on the ion currents carried by peptides whose sequences match a specific protein or a protein group to provide an approximation of abundance.</p><p>Myristoylated peptide search in MaxQuant was performed as described above applying the following variable modifications: cysteine carbamidomethylation, +463.2907 (reagent <bold>2</bold>) and +491.3220 (reagent <bold>3</bold>) at any peptide N-terminus and cysteine residues. In addition, the minimum peptide length was reduced to six amino acids and the ‘Match between runs’ option was disabled. MaxQuant utilises a scoring algorithm when matching experimental MS/MS spectra with a library of theoretical spectra generated from the in silico digestion of proteins within databases selected for the search. The algorithm is used to evaluate the quality of peptide-spectrum matches (PSMs). To each PSM, MaxQuant also attributes a delta score, which is a difference between scores associated with the match to the best peptide candidate and the second best match within the database. The higher the score and the delta score, the more reliable the identification. In order to reduce a possibility for a false peptide sequence assignment even further, we applied relatively high delta score thresholds (20 vs 6 pre-set as default) for all myristoylated peptides in our analysis.

After 3x washes with PBS, cells were incubated with goat anti-rabbit Alexa Fluor 594 (1:2000; Life Technologies) and goat anti-mouse Alexa Fluor 488 (1:2,000; Life Technologies) secondary antibodies and 5 µg/mL DAPI (Sigma) for 1 hr followed by 3x washes with PBS. Images were obtained using a Nikon Eclipse Ti-U inverted fluorescent microscope using a 20x objective and analysed using FIJI software. ≥5 fields of view per condition were analysed in three independent experiments. The number of pSTAT6 positive HFFs was normalised to the total number of HFFs, and results were statistically tested with a two-way ANOVA with Sidak’s multiple comparison test in GraphPad Prism 8. The data are presented as mean ± SD.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We would like to thank Peter Bradley, Matt Bogyo, Vern Carruthers, and John Boothroyd for sharing reagents as well as the teams from EupathDB and ToxoDB for their valuable contributions to the community.

Indeed any experiments that would mechanistically explore the role of myristoylation for MIC7 or CDPK1 would take considerably longer than two months, and the same holds true for the curation and interpretation of the myristoylome as well as providing data with NMT inhibitors for recovery of true Myred proteins.

The authors provided data, suggesting that Myristoylation of MIC7 is important in host cell invasion.</p><p>This is a very interesting paper in the field of lipid modifications in the obligate protozoan parasite <italic>Toxoplasma gondii</italic> and I particularly appreciated the strategy(ies) used to depict these tricky modifications on proteins. Nonetheless, the specificity of the MIC7Myristoylation effect claimed in the paper, which is not given a mechanistic explanation except for the possible involvement in host cell invasion, should be thoroughly re-considered to make the paper really convincing.</p><p>The experiments appear accurately preformed and well presented but a number of points required clarification.</p><p>Major concerns:</p><p>1) As the authors reported and already known, YnMyr can be non-specifically incorporated on amino acids differently than N-terminal glycines given the high level of non-myristoylation dependent background. To identify the YnMyr incorporation into N-terminal glycines, the commonly accepted method is the use of NMT inhibitors.</p><p>I understand the authors' method to distinguish between incorporation of YnMyr in N-Gly or GPI anchors, but to be convincing and to validate the base treatment the authors should also show data with NMT inhibitors for recovery of true Myred proteins.</p><p>2) Authors should report the list of 206 human proteins claimed to bear the MG myristoylation motif (subsection “Identification of the myristoylated proteome in <italic>T. gondii”</italic>) and compare the retrieved proteins with the recent reported complete list of human Myred proteins (Castrec et al., 2018) to validate their approach. This list is missing for the moment.</p><p>3) Alternative experiments concerning the cellular localization of CDPK1 will help better to understand the function of lipidation of this protein in <italic>Toxoplasma gondii</italic>. The data presented are not convincing.</p><p>4) As reported above, no mechanistic inside is reported to explain how myristoylation of MIC7 plays a role in the invasion of the host cells. This is a very important aspect of the work that should be further investigated.</p><p>5) Of all myristoylated proteins identified is not clear why the authors decided to focus on the two specific proteins (CDPK1 and MIC7). Although I can understand the characterization of MIC7, I'm a bit sceptic about the advances brought by CDPK1 data (already known to undergo myristoylation in most organism).</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>Broncel et al., uses chemoproteomic techniques to identify myristoylated proteins in <italic>Toxoplasma</italic> and then validate two targets and derive functional information about the role of this modification during the lytic cycle. Myristoylation is a non-reversible modification (as compared to palmitoylation) and can occur either by itself or in partnership with nearby palmitoylation. Indeed, it is dogma that myristoylation is required for subsequent palmitoylation, at least in <italic>Toxoplasma</italic>. This work proceeds work done on the identification of palmitoylated proteins in both <italic>Toxoplasma</italic> and Plasmodium as well as the identification of myristoylated proteins in <italic>P. falciparum</italic> and investigations on its importance. Further, proteins that are both myristoylated and palmitoylated have been predicted, their localisation and function of these sites, in combination, investigated. The substrates that Broncel et al., identify here include these dually acylated proteins, validating their approach and also include many novel molecules. Broncel also duly acknowledge all this previous work.</p><p>Whilst this reviewer is not a chemical biologist, the approach taken to identify myristoylated proteins seems robust, well controlled and has been well validated. This dataset will be useful for others that are interested in acylation in <italic>Toxoplasma</italic> or determining whether their protein of interest is myristoylated. Further, this dataset also provides potential information on whether <italic>Toxoplasma</italic> proteins have a GPI anchor.</p><p>Presumably, because of the extensive work been done on dual acylation (myristoylation and palmitoylation together) the authors chose to study proteins that they suspect (but not proven) to be only myristoylated and not palmitoylated. They were able to show that the myristoylation site of both CDPK1 and MIC7 are functionally important, albeit limited.</p><p>The main issues I have with this paper is one of novelty. Whilst this work is robust, well validated and its functional relevance investigated, none of this is surprising. The real interesting question is, and where the field is at, is understanding what myristoylation is doing over and above membrane affinity and what relevance does this have to parasite biology? Again, it is unsurprising that loss of myristoylation leads to changes in solubility (as a surrogate for localisation), but the real interest is what other function might this modification have? This could be particularly interesting with MIC7 where it appears not to have an SP, and myristoylation not required for apparent correct localisation. What about is whether myristoylation is required for surface display or secretion? This might review novel biology of this lipid modification.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic></p><p>Acylation has been shown to influence eukaryotic protein function in a variety of contexts. In <italic>Toxoplasma gondii</italic> several studies have shown acylation to be important for specific proteins, and global studies have been undertaken to describe the complement of palmitoylated proteins. However, the full extent of myristoylation-a modification often required to license palmitoylation, but also important in its own right-has not been systematically examined in the context of the <italic>T. gondii</italic> proteome. The present study is an important resource, addressing this gap in our understanding. Through several complementary mass-spectrometry experiments, the authors identify novel and known myristoylated proteins. For two of the identified proteins, CDPK1 and MIC7, the authors use complementation of knockouts to demonstrate the functional importance of myristoylation. Although, the precise role of myristoylation is not uncovered for either candidate, the evidence supporting a role for the modification is strong. The major concerns listed below therefore fall into two main categories: (1) curating the results and interpretation of the myristoylome to ensure its utility as a resource, and (2) ensuring the rigor of test cases.</p><p>1) In reference to Figure 1—figure supplement 1A, the statement &quot;without any detectable background&quot; is not supported by the visible background in the figure. The authors later also state that &quot;this additional layer of confidence in target identification is especially important given the high level of non-myristoylation dependent background reported for metabolic tagging with YnMyr,&quot; contradicting their prior statement about low background. Please clarify in the text.</p><p>2) What is the evidence that &quot;protein tagging in vivo was non-toxic&quot;? It seems that the statement should be limited to the 16h incubation used unless long-term culture experiments in the presence of YnMyr were performed. It is also unclear how the extracellular labeling in Figure 1—figure supplement 1B was performed. Please clarify in the text.</p><p>3) In Figure 1B, it is formally possible that alkaline treatment is altering proteins beyond the cleavage of the GPI-anchored label (e.g. causing precipitation or aggregation). The authors should repeat the alkaline treatment after blotting onto the membrane, prior to detection. Alternatively, they could include the noted caveat in the text.</p><p>4) In Figure 2D, could the authors explain the YnMyr/Myr-enriched proteins that are categorized as &quot;Non-targets&quot;? Were they only identified in a single experiment? Which experiment are fold enrichment and statistics for this figure drawn from?</p><p>5) Can the authors address the different patterns of labeling observed in Figure 1—figure supplement 1A-C compared to Figure 2—figure supplement 2E? Please provide an explanation in the text.</p><p>6) It is unclear why there was decreased background in TEV-I compared TEV-II, when in both cases the analyte is TEV-eluted and should therefore experience the same background reduction compared to reagent 2. Please clarify in the text.</p><p>7) At several points, the authors compare their results to those of the previous palmitoylation studies to identify myristoylated proteins that were not palmitoylated. It would be informative to perform the converse analysis, to identify palmitoylated proteins that were not identified as myristoylated. Such an analysis might be an orthogonal way of identifying proteins that might have been missed.</p><p>8) For Figure 6F-G, since invasion and attachment are performed following rapamycin treatment of all strains, it would be important to include a wildtype strain as the appropriate strain for normalization, instead of normalizing to the complemented strain (i.e. if the complementation is not working properly, we would not be able to tell from Figure 6).</p><p>9) If MIC7 is dispensable, were the authors able to isolate knockout parasites from the population and maintain them in culture?</p><p>[Editors’ note: further revisions were suggested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Profiling of myristoylation in <italic>Toxoplasma gondii</italic> reveals an N-myristoylated protein important for host cell penetration&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by Dominique Soldati-Favre as the Senior Editor, a Reviewing Editor, and three reviewers.

Since no new experiments are requested the lockdown situation should not present a barrier.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>Myristoylation is an irreversible lipid modification that is important for priming subsequent acylation, but on its own has been shown to have additional regulatory roles including facilitating protein-protein interactions. This modification is catalyzed in the cytoplasm by N-myristoyl transferase (NMT). In the protozoan parasite, <italic>Toxoplasma gondii</italic>, the functional significance of myristoylation has been studied for a handful of proteins. Broncel et al., use chemoproteomic methods to globally identify myristoylated proteins-including many modified peptides-in <italic>Toxoplasma</italic>. Using these approaches, the authors identify known myristoylated proteins as well as novel candidates and choose to pursue one of these, MIC7, for additional characterization.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) For the pilot experiment, to define a protein as myristoylated, the authors required robust enrichment (YnMyr/Myr log<sub>2</sub> fold change &gt; 2), the presence of an MG motif, and insensitivity towards base treatment. It would be helpful to assess this enrichment cutoff by plotting the enrichments of all proteins and highlight known gold standards.</p><p>2) The authors claim that there are no substantial differences between the YnMyr and Myr proteomes by comparing the protein abundance of supernatants. Given the near-complete pulldown efficiency (Figure 1—figure supplement 1C), no conclusions should be made about overall substrate abundance from the supernatant.</p><p>3) The banding observed in Figure 2—figure supplement 2E doesn't seem to correspond to bands observed in Figure 1—figure supplement 1A and Figure 1—figure supplement 1B. Any background due to endogenously biotinylated proteins (for Figure 2—figure supplement 2E) should be prevalent in the left three lanes.</p><p>4) In the text, the authors suggest that the overlap in the number of myristoylated peptides is due to different specificities. Is there any reason to believe that the two cleavable reagents should have different specificities? Another explanation is just experimental variation: for trypsin, of 24 peptides identified, 7 were identified in all three replicates, while 16 were identified in two replicates.</p><p>5) In describing the results from the NMT inhibition experiments, the authors state &quot;14 proteins for which the myristoylated peptide was detected were either not quantified at the highest concentration of IMP-1002 or did not respond robustly to NMT inhibition.&quot; Lack of detection and lack of robust response are quite different, and the text should reflect this. For example, NMT inhibition could result in protein substrate instability-in fact, the majority of this subset are not represented in the total protein abundance (Toxo proteome tab of Supplementary file 3). As a minor point, by my count in Supplementary file 3, this number is 15, not 14.</p><p>6) The authors should compare their findings (65 predicted proteins) with the previously published in silico prediction of myristoylated proteins, 157 proteins as shown below (Alonso et al., 2019. Exploring protein myristoylation in <italic>Toxoplasma gondii</italic>).</p><p>7) The co-IPs of MIC7 in Figure 7B are performed with low amounts of detergent (0.2% Triton X-100), which may not fully solubilize micronemes. In order to make any claims about this interaction, some controls should be included in the western blot (e.g., MIC2) to show the specificity. However, the evidence that the myristoylation is not required for localization is sufficiently shown by localization in RAPA treated parasites (Figure 7 figure supplement 1H). It might therefore be prudent for authors to include this caveat in the text, because the evidence presented is not sufficient to demonstrate dimerization.</p><p>8) The fact that the myristoylation affects significantly invasion but not parasite attachment (Figure 6F and G) suggests a could be possible a role of MIC7 myristoylation in a signaling cascade leading to rhoptry discharge?

The authors provided data, suggesting that Myristoylation of MIC7 is important in host cell invasion.</p><p>This is a very interesting paper in the field of lipid modifications in the obligate protozoan parasite Toxoplasma gondii and I particularly appreciated the strategy(ies) used to depict these tricky modifications on proteins. Nonetheless, the specificity of the MIC7Myristoylation effect claimed in the paper, which is not given a mechanistic explanation except for the possible involvement in host cell invasion, should be thoroughly re-considered to make the paper really convincing.</p><p>The experiments appear accurately performed and well presented but a number of points required clarification.</p><p>Major concerns:</p><p>1) As the authors reported and already known, YnMyr can be non-specifically incorporated on amino acids differently than N-terminal glycines given the high level of non-myristoylation dependent background. To identify the YnMyr incorporation into N-terminal glycines, the commonly accepted method is the use of NMT inhibitors.</p><p>I understand the authors' method to distinguish between incorporation of YnMyr in N-Gly or GPI anchors, but to be convincing and to validate the base treatment the authors should also show data with NMT inhibitors for recovery of true Myred proteins.</p></disp-quote><p>Following reviewer’s suggestion, we performed additional validation using an NMT inhibitor. In the absence of dedicated <italic>Tg</italic>NMT inhibitors, we have used a previously published <italic>Pf</italic>NMT inhibitor IMP1002 (Schlott et al., 2019). Based on the structural identity (~ 60%) of both <italic>Toxoplasma</italic> and <italic>Plasmodium</italic> NMTs we predicted that this inhibitor will act also on <italic>Tg</italic>NMT. This hypothesis was supported by homology modelling of <italic>Tg</italic>NMT onto <italic>Pv</italic>NMT crystal structure with the inhibitor bound, which showed that all residues involved in compound binding are located in conserved positions in the active site. Following preliminary experiments testing dose response for IMP-1002 in <italic>Toxoplasma</italic>, we performed a large scale MS-based experiment that allowed for quantification of substrate response to NMTi. Importantly, all proteins previously assigned as base sensitive showed no response to inhibitor thus validating the base treatment as means to distinguish YnMyr incorporation at the N-terminal glycine vs GPI anchors. All the described data have been added to the manuscript (see also Figure 3, Figure 3—figure supplement 1 and Supplementary file 3).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Authors should report the list of 206 human proteins claimed to bear the MG myristoylation motif (subsection “Identification of the myristoylated proteome in T. gondii”) and compare the retrieved proteins with the recent reported complete list of human Myred proteins (Castrec et al., 2018) to validate their approach. This list is missing for the moment.</p></disp-quote><p>We originally did not include the human targets into our manuscript because many were already published elsewhere and the manuscript focuses on the substrates of the parasite NMT and their potential functions. However, after the reviewer’s suggestion, we now included the list of all identified human proteins bearing the MG motif and also compared it with the suggested literature (see manuscript text and Supplementary file 2).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Alternative experiments concerning the cellular localization of CDPK1 will help better to understand the function of lipidation of this protein in Toxoplasma gondii. The data presented are not convincing.</p></disp-quote><p>After careful consideration of the reviews, we decided to fully focus on the unusual myristoylation of MIC7, rather than putting more emphasis on CDPK1. The CDPK1 data will now be incorporated into a different manuscript that specifically focuses on CDPK1 function and myristate-dependent target activity.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) As reported above, no mechanistic inside is reported to explain how myristoylation of MIC7 plays a role in the invasion of the host cells. This is a very important aspect of the work that should be further investigated.</p></disp-quote><p>We put significant effort into further investigation of the function of MIC7 and its myristoylation. In order to investigate the fate of MIC7 N-terminus and the myristate itself, we generated new complemented WT and Mut lines with Myc tag inserted within the MIC7 EGF2 domain in addition to the Ty1 tag that has previously been present at the C-terminus. After thorough validation (see text, Figure 7 and Figure 7—figure supplement 1) we used these new tools to prove that although not important for MIC7 sorting, the myristate is indeed retained in the lumenal part of the microneme, suggesting that it may function later in the lytic cycle. Consistent with this hypothesis, using large scale invasion assays as well as static and live microscopy, we confirm that both MIC7 and its myristoylation are important in the host cell invasion, particularly in its onset (see Figure 7, Video1, Video 2, Video 3, Video 4)). We then investigate in more detail potential causes of the observed invasion defect and show that it is not due to the faulty microneme secretion, gliding motility or the attempt of tachyzoites to invade, but a likely failure to properly engage with the host cell (Figure 7 and Figure 7—figure supplement 2). We also show that MIC7 behaves unlike most other microneme proteins as it is not shed during invasion. We have tentative data that rhoptry secretion <italic>per se</italic> is not affected, but observe a reduction in cells into which ROP16 has been efficiently transferred if MIC7 is deleted (Figure 7J). Further work will be required to understand the details of the invasion defect. This, we believe, will require substantial work, especially to understand the function of the myristate, whether it may be inserted into the host cell membrane or is required for protein-protein interactions. In IPs using the tagged MIC7 lines, we did not reliably identify specific interaction partners, despite efficient pull down of MIC7 (this data is not shown or discussed in the manuscript). We therefore believe that any MIC7 interaction with partner proteins may be of lower affinity, again, requiring substantial optimisation of IP conditions and will be focus of future work.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) Of all myristoylated proteins identified is not clear why the authors decided to focus on the two specific proteins (CDPK1 and MIC7). Although I can understand the characterization of MIC7, I'm a bit sceptic about the advances brought by CDPK1 data (already known to undergo myristoylation in most organism).</p></disp-quote><p>The CDPK1 dataset has been removed from the manuscript and we now fully focus on MIC7, which, as a secreted transmembrane protein is highly unusual to be myristoylated and the first example of any protein without a signal peptide (to our knowledge) that is trafficked into the micronemes in either <italic>Toxoplasma</italic> or related parasites.</p><p>A note to the reviewer: We agree that many CDPKs may be myristoylated in other organisms. But it is important to note that one cannot infer that CDPK1 of <italic>Toxoplasma</italic> is the functional orthologue of CDPK1 in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>, or any other organism as the CDPK1 indexing has been predominantly defined by the sequence of their discovery, not sequence identity to other species.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2:</p><p>Broncel et al., uses chemoproteomic techniques to identify myristoylated proteins in <italic>Toxoplasma</italic> and then validate two targets and derive functional information about the role of this modification during the lytic cycle. Myristoylation is a non-reversible modification (as compared to palmitoylation) and can occur either by itself or in partnership with nearby palmitoylation. Indeed, it is dogma that myristoylation is required for subsequent palmitoylation, at least in <italic>Toxoplasma</italic>. This work proceeds work done on the identification of palmitoylated proteins in both <italic>Toxoplasma</italic> and Plasmodium as well as the identification of myristoylated proteins in <italic>P. falciparum</italic> and investigations on its importance. Further, proteins that are both myristoylated and palmitoylated have been predicted, their localisation and function of these sites, in combination, investigated. The substrates that Broncel et al., identify here include these dually acylated proteins, validating their approach and also include many novel molecules. Broncel also duly acknowledge all this previous work.</p><p>Whilst this reviewer is not a chemical biologist, the approach taken to identify myristoylated proteins seems robust, well controlled and has been well validated. This dataset will be useful for others that are interested in acylation in Toxoplasma or determining whether their protein of interest is myristoylated. Further, this dataset also provides potential information on whether Toxoplasma proteins have a GPI anchor.</p><p>Presumably, because of the extensive work been done on dual acylation (myristoylation and palmitoylation together) the authors chose to study proteins that they suspect (but not proven) to be only myristoylated and not palmitoylated. They were able to show that the myristoylation site of both CDPK1 and MIC7 are functionally important, albeit limited.</p><p>The main issues I have with this paper is one of novelty. Whilst this work is robust, well validated and its functional relevance investigated, none of this is surprising. The real interesting question is, and where the field is at, is understanding what myristoylation is doing over and above membrane affinity and what relevance does this have to parasite biology? Again, it is unsurprising that loss of myristoylation leads to changes in solubility (as a surrogate for localisation), but the real interest is what other function might this modification have? This could be particularly interesting with MIC7 where it appears not to have an SP, and myristoylation not required for apparent correct localisation. What about is whether myristoylation is required for surface display or secretion? This might review novel biology of this lipid modification.</p></disp-quote><p>See comment to reviewer 1, point 4.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3:</p><p>Acylation has been shown to influence eukaryotic protein function in a variety of contexts. In Toxoplasma gondii several studies have shown acylation to be important for specific proteins, and global studies have been undertaken to describe the complement of palmitoylated proteins. However, the full extent of myristoylation-a modification often required to license palmitoylation, but also important in its own right-has not been systematically examined in the context of the T. gondii proteome. The present study is an important resource, addressing this gap in our understanding. Through several complementary mass-spectrometry experiments, the authors identify novel and known myristoylated proteins. For two of the identified proteins, CDPK1 and MIC7, the authors use complementation of knockouts to demonstrate the functional importance of myristoylation. Although, the precise role of myristoylation is not uncovered for either candidate, the evidence supporting a role for the modification is strong. The major concerns listed below therefore fall into two main categories: (1) curating the results and interpretation of the myristoylome to ensure its utility as a resource, and (2) ensuring the rigor of test cases.</p></disp-quote><p>General comment re. curation and interpretation of the myristoylome:</p><p>All proteomic data will be submitted to ProteomeXchange consortium and the target list incorporated within ToxoDB resource to allow broad application of the generated dataset.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1) In reference to Figure 1—figure supplement 1A, the statement &quot;without any detectable background&quot; is not supported by the visible background in the figure. The authors later also state that &quot;[t]his additional layer of confidence in target identification is especially important given the high level of non-myristoylation dependent background reported for metabolic tagging with YnMyr,&quot; contradicting their prior statement about low background. Please clarify in the text.</p></disp-quote><p>We meant that when applying in-gel fluorescence based detection, there is usually very little background detected (especially seen in Figure 1—figure supplement 1C); whereas when analysed by MS, which is much more sensitive, the level of detected background is quite substantial.</p><p>This has been clarified in the text.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) What is the evidence that &quot;protein tagging in vivo was non-toxic&quot;? It seems that the statement should be limited to the 16h incubation used unless long-term culture experiments in the presence of YnMyr were performed. It is also unclear how the extracellular labeling in Figure 1—figure supplement 1B was performed. Please clarify in the text.</p></disp-quote><p>Yes, the non-toxicity of labelling is limited to 16 h of experiment and it has been clarified in the text.</p><p>The labelling step for intracellular and extracellular parasites is the same. The term extracellular was used to reflect that the parasites were lysed out of host cells prior to click chemistry and visualization. In contrast, the intracellular means that intracellular parasites were processed (parasite + host cells). Both terms are explained in the figure caption.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) In Figure 1B, it is formally possible that alkaline treatment is altering proteins beyond the cleavage of the GPI-anchored label (e.g. causing precipitation or aggregation). The authors should repeat the alkaline treatment after blotting onto the membrane, prior to detection. Alternatively, they could include the noted caveat in the text.</p></disp-quote><p>This is an important point. We believe we control for this by measuring global protein levels. If some proteins were to precipitate or aggregate, and therefore be reduced in amounts, this would be reflected in the global protein abundance (Supplementary file 1), which we did not observe.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) In Figure 2D, could the authors explain the YnMyr/Myr-enriched proteins that are categorized as &quot;Non-targets&quot;? Were they only identified in a single experiment? Which experiment are fold enrichment and statistics for this figure drawn from?</p></disp-quote><p>The term ‘Non-targets’ was used to represent all proteins that were not classified as targets, i.e. non MG proteins that are non-specifically bound to the beads (background), non-MG proteins that are YnMyr-enriched but not via the N-terminal glycine, e.g. GPI anchored proteins, as well as proteins identified with only one of three capture reagents. We have now updated the legend in the figure and included this extended explanation in the figure caption.</p><p>The data presented in Figure 2D were taken from the experiment with the Trypsin cleavable reagent for which we used a t-test to obtain statistical significance (n=3) and also obtained most comprehensive target coverage. This information was added to the figure caption.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) Can the authors address the different patterns of labeling observed in Figure 1—figure supplement 1A-C compared to Figure 2—figure supplement 2E? Please provide an explanation in the text.</p></disp-quote><p>The patterns of labelling look slightly different as two different methods were used for visualization, i.e. in-gel fluorescence and Western blotting with streptavidin HRP. They differ in their sensitivity.</p><p>The visualization methods used are clearly indicated.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) It is unclear why there was decreased background in TEV-I compared TEV-II, when in both cases the analyte is TEV-eluted and should therefore experience the same background reduction compared to reagent 2. Please clarify in the text.</p></disp-quote><p>TEV I and TEV II are two alternative strategies that can be applied when using reagent 3 (as shown in Figure 2A). They both use TEV and trypsin for protein elution/digestion, however they differ in the applied enzyme order. TEV I strategy which releases both unmodified and myristoylated peptides in one pool (a result of sequential TEV and trypsin digest) should decrease the level of background. This is due to the fact that TEV protease is used first and will only cleave metabolically tagged proteins that have been clicked to capture reagent 3 (that is equipped with a TEV linker, see Figure 2—figure supplement 2A) and not the ones which are non-specifically bound to the beads. In case of TEV II strategy, trypsin is applied first and all unmodified peptides are collected in fraction1. These peptides will originate from both specific enrichment as well as non-specific binding, hence no reduction in background. Subsequently TEV protease is applied and all myristoylated peptides are now cleaved and collected in a separate fraction, which due to reduced complexity should increase the myristoylated peptide discovery by MS.</p><p>For better clarity additional explanation was included in the manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7) At several points, the authors compare their results to those of the previous palmitoylation studies to identify myristoylated proteins that were not palmitoylated. It would be informative to perform the converse analysis, to identify palmitoylated proteins that were not identified as myristoylated. Such an analysis might be an orthogonal way of identifying proteins that might have been missed.</p></disp-quote><p>This is a good idea and we have performed the requested analysis. We found 6 palmitoylated proteins with the potential of being myristoylated, i.e. containing the MG motif. Only one of them has been found in our global analysis and was classified as base sensitive. We did not obtain any experimental evidence for the remaining 5 proteins. As the presence of the MG motif is merely a prerequisite and not a proof of myristoylation, we did not add these proteins to our substrate list.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>8) For Figure 6F-G, since invasion and attachment are performed following rapamycin treatment of all strains, it would be important to include a wildtype strain as the appropriate strain for normalization, instead of normalizing to the complemented strain (i.e. if the complementation is not working properly, we would not be able to tell from Figure 6).</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewer is correct that the epitope tagged MIC7 version could have a slight growth defect (as indeed observed (Figure 7C) for the new <sup>Myc</sup>cWT MIC7 with the Myc-tag in the ectodomain).</p><p>However, in plaque assays with the old complemented line we did not observe obvious differences in plaque size (see Figure 6E), suggesting that the complementation is working close to or at normal levels. We have not included the parental control as the purpose of the experiment was to investigate the function of myristoylation, which needs to be done in the isogenic iKO background. However, when analysing invasiveness of the new Myc tagged complemented lines (due to the small growth defect) we did include this important control (see Figure 7E).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>9) If MIC7 is dispensable, were the authors able to isolate knockout parasites from the population and maintain them in culture?</p></disp-quote><p>Yes, after several weeks we were able to isolate clones of MIC7 KO parasites. The clones initially grew very slow, supporting our initial plaque assay results. In addition, we frequently observed many free floating parasites and very few intracellular ones, supporting the observed defect in invasion. After ~3 weeks in culture the KO parasites acquired normal growth kinetics. We hypothesized that a bradyzoite MIC7-like protein (TGME49_315520) identified by blast analysis could have been upregulated by the KO parasites as a potential compensation mechanism. This turned out not to be the case, as verified by cDNA analysis from these parasites (data not shown). We have decided not to include this information within the manuscript as for now it is mainly based on observations, rather than solid measurements, and will require more work, including RNA seq analysis to identify potentially compensating transcripts, their validation and functional analysis and is, we think, beyond the scope of this manuscript.</p><p>[Editors’ note: what follows is the authors’ response to the second round of review.]</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Importantly, the well performed myristylome is viewed as important and reliable resource for the scientific community whereas the work on the biology of MIC7 substrate is robust and intriguing but still full of enigma that cannot be addressed in given timeframe.</p><p>In consequence we encourage you to consider submitting a revision of your manuscript as a Resource with the MIC7 section serving as atypical substrate validation. Since no new experiments are requested the lockdown situation should not present a barrier.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>Myristoylation is an irreversible lipid modification that is important for priming subsequent acylation, but on its own has been shown to have additional regulatory roles including facilitating protein-protein interactions. This modification is catalyzed in the cytoplasm by N-myristoyl transferase (NMT). In the protozoan parasite, Toxoplasma gondii, the functional significance of myristoylation has been studied for a handful of proteins. Broncel et al., use chemoproteomic methods to globally identify myristoylated proteins-including many modified peptides-in Toxoplasma. Using these approaches, the authors identify known myristoylated proteins as well as novel candidates and choose to pursue one of these, MIC7, for additional characterization.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) For the pilot experiment, to define a protein as myristoylated, the authors required robust enrichment (YnMyr/Myr log<sub>2</sub> fold change &gt; 2), the presence of an MG motif, and insensitivity towards base treatment. It would be helpful to assess this enrichment cutoff by plotting the enrichments of all proteins and highlight known gold standards.</p></disp-quote><p>The requested assessment and the corresponding plot have been made and included in the revised manuscript (see Results section and Figure 2—figure supplement 2C).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) The authors claim that there are no substantial differences between the YnMyr and Myr proteomes by comparing the protein abundance of supernatants. Given the near-complete pulldown efficiency (Figure 1—figure supplement 1C), no conclusions should be made about overall substrate abundance from the supernatant.</p></disp-quote><p>We used post enrichment supernatants to test for general proteome changes that would have been indicative of adverse effects invoked by YnMyr treatment and potentially affect our conclusions, not to quantify the myristoylated proteins. Comprehensive quantification of myristoylated proteins without prior enrichment would likely not have been possible without extensive sample fractionation or targeted mass spectrometry approaches. We have amended this statement for clarity (see Results section).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) The banding observed in Figure 2—figure supplement 2E doesn't seem to correspond to bands observed in Figure 1—figure supplement 1A and Figure 1—figure supplement 1B. Any background due to endogenously biotinylated proteins (for Figure 2—figure supplement 2E) should be prevalent in the left three lanes.</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewer is correct that any background originating from the endogenous biotinylation should also be present in (-) YnMyr controls in Figure 2—figure supplement 2E . We therefore do not think that these bands correspond to background. We think that it is the difference in the applied visualization methodology (in gel fluorescence (igFL) vs Western blotting (WB)) that causes this inconsistency. Specifically, we believe that the efficiency of protein transfer onto the nitrocellulose membrane prior to incubation with streptavidin HRP may be the cause. Here we applied a semi dry (SD) blotting system which is known to provide faster and simpler transfer than a standard tank transfer method. Unfortunately, due to high electrical field strengths and reduced volumes of transfer buffer, SD systems can cause a blow-through of low molecular weight proteins and incomplete transfer of high molecular weight proteins. We would like to stress that bands from the WB (75 kD, 50-60 kD, 20-25 kD) are also visible by igFL (Figure 1—figure supplement 1A and Figure 1—figure supplement 1B) although with different intensity.</p><p>We decided to not pursue this further, as the goal of this experiment was to compare YnMyr enrichment between capture reagents and not to quantify specific bands. We believe that we clearly show in Figure 2—figure supplement 2E that all three capture reagents used enable efficient pull down of myristoylated proteins, which we then quantify using mass-spectrometry.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) In the text, the authors suggest that the overlap in the number of myristoylated peptides is due to different specificities. Is there any reason to believe that the two cleavable reagents should have different specificities? Another explanation is just experimental variation: for trypsin, of 24 peptides identified, 7 were identified in all three replicates, while 16 were identified in two replicates.</p></disp-quote><p>The two cleavable reagents (Trypsin and TEV) used in our study are very different in terms of their structure, applied click reaction conditions and cleavage strategy, and finally in the nature of the resulting myristoylation adduct that is detected by MS. We were referring to all these features as to ‘different specificities’. We realize, however, that such statement was misleading for a reader in suggesting that different subsets of substrates are being targeted by these two reagents. We have amended the text accordingly (see Results section).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) In describing the results from the NMT inhibition experiments, the authors state &quot;14 proteins for which the myristoylated peptide was detected were either not quantified at the highest concentration of IMP-1002 or did not respond robustly to NMT inhibition.&quot; Lack of detection and lack of robust response are quite different, and the text should reflect this. For example, NMT inhibition could result in protein substrate instability-in fact, the majority of this subset are not represented in the total protein abundance (Toxo proteome tab of Supplementary file 3). As a minor point, by my count in Supplementary file 3, this number is 15, not 14.</p></disp-quote><p>We recognize how this statement could have been misleading and have amended the text accordingly (see Results section). Regarding the Reviewer’s minor point addressing the number of proteins with myristoylated peptide, the reported number (14) is actually correct, the mistake was that one of the protein entries (289615) had been entered twice. We thank for that comment and we amended the table accordingly.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) The authors should compare their findings (65 predicted proteins) with the previously published in silico prediction of myristoylated proteins, 157 proteins as shown below (Alonso et al., 2019. Exploring protein myristoylation in Toxoplasma gondii).</p></disp-quote><p>The requested comparison has been made and included in the revised manuscript (see Results section and Supplementary file 4).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7) The co-IPs of MIC7 in Figure 7B are performed with low amounts of detergent (0.2% Triton X-100), which may not fully solubilize micronemes. In order to make any claims about this interaction, some controls should be included in the western blot (e.g., MIC2) to show the specificity. However, the evidence that the myristoylation is not required for localization is sufficiently shown by localization in RAPA treated parasites (Figure 7 - figure supplement 1H). It might therefore be prudent for authors to include this caveat in the text, because the evidence presented is not sufficient to demonstrate dimerization.</p></disp-quote><p>This was a good suggestion and could well have been the case. Using the previously prepared lysates we have included the MIC2 control, see Figure 7B in the revised manuscript. This shows that MIC2 is not co-immunoprecipitated in the MIC7 IPs, indicating efficient lysis of the micronemes and dimerization or oligomerisation of MIC7, under the conditions used.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>8) The fact that the myristoylation affects significantly invasion but not parasite attachment (Figure 6F and G) suggests a could be possible a role of MIC7 myristoylation in a signaling cascade leading to rhoptry discharge? The authors should discuss it and also in the context of MIC8 previous implication in this event.</p></disp-quote><p>Indeed, we were tempted to speculate that MIC7 may be involved in such a cascade, similarly to MIC8. However, since in case of MIC7 the rhoptry secretion phenotype was not as severe as for MIC8, we believe that rhoptries are likely to discharge but the contents are not efficiently translocated into the host cell. We have clarified this and referenced MIC8 in the revised manuscript (see Discussion section).</p></body></sub-article></article>
