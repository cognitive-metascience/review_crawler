Unlike other widely expressed synaptic vesicle proteins such as vSNAREs and synaptotagmins, the primary function has not been resolved. Here, we report robust elevation in the probability of release of readily releasable vesicles with both high and low release probabilities at a variety of synapse types from knockout mice missing all four family members. Neither the number of readily releasable vesicles, nor the timing of recruitment to the readily releasable pool was affected. The results suggest that family members serve as negative regulators of neurotransmission, acting directly at the level of exocytosis to dampen connection strength selectively when presynaptic action potentials fire at low frequency. The widespread expression suggests that chemical synapses may play a frequency filtering role in biological computation that is more elemental than presently envisioned.</p><p><bold>Editorial note:</bold> This article has been through an editorial process in which the authors decide how to respond to the issues raised during peer review.

Synaptogyrin 2, also known as cellugyrin, is non-neuronal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Janz and Südhof, 1998</xref>). The widespread expression of neuronal family members suggests a fundamental role in synaptic transmission, but what that might be is not known.</p><p>Family members bind to the vSNARE synaptobrevin 2/VAMP 2, which is a core component of the machinery that catalyzes membrane fusion during synaptic vesicle exocytosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Söllner et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Calakos and Scheller, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Washbourne et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Edelmann et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Becher et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Khvotchev and Südhof, 2004</xref>). And, overexpression of family members potently inhibited neurotransmitter release in a cell line (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Sugita et al., 1999</xref>). Despite this, the hypothesis that the native function might involve negative regulation of exocytosis has not been pursued extensively, possibly because no clear evidence was found for increases in neurotransmitter release at synapses from synaptophysin 1 and synaptogyrin 1 single and double knockouts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">McMahon et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Janz et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abraham et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Stevens et al., 2012</xref>). Instead, recent research has been focused on a variety of mechanisms that operate downstream of exocytosis, including: endocytosis of membrane; and/or recycling of proteins thought to be needed to catalyze subsequent rounds of exocytosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kwon and Chapman, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Gordon et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Rajappa et al., 2016</xref>). However, the previous studies, at least in mammals, involved exogenous expression or genetic deletion of synaptophysin 1 and synaptogyrin 1, whereas possible compensatory activity of synaptophysin 2 and synaptogyrin 3 has never been assessed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">McInnes et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>Here, we report that individual action potentials trigger exocytosis of a higher fraction of the readily releasable vesicles at a variety of synapse types from quadruple knockout mice (QKO) where all four neuronal family members have been deleted (see Materials and methods). No deficit was detected in other presynaptic parameters that control function such as the capacity of the readily releasable pool (RRP) for storing vesicles and the timing of vesicle recruitment to the RRP during light or heavy use. The results suggest strongly that family members play an inhibitory role at the level of exocytosis rather than the facilitatory downstream role that is currently envisioned. A follow-on analysis of double and triple knockouts showed that synaptophysin 1 and synaptogyrin 3 can compensate for missing family members, whereas synaptophysin 2 seemed to play a dominant negative role.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>QKO mice appeared to develop normally when housed in individually ventilated cages, and produced litters of normal size. However, adults were prone to convulsions, sometimes causing death, especially after being startled. We were not able to maintain the colony in a second facility where ventilated cages were not available, suggesting that the ventilation system aided survival, possibly by producing continuous white noise that limited startling. A quantitative western blot analysis of homogenized tissue and purified synaptosomes from QKO brains revealed a selective decrease in VAMP 2 levels, but no major changes in a wide variety of other synaptic proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>); a decrease in VAMP 2 levels was detected previously in synaptophysin 1 single knockouts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">McMahon et al., 1996</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.40744.002</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Selective decrease in VAMP 2 levels in synaptosomes of QKO mice.</title><p>Representative immunoblots and quantification of the indicated proteins from synaptosomes purified from brains of 3-month-old WT and QKO mice.

At such a low frequency, the RRP remains almost completely full because the time between action potentials (5 s) is enough for recruitment of new vesicles to replace the ones that undergo exocytosis.

Furthermore, no differences between QKO and WT were detected in the amount of staining during loading, further supporting the conclusion of no alterations in rate-limiting steps in vesicle trafficking in QKO synapses.</p></sec><sec id="s2-7"><title>Analysis of triple and double knockouts</title><p>Of the triple knockouts lacking all but one of the neuronal family members, synaptophysin 1 or synaptogyrin 3 alone largely compensated for the loss of the other three family members (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref>).</p><p>Intriguingly, synapses from triple knockouts expressing only synaptophysin 2 were not noticeably different from QKO, but the combination of synaptophysin 2 with either synaptophysin 1 or synaptogyrin 3 was less effective at compensation than synaptophysin 1 or synaptogyrin 3 alone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7E</xref>). This result suggests that synaptophysin 2 may act as a competitive inhibitor of the function of other family members, or play a dominant negative role. And indeed, synaptophysin 2 is unique in that it lacks many of the sites for C-terminal tyrosine phosphorylation that are striking features of the other family members (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Evans and Cousin, 2005</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Synaptophysin family proteins are widely expressed in synaptic vesicle membranes, with more individuals per vesicle than the extensively studied synaptotagmins, although likely less than the vSNARE VAMP 2 and homologs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Takamori et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Wilhelm et al., 2014</xref>). Despite the abundance, information about the role in presynaptic function has been elusive. Here, we show that the efficiency of the release machinery is elevated at a variety of synapse types from knockout mice where all four neuronal family members have been deleted, with no indication of any alteration in RRP content or the timing of vesicle recruitment to the RRP during light or heavy use. The new results strongly suggest that synaptophysin family members modulate function at the level of exocytosis. If so, the native action likely includes inhibition, especially when the results are taken together with an earlier study where exogenous synaptophysin 1 and synaptogyrin 1 potently inhibited exocytosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Sugita et al., 1999</xref>; but see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Alder et al., 1995</xref>).</p><p>The concern that the elevated <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf98"><mml:msub><mml:mover accent="true"><mml:mi>p</mml:mi><mml:mo stretchy="false">¯</mml:mo></mml:mover><mml:mi>v</mml:mi></mml:msub></mml:math></inline-formula> seen at QKO synapses might instead reflect complicating developmental or compensatory mechanisms that are not directly related to the native function of the missing proteins is countered by the following. First, the alteration is unusually specific; <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf99"><mml:msub><mml:mover accent="true"><mml:mi>p</mml:mi><mml:mo stretchy="false">¯</mml:mo></mml:mover><mml:mi>v</mml:mi></mml:msub></mml:math></inline-formula> was elevated without desynchronizing the relationship between action potentials and neurotransmitter release, or disrupting other vesicle trafficking mechanisms that control presynaptic function such as the capacity of the RRP for storing synaptic vesicles and the timing of vesicle recruitment to vacancies within the RRP. Second, the alteration was robust across a variety of synapse types embedded within neuronal networks that are subject to dissimilar developmental forces, including the networks formed by neurons grown in dissociated cell culture. Third, besides the decrease in VAMP 2, we did not detect substantial changes in levels of a variety of other proteins that have been implicated in exocytosis, including syntaxin 1, SNAP-25, RIM 1/2, Munc13-1, Rab 3a, and complexin 1/2. And fourth, synaptophysin 2 seemed to inhibit the function of other family members, which argues against the specific concern that removing the other family members increased the fusogenicity of synaptic vesicles mechanically, by simply exposing space on the surface vesicular membranes.</p><p>Notably, however, no elevation in <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf100"><mml:msub><mml:mover accent="true"><mml:mi>p</mml:mi><mml:mo stretchy="false">¯</mml:mo></mml:mover><mml:mi>v</mml:mi></mml:msub></mml:math></inline-formula> was detected in neuromuscular junctions after deleting the family from <italic>C. elegans</italic> or <italic>Drosophila</italic> - and exocytosis of neurotransmitter was increased rather than decreased after expressing exogenous synaptophysin 1 in <italic>Xenopus</italic> - and it seems unlikely that an entire family of proteins would have an unrelated function in the different species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Alder et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abraham et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Stevens et al., 2012</xref>). One possibility is that family members function as bi-directional regulators of exocytosis where the directionality is modulated by second messengers, possibly via phosphorylation of the tyrosine residues along the C-terminal tail. In any case, we anticipate that the cause of the discrepancies between species will become clear when more is known about the mechanism.</p><p>Indeed, even basic information about the mechanism remains to be elucidated. One possibility is that synaptophysin family members might interact directly with catalysis as outlined in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Rothman et al. (2017)</xref>; see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Adams et al. (2015)</xref>. However, when bound to synaptophysin 1, VAMP 2 was excluded from the core SNARE complex consisting of VAMP 2, syntaxin 1, and SNAP25 that catalyzes exocytosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Edelmann et al., 1995</xref>), and the combination of syntaxin 1 and SNAP25 could disrupt the binding between synaptophysin 1 and VAMP 2 in an enriched vesicle preparation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Siddiqui et al., 2007</xref>). A second possibility is that family members might lessen SNARE complex formation simply by restricting the availability of VAMP 2. However, we are not aware of evidence that exocytosis can be modulated in this manner, and indeed, lowering levels of the SNAP-25 component paradoxically increased <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf101"><mml:msub><mml:mover accent="true"><mml:mi>p</mml:mi><mml:mo stretchy="false">¯</mml:mo></mml:mover><mml:mi>v</mml:mi></mml:msub></mml:math></inline-formula> in at least one study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Antonucci et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>In any case, the relevance of the reduction in VAMP 2 levels in purified QKO synaptosomes to the increase in exocytosis seen at intact synapses in the functional assays is not known, and is counter-intuitive given that VAMP 2 is necessary for exocytosis. Intriguingly, the reduction is in-line with a previous study where exogenous VAMP 2 could be driven to synaptic vesicles by co-expressing synaptophysin 1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Pennuto et al., 2003</xref>). The results do not suggest that synaptophysin family members are required for targeting VAMP 2 to synaptic vesicles, but are consistent with the possibility that VAMP 2 exists in two pools within vesicle membranes: one of which is stabilized by binding to synaptophysin family members; and the other by a different factor that remains to be identified. On the other hand, it is possible that the reduction in QKO synaptosomes resulted from depletion from plasma membrane rather than synaptic vesicles because significant amounts of VAMP 2 are consistently found in plasma membranes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Sankaranarayanan et al., 2000</xref>), and synaptosomes contain plasma membrane in addition to synaptic vesicles.</p><p>It is not clear how or if the small elevation in size of spontaneous responses seen both here and after deleting synaptogyrin from <italic>Drosophila</italic> is related to the elevated probability of release (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Stevens et al., 2012</xref>). We cannot rule out a postsynaptic mechanism, but vesicles were larger in the <italic>Drosophila</italic> mutants, which might play a role. Possibly also relevant: Vesicles were also larger in synapses from knockouts of other presynaptic proteins involved in exocytosis, including VAMP 2, SNAP-25, and Munc13-1/2; the increase in radius was &lt;10%, but even this small increase would translate to an increase in volume of 30%, which is more than the elevation in quantal size seen here (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Imig et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>Our results are in-line with previous reports of a role for synaptophysin family members in short-term synaptic plasticity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Janz et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kwon and Chapman, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Rajappa et al., 2016</xref>). However, the decreased paired-pulse facilitation and increased paired-pulse depression seen in single, double and quadruple knockouts at a variety of synapse types do not necessarily indicate defects in mechanisms underlying short-term plasticity, but instead may result from the baseline elevation of <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf102"><mml:msub><mml:mover accent="true"><mml:mi>p</mml:mi><mml:mo stretchy="false">¯</mml:mo></mml:mover><mml:mi>v</mml:mi></mml:msub></mml:math></inline-formula>.

However, their effective role during the type of burst firing that occurs routinely in vivo would be more complex owing to slower depletion of the RRP as a direct consequence of reduced transmitter release. One way to characterize this sort of functional complexity is so called <italic>redistribution of synaptic efficacy</italic> where a decrease in synaptic strength at the beginning of a train of action potentials serves to enhance the strength later on (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Markram and Tsodyks, 1996</xref>). Intriguingly, it seems that some activity-dependent form of redistribution of synaptic efficacy can be induced at a broad range of synapse types. For example, long-lasting bidirectional redistribution can be induced at cortical and hippocampal synapses by some of the same experimental protocols used to activate standard long-term potentiation and depression mechanisms at other synapse types (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Markram and Tsodyks, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Sjöström et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Yasui et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Monday et al., 2018</xref>).

Synaptic vesicles (SVs) contain three types of tetraspan membrane proteins, synaptophysins, synaptogyrins, and SCAMPs. Although synaptophysins are among the most abundant SV proteins, their function – and the function of synaptophysins, synaptogyrins, and SCAMPs in general – has remained enigmatic. Indeed, genetic elimination of synaptophysin, synaptogyrin, and SCAMP in <italic>C. elegans</italic>, which expresses only one isoform of each family of tetraspan vesicle membrane proteins, has no effect on spontaneous or evoked synaptic transmission (Abraham et al., 2006). Raja et al. performed a related study on mammalian synaptophysins and synaptogyrins, focusing on quadruple KO mice lacking all synaptophysins and synaptogyrins. The key finding is that the loss of synaptophysins and synaptogyrins causes increased SV release probability and faster excitation-secretion coupling. This is clearly interesting and important for the synapse biology field. Raja et al. based their analysis on electrophysiological recordings at the calyx of Held and Schaffer collateral synapses in the hippocampus, and on FM4-64 loading/destaining experiments with cultured hippocampal neurons. Overall, the experiments were done in a stringent manner and the data look convincing. After extensive discussion, all three reviewers agree that the study is an important contribution, but there remain issues that should be addressed prior to publications, as cited below.</p><p>Major revisions:</p><p>1) The reviewers discussed the issue of interpreting synaptic vesicle fusion in the absence of four synaptic vesicle proteins that are among the most abundant synaptic vesicle proteins. The data shown in Figure S1 show trends regarding changes in SV proteins in the whole hippocampus of quadruple KOs. The issue of compensatory changes in synaptic vesicle proteins as a primary or secondary mediator of the observed effects on synaptic vesicle release is important, and is something that has been routinely addressed in similar knockout studies. As such, the authors could extend this analysis of synaptic vesicle protein abundance in purified synaptic vesicle fractions from the quadruple knockouts, including proteins directly involved in release probability such as RIM, Munc13, Rab3, and Complexin. Alternatively, the authors must provide additional discussion, citing the relevant literature, regarding how any observed changes may contribute, or not contribute, to the observed phenotype. In particular, discuss whether removal of a large fraction of synaptic vesicle protein might directly contribute to enhanced release through direct effects on vesicle fusogenicity.</p><p>2) The reviewers recommend either addressing synaptic vesicle endocytosis with direct assays, or altering the text of the manuscript to be more circumspect.</p><p>3) It is important that the authors cite and discuss the relevance of work in the <italic>C. elegans</italic> system (Abraham et al., 2006), and discuss more precisely their claim of having assessed a broad range of synapses. Several synapses have been assessed. How similar or distinct are these synapses?</p><p>4) It was recommended that the Discussion section be focused more clearly on the data presented.

Subsequent analyses at Calyx and hippocampal synapses in the quad-KO demonstrate altered presynaptic vesicle release consistent with an increase in presynaptic release probability. The fact that this effect is observed at two very different synapses, in vitro and in vivo, argues for the generality of the observed effects. The paper ends with a modest amount of data on gene-specific contributions, highlighting a potentially interfering function for synaptophysin 2. In general, the experiments seem to have been performed to a high standard, are clearly presented and appropriately discussed. The findings are clear, and provide what could be considered a definitive set of experiments regarding the required action of this set of proteins for synaptic transmission. Given that very similar phenotypes are observed at Calyx and hippocampus, in vivo and in vitro, it seems unlikely that the effects will be caused by altered developmental trajectory of synapse development. However, this was never directly addressed. There is a curious effect on synaptic delay at the Calyx. It would be nice to know if this was altered at the hippocampal synapses. My only other comment is that an assessment of intrinsic excitability would be easily achieved in both systems, somatic in the hippocampus and presynaptically at the Calyx. Given that there is a shortened delay in the calyx and there is evidence of increased excitability, I am curious if the action potential waveform is altered. While this would be expected to alter the waveform of the EPSC, it remains a final piece of the puzzle that could be resolved. Given that these studies are carried out in quad KO animals, I am hesitant to require additional work unless it provides fundamental evidence in favor of the existing data, or has the potential to alter the fundamental conclusions in some manner.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic> </p><p>Raja et al. present an interesting story on tetraspan vesicle membrane proteins of the synaptophysin and synaptogyrin families. Synaptic vesicles (SVs) contain three types of tetraspan membrane proteins, synaptophysins, synaptogyrins, and SCAMPs. Although synaptophysins are among the most abundant SV proteins, their function – and the function of synaptophysins, synaptogyrins, and SCAMPs in general – has remained enigmatic. Indeed, genetic elimination of synaptophysin, synaptogyrin, and SCAMP in <italic>C. elegans</italic>, which expresses only one isoform of each family of tetraspan vesicle membrane proteins, has no effect on spontaneous or evoked synaptic transmission (Abraham et al., 2006). Raja et al. performed a related study on mammalian synaptophysins and synaptogyrins, focusing on quadruple KO mice lacking all synaptophysins and synaptogyrins. The key finding is that the loss of synaptophysins and synaptogyrins causes increased SV release probability and faster excitation-secretion coupling. This is clearly interesting and important for the synapse biology field.</p><p>Raja et al. based their analysis on electrophysiological recordings at the calyx of Held and Schaffer collateral synapses in the hippocampus, and on FM4-64 loading/destaining experiments with cultured hippocampal neurons. Overall, the experiments were done in a stringent manner and the data look convincing. Nevertheless, I have several comments regarding the data and their interpretation that the authors should address.</p><p>1) In principle, I like the mouse KO approach. However, when four proteins are removed from SVs – and among these some of the most abundant SV proteins – the issue of 'collateral damage' arises. In essence, I think the authors can at present not be sure that the quadruple KO SVs are properly equipped with all relevant protein components. The data shown in Figure S1 already show trends of changes in SV proteins in the whole hippocampus of quadruple KOs. To rule out substantial changes at the level of SV composition, it would be necessary to systematically assess protein levels in purified SV fractions from quadruple KOs. The problem here may be that not many labs can do this properly.… but it could be done within a reasonable time frame on the basis of a collaboration (e.g. with people like Reinhard Jahn). If this is out of the question, the authors should at least discuss this issue and tone down the manuscript text regarding collateral changes in SV composition after loss of all synaptophysins and synaptogyrins. I personally think that SV composition may well be changed, contributing to the phenotypical changes observed.</p><p>2) An issue related to the one above (point 1) concerns the intrinsic 'fusogenicity' of SVs after loss of all synaptophysins and synaptogyrins. Upon removal of these proteins, one has to assume that large SV surface areas are stripped of a 'protein coat', so that much more 'naked' lipid membrane is exposed than in wild-type SVs. What argues against the possibility that this alone changes the fusion characteristics of SVs in a manner that might explain the phenotypes observed (e.g. because no 'protein coat' is present to inhibit the interactions of the SV and target membrane, thereby facilitating fusion)? I think this issue should at least be discussed.</p><p>3) In subsection &quot;No alteration in the timing of vesicle trafficking&quot;, the authors relate their findings to earlier claims that synaptophysin 1 may play a role in post-endocytic clearing of SV material from the presynaptic membrane. In this context, they cite three papers, two of which mainly addressed a role of Synaptophysin in endocytosis without focusing on release-site clearance, which are related but different processes. I think the data presented in the present study cannot be taken as strong evidence against a role of synaptophysins and synaptogyrins in endocytosis. To make this claim, the authors would have to assess endocytosis directly. If this is out of the question, the corresponding text should be toned down.</p><p>4) In the Abstract and the main text, the authors state that they studied &quot;a broad range of synapse types&quot;. I find this a bit hyperbolic. They studied calyx of Held synapses, Schaffer collateral synapses, and synapses of cultured hippocampal neurons. This is nice – I do not want to be misunderstood here – but not a &quot;broad range&quot;. After all, some calyx experts have repeatedly made the casual statement that the calyx of Held is like a parallel array of hippocampal-like synapses, and Schaffer collateral synapses in slices and synapses in cultured hippocampal neurons are not so dissimilar either.</p><p>5) Based on the argument above, I am not convinced that the authors' &quot;comparison between calyx of Held and Schaffer collateral synapses is a good test for the generality [of the phenotypes they observe] across synapse types&quot;. On the contrary, I think the general relevance of the present findings remains questionable. This is particularly critical in view of a corresponding study on <italic>C. elegans</italic> (Abraham et al., 2006), which showed that the complete loss of synaptophysin, synaptogyrin, and SCAMP has no effect on spontaneous or evoked synaptic transmission and which is not even cited in the present study. I think that not citing the study by Abraham et al., 2006, is a problematic omission that must be rectified. Further, I think that in the course of discussing the Abraham-paper the whole 'generality' discussion should be toned down in view of the arguments I made above.</p><p>6) The discussion part of the present paper is too speculative for my taste. The link between the present study and phosphorylation of synaptophysins and synaptogyrins, mover, GITs, ELKS, or tomosyn feels a bit constructed and arbitrary. After all, several other mutants show increased vesicular release probability.

Moreover, the low <italic>p<sub>v</sub></italic> vesicles likely are released in parallel with high <italic>p<sub>v</sub></italic> vesicles during low frequency stimulation when the RRP is full because synapses with more low <italic>p<sub>v</sub></italic> vesicles express more paired-pulse facilitation whereas synapses with fewer express more paired-pulse depression (Figure 9 of Mahfooz et al., 2016).</p><p>We are aware that conversion from low to high <italic>p<sub>v</sub></italic> states plays a key role in models from other groups, and we do not rule this out – so long as vesicles in the low p<sub>v</sub> subdivision can be released directly to account for the synchronicity of release immediately after the frequency jump (see Results under heading “Elevated probability of release.…”, and Legend of Figure 5A). Nor do we rule out the idea that high frequency stimulation might accelerate the rate of transfer. In fact, we were able to elucidate a surprising quantitative constraint in Mahfooz et al., 2016; specifically, the transfer between subdivisions would have to be ∼9/s during 300Hz stimulation, at room temperature – not substantially faster or slower – and would have to be reversible. This constraint is not altered at QKO synapses</p><p>Notably, our own WT and QKO data could be modeled equally well by eliminating the transfer in both directions. This eliminates a degree of freedom and has interesting consequences for how synapses might be modulated at the level of mechanism (last paragraph of Results of Mahfooz et al., 2016). In addition, at least one of the recent articles proposing a serial scheme acknowledged that the authors could not rule out alternatives where low and high <italic>p<sub>v</sub></italic> vesicles are processed in parallel (Miki et al., 2016). And finally, there seems to be a growing body of evidence that stable high and low release probability release sites do co-exist at some synapse types (Hu et al., 2013; Muller et al., 2015; Böhme et al., 2016).</p><p>Nevertheless, we have considered alternate scenarios where the low <italic>p<sub>v</sub></italic> vesicles are not actually immediately releasable and the ongoing synchronous transmitter release in the absence of high <italic>p<sub>v</sub></italic> vesicles is explained by fast transfer of a tiny fraction of the un-releasable vesicles to an immediately releasable state in the time between action potentials. The fraction would be the value of mean p<sub>v</sub> we estimated for the low <italic>p<sub>v</sub></italic> vesicles. Our understanding is that the reviewer is asking about the subset of models in this category where the essentially equivalent value for mean p<sub>v</sub> at 50 and 100Hz in Figure 5E is explained by activity dependent acceleration of the rate of transfer that is close to directly proportional to the frequency of stimulation.</p><p>We found that models of this class are not compatible with the results of the frequency jump experiments. We arrived at this conclusion as follows. We reasoned that the acceleration mechanism could not influence the rate of transfer from the un-releasable to immediately releasable state until <italic>after</italic> the first 3.33 ms interstimulus interval during 300Hz stimulation. In contrast, the rate of transfer <italic>during</italic> the first 3.33 ms interstimulus interval would have to be equivalent to the rate during the first 3.33ms of the 20 or 10ms interstimulus intervals during the preceding 50 or 100Hz stimulation. Therefore, one would expect 6-fold or 3-fold fewer new immediately releasable vesicles at the end of the first 3.33ms interstimulus interval compared to before the preceding action potential. If so, the second pulse during 300Hz stimulation would elicit paired-pulse depression rather than the facilitation seen in Figure 5D and Figure supplement 1B. And, indeed, one would expect twice as much paired-pulse depression in Figure 5D compared to Figure supplement 1B (i.e., because the transfer rate during 50Hz stimulation would be half the rate when stimulation is 100Hz). If the acceleration was very fast, the third pulse could then elicit facilitation.This reasoning is now included in the Legend of Figure 5—figure supplement 1.</p><p>For completeness: We are aware that it would be possible to rescue the alternate scenario by replacing the premise that activity accelerates the transfer from un-releasable to immediately releasable states with the premise that single action potentials – at any frequency – always induce transfer of a similar fraction of un-releasable vesicles to the immediately releasable state. If so, synaptophysin family members would have two functional roles:</p><p>a) Negative regulation of the releasablility of immediately releasable vesicles; and,</p><p>b) Negative regulation of the fraction of un-releasable vesicles that are transferred to the immediately releasable state after each action potential.</p><p>However, we do not include a discussion of models of this final class in the manuscript because our understanding is that none have yet been proposed, and it seems unlikely to us because the two roles would have analogous functional effects on the releasability of vesicles in the high and low p<sub>v</sub> subdivisions of the RRP via dissimilar types of mechanisms.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– Why would high Pr vesicles influence the time course of an EPSC?</p></disp-quote><p>We are not certain what is meant here. We would not necessarily expect an influence, but such a factor could explain the results in Fedchyshyn and Wang, 2007.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– A similar amplitude after the 4th AP during a train is consistent with the description of superprimed vesicles (e.g. Taschenberger et al., 2016). Thus in the QKO, more vesicles could reside in the superprimed state.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that the plot in Figure 3C is reminiscent of the effect produced by PdBu in Taschenberger et al., 2016. However, our understanding is that the superpriming idea proposed in Taschenberger et al., 2016, supposes that vesicles are converted from the high <italic>p<sub>v</sub></italic> state to the superprimed state, whereas mean p<sub>v</sub> at QKO synapses seems to be elevated for both the low and high p<sub>v</sub> subdivisions at QKO synapses; this is now noted in the seventh paragraph of the Discussion, which now includes a reference to Taschenberger et al., 2016. Note, however, that the plot in Figure 3C is equally reminiscent of Figure 2B of Mahfooz et al., 2016, where mean p<sub>v</sub> was increased by raising extracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup>, which presumably would not alter the number of superprimed vesicles. Also relevant: Ongoing experiments in the lab suggest that post-tetanic potentiation is intact in QKO synapses; the results will be included in a separate article (we haven’t tried PdBu yet).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>An estimate of the RRP from the steady state at the end of a train does not allow to distinguish between vesicle numbers in different Pr states.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree and did not mean to suggest otherwise. A key point is that we define mean p<sub>v</sub> to be equal to the number of release events following an action potential divided by the quantal content of the RRP immediately beforehand; mean p<sub>v</sub> now replaces some instances of <italic>p<sub>v</sub></italic> in the previous version to make this more clear. Thus, mean p<sub>v</sub> is the mean probability of release of all vesicles within the RRP. Our reasoning does not rely on any assumptions about the distribution of release probabilities of the individuals within the RRP.</p><p>We reasoned that the mean p<sub>v</sub>-value for the vesicles remaining within the RRP during steady state 50 or 100 Hz stimulation can be calculated by dividing the number of quanta released by each action potential during steady state stimulation by the steady state quantal content of the RRP (Figure 5E) just as mean p<sub>v</sub> for the vesicles within the RRP after long rest intervals can be calculated by dividing the number of quanta released by the first action potential in a train by the quantal content of the RRP when completely replenished (Figure 3E).</p><p>We then found that the mean p<sub>v</sub>-value for vesicles remaining in the RRP during steady state 50 or 100 Hz stimulation was lower than the value when the RRP was full for both genotypes, confirming that at least some of the high <italic>p<sub>v</sub></italic> vesicles were eliminated. Next, the mean p<sub>v</sub> value during 50 Hz stimulation was essentially equivalent to during 100 Hz stimulation, even though the standing fullness of the RRP was substantially less during 100 Hz stimulation (Figure 5—figure supplement 2), indicating that almost all of the high <italic>p<sub>v</sub></italic> vesicles were eliminated during both frequencies of stimulation. Finally, the mean p<sub>v</sub>-values for QKO synapses during 50 and 100 Hz stimulation were higher than the corresponding values for WT synapses (Figure 5E). We interpret these results as indicating that synaptophysin family proteins negatively regulate the probability of release of both low and high <italic>p<sub>v</sub></italic> vesicles, and as arguing against scenarios where only vesicles in the high p<sub>v</sub> subdivision are affected.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– The traces in Figure 4C from the end of the 50Hz train and the switch to 300Hz for the two genotypes look similar to me. Not clear to me how the authors derive a difference in the low Pr vesicles.</p></disp-quote><p>We have clarified this in the Results and Figure 5F where the data are normalized so that both QKO and WT results can be plotted on the same graph. Most of the difference between QKO and WT is not actually visible in Figure 5C – Figure 4C in the previous version is Figure 5C in the current version – because of how the data are binned; each plot on the graph is the sum of 6 EPSCs. However, one can still see that – even when binned – responses did decay faster at QKO synapses, and reached a new steady state sooner.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– Some proteins were analyzed, but not proteins previously shown to regulate release probability, such as RIM, Munc13, Rab3, Complexin. Are those proteins upregulated and mediate the increase in Pr?</p></disp-quote><p>We have now looked at levels of RIM1/2, Mun13-1, Raba,b,c, and Complexin in purified synaptosomes in collaboration with Dr. Reinhard Jahn. The results are in Figure 1 and Figure 1—figure supplement 1. We did not find clear evidence for upregulation of any.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– The description of methods and analysis is very limited to the extent that it is e.g. not understandable how the cumulative plots are generated. Why are there steps of different sizes on the y-axes and multiple data points at the same y value?</p></disp-quote><p>The cumulative plots of summary statistics have been replace with standard bar graphs; individual values are plotted on top of the bars. The cumulative plots of electrophysiological responses during repetitive stimulation have not been altered, but these are standard in the field and our understanding is that it was the plots of summary statistics which were seen as difficult to interpret.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– Authors estimate quanta/vesicle numbers from the charge of EPSCs. In high frequency trains, receptor desensitization, saturation and spill was reported. How does it influence the results?</p></disp-quote><p>Responses:</p><p>a) Desensitization: Our conditions were different from the conditions of studies reporting postsynaptic receptor desensitization and saturation in two regards that we believe are relevant: (1) we used tissue from older animals; and (2), experiments where quantal content is estimated from responses during repetitive stimulation were conducted in the presence of 1mM kynurenic acid. We have now added Figure 3—figure supplement 1A-E to show that receptor desensitization does not play a substantial role under these conditions.</p><p>b) Saturation: Likewise, receptor saturation was not a concern in the presence of kynurenic acid because responses were reduced greatly in size, by 85% ± 2% for QKO and 85% ± 3% for WT. Saturation (or voltage clamp errors) could affect estimates of EPSC size recorded in the absence of kynurenic acid when measured as the peak or current integral. However, the estimates of amount of block by 1mM kynurenic acid were likely not affected substantially because we measured the slope of the rising phase (20 to 60%) instead of the peak or current integral for this purpose.</p><p>c) Spill: We have had personal conversations with calyx of Held experts who have raised concerns that part of the response we see during steady state 300Hz stimulation might arise from glutamate that spills over from nearby synaptic clefts. Newly added Figure 3—figure supplement 1F now addresses this possibility.</p><p>In any case:</p><p>i) Our estimates of quantal content and unitary rates of vesicle recruitment during repetitive use agree with estimates from other studies that used different techniques (Neher, 2010);</p><p>ii) We think the estimates are accurate, but even if not, the key conclusions are drawn from either the presence or absence of differences between WT and QKO synapses, rather than from the precise values of quantal content or recruitment rates; and,</p><p>iii) The key conclusions that involve quantal estimates are additionally demonstrated in two other ways using different techniques and preparations. In particular, the experiments in cell culture in Figure 7D avoid completely the involvement of postsynaptic receptors</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– How does the reduced delay between AP and vesicle release affect the trains at 300Hz? Is e.g. desensitization, receptor saturation differently affected?</p></disp-quote><p>We have removed the evidence for a reduced delay between AP and vesicle release as explained in the response to the first reviewer. The results in Figure 3—figure supplement 1AE show that receptor desensitization does not seem to play a role in 1mM or more kynurenic acid</p><p>References:</p><p>Fedchyshyn MJ &amp; Wang LY (2007).
