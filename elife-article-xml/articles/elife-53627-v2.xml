However, how such systems regulate development and function of myeloid cells is barely understood. Here we show that in contrast to its critical role in T cells, the murine Trx1 system is dispensable for steady-state myeloid-cell hematopoiesis due to their capacity to tap the glutathione/glutaredoxin pathway for DNA biosynthesis. However, the Trx1 pathway instrumentally enables nuclear NF-κB DNA-binding and thereby pro-inflammatory responses in monocytes and dendritic cells. Moreover, independent of this activity, Trx1 is critical for NLRP3 inflammasome activation and IL-1β production in macrophages by detoxifying excessive ROS levels. Notably, we exclude the involvement of the Trx1 inhibitor Txnip as a redox-sensitive ligand of NLRP3 as previously proposed. Together, this study suggests that targeting Trx1 may be exploited to treat inflammatory diseases.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>nf- kb</kwd><kwd>NLRP3 inflammasome</kwd><kwd>thioredoxin-1</kwd><kwd>glutaredoxin</kwd><kwd>reactive oxygen species</kwd><kwd>txnip</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100003006</institution-id><institution>ETH Zürich</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>ETH-23-16-2</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kopf</surname><given-names>Manfred</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001711</institution-id><institution>Swiss National Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>310030B_182829</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kopf</surname><given-names>Manfred</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The thioredoxin-1 (Trx1) system promotes inflammation by positively regulating both NLRP3 inflammasome responses, by detoxifying excessive ROS independently of Txnip and NF-κB binding to target DNA.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Aerobic organisms must continuously prevent the oxidation of their cellular macromolecules. To achieve this, they have evolved a sophisticated system composed of antioxidant proteins that ensure redox homeostasis in the cell. The two main pathways that make up this cellular redox system are the thioredoxin (Trx) system and the glutathione (GSH) system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Arnér and Holmgren, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Couto et al., 2016</xref>). GSH can donate electrons to both glutaredoxins (Grx) and glutathione peroxidases (Gpx), a member of which, namely Gpx4, has been recently shown to prevent ferroptotic cell death in T and B1 cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Matsushita et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Muri et al., 2019a</xref>). Both the Trx and GSH systems ultimately rely on the reducing power from NADPH, which in mammals is generated by the alternative oxidation of glucose in the pentose phosphate pathway (PPP) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Stanton, 2012</xref>). In turn, the Trx and the GSH/Grx systems provide reducing equivalents that sustain a number of cellular processes crucial for cell function, cell survival, cell proliferation, and redox-regulated signaling pathways. For instance, they fuel the reducing power for DNA synthesis by ribonucleotide reductase (RNR) during proliferation, for scavenging reactive oxygen species (ROS), and for the reduction of protein disulfides back to their reduced state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Camier et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Holmgren, 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Holmgren, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Muri et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Potamitou et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Prinz et al., 1997</xref>). In the cytosolic Trx1 system, Trx reductase 1 (TrxR1, encoded by the <italic>Txnrd1</italic> gene) has the unique capacity to transfer electrons from NADPH to oxidized Trx1 (encoded by the <italic>Txn1</italic> gene), thereby keeping Trx1 in its reduced state. Thioredoxin-interacting protein (Txnip) is an additional member of the Trx1 system, which negatively regulates Trx function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Arnér, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Mustacich and Powis, 2000</xref>). In the GSH/Grx system, by contrast, glutathione reductase (Gsr) maintains the pool of cellular GSH in its reduced state, which in turn further reduces oxidized Grx (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Lu, 2013</xref>). To which extent the Trx and the GSH/glutaredoxin systems compensate for each others functions in vivo remains unknown.</p><p>Macrophages and dendritic cells (DCs) secrete several inflammatory cytokines to orchestrate immune responses. Upon sensing microbial components via Toll-like receptors (TLR), they utilize the MyD88 adaptor to activate nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB)-dependent transcription of pro-inflammatory cytokines including IL-6 (encoded by the <italic>Il6</italic> gene), IL-12p40 (encoded by the <italic>Il12b</italic> gene), TNF-α (encoded by the <italic>Tnfa</italic> gene) and IL-1β (encoded by the <italic>Il1b</italic> gene) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Akira and Takeda, 2004</xref>). Secretion of IL-1β, however, needs a second signal required for inflammasome assembly, caspase-1 or −11 activation, processing of the immature IL-1β precursor (pro-IL-1β), and subsequent release of the active and mature form of IL-1β (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Martinon et al., 2002</xref>). A variety of different stimuli that activate inflammasome have been described in the field, especially for the canonical NLRP3 inflammasome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Broz and Dixit, 2016</xref>). Interestingly, cellular redox regulation and ROS production have been described to regulate both NF-κB activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Morgan and Liu, 2011</xref>) and NLRP3 inflammasome function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Tschopp and Schroder, 2010</xref>). However, the molecular mechanisms of this redox regulation remain to be defined. In particular, the Trx-inhibitor Txnip has been proposed to activate the NLRP3 inflammasome in response to ROS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Zhou et al., 2010</xref>), although these results remain controversial (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Masters et al., 2010</xref>). Therefore, the mechanism by which redox regulation is linked to NF-κB and inflammasome regulation is not fully resolved yet.</p><p>We have previously characterized the roles of the Trx1 and GSH/Grx1 systems in T- and B-cell immunity. Notably, we demonstrated that the Trx1 system is critically required to fuel reducing power for the sustainment of DNA biosynthesis during metabolic reprogramming in T but not in follicular B cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Muri et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Muri et al., 2019b</xref>). In the present study, we found that the Trx1 system is dispensable for the steady-state hematopoiesis of myeloid cells (i.e. neutrophils, monocytes, macrophages and DC subsets), which efficiently rearrange their redox system toward the GSH/Grx pathway to fuel proliferation when the Trx1 system is absent. Furthermore, we demonstrated how the Trx1 and Grx systems differentially regulate the inflammatory responses of bone marrow-derived DCs (BMDCs) and macrophages (BMDMs). Specifically, while the first utilize the reducing power of the Trx1 system to allow efficient NF-κB p65 transcription factor binding to its DNA response element, the latter need Trx1-dependent antioxidant functions to enable NLRP3 inflammasome formation and IL-1β release. Importantly, our data exclude a role of Txnip in NLRP3 inflammasome regulation as previously proposed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Zhou et al., 2010</xref>). In conclusion, these results suggest that therapeutic intervention aimed at blocking the Trx1 system may be beneficial to treat inflammatory diseases.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>The Trx1 system is dispensable for myeloid-cell but not T-cell development and homeostatic maintenance</title><p>To investigate the requirement of the Trx1 system in myeloid cells during development and homeostatic maintenance, we crossed mice carrying tamoxifen (TAM)-inducible Rosa26-CreERT2 with mice carrying <italic>lox</italic>P-flanked <italic>Txnrd1</italic> alleles to generate progeny (<italic>Txnrd1<sup>fl/fl</sup></italic>;Rosa26-CreERT2) in which <italic>Txnrd1</italic> is globally deleted upon TAM administration.

Therefore, we first generated mixed-bone marrow chimeras as described above. After reconstitution, mice were injected with TAM to delete the <italic>Txnrd1</italic> gene and subsequently treated with BSO over a period of 22 days to deplete GSH (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). Expectedly, BSO-treated mice showed a significant reduction in total GSH levels compared to controls in the bone marrow and in the spleen (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B,C</xref>). In keeping with the data presented above, TAM administration led to a partial defect displayed by <italic>Txnrd1</italic>-deficient blood neutrophils, eosinophils and monocytes in a competitive setting with WT cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D,E</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). Interestingly, however, additional depletion of GSH strikingly reduced <italic>Txnrd1</italic>-deficient granulocytes within 5 days after oral BSO administration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D,E</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). Neutrophils, eosinophils and monocytes lacking the Trx1 system from the bone marrow, lungs and spleen also displayed a similar sensitivity to GSH depletion as observed in the blood (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F–H</xref>). Although DCs were similarly affected, <italic>Txnrd1</italic>-deficient tissue resident macrophages in the lungs and in the spleen only showed a minor reduction upon BSO administration, consistent with their fetal origin and local persistence by slow turnover during adult life (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G,H</xref>). In keeping with the data presented above, <italic>Txnrd1</italic>-deficient CD4<sup>+</sup>CD8<sup>+</sup> double positive, CD4<sup>+</sup> and CD8<sup>+</sup> single positive thymocytes were completely outcompeted by WT cells irrespective of BSO treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2I</xref>), consistent with the critical role of the Trx1 system and dispensability of the GSH/Grx system for T-cell proliferation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Muri et al., 2018</xref>).

In keeping with our hypothesis, we observed reduced NF-κB p65 DNA binding to the promoters of the pro-inflammatory genes <italic>Il12b</italic>, <italic>Il1b</italic> and <italic>Il6</italic>, and of the notorious NF-κB target gene <italic>Nfkbia</italic> (encoding IκB-α) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>). Furthermore, we validated our ChIP results using an ELISA-based method for detecting specific p65 transcription factor DNA binding in nuclear extracts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>). Thus, these data indicate that the Trx1 system positively regulates transcription of pro-inflammatory cytokines by promoting the binding of NF-κB to its DNA response element in BMDCs.</p><p>As the Trx1 system is an important player in maintaining cellular redox homeostasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Mustacich and Powis, 2000</xref>), we next investigated whether deletion of <italic>Txnrd1</italic> would impact ROS levels and consequently cytokine secretion in BMDCs. Despite a significant increase in total cellular ROS levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s3">Figure 5—figure supplement 3A</xref>), the reduction in IL-12p40 secretion by <italic>Txnrd1</italic>-deficient BMDCs was not restored by the supplementation of a panel of antioxidants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s3">Figure 5—figure supplement 3B,C</xref>). Importantly, we verified as a control that the antioxidant catalase scavenged excessive ROS in the absence of the <italic>Txnrd1</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s3">Figure 5—figure supplement 3D</xref>). Together, these results suggest that the defect in pro-inflammatory cytokine secretion is not a consequence of a general increase of ROS but is due to the compromised Trx1-mediated regulation of the redox status of NF-κB, which interferes with NF-κB p65 binding to the DNA.</p></sec><sec id="s2-7"><title>The Trx1 system promotes M1 macrophage polarization</title><p>The BMDC culture is known to comprise both conventional DCs and monocyte-derived macrophages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Helft et al., 2015</xref>) with the latter only possessing the capacity of inflammasome activation and IL-1β release (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Erlich et al., 2019</xref>).

Overall, here we show that while BMDCs are critically dependent on the Trx1 system for NF-κB-mediated pro-inflammatory cytokine secretion, BMDMs can utilize both the Trx1 and GSH/Grx systems to fuel redox reactions aimed at promoting NF-κB-binding activity and consequent transcription of pro-inflammatory target genes.</p></sec><sec id="s2-9"><title>The Trx1 system but not Txnip positively regulates NLRP3 inflammasome-driven IL-1β maturation</title><p>An intact signal one in <italic>Txnrd1</italic>-deficient BMDMs, in contrast to <italic>Txnrd1</italic>-deficient BMDCs, allowed us to study the quality of signal two and inflammasome activation in the absence of <italic>Txnrd1</italic>.

In line with the in vitro defects, we found that <italic>Txnrd1</italic>-deficient mice display an impaired neutrophil influx (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D</xref>) and reduced IL-1β production (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7E</xref>) upon MSU injection compared to WT mice. Therefore, these results further confirm that the Trx1 system plays a critical role in NLRP3 inflammasome activation and IL-1β secretion in vivo.</p><p>The Trx1 system is a major player in the control of cellular antioxidant responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Mustacich and Powis, 2000</xref>). Therefore, we next hypothesized that <italic>Txnrd1</italic> deficiency may influence ROS homeostasis and consequently negatively affect the normal processing of IL-1β by the NLRP3 inflammasome. To test this possibility, we first quantified cellular ROS in the absence of the Trx1 system by CM-H<sub>2</sub>DCFDA staining and observed that <italic>Txnrd1</italic>-deficient BMDMs accumulated ROS to a higher extent compared to control cells after treatment with LPS or R837 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7F,G</xref>). Notably, we additionally found that supplementation with a cell-permeable version of catalase, one of the main cellular antioxidants involved in the neutralization of hydrogen peroxide, can restore ATP- and alum-induced IL-1β production in <italic>Txnrd1</italic>-deficient BMDMs up to WT levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7H</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s2">Figure 7—figure supplement 2</xref>). As a control, we verified that addition of catalase does not affect the expression of the <italic>Il1b</italic> gene (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s3">Figure 7—figure supplement 3</xref>). By contrast, other classical antioxidants, such as N-acetyl-L-cysteine (NAC), ascorbic acid (AA), dithiothreitol (DTT), and diphenyleneiodonium (DPI), did not rescue the impaired IL-1β production in the absence of the Trx1 system (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s4">Figure 7—figure supplement 4</xref>). As ROS are commonly described as inducers of the NLRP3 inflammasome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Tschopp and Schroder, 2010</xref>), we next aimed at better understanding why the antioxidant catalase restores IL-1β production in the absence of the Trx1 system. Therefore, we incubated <italic>Txnrd1</italic>-deficient and -sufficient BMDMs with increasing concentrations of catalase and measured IL-1β secretion and ROS levels upon LPS and ATP stimulation. We observed that only low concentrations of catalase restored defective IL-1β production in <italic>Txnrd1</italic>-deficient cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7I</xref>) and concomitantly reduced ROS to levels observed in WT cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7J</xref>). However, higher concentrations of the antioxidant catalase (described as ‘medium’ and ‘high’ in the graphs) more potently inhibited cellular ROS and consequently IL-1β secretion upon NLRP3 inflammasome activation in both WT and <italic>Txnrd1</italic>-deficient BMDMs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7I,J</xref>), in line with the general view of ROS as triggers of the NLRP3 inflammasome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Tschopp and Schroder, 2010</xref>). Altogether, these results demonstrate that the Trx1 pathway is crucial for IL-1β production in macrophages by prevention of an excessive accumulation of hydrogen peroxide.</p><p>Our data suggest that excessive levels of ROS impair inflammasome activation. Contrary to these observations, the Trx1 inhibitor Txnip has been described as a redox-sensitive ligand of the NLRP3 inflammasome that promotes mature IL-1β production in response to ROS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Zhou et al., 2010</xref>). Therefore, to reconcile this and comprehensively understand how the Trx1-Txnip system regulates IL-1β release, we generated <italic>Txnip<sup>fl/fl</sup>;Vav1-Cre</italic> mice by crossing mice with <italic>lox</italic>P-flanked <italic>Txnip</italic> alleles to mice expressing Cre recombinase from the <italic>Vav1</italic> promoter, and differentiated in vitro BMDMs as described above. Although <italic>Txnip</italic> deletion was complete at the mRNA level (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s5">Figure 7—figure supplement 5A</xref>), <italic>Txnip</italic>-deficient BMDMs did not show any defects in IL-12p40 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s5">Figure 7—figure supplement 5B</xref>) and IL-1β secretion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7K,L</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s5">Figure 7—figure supplement 5C</xref>) compared to WT controls. Moreover, administration of MSU into <italic>Txnip</italic>-deficient and sufficient mice elicited a comparable influx of neutrophils in the peritoneum (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7M</xref>), thereby further supporting the dispensability of Txnip in NLRP3 inflammasome activation. Together, these data demonstrate that Trx1 but not Txnip is critical for NLRP3-dependent processing of IL-1β.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>In this study, we assessed the role of the Trx1 system in the development, homeostatic maintenance, and inflammatory responses of myeloid cells. We found that the Trx1 pathway is not required for development and maintenance of tissue and blood monocytes, DCs, neutrophils, eosinophils and macrophages due to their flexibility in rearranging their redox system toward the GSH/Grx pathway to fuel cellular thiol-based reactions when the Trx1 system is compromised, in contrast to its critical role for the development of T cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Muri et al., 2018</xref>). However, in a situation of emergency myelopoiesis driven by endotoxin, when proliferation of myeloid precursors bursts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Boettcher et al., 2012</xref>), the GSH/Grx pathway was insufficient to fully compensate for the absence of the Trx1 system and fewer neutrophils were found in blood of TAM-treated <italic>Txnrd1<sup>fl/fl</sup></italic>;Rosa26-CreERT2 mice. This may be either due to less efficient donation of electrons to RNR by the GSH/Grx system at the last step of the PPP or due to a delay in mobilization of this backup system. Indeed, we previously reported a delay in engagement of the Grx pathway in germinal center responses of follicular B cells lacking <italic>Txnrd1</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Muri et al., 2019b</xref>).</p><p>Importantly, we have established a critical role of the Trx1 system for pro-inflammatory responses in both DCs and macrophages. Using BMDCs, we showed that Trx1 provides reducing equivalents for the redox-dependent binding of the NF-κB p65 transcription factor to target DNA in DCs. The transcription factor NF-κB serves as a crucial mediator of inflammatory responses by inducing the expression of numerous pro-inflammatory cytokine and chemokine genes among others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Liu et al., 2017</xref>). NF-κB regulation is tightly controlled both in the cytoplasm and in the nucleus, and many factors and conditions are known to control NF-κB induction including ROS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Gloire and Piette, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Kabe et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Schreck et al., 1991</xref>). Interestingly, while redox regulation of NF-κB activity by the Trx1 antioxidant pathway has been proposed, its contribution in inflammation remains controversial because both activating and inhibitory effects have been described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Isakov et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Kabe et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Lillig and Holmgren, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Morgan and Liu, 2011</xref>). Our results demonstrate that the Trx1 system promotes the DNA-binding capacity of NF-κB in the nucleus rather than its activation in the cytoplasm or nuclear translocation. Trx1 promotes NF-κB DNA binding probably by structural modification of a component(s) (e.g. via reduction of disulfide bonds) of the NF-κB binding complex rather than through indirect effects of ROS, since supplementation with different antioxidants did not restore NF-κB activity in <italic>Txnrd1</italic>-deficient BMDCs.</p><p>GM-CSF-driven BMDCs are known to comprise a mixture of conventional DCs, monocyte-derived DCs and macrophages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Helft et al., 2015</xref>), with the latter population only capable of inflammasome-dependent IL-1β production (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Erlich et al., 2019</xref>). Therefore, we aimed to verify our results in BMDMs generated with M-CSF, which are thought to consist of a pure population of macrophages. However, in contrast to BMDCs, we surprisingly found that BMDMs displayed normal NF-κB DNA binding activity and transcription of pro-inflammatory genes in the absence of the Trx1 system and showed that this is due to higher expression of the cellular Grx proteins in BMDMs compared to BMDCs. Indeed, we showed that BMDMs but not BMDCs have the capability to engage the Grx pathway when the Trx1 system is genetically deleted. Thus, Trx1 activates NF-κB transcription, and depending on the expression levels of Grx proteins in different myeloid-cell types, <italic>Txnrd1</italic>-deficiency may have more or less pronounced outcomes. Myeloid cells are known to generate high amounts of ROS by NADPH oxidases to fight intracellular microbes, which may explain the requirement of robust ROS scavenging systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Lambeth, 2004</xref>).</p><p>Inflammasomes are cytoplasmic multiprotein complexes that trigger IL-1β processing and release (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Broz and Dixit, 2016</xref>). Although Txnip has been suggested as a redox-sensitive ligand of NLRP3 that links ROS generation to NLRP3 inflammasome activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Zhou et al., 2010</xref>), we here showed that NLRP3-dependent IL-1β production in macrophages is independent of Txnip both in vitro and in vivo. In contrast, our study identifies the Txnip-interacting partner Trx1 as a critical regulator of inflammasome-dependent IL-1β release in macrophages. In the absence of the Trx1 system, we observed drastically impaired IL-1β production in response to classical NLRP3 stimuli in vitro and during MSU-induced peritonitis in vivo, while pro-<italic>Il1b</italic> transcription was unaltered. Interestingly, <italic>Txnrd1</italic>-deficient BMDMs displayed excessive intracellular ROS levels upon TLR triggering, and decomposition of hydrogen peroxide to water and oxygen with a cell-permeable form of the enzyme catalase restored IL-1β production. Notably, other anti-oxidants lacked this capacity, indicating that local peroxide detoxification by Trx1 is critical for NLRP3 inflammasome activation. Thus, our findings suggest that moderate ROS levels act as triggers for the NLRP3 inflammasome in line with the known role of mitochondrial ROS released from stressed mitochondria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Latz et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Zhou et al., 2011</xref>), while excessive ROS levels display an opposite effect and inhibit NLRP3 activation. Excessive ROS concentrations may lead to the oxidation of particular components of the inflammasome machinery (e.g. ASC, NLRP3, or caspase-1), with detrimental consequences for their ability to assemble and/or cleave IL-1β. Likely candidates might be oxidations on cysteine (Cys-disulfide; Cys-sulfenic acid; Cys-sulfinic acid; Cys-sulfonic acid) and on methionine (Met-sulfoxide), which are generally caused by oxidizing agents such as ROS. In keeping with this hypothesis, nitrogen oxide (NO) has been reported to induce NLRP3 and caspase-1 nitrosylation and thereby inhibit NLRP3 inflammasome activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Kim et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Mishra et al., 2013</xref>). Taken together, ROS must be kept within a restricted window of concentrations to allow inflammasome activation, where both an excess or an undersupply prevent it. A non-linear dose response to a stressor (e.g. ROS) with a certain effect at low doses and the reverse at high doses has been referred to as hormesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Ristow, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Ristow and Schmeisser, 2011</xref>). Our results are in line with an hormetic regulation of NLRP3 inflammasome activity by ROS, which promote its assembly at moderate concentrations, while they inhibit it at low and high concentrations.</p><p>While classically activated M1 macrophages are associated with inflammatory responses, alternatively activated M2 macrophages are described as anti-inflammatory, thereby promoting tissue remodeling and resolution of inflammation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chinetti-Gbaguidi et al., 2015</xref>). Interestingly, extensive research has demonstrated that the distinct metabolic phenotypes of these two types of macrophages dictate their function. For instance, M1 macrophages undergo increased rates of glycolysis compared to M2 macrophages, allowing rapid ATP production and sustainment of the PPP in order to generate NADPH for ROS production and de novo nucleotide biosynthesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Kelly and O'Neill, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">O'Neill, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Russell et al., 2019</xref>). We found that LPS/IFN-γ but not IL-4 stimulation leads to an induction of the Trx1 system, which is in line with the observed impairment in M1 polarization in the absence of the Trx1 pathway. As discussed above, Trx1 donates electrons to RNR, which catalyzes the rate-limiting step of the PPP, leading to nucleotide biosynthesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Holmgren and Sengupta, 2010</xref>). Therefore, the importance of the Trx1 system in M1 polarization is consistent with the high rates of the PPP in these cells. Why M1 macrophages require such enormous amounts of DNA building blocks despite their low proliferative capacity is unknown, although it has been suggested that they need them to generate different RNA populations, such as microRNAs and long non-coding RNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">O'Neill et al., 2016</xref>). In <italic>Txnrd1</italic>-deficient M1 macrophages, reduced levels of these regulatory RNAs may impact proper M1 polarization. M2 macrophages, on the other hand, seem to suppress the PPP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Haschemi et al., 2012</xref>). Thus, this observation is fully in line with the dispensability of the Trx1 system in fueling the PPP during M2 polarization.</p><p>Our results show that the cellular redox systems of BMDCs and BMDMs differ considerably, with each providing valuable information to the mechanism. The defect of NF-κB mediated transcription (also referred to as signal 1 in the inflammasome field) in <italic>Txnrd1</italic>-deficient BMDCs did not allow to study inflammasome activity due to impaired transcription of pro-IL1β mRNA, which was intact in BMDMs and therefore allowing to unravel the function of Trx1 in NLRP3 activation. Importantly, we confirmed impaired NLRP3 inflammasome activity in vivo by treatment of <italic>Txnrd1</italic>-deficient mice with MSU. The differential redox regulation in BMDCs and BMDMs may reflect distinct requirements of the Trx1 and GSH/Grx pathways for the inflammatory response of DCs, tissue macrophages and monocyte-derived macrophages in vivo.</p><p>In conclusion, our study reveals a key role of the Trx1 system for NF-κB-mediated inflammatory responses as well as NLRP3 inflammasome-mediated IL-1β release. Consequently, these results unveil therapeutic opportunities for treatment of inflammatory diseases with Trx1 inhibitors.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and

Fresh medium was added on day 3 and day 6 of culture, and non-adherent cells were harvested and used in experiments on day 7 of culture. BMDMs were cultured analogously, but with medium supplemented with 20 ng/ml recombinant M-CSF (PeproTech). Adherent BMDMs detached by washing plates with cold PBS + 2 mM EDTA (Sigma-Aldrich) were used in experiments. For differentiation of BMDMs toward M1 and M2, cells were polarized in the presence of ultra-pure LPS from <italic>Escherichia coli O111:B4</italic> (20 ng/ml; InvivoGen) + IFN-γ (50 ng/ml; PeproTech) and IL-4 (20 ng/ml; PeproTech), respectively. For analysis of M1/M2 markers at the RNA and protein levels, BMDMs were polarized for 24 and 48 hr, respectively. For BMDC/BMDM stimulation, cells were generally primed with R837 (Tocris Bioscience), CpG (InvivoGen), Ultra-pure LPS from <italic>Escherichia coli O111:B4</italic> (InvivoGen), lipoteichoic acid from <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic> (InvivoGen), and zymosan A (Sigma-Aldrich).

Cells were washed using ice-cold PBS, resuspended in swelling buffer (25 mM HEPES [pH 8], 1.5 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 10 mM KCl, 0.5% NP-40) with protease inhibitors for 15 min, spun down and finally resuspended in 400 μl lysis buffer (PBS [1x], 1% SDS, 1% NP-40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate) with protease inhibitors for 10 min. Sonication was subsequently performed using the Bioruptor (Diagenode; 30 cycles of 30 s on, 30 s off) at 4°C to shear chromatin into ca. 200–300 base-pair DNA fragments. Sonicated samples were diluted with 1.6 ml of lysis buffer without SDS (PBS [1x], 1% NP-40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate). 40 μg sonicated chromatin in 1 ml volume was precleared by adding 50 μl of dynabeads (Thermo Scientific) and incubation on a wheel for 2 hr at 4°C. At this stage, 10% of chromatin was taken as input DNA. Supernatant was then collected, 3 μg of p65 antibody (Biolegend) was added, and samples were incubated overnight at 4°C on a wheel. Chromatin-antibody complexes were then retrieved by adding 50 μl of dynabeads (Thermo Scientific) and incubation for 4 hr at 4°C on a wheel.

key enzyme in the Thioredoxin system, influences emergency myelopoiesis, inflammatory gene induction in dendritic cells, and NLRP3 inflammasome activation. The findings indicated that TrxR1 activity modulates an optimal level of cellular ROS that is needed for normal myeloid cell functionality.</p><p><bold>Decision letter after peer review:</bold></p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Thioredoxin-1 differentially promotes NF-κB target DNA binding and NLRP3 inflammasome activation independently of Txnip&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the evaluation has been overseen by Satyajit Rath as the Senior Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>Antioxidant systems maintain cellular redox homeostasis, yet how this affects myeloid cell biology is not well understood. Here Kopek et al. examine the effects of genetic deletion of <italic>Txnrd1</italic>, a key enzyme in the Thioredoxin system, on myeloid cell development/homeostasis, polarization, and effector functions.</p><p>The authors found that <italic>Txnrd1</italic> deletion had little effect on steady state myeloid cell numbers, but led to significant reduction in a competitive setting with WT counterparts and during emergency myelopoiesis.</p><p>Upon exposure to Toll-like receptor agonists, <italic>Txnrd1</italic>-deficient bone marrow derived dendritic cells (BMDCs) displayed reduced induction of Il12p40, Il1b, and Il6, which was attributed to reduced p65 DNA binding. However, <italic>Txnrd1</italic>-deficient bone marrow derived macrophages (BMDMs) compensated by upregulating enzymes of the GSH/Grx system leading to no reduction of inflammatory gene induction.</p><p>Finally, the authors examined NLRP3 inflammasome activation in BMDMs. The authors found that <italic>Txnrd1</italic> deficiency led to decreased NLRP3 inflammasome activation, which they attributed to increased ROS production, since treatment with cell permeable catalase rescued the defect.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The authors should obtain more support for their conclusion that excessive levels of ROS impair NLRP3 inflammasome activation given that many previous studies have reached opposite conclusions.</p><p>• The authors are advised to more definitely examine NLRP3 inflammasome activation by interrogating IL-1β and caspase-1 processing by western blot.</p><p>• The authors need to offer some explanation, ideally supported by experimental evidence, for the discrepant role of ROS in inflammasome activation in their data versus the literature. For example, is it possible to gradually titrate the amount of catalase added to either WT or <italic>Txnrd1</italic> deficient BMDMs and to see dose dependent effects on DCFDA staining concomitant with different effects on inflammasome activation? In Figure 7H-K, can the authors confirm that addition of catalase does not affect Il1b gene induction? At the very least, the authors should propose experiments that could be done in future studies to confirm the differing effects of excessive versus moderate ROS levels on inflammasome activation.</p><p>2) Clarification is needed on a few points in the second part of the story addressing the role of the Trx system in NF-κB activation.</p><p>• The authors should confirm the defect in p65 DNA binding using p65 ChIP at the promoters of the inflammatory genes.</p><p>• What is the proposed mechanism for why <italic>Txnrd1</italic> deficiency is more specific for NF-κB regulation than general oxidation? A control that demonstrates the general efficacy of the reducing agents seems warranted.</p><p>• It is not clear why nuclear NF-κB is unchanged (Figure 5B) but DNA binding is affected (Figure 5E) in the KO.</p><p>3) In the first part of the story, the authors conclude that reduced myeloid cell numbers in the absence of the antioxidant system(s) is due to defects in proliferation, but data to support this is lacking. The authors are advised to describe the data as defects in &quot;maintenance&quot; and &quot;homeostasis&quot;.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.53627.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:1) The authors should obtain more support for their conclusion that excessive levels of ROS impair NLRP3 inflammasome activation given that many previous studies have reached opposite conclusions.• The authors are advised to more definitely examine NLRP3 inflammasome activation by interrogating IL-1β and caspase-1 processing by western blot.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewers for this important comment. As suggested, we have now performed western blotting for IL-1β and caspase-1 in both the cell lysate and SN upon stimulation with LPS/R837 and ATP/Alum to interrogate NLRP3 inflammasome activation. Consistent with the impaired secretion of IL-1β in the absence of the Trx1 system measured by ELISA, we found reduced levels of both processed IL-1β and caspase-1 by western blot (see new Figure 7C and Figure 7—figure supplement 1B). Thus, these data are in line with a defect in the activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome when the <italic>Txnrd1</italic> gene is deleted.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>• The authors need to offer some explanation, ideally supported by experimental evidence, for the discrepant role of ROS in inflammasome activation in their data versus the literature. For example, is it possible to gradually titrate the amount of catalase added to either WT or Txnrd1 deficient BMDMs and to see dose dependent effects on DCFDA staining concomitant with different effects on inflammasome activation?</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewers that this is a critical point. First of all, it is important to mention that, as already described in the Discussion section, nitrogen oxide (a key nitrogen reactive species [RNS]) can nitrosylate NLRP3 and caspase-1, thus leading to NLRP3 inflammasome inhibition (see for example PMID: 9780184 and PMID: 23160153). One could imagine a similar mechanism with ROS and in particular with H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>, where excessive level of this particular ROS may result in the oxidation/peroxidation of inflammasome components (such as ASC, NLRP3, and caspase-1 among others) or other inflammasome regulators, thus compromising their proper functionality. This would be consistent with the defect that we have observed in IL-1β and caspase-1 processing. We believe that our data/conclusions are not opposite to other studies in the field as we report that only excessive levels of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> due to <italic>Txnrd1</italic> deletion impair inflammasome function. To further strengthen this model, we followed the suggestions of the reviewers and titrated the amount of catalase to see dose dependent effects on DCFDA staining and IL-1β secretion (see new Figures 7I and 7J). Interestingly, we now show that only low levels of catalase could rescue IL-1β production in the absence on <italic>Txnrd1</italic> by bringing ROS to the levels observed in WT cells. By contrast, increased catalase concentrations, which led to a more drastic inhibition of ROS, turned out to display the opposite effects and thus inhibit inflammasome formation in both WT and KO BMDMs. This observation is in line with the many reports in the literature that describe ROS as inducers of NLRP3 inflammasome. In conclusion, our data confirms that ROS are involved in NLRP3 inflammasome activation; however, they also highlight that an excess of ROS (for example due to the genetic ablation of the key antioxidant pathway Trx1) impairs NLRP3 activation. As mentioned, the underlying molecular mechanism is unknown and currently under investigation, but it could involve a general oxidation of inflammasome components which compromises their proper functionality.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In Figure 7H-K, can the authors confirm that addition of catalase does not affect Il1b gene induction?</p></disp-quote><p>We are thankful for the reviewers’ thoughtful suggestion. First of all, it is important to mention here that the levels of IL-1β mRNA in KO BMDMs, as we have already shown in our initial submission (see new Figure 7B), are higher compared to WT cells, despite a large impairment in IL-1β secretion (probably due to compensation mechanisms). Importantly, however, by performing the experiment suggested by the reviewers, we have observed that catalase treatment does not affect the transcriptional levels of IL-1β (after either LPS or CpG priming) in both WT and KO cells (see new Figure 7—figure supplement 3). Thus, these data suggest that catalase treatment promotes inflammasome activation rather than affecting priming in KO BMDMs.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>At the very least, the authors should propose experiments that could be done in future studies to confirm the differing effects of excessive versus moderate ROS levels on inflammasome activation.</p></disp-quote><p>To date, various cellular and molecular events have been proposed as trigger for the NLRP3 inflammasome, such as potassium efflux, lysosomal destabilization and ROS among others. Although ROS are one of the first NLRP3 activators that have been identified, the exact mechanism by which the NLRP3 inflammasome senses ROS remains still unknown and is beyond the aim of this study. A clear example for the huge controversy of ROS in the inflammasome field is given by the role of the key antioxidant pathway Nrf2. In particular, Nrf2 has been associated with both a negative (e.g. PMID 27211851; PMID 29590092) and a positive (e.g. PMID: 24798340; PMID: 21484785) regulation of IL-1β responses. Thus, we strongly believe that understanding how ROS affect NLRP3 inflammasome activation and especially how various concentrations of ROS have different effects might be not so simple. As we have already mentioned before, we believe and our data suggest that moderate/medium ROS levels trigger or participate in the activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome, while excessive/damaging ROS concentrations are inhibitory because they may oxidize and compromise the functionality of factors that are needed for inflammasome formation. To test this in future studies, we are currently planning to determine protein oxidations caused by <italic>Txnrd1</italic> deficiency using unbiased mass spectrometry. Likely candidates might be oxidations on cysteine (Cys-disulfide; Cys-sulfenic acid; Cys-sulfinic acid; Cys-sulfonic acid) and on methionine (Met-sulfoxide), which are generally caused by oxidizing agents such as ROS (this has now been added to the Discussion section). One should for example analyze the most significant differences in oxidation patterns between WT and KO cells, focusing on known inflammasome components and other regulators. Using this strategy, we actually aim to understand whether genetic ablation of a key antioxidant pathway leading to high and detrimental ROS levels shifts the redox balance and leads to oxidation of proteins involved in NLRP3 inflammasome function.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Clarification is needed on a few points in the second part of the story addressing the role of the Trx system in NF-κB activation.• The authors should confirm the defect in p65 DNA binding using p65 ChIP at the promoters of the inflammatory genes.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewers that validating the results obtained with the ELISA-based method will strengthen the conclusion. Indeed, as suggested, we have now performed p65 ChIP-qPCR at the promoters of the inflammatory genes (the details about the utilized procedure can be found in the new method section). We tested four different genes (<italic>IL-12p40</italic>, <italic>IL-6</italic>, <italic>IL-1β</italic> and <italic>Nfkbia</italic>), which are all well-known NF-κB target genes, and we performed qPCR utilizing two different primer sets for each gene. The first primer pair (named as “promoter”) allowed us to amplify a fragment close to the NF-κB binding sites at the promoter region, whereas the second primer pair (named as “Ctr primers”) was used as a control to amplify a region several kilobases away from the NF-κB binding sites. As depicted in the new Figure 5D, we were able to confirm that <italic>Txnrd1</italic>-deficient BMDCs display a reduced NF-κB binding to target DNA.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>• What is the proposed mechanism for why Txnrd1 deficiency is more specific for NF-κB regulation than general oxidation? A control that demonstrates the general efficacy of the reducing agents seems warranted.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewers for mentioning this important point. Unfortunately, it seems like we were not clear enough in our initial description of the data, which must have resulted in a misunderstanding of the reviewer(s). The reason why we studied the NLRP3 inflammasome phenotype exclusively in BMDMs is that they do not display any defects in IL-1β transcription. In contrast, BMDCs have a drastic impairment in TLR priming, thus rendering the investigation of NLRP3-inflammasome function more complicated. This said, our data do not indicate that “Txnrd1 deficiency is more specific for NF-κB regulation than general oxidation” in BMDCs; indeed, in BMDCs, we observed both a defect in NF-κB binding to target DNA and a general increase of ROS, which is likely leading to a defective NLRP3 activation as we have shown for BMDMs. Originally, we omitted these data from our manuscript to reduce complexity and facilitate readability and understanding of the story. Unfortunately, it seems like that we reached the opposite and created confusion of the reviewer(s). Therefore, we have now included these data in the new version of the manuscript (see new Figure 5—figure supplement 3). Here, we show that BMDCs also display higher ROS levels in the absence of <italic>Txnrd1</italic>, and that catalase-treatment, although it inhibits ROS formation, cannot restore cytokine production. Therefore, it looks like both BMDCs and BMDMs require Txnrd1 to inhibit ROS and allow inflammasome formation; by contrast, the NF-κB phenotype is exclusively observed in BMDCs, as BMDMs express high levels of glutaredoxins which can compensate for the absence of the Trx1 system. It is additionally important to mention that the binding of NF-κB to the target DNA is not ROS dependent (as catalase, which blocks ROS production, does not restore cytokine production) but specifically requires the Trx1 protein (or Grx as a backup), for example by providing reducing power for the regulation of NF-κB redox state (e.g. disulfide bond formation). This is actually reminiscent of what we have previously observed in T cells, where the enzymatic activity of Trx1, but not its general antioxidant function, was needed to deliver electrons to a specific protein, namely ribonucleotide reductase for the synthesis of dNTPs.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>• It is not clear why nuclear NF-κB is unchanged (Figure 5B) but DNA binding is affected (Figure 5E) in the KO.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewers for raising this point and we are sorry for the lack of clarity. NF-κB induced inflammatory responses can be separated into at least three steps including (i) cytoplasmic NF-κB activation, (ii) nuclear translocation, and (iii) DNA binding followed by transcription of target genes, which are controlled by different biochemical mechanisms. We found reduced production of pro-inflammatory cytokines known to be controlled NF-κB in <italic>Txnrd1</italic>-deficient BMDCs. We showed that cytoplasmic NF-κB activation and nuclear translocation were unaffected indicating that DNA binding, which is differentially regulated, is impaired in the absence of <italic>Txnrd1</italic>. Indeed, in the first submitted version of the manuscript, we showed that DNA binding is impaired in <italic>Txnrd1</italic>-deficient BMDCs using a binding assay. In the revised version, as requested by the reviewers, we supported this finding by performing p65-CHIP analysis of NF-κB target genes.</p><p>What it actually remains to be answered in future studies would be why and how the p65 DNA binding is affected. In this regard, we believe that Trx1 controls and regulates the redox status of p65 (and possibly of other factors that participate in DNA binding). For instance, Trx1 may provide electrons to reduce disulfide bonds of p65, and this may promote the DNA binding activity of the transcription factor. By using mass spectrometry, one could better analyze and understand how exactly the Trx1 system regulates the redox state of p65.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) In the first part of the story, the authors conclude that reduced myeloid cell numbers in the absence of the antioxidant system(s) is due to defects in proliferation, but data to support this is lacking. The authors are advised to describe the data as defects in &quot;maintenance&quot; and &quot;homeostasis&quot;.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewers for pointing out this aspect that was not fully supported by the data in our manuscript. We have previously described the defect as a “proliferation defect” since this is what we have originally reported in the T cells (where the Trx1 system donates electrons for the synthesis of DNA building blocks during rapid proliferation; PMID: 29749372). Although we believe that a similar mechanism very likely also takes place in myeloid cells, we agree with the reviewers that the data in the current manuscript do not unambiguously prove it. Thus, we have now followed the reviewers’ suggestion and described the data in this manuscript as defects in “maintenance” and “homeostasis”.</p></body></sub-article></article>
