maturation and ovulation. In this study, we first examined the ovulation of <italic>Ciona intestinalis</italic> Type A by monitoring follicle rupture in vitro, identifying a novel mechanism of neuropeptidergic regulation of oocyte maturation and ovulation. <italic>Ciona</italic> vasopressin family peptide (CiVP) directly upregulated the phosphorylation of extracellular signal–regulated kinase (CiErk1/2) via its receptor. CiVP ultimately activated a maturation-promoting factor, leading to oocyte maturation via germinal vesicle breakdown. CiErk1/2 also induced expression of matrix metalloproteinase (CiMMP2/9/13) in the oocyte, resulting in collagen degradation in the outer follicular cell layer and liberation of fertile oocytes from the ovary. This is the first demonstration of essential pathways regulating oocyte maturation and ovulation in ascidians and will facilitate investigations of the evolutionary process of peptidergic regulation of oocyte maturation and ovulation throughout the phylum Chordata.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>ovulation</kwd><kwd>follicle</kwd><kwd>maturation</kwd><kwd>vasopressin</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>C. intestinalis</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001691</institution-id><institution>Japan Society for the Promotion of Science</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>JP16K07430</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Satake</surname><given-names>Honoo</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001691</institution-id><institution>Japan Society for the Promotion of Science</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>JP16K18581</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Matsubara</surname><given-names>Shin</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001691</institution-id><institution>Japan Society for the Promotion of Science</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>JP17J10624</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Matsubara</surname><given-names>Shin</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Oocyte maturation and ovulation in the sister group of vertebrates, <italic>Ciona intestinalis</italic> Type A, are triggered by Ci-VP, the <italic>Ciona</italic> homolog of a typical neruopeptide, vasopressin.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Oocyte maturation and ovulation are critical steps in the completion of female gametogenesis in the ovary and thus for subsequent fertilization and embryogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Lane et al., 2014</xref>). Meiosis in animal oocytes is arrested at prophase of the first division (ProI). Hormonal stimulation triggers the resumption of meiosis in most vertebrates and invertebrates, and oocytes undergo nuclear maturation upon the onset of nuclear disassembly (i.e., germinal vesicle breakdown [GVBD]). Concomitant with the progression of nuclear maturation, dynamic rearrangement of intracellular organelles promotes cytoplasmic maturation. Mature oocytes become fertilizable, and their meiosis is arrested again at a species-specific stage: metaphase of the first division (MetI, many invertebrates), metaphase of the second division (MetII, most vertebrates), or G1-phase (some echinoderms and coelenterates) until fertilization. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Richani and Gilchrist, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Das and Arur, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Nagahama and Yamashita, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Fan and Sun, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Kishimoto, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Von Stetina and Orr-Weaver, 2011</xref>). Mature oocytes are then ovulated via proteolytic degradation of the follicle walls (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Richards and Ascoli, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Takahashi et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Richards and Pangas, 2010</xref>). Some mutations in oocytes lead to infertility in the mature organism, whereas others, over a long period of time, may eventually lead to the emergence of novel species or subspecies. Therefore, the regulatory mechanisms underlying oocyte maturation and ovulation control not only the reproduction of the respective organisms but also evolutionary processes across the animal kingdom.</p><p>In vertebrates, oocyte maturation and ovulation are regulated by the hypothalamus-pituitary-gonadal axis (HPG axis); gonadotropins from the pituitary stimulate the maturation of follicles in response to hypothalamic peptide hormones, including gonadotropin-releasing hormone (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Richani and Gilchrist, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Das and Arur, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Nagahama and Yamashita, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Fan and Sun, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Kishimoto, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Von Stetina and Orr-Weaver, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Richards and Ascoli, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Takahashi et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Richards and Pangas, 2010</xref>). In contrast, neither a pituitary organ nor gonadotropins arose in most species of invertebrates, indicating the presence of HPG axis–independent regulation in these organisms. Some neuropeptides have been shown to induce oocyte maturation and ovulation (or spawning) in several species of invertebrates. The neuropeptide W/RPRPamide in jellyfish directly induces oocyte maturation and spawning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Takeda et al., 2018</xref>). A relaxin-like peptide stimulates the production of 1-methyladenosine, which directly induces oocyte maturation, followed by ovulation and spawning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Mita et al., 2009</xref>). Cubifurin (NGIWYamide) induces oocyte maturation, ovulation, and spawning in the sea cucumber (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kato et al., 2009</xref>). These findings demonstrate that various neuropeptides are responsible for triggering oocyte maturation and ovulation in invertebrates, and suggest that oocyte maturation and ovulation and their underlying molecular mechanisms are regulated in both a species-specific and evolutionarily conserved fashion.</p><p>Ascidians are invertebrates that belong to the Chordata superphylum as Urochordata, and thus, phylogenetically, they are the closest living relatives of vertebrates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Delsuc et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Denoeud et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Satoh et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Horie et al., 2018</xref>). As such, ascidians are considered crucial model organisms in research into the evolutionary processes underlying chordate reproductive systems. Our previous studies identified a variety of vertebrate prototypic neuropeptides from the neural complex of the cosmopolitan ascidian, <italic>Ciona intestinalis</italic> Type A (<italic>Ciona robusta</italic>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kawada et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Brunetti et al., 2015</xref>), and we revealed the full trajectory of visceral nerves to the ovary (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Osugi et al., 2017</xref>). Moreover, several cognate receptors were shown to be expressed in the ovary (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Kawada et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Satake et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Sekiguchi et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Tello et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Shiraishi et al., 2019</xref>), and some neuropeptides, such as <italic>Ciona</italic> tachykinin and neurotensin-like peptide 6, were found to participate in regulating pre-GVBD follicle growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Aoyama et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Aoyama et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kawada et al., 2011</xref>). These findings, considered in the context of the lack of a pituitary organ and gonadotropins, strongly suggest that neuropeptides also play vital roles in oocyte maturation and ovulation in <italic>Ciona</italic>.</p><p><italic>Ciona</italic> meiosis is arrested at ProI, resumes under stimulation by an as yet unidentified factor, and is arrested again at MetI after oocyte maturation and ovulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Tosti et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Von Stetina and Orr-Weaver, 2011</xref>).

In addition, the activities of MAP kinase (MAPK) and maturation promoting factor (MPF), which are prerequisite for oocyte maturation in vertebrates, have been investigated in <italic>Ciona</italic> post-fertilization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Russo et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Russo et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Russo et al., 2009</xref>). However, neither the endogenous factors nor the signaling pathways regulating GVBD and ovulation in <italic>Ciona</italic> have been identified. Furthermore, investigations of oocyte maturation and ovulation in <italic>Ciona</italic> are expected to provide crucial clues for understanding the evolution and diversification of chordate reproductive systems.</p><p>In this study, we documented for the first time the process of ovulation in <italic>Ciona</italic> and demonstrated that the essential molecular mechanisms underlying the onset of GVBD and ovulation are regulated by <italic>Ciona</italic> vasopressin family peptide, CiVP.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>In vitro evaluation of <italic>Ciona</italic> ovulation</title><p>In contrast to oocyte maturation, ovulation in <italic>Ciona</italic> has yet to be documented.

Notably, incubating <italic>Ciona</italic> ovaries in ASW for 16 hr resulted in the liberation of numerous follicles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Intriguingly, time-lapse imaging revealed that follicle liberation followed the rupture of the outer follicular cell layer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref> and <xref ref-type="video" rid="video1">Video 1</xref>), and we therefore defined this phenomenon as <italic>Ciona</italic> ovulation.

Hence, invertebrate reproductive processes are regulated by HPG axis–independent systems, but many details of the underlying molecular mechanisms of these systems remain to be elucidated. Over the past decade, some neuropeptides were found to play key roles in oocyte maturation and ovulation (or spawning) in a limited number of invertebrates, such as jellyfish (W/RPRPamide, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Takeda et al., 2018</xref>), starfish (relaxin-like peptide, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Mita et al., 2009</xref>), and sea cucumber (cubifrin: NGIWYamide, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kato et al., 2009</xref>).

Furthermore, the involvement of VP/OT family peptides in various reproduction-related functions has been documented. The earthworm VP/OT family peptide annetocin and nematode VP/OT family peptide nematocin induce egg-laying behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Fujino et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Oumi et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Satake et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Garrison et al., 2012</xref>). Vasotocin (VT), a non-mammalian vertebrate VP family peptide exhibited similar functions in amphibians (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Moore et al., 1992</xref>), and its involvement in spawning migration in fish and ovipositioning in birds was also suggested, although the underlying molecular mechanisms remain to be investigated. VT was also reported to be involved in oocyte maturation and ovulation in catfish (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Singh and Joy, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Joy and Chaube, 2015</xref>). However, VT-induced oocyte maturation and ovulation are mediated primarily via the VT receptor in follicular cells and following sexual steroidogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Singh and Joy, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Joy and Chaube, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Rawat et al., 2019</xref>). This is distinct from the present data indicating that CiVP directly acts on CiVPR expressed in oocytes to induce oocyte maturation and ovulation without steroidogenesis. This is also consistent with the complete absence of major steroidogenesis genes in the <italic>Ciona</italic> genome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Dehal et al., 2002</xref>). Collectively, these findings suggest that VT and CiVP participate in oocyte maturation and ovulation via distinct molecular mechanisms in catfish and <italic>Ciona</italic>, respectively. In other words, the biological role of VP family peptides in oocyte maturation and ovulation might have been acquired at least by common ancestors of Olfactores (vertebrates and urochordates) and conserved in both <italic>Ciona</italic> and fish, with diversification of the molecular mechanisms in species-specific evolutionary lineages. In mammals, the murine VP-receptor genes <italic>Avpr1a</italic> and <italic>1b</italic> and OT-receptor gene <italic>Oxtr</italic> are reportedly expressed in the ovary (MGI Direct Data Submission MGI:3625434, MGI:3625077, MGI:5895306, and SRS307248). However, no effects of deficiencies of these genes on oocyte maturation and ovulation in mice have been reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Koshimizu et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Takayanagi et al., 2005</xref>). Taken together, these results suggest that the biological roles of VPergic oocyte maturation and ovulation might have been lost or replaced by other factors in mammals. Consequently, elucidating the biological roles of VP/OT family peptides in the ovary and in the process of VPergic oocyte maturation and ovulation evolution awaits further investigations.</p><p>Oocyte maturation (GVBD) in vertebrates (meiotic resumption from ProI to MetII via GVBD) is regulated in follicles by sex steroids and subsequently by several signaling cascades, including the Mos-MAPK and MPF pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Richani and Gilchrist, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Das and Arur, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Nagahama and Yamashita, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Fan and Sun, 2004</xref>). In ascidians, MAPK and MPF activity function after fertilization, given that <italic>Ciona</italic> oocytes are re-arrested at MetI after GVBD and resume meiosis in response to fertilization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Russo et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Russo et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Russo et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Dumollard et al., 2011</xref>). However, the functional roles of MAPK and MPF at the onset of <italic>Ciona</italic> GVBD and the identity of their upstream regulator remain unclear. We demonstrated that CiErk1/2 is directly phosphorylated by CiVP in the oocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>) and that MEK inhibition prevents spontaneous GVBD of early stage III follicles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E and F</xref>), in contrast to a previous study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Lambert, 2008</xref>). This discrepancy is likely the result of the involvement of CiErk1/2 in GVBD of <italic>Ciona</italic> oocytes over a limited period; CiErk1/2 is triggered around early stage III; subsequent MEK inhibition during late stage III is no longer able to prevent spontaneous GVBD. Although CiErk1/2 is expressed both in oocytes and test cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>), de-folliculated <italic>Ciona</italic> oocytes are competent for GVBD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Silvestre et al., 2009</xref>), supporting the hypothesis that CiErk1/2 in oocytes (rather than in test cells) is important for <italic>Ciona</italic> GVBD, as reported in <italic>Xenopus</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Kosako et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Cross and Smythe, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Fan and Sun, 2004</xref>). Moreover, we verified that spontaneous GVBD of late stage III follicle is disrupted by inhibition of a major component of MPF, Cdc2, indicating that MPF activity is responsible for <italic>Ciona</italic> GVBD, as reported in vertebrates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Das and Arur, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Nagahama and Yamashita, 2008</xref>), starfish (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Kishimoto, 2018</xref>), fruit flies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Von Stetina et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Hong et al., 2003</xref>), and nematodes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Burrows et al., 2006</xref>). In addition, we demonstrated that CiVP-induced GVBD is completely blocked by MPF (Cdc2) inhibition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>), which is consistent with the observation that the triggering factors of oocyte maturation (e.g., maturation-inducing hormone) are highly variable among species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Takeda et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Kishimoto, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Nagahama and Yamashita, 2008</xref>). Collectively, the current results provide evidence that CiVP triggers <italic>Ciona</italic> nuclear maturation of oocytes via the MEK/ERK-MPF pathway, which appears to be highly conserved among some vertebrates. Additionally, in vitro fertilization experiments using follicles in which maturation was induced by CiVP showed incomplete development of some follicles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>), suggesting the involvement of other factors in nuclear or cytoplasmic maturation of oocytes. However, the present study provides new evidence identifying CiVP as the only VP/OT family peptide that plays a crucial role in initiating GVBD via the MEK/ERK-MPF pathway in a chordate. Thus, how VP was replaced by other factors in MEK/ERK-MPF–directed GVBD in vertebrates is of particular interest.</p><p>Neither ovulation itself nor its mechanism have been documented in <italic>Ciona</italic>. We verified that the VPergic ovulation process involves CiVP-mediated upregulation of CiMMP2/9/13 via CiErk1/2 activation, in turn leading to the degradation of collagens followed by the release of oocytes from the ovary (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figures 3</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">4A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">5</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">6</xref>). This is in good agreement with the results of previous studies of medaka demonstrating that MMP-2 and MMP-15 are responsible for the respective degradation of type IV and type I collagens and ovulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Ogiwara et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Takahashi et al., 2018</xref>), although medaka MMP-15 is induced by sex steroids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Ogiwara and Takahashi, 2017</xref>) and no role for medaka ERK in ovulation has been demonstrated. In contrast, conditional ERK1/2-deficient mice lack ovulated oocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Fan et al., 2009</xref>), and critical proteases have yet to be identified. Consequently, the present study provides the first demonstration of the biological roles of VP family peptides in regulating ovulation and inducing MMP via ERK in chordates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1</xref>).</p><p>Considered along with the aforementioned involvement of MMPs in ovulation in vertebrates, the present data regarding the MEK/ERK-MMP regulatory pathway in <italic>Ciona</italic> ovulation suggest the following three-step evolutionary process: i) common chordate ancestors might have adopted the MEK/ERK-MMP pathway, which is also conserved in <italic>Ciona</italic> ovulation; ii) MEK/ERK regulation in fish might have been lost or compensated by other regulators, given that an MEK/ERK-directed ovulatory mechanism has been demonstrated in mammals; and iii) the roles of various proteases, including MMPs, in vertebrate ovulatory regulation have diversified during the evolutionary process (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1i-iii</xref>). Although the evolutionary conservation and detailed mechanism of ovulatory regulation via the MEK/ERK-MMP pathway in chordates await further investigation, the results of the present study suggest that VP/OT family peptide–directed regulation of oocyte maturation and ovulation might have originated in ancestral chordates and that other regulators, including sex steroids, prostaglandins, and gonadotropins, diverged along with the evolution of vertebrates.</p><p>In conclusion, the present study provides evidence that CiVP triggers oocyte maturation and ovulation via MEK/ERK signaling followed by MPF- and CiMMP2/9/13-directed collagen degradation, respectively, in the closest sister group of vertebrates. These data suggest that VP/OT family peptides have played key roles in the evolution of regulatory mechanisms underlying oocyte maturation and ovulation in chordates.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th>Reagent type <break/>(species) or resource</th><th>Designation</th><th>Source or reference</th><th>Identifiers</th><th>Additional <break/>information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Gene (<italic>Ciona intestinalis</italic> type A)</td><td><italic>CiVp</italic></td><td><italic>Ciona</italic> Ghost Database (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://ghost.zool.kyoto-u.ac.jp/cgi-bin/gb2/gbrowse/kh/">http://ghost.zool.kyoto-u.ac.jp/cgi-bin/gb2/gbrowse/kh/</ext-link>)</td><td>KH.C6.11.</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Gene (<italic>Ciona intestinalis</italic> type A)</td><td><italic>CiVpr</italic></td><td><italic>Ciona</italic> Ghost Database (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://ghost.zool.kyoto-u.ac.jp/cgi-bin/gb2/gbrowse/kh/">http://ghost.zool.kyoto-u.ac.jp/cgi-bin/gb2/gbrowse/kh/</ext-link>)</td><td>KH.C9.885.</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Gene (<italic>Ciona intestinalis</italic> type A)</td><td><italic>CiErk1/2</italic></td><td><italic>Ciona</italic> Ghost Database (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://ghost.zool.kyoto-u.ac.jp/cgi-bin/gb2/gbrowse/kh/">http://ghost.zool.kyoto-u.ac.jp/cgi-bin/gb2/gbrowse/kh/</ext-link>)</td><td>KH.L153.20.</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Gene (<italic>Ciona intestinalis</italic> type A)</td><td><italic>CiCcnb</italic></td><td><italic>Ciona</italic> Ghost Database (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://ghost.zool.kyoto-u.ac.jp/cgi-bin/gb2/gbrowse/kh/">http://ghost.zool.kyoto-u.ac.jp/cgi-bin/gb2/gbrowse/kh/</ext-link>)</td><td>KH.C4.213.</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Gene (<italic>Ciona intestinalis</italic> type A)</td><td><italic>CiCdk1</italic></td><td><italic>Ciona</italic> Ghost Database (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://ghost.zool.kyoto-u.ac.jp/cgi-bin/gb2/gbrowse/kh/">http://ghost.zool.kyoto-u.ac.jp/cgi-bin/gb2/gbrowse/kh/</ext-link>)</td><td>KH.C12.372.</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Gene (<italic>Ciona intestinalis</italic> type A)</td><td><italic>CiMmp2/9/13</italic></td><td><italic>Ciona</italic> Ghost Database (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://ghost.zool.kyoto-u.ac.jp/cgi-bin/gb2/gbrowse/kh/">http://ghost.zool.kyoto-u.ac.jp/cgi-bin/gb2/gbrowse/kh/</ext-link>)</td><td>KH.L76.4.</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Recombinant DNA reagent</td><td>pET21a-CiMMP2/9/13 (plasmid)</td><td>This paper</td><td/><td>Expression vector of Ci-MMP2/9/13</td></tr><tr><td>Strain, strain background (<italic>Escherichia coli</italic>)</td><td>Rossetta 2 (DE3)</td><td>Novagen</td><td>Cat.#:71400–3</td><td>Competent cells for rCi-MMP2/9/13 expression</td></tr><tr><td>Antibody</td><td>anti-ERK <break/>(rabbit polyclonal)</td><td>Cell Signaling Technology</td><td>Cat.#:9102S;

Mature oocytes in the ovary are extruded into the ovarian tube (ovulated) and stored in the oviduct until spawning (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A and B</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Sugino et al., 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Kawamura et al., 2011</xref>).

Thousands of follicles were collected from each sieve after washing with an excess amount of ASW. Two independent sets of follicles were used for RNA-seq, and three additional sets were used for qRT-PCR. Immature/pre-ovulatory follicles were further isolated under a stereomicroscope (Discovery V8, Carl Zeiss Microscopy, Tokyo, Japan) and divided into three gropes (late stage II, early stage III, and late stage III) based on size, and GVBD and ovulation rates were determined after a 24 hr incubation. Approximately 20–30 follicles of late stage II, early stage III, or late stage III were randomly allocated and incubated with various chemicals and/or CiVP, and GVBD and ovulation rates were determined after a 24 hr incubation. Synthetic CiVP peptide was prepared as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Kawada et al., 2008</xref>) and used at a final concentration of 5 μM, given that lower concentrations of other peptides are reportedly ineffective in <italic>Ciona</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Kamiya et al., 2014</xref>).

After washing 3 times with 1 ml of wash buffer (20 mM HEPES, 5 mM EGTA, 15 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 1 mM DTT, 1 × Complete protease inhibitor cocktail, 1 × PhosSTOP phosphatase inhibitor cocktail, and 0.2% Tween 20 [pH 7.5]), the enzymatic activity of CiCdk1 was measured using a MESACUP Cdc2/Cdk1 Kinase Assay kit (MBL, Nagoya, Japan) according to the manufacturer’s instructions, with the exception that the kinase reaction was performed using sepharose with and without 1 μM Ro-3306 at 30°C for 45 min.</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>Preparation of recombinant CiMMP2/9/13 and antibody generation</title><p>The cDNA fragment corresponding to the active form of CiMMP2/9/13 (KH.L76.4, amino acid sequence of residues 212–792) was amplified using cDNA from the ovary, Prime Star HS DNA polymerase (Takara, Shiga, Japan), and the primer pair <named-content content-type="sequence">5’-ACAAGAGGTCCATCGTTCGG-3’</named-content> and <named-content content-type="sequence">5’-GTCGTAGTTGTCAGTGGTAG-3’</named-content>. The DNA fragment was cloned into the pCR-Blunt II-TOPO vector (Thermo). DNA sequencing revealed that the insert contained a non-synonymous SNP resulting in the substitution of W with G at residue 252, which was confirmed by two independent RT-PCR analyses. In addition, 42 amino acids were inserted at residue 569: 38 amino acids were aligned with residues 569–606 of the sequence in the NCBI database (XP_009861837.1), with repetitive extension of 4 amino acids (GTGT), indicating successful cloning of the recombinant protein without any frameshifts. The <italic>Eco</italic>RI/<italic>Hin</italic>dIII fragment was inserted into the identical sites of the pET21a expression vector (Novagen, Madison, WI). Expression of rCiMMP2/9/13 was induced using the Rossetta 2 (DE3) expression system (Novagen). <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> cells were sonicated in 100 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), and soluble proteins were removed by centrifugation. The precipitate was suspended in buffer composed of 50 mM NaH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>, 300 mM NaCl, and 6 M urea and solubilized by sonication. rCiMMP2/9/13 was purified with a vector-derived His-tag at the C-terminus using Ni-NTA agarose (QIAGEN, Hilden, Germany). Purified rCiMMP2/9/13 was concentrated in PBS by ultrafiltration using an Amicon Ultra-centrifugal filter (Merck, Tokyo, Japan). Purified rCiMMP2/9/13 was then injected into rabbits for immunization (Hokudo Co., Ltd., Hokkaido, Japan). The specificity of the resultant antiserum against CiMMP2/9/13 was confirmed by Western blotting (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>Immunohistochemistry</title><p><italic>Ciona</italic> ovaries were fixed in Bouin’s solution, embedded in SCEM, and sectioned at 10 μm. The resulting slides were dried at 37°C for 1 hr and washed with PBS. The samples were then boiled in 10 mM citrate buffer (pH 6.0) for 5 min using a microwave oven and cooled for 30 min at room temperature. Endogenous peroxidase activity was quenched by incubating the samples with 0.3% hydrogen peroxide for 10 min. The samples were then sequentially blocked for 30 min each with Blocking One (Nacalai Tesque) and normal horse serum of the R.T.U. VECTASTAIN Universal Elite ABC kit (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA). Anti–MMP-2/9/13 antiserum was used as the primary antibody. Immunoreactivity was assessed using an ABC kit according to the manufacturer’s instructions.</p></sec><sec id="s4-10"><title>In vitro collagenase activity assay</title><p>A total of 0.5 μg of rMMP-2/913 was incubated with 5 μg of DQ collagen type I or type IV in 200 μl of reaction buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl, 150 mM NaCl, 5 mM CaCl2) in the presence or absence of 1 μM MMP-2/MMP-9 inhibitor II at 20°C. After 48 hr of incubation, the fluorescence was measured using a FlexStation II (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA) with the following settings: Ex, 485 nm; Em, 538 nm; cut-off, 495 nm.</p></sec><sec id="s4-11"><title>In situ zymography</title><p>Isolated late stage III follicles were incubated with 50 μg/ml of DQ collagen type I (Thermo, D12060) or DQ collagen type IV (Thermo, D12052) in ASW at 20°C for 3 hr.

First they described how oocyte maturation and ovulation proceed in a macroscopic view. Then they revealed that vasopressin, MAPK pathway, and MMP were involved in this control at the molecular level. Their success will probably be based on development of a simple but effective method to fractionate follicles, because it enabled them to do molecular biological assays. Oocyte maturation and ovulation are fundamental biological processes for animals. However, the regulatory mechanism may be very different between vertebrates and other animals. This raises a question how the vertebrate system emerged during evolution. To answer this question, the ascidian system is promising, as they indeed demonstrated. This is because ascidians are the closest invertebrate relative of vertebrates. In addition, the system they revealed in the present study may provide leads for studies in vertebrate systems, because it is possible that a similar mechanism also works in vertebrates. The experimental results shown in this manuscript was clear and sufficient for supporting their conclusions.

They make a number of important technical advances, including observing ovulation in ascidians, fractionating stages of maturing oocytes by size, and localizing collagenase activity in situ.</p><p>While the results are solid, and they make considerable progress elucidating the mechanisms of ovulation and maturation in this species, the main conclusions do not make clear, broad implications, and thus read like an incremental advance. They will likely be of limited interest for most readers of <italic>eLife</italic>.</p><p>The impact of the work could be enhanced by framing the results in a more general way, and making the evolutionary implications more explicit. The origin of the HPG axis in vertebrates is an important vertebrate innovation. In principle, the results presented here could add to our understanding of its origin, by helping to establish the likely ancestral character state at the base of the vertebrates. From this perspective, it would help if they were clearer about how their findings relate to what has been found in other invertebrates. Do other invertebrates have VP/OT-type peptides? Are the neuropeptides that have been implicated in oocyte maturation in other invertebrates similar in any way to peptide and receptor implicated here? It seems like more can be said about what their work tells us about metazoan oocyte maturation in general.</p><p>Similarly, they need to be clearer about how their results relate to what is known in vertebrates. It is very interesting that fish use a VP-related gene for oocyte maturation and ovulation, and this suggests a hypothesis about how their data relates to vertebrates, as they point out. However, this argument could be made more directly. They point out that mouse VP receptor genes are expressed in the ovary, but they do not state whether existing functional studies of VP in mouse would have revealed a role in this organ; it would help to add this if it is true and if they are implying that such a role might exist.</p><p>As an aside, is the fish vasotocin peptide similarly related to vasopressin and oxytocin in mammals? Might it represent the ancestral gene these two peptides in mammals? Again, clarification of the distribution of vasopressin and oxytocin peptides across animals might help make the story clearer.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.49062.035</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p>Reviewer #1:</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>[…] I found some major points to be revised:</p><p>Abstract: reports too many literature information but poor description of the present data.

First, we address the reviewer’s question. VP/OT family peptides are conserved in vertebrates and many invertebrates, including ascidians, amphioxus, echinoderms, annelids, molluscs, and nematodes. Moreover, some insects (e.g., red beetles) possess a VP/OT family peptide, whereas other insects (e.g., fruit flies) lack such peptides (Banerjee et al., 2017; Stoop, 2012; Donaldoson and Young, 2008). These peptides, with some exceptions, completely share Cys<sup>1</sup>, Asn<sup>5</sup>, Cys<sup>6</sup>, Pro<sup>7</sup>, and Gly<sup>9</sup>. In mammals, VP and OT are classified based on the amino acid residue present at position 8; the VP family peptides contain a basic amino acid, and the OT family peptides contain a neutral amino acid at this position. The respective homologs are conserved in non-mammalian vertebrates. Non-mammalian vertebrate VP homologs are designated as vasotocin (VT). Moreover, non-mammalian tetrapod and fish OT homologs are designated mesotocin (MT) and isotocin (IT), respectively. Notably, only VT is present in the lowest vertebrate agnathans. Most invertebrates also possess a single VP/OT family peptide. In addition, some invertebrate VP/OT family peptides harbor a basic amino acid, whereas others harbor a non-basic amino acid. On the other hand, the structural organization is conserved in all precursors of VP/OT family peptides: a signal peptide region, a single VP/OT family peptide sequence, and a neurophysin domain that features multiple cysteines (Banerjee et al., 2017; Stoop, 2012; Donaldson and Young, 2008). Collectively, VP/OT family peptides are thought to have emerged in an ancestral stem group of vertebrates and invertebrates ~600 million years ago (Banerjee et al., 2017; Stoop, 2012; Donaldoson and Young, 2008), leading to the occurrence of the VP and OT family during the evolution of gnathostomates via gene duplication, while classification of invertebrate VP/OT family peptides into the VP or OT family on the basis of the residue at position 8 is impossible (Banerjee et al., 2017; Stoop, 2012; Donaldson and Young, 2008).</p><p>Next, we address the question regarding the biological roles of VP/OT family peptides and the regulation of oocyte maturation and ovulation by peptides. To date, multiple biological functions of these peptides have been reported in various organisms. However, the present paper shows for the first time that an OT/VP family peptide regulates oocyte maturation and ovulation in an organism, as described in the original manuscript. Instead, a few species-specific peptides have been shown to be responsible for oocyte maturation and ovulation in other invertebrates such as jellyfish, starfish, and sea cucumber, and thus, we mentioned them in the Introduction and Discussion sections of the revised manuscript, indicating that inducible factors and the molecular mechanisms underlying oocyte maturation and ovulation vary among invertebrate species. Additionally, in jellyfish, direct induction of oocytes by MIH (Takeda et al., 2018) is similar to the direct activity of CiVP on oocytes rather than the two-step induction by starfish relaxin-like peptide via 1-methyladenosine (a direct inducer of oocyte maturation and ovulation in starfish) produced in and secreted from follicular cells (Mita et al., 2009). These points have also been included in the revised manuscript, as shown below:</p><p>In the Introduction section:</p><p>“The neuropeptide W/RPRPamide in jellyfish directly induces oocyte maturation and spawning (Takeda et al., 2018). […] These findings demonstrate that various neuropeptides are responsible for triggering oocyte maturation and ovulation in invertebrates, and suggest that oocyte maturation and ovulation and their underlying molecular mechanisms are regulated in both a species-specific and evolutionarily conserved fashion.”</p><p>In the Discussion section:</p><p>“The vertebrate OT and VP families are thought to have emerged from a common ancestral gene via gene duplication during the evolution of gnathostomates, and invertebrates and jawless vertebrates have been shown to possess a single VP/OT family peptide (Banerjee et al., 2017; Stoop, 2012; Donaldoson and Young, 2008). […] VT was also reported to be involved in oocyte maturation and ovulation in catfish (Singh and Joy, 2011; Joy and Chaube, 2015).”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Similarly, they need to be clearer about how their results relate to what is known in vertebrates. It is very interesting that fish use a VP-related gene for oocyte maturation and ovulation, and this suggests a hypothesis about how their data relates to vertebrates, as they point out. However, this argument could be made more directly. They point out that mouse VP receptor genes are expressed in the ovary, but they do not state whether existing functional studies of VP in mouse would have revealed a role in this organ; it would help to add this if it is true and if they are implying that such a role might exist.</p></disp-quote><p>As described in the original manuscript, VT, the fish VP homolog, was shown to be involved in oocyte maturation and ovulation. This is the only previous study demonstrating the activity of VP/OT family peptides in induction of oocyte maturation and ovulation. However, as stated in the original version as well, we have verified that the regulation of oocyte maturation and ovulation via CiVP is distinct from that mediated by catfish VT. In addition, animals genetically deficient in VPR and OTR were generated, but no phenotypic defects in oocyte maturation and ovulation have been reported. Considering these previous findings and the present data, we rephrased the corresponding text in the Discussion section, as shown below:</p><p>“However, VT-induced oocyte maturation and ovulation are mediated primarily via the VT receptor in follicular cells and following sexual steroidogenesis (Singh and Joy, 2011; Joy and Chaube, 2015; Rewat et al., 2018). […] Consequently, elucidating the biological roles of VP/OT family peptides in the ovary and in the process of VPergic oocyte maturation and ovulation evolution awaits further investigations.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>As an aside, is the fish vasotocin peptide similarly related to vasopressin and oxytocin in mammals? Might it represent the ancestral gene these two peptides in mammals? Again, clarification of the distribution of vasopressin and oxytocin peptides across animals might help make the story clearer.</p></disp-quote><p>As described in the original manuscript, VT, the fish VP homolog, was shown to be involved in oocyte maturation and ovulation.
