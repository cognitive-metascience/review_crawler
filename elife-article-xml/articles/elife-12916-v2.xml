The midbrain and cerebral association cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Stein and Stanford, 2008</xref>), and the cerebellum receive and process sensory signals of various modalities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Snider and Stowell, 1944</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Azizi and Woodward, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Gao et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Sobel et al., 1998</xref>). Although it is well known that each granule cell in the mammalian cerebellum receives excitatory synaptic inputs from on average four mossy fibers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Eccles et al., 1967</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Jakab and Hamori, 1988</xref>), it is important to determine whether multisensory integration takes place already on the level of the granule cells, which form the input layer, or only in the downstream neurons, including Purkinje cells. A recent study using projection mapping has shown that some granule cells receive mossy fibers from two areas in the brainstem (the basilar pontine nucleus and the external cuneate nucleus), providing morphological evidence of multimodal convergence in single granule cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Huang et al., 2013</xref>; see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Chabrol et al., 2015</xref>). However, in vivo single cerebellar granule cells in cats have been shown to only respond to stimulation of a single modality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Jörntell and Ekerot, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Spanne and Jörntell, 2015</xref>). Therefore, to determine whether functional multimodal convergence is common we made whole-cell patch-clamp recordings in vivo from single granule cells and directly tested responsiveness to sensory stimulation of different modalities.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Granule cell responses to different sensory modalities</title><p>We made patch-clamp recordings from single cerebellar granule cells of rats in vivo to examine their responses to auditory, visual and somatosensory stimulation. We selected crus I and II and the dorsal paraflocculus of the cerebellum because previous studies suggested that these areas might receive multisensory inputs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Azizi and Woodward, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Huang et al., 2013</xref>). The high quality of voltage clamp recordings in granule cells in vivo enabled detection of individual sensory-evoked EPSCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Chadderton et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Rancz et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Arenz et al., 2008</xref>), thus providing exquisite sensitivity for detection of responses to a sensory stimulus. 45% of granule cells (60/133 cells) in crus I and II and 10% of those (3/30 cells) in the dorsal paraflocculus responded to somatosensory stimulation with a burst of EPSCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A–E</xref> left column and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F–G</xref>), as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Chadderton et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Rancz et al., 2007</xref>). In contrast, auditory stimulation (white noise, 81–91 dB SPL, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A–E</xref> middle column) evoked EPSCs in 25% of granule cells in crus I and II (33/133 cells) and 10% (3/30 cells) of granule cells in the dorsal paraflocculus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F–G</xref>). When different sound levels were systematically tested, the number of evoked EPSC events increased with increasing sound levels (from 75 dB to 94 dB), while the mean amplitude of evoked EPSCs remained constant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). Finally, visual stimulation (binocular LED flash; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A–E</xref> right column) evoked EPSCs in 87% of granule cells (26/30 cells) in the dorsal paraflocculus, while visual responses in crus I and II were rare (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F–G</xref>). When visual stimulation was delivered monocularly, ipsilateral stimulation evoked the predominant response (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>).

This conjecture has been supported by the recent anatomical (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Huang et al., 2013</xref>) and in vitro electrophysiological (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Chabrol et al., 2015</xref>) demonstration that single granule cells can receive mossy fibers of different origins (see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">[Sawtell, 2010</xref>]). Our findings in vivo provide a direct functional demonstration that single granule cells can receive inputs from up to three separate sensory modalities. Furthermore, we show that combined stimulation of two sensory modalities can produce enhanced spike output from granule cells, indicating that the result of multisensory integration can be transmitted to downstream neurons in the cerebellar network.</p><p>While the present study strongly supports the conclusions of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Huang et al. (2013)</xref> regarding multimodal integration in single cerebellar granule cells, we could not directly prove the integration of sensory and motor signals in granule cells as proposed by their study, because we could test only integration of sensory modalities in anesthetized animals. Integration of sensory and motor inputs should to be tested in future studies using recordings from granule cells in awake behaving animals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Powell et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>When combining stimulation of two sensory modalities, we observed significant sublinear summation of synaptic currents in a subset of granule cells. Under the excellent voltage-clamp conditions that exist in granule cells, inputs from different synapses are expected to summate linearly. Thus, the observed sublinear summation of synaptic currents is likely to be due to inhibitory interactions between the two sensory pathways upstream from the granule cell (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). Such interactions could occur at any point in upstream sensory pathways, including the brainstem, the thalamus and the cerebral cortex, particularly given that the relatively long latency (&gt; 10 ms) of sensory responses in our recordings suggests that these sensory signals are mediated via the corticocerebellar pathway rather than direct projections from primary sensory neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Morissette and Bower, 1996</xref>). Further studies are required to understand the mechanism and significance of such inhibitory interactions.</p><p>It should also be noted that our findings do not directly contradict the absence of multimodal integration observed in granule cells in decerebrate animals in which the corticocerebellar pathway is not preserved (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Jörntell and Ekerot, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Spanne and Jörntell, 2015</xref>). It is likely that granule cells represent a diverse population with respect to functional multisensory input (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>), with some granule cells appearing to be unimodal, some with multisensory input delivered by separate mossy fibers, and some with multisensory input delivered by a single mossy fiber.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Functional implications</title><p>The convergence of functionally distinct sensory signals in single granule cells at the input layer of the cerebellar cortex, predicted by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Huang et al. (2013)</xref> and demonstrated directly here, is likely to be a crucial feature of cerebellar signal processing. Indeed, influential theories of cerebellar computation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Marr, 1969</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Albus, 1971</xref>) have proposed that granule cells are not merely relaying signals but “recoding” multiple types of incoming signals. Our present study provides important in vivo functional evidence supporting this “recoding” hypothesis in the mammalian cerebellum. Moreover, it was hypothesized (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Albus, 1971</xref>) that such “recoding” would expand the representation of population patterns because granule cells outnumber mossy fibers by a factor of 100 (due to the extensive branching of mossy fibers). Our observation that the linearity of summation (both in synaptic inputs and in spike outputs) varies across cells may reflect the diversity of coding patterns required for the computational role of the granule cell in expansion recoding. In future studies, it will be important to reveal how synaptic plasticity at the mossy fiber-granule cell synapse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Roggeri et al., 2008</xref>) may affect the representation of multiple sensory inputs at the level of a single granule cell.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><p>All experiments were carried out in accordance with UK Home Office regulations and the guidelines of the Animal Experiment Committee of Jikei University. Lister-hooded rats (19<bold>–</bold>24 days old) were anaesthetized with a ketamine (60 mg/kg) and xylazine (4.5 mg/kg) mixture. Rats were freely breathing during surgery and recording. A peripheral anticholinergic drug, glycopyrrolate bromide (0.02 mg/kg S.C.) was administered in most of the experiments. In some early experiments, atropine (0.06 mg/kg) was used instead of glycopyrrolate. A head-post was glued onto the skull and a small craniotomy was made over the cerebellar region to be targeted. After removal of the dura, saline was used to prevent drying of the exposed brain surface.</p><p>Whole cell voltage-clamp (V-C) and current-clamp (I-C) recordings were made from granule cells in crus I and II and paraflocculus of the cerebellar cortex, using a Multiclamp 700B amplifier (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA). The internal solution contained: K-methanesulphonate 133 mM, KCl 7 mM, HEPES 10 mM, Mg-ATP 2 mM, Na<sub>2</sub>ATP 2 mM, Na<sub>2</sub>GTP 0.5 mM, EGTA 0.05 mM and biocytin 0.5%, pH 7.2, giving an estimated chloride reversal potential (E<sub>Cl</sub>) of -69 mV. This allows excitatory synaptic currents to be observed in isolation by voltage clamping at −70 mV. Data were low-pass filtered at 6 kHz and acquired at 50 kHz using a Digidata interface and pClamp software (Molecular Devices). Offline box smoothing (up to 11 points) was applied for noise reduction.</p><p>The animal was placed in a sound-attenuating light-proof box during the recording. Somatosensory stimulation was delivered using an air-puff (50 ms, 20<bold>–</bold>50 psi at source) timed by a Picospritzer and aimed at the ipsilateral whiskers, perioral skin or eye regions. Audible noise caused by the airpuff apparatus was carefully minimized and did not evoke cerebellar responses by itself. Auditory stimulation was delivered with a calibrated speaker driven by an RP2.1 processor and RPdvs software (Tucker-Davis Technologies, Alachua, FL). Gaussian white noise (up to 20 kHz) was presented for 350 ms with linear ramp rise and fall (5 ms). Visual stimulation was presented using two white LEDs (approximate intensity 200 mcd, one for each eye) each placed at 10 mm from the left or right eye. Each LED was light-shielded with a black cylinder, which also surrounds the eye, in order to deliver monocular stimulation. These LEDs diffusely illuminate a wide visual field because they are out of focus for the rat’s vision. In a subset of visual experiments, a computer screen placed at 12 cm from the animal head was used to deliver a wide-field visual presentation (from 10° contralateral to 60° ipsilateral) of full screen flickering from black to white (10 frames/s).</p><p>The detection of EPSCs and action potentials was performed using a custom threshold-based algorithm programmed in Igor Pro (TaroTools: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://sites.google.com/site/tarotoolsregister/">https://sites.google.com/site/tarotoolsregister/</ext-link>). The event number evoked by stimulation was counted (baseline-subtracted) in a time window adjusted for each cell to include all evoked events. Sensory responses were defined as positive when the post-stimulus histogram exceeded three times the standard deviation of the baseline. The synaptic charge was measured as the integral of the averaged current trace (baseline-subtracted and sign-reversed). Sensory response latency was defined as the time from the stimulus onset to the first EPSC event. In the analysis for <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>, a granule cell that had an extremely large time difference (109 ms) between two unimodal responses compared to other cases (&lt;35 ms) was excluded. Data are represented as mean ± s.e.m unless otherwise noted. Statistical significance was tested using the unpaired Student’s t-test unless otherwise noted.</p></sec><sec id="s5"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We are grateful to Charlotte Arlt, Beverley Clark, Dimitar Kostadinov, Arnd Roth, Greg Stuart and Christian Wilms for helpful discussions and for comments on the manuscript.

Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by Eve Marder as the Senior Editor and Reviewing Editor.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>As you know, we usually provide a summary of the needed revisions, but instead I am providing you with the entire set of reviewer comments. The revisions needed are exclusively editorial, and many of them relatively minor, but it seems that the context provided by these full reviews will help you understand what is necessary for you to directly address.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic></p><p>It has long been thought that cerebellar granule cells perform multimodal integration and that such integration represents an important step in cerebellar processing, however whether or not granule cells actually perform such integration has been debated until recently. An elegant anatomical study published in e<italic>Life</italic> provided clear evidence that individual granule cells in some cerebellar regions integrate mossy fiber input from different sources. A recent study (Chabrol <underline>et al.</underline>) provides clear evidence for multimodal integration in cerebellar granule cells using both anatomy and in vitro electrophysiology. Multimodal integration has also been shown in vivo in granule cells in a cerebellum-like structure in electric fish. The present study by Ishikawa <underline>et al.</underline> provides further support for multimodal integration in cerebellar granule cells using in vivo electrophysiological recordings.</p><p>The central finding is that a subset of granule cells receive input about different sensory modalities and that in some cases these are conveyed by different mossy fibers (as indicated by distinct EPSC waveforms). This is a strong result with clear relevance to the field and provides in vivo physiological support for the results of Huang et al. (albeit in relation to different sets of inputs).</p><p>The authors also make claims regarding the important functional question of how multimodal convergence affects spiking output and about the different possible functional connectivity patterns in granule cells (unimodal, multimodal input conveyed by a single anatomical input etc). These claims are less well supported. The analysis of spiking output involves only four neurons amongst which half were suppressed and the other half enhanced by multimodal stimulation.</p><p>Discussion: …&quot;Importantly, we show that granule cells represent a diverse population with respect to functional multisensory input, with some granule cells appearing to be unimodal, some with multisensory input delivered by separate mossy fibers, and some with multisensory input delivered by a single mossy fiber. These different anatomical and functional arrangements are illustrated schematically in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>.&quot; I am not convinced that the authors have provided strong support for these claims. Some granule cells may be unimodal but the authors tested only a tiny fraction of the possible stimuli that could engage granule cells, so the appearance of unimodality does not count for much in my opinion. In the Results the authors say that for cases in which EPSCs don't differ significantly &quot;it is not possible to determine if multimodal input arises from a single mossy fiber or from two mossy fibers that have indistinguishable characteristics.&quot; If this is true what is the support for the claim that some granule cells receive multisensory input delivered by a single mossy fiber? The statements made here need to be carefully qualified.</p><p>While the present manuscript is clearly relevant to the Huang et al. paper, the relationship between the two including the similarities/differences and advantages/limitations of both approaches could be made more explicit. This seems to warrant a separate paragraph in Discussion. For example Huang et al. looked at integration of cuneate and pontine (sensory and motor inputs) while the present paper looks at convergence of various sensory inputs.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic> In this manuscript, the authors accomplish the challenging task of making in vivo whole cell patch clamp recordings from cerebellar granule neurons in anesthetized rat. By doing so, they demonstrate conclusively that a subset of granule neurons can respond to two or more types of sensory stimulation (most frequently, auditory and somatosensory; 20% in the paraflocculus and14% in crus I &amp; II). While this multisensory sensitivity is predicted from the anatomy, conflicting in vitro electrophysiological data make it important to demonstrate physiologically in an in vivo preparation. In fact, the result that the majority of cells were sensitive to just one modality (at least with the stimulus parameters tested) yet a significant minority were multisensory goes a long way toward resolving the discrepancy in the literature, although the authors (surprisingly?) don't emphasize this aspect of the work. The authors go on to show that in these multimodal cells, the EPSCs evoked by the two sensory stimuli applied together sum slightly sublinearly in voltage clamp, and evidence and reasoning are presented to suggest that this is indicative of upstream interactions in the two sensory pathways. The authors also demonstrate in current clamp that the sublinear EPSC summation can result in either more or fewer spikes than elicited by stimulation through a single modality, which is a useful additional piece of information, since it shows that multiple factors determine the nature of spike integration. The data are of high quality, and the manuscript is for the most part clearly written. It is hard not to wish for more manipulations, but given the technical difficulty of the recordings, it is not surprising that the work stops where it does. The manuscript seems well suited to <italic>eLife</italic>'s description of a Research Advance, since the paper by Hantman and colleagues that precedes this study was anatomical, and the present work offers a (much needed) physiological confirmation. All my comments are stylistic.</p><p>1) Abstract: &quot;These findings provide functional evidence for convergence of multimodal signals onto single granule cells.&quot; That is true but somehow this seems to go just beyond &quot;providing evidence&quot; for multimodal signals. The multimodal signals are actually measured.</p><p>2) Introduction, &quot;Therefore, determining the extent to which multimodal convergence is functionally relevant in vivo requires direct recordings from single granule cells using sensory stimulation of different modalities.&quot; This sentence is likewise a bit oblique and off the point, as there is nothing about functional relevance here. Isn't the question that whether granule cells in the intact, functioning brain respond to multimodal inputs can only be assessed with direct in vivo measurements in the species of interest?</p><p>3) Please indicate species at the beginning of Results.</p><p>4) Suggestion if space permits: please give a hint in the results of why the sublinear summation might be interesting. On first reading, it seemed that non-linear summation of synaptic inputs would be expected, unless the idea was that the different modalities on the different dendrites would necessarily be so segregated that they would have to sum linearly. The Discussion cleared this up, but a little more extensive orienting of the reader earlier would be helpful.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic> The manuscript describes powerful and straightforward measurements indicating that single cerebellar granule neurons receive multimodal sensory inputs; it also shows that such multimodal inputs are summed in a simple manner to generate spike output. These are striking results given that these neurons receive input from 3-5 mossy fiber presynaptic terminals. They are also important because they provide direct evidence for a hypothesized integrative role for granule cells in sensorimotor processing.</p><p>In general the paper is clearly written and reports interesting findings that should be of interest to a general audience of neuroscientists. I have no substantive concerns and recommend that the paper be accepted with minimal revisions.</p><p>Minor comment: The last sentence of the Introduction seems indirect.
