of PAMPs that originate from gram-positive bacteria. Here we describe a novel mechanism regulating TLR2 protein expression and subsequent cytokine release through the ubiquitination and degradation of the receptor in response to ligand stimulation. We show a new mechanism in which an uncharacterized RING finger E3 ligase, PPP1R11, directly ubiquitinates TLR2 both in vitro and in vivo, which leads to TLR2 degradation and disruption of the signaling cascade. Lentiviral gene transfer or knockdown of PPP1R11 in mouse lungs significantly affects lung inflammation and the clearance of <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic>. There is a negative correlation between PPP1R11 and TLR2 levels in white blood cell samples isolated from patients with <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic> infections. These results suggest that PPP1R11 plays an important role in regulating innate immunity and gram-positive bacterial clearance by functioning, in part, through the ubiquitination and degradation of TLR2.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.18496.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.18496.001</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>TLR2</kwd><kwd>E3 ligase</kwd><kwd>ubiquitination</kwd><kwd>innate immunity</kwd><kwd>ARDS</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd><kwd>Mouse</kwd><kwd>Virus</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>HL114453</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Zhang</surname><given-names>Yingze</given-names></name><name><surname>McVerry</surname><given-names>Bryan J</given-names></name><name><surname>Chen</surname><given-names>Bill B</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000050</institution-id><institution>National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>HL116472</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Chen</surname><given-names>Bill B</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000050</institution-id><institution>National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>HL132862</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Chen</surname><given-names>Bill B</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Novel post-translational modification of pattern recognition receptor TLR2 has consequences in bacterial infection and inflammatory signaling.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The human toll-like receptor (TLR) family consists of ten family members (TLR1-TLR10) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chuang and Ulevitch, 2004</xref>). TLRs are single transmembrane pattern recognition receptors that recognize molecules derived from various pathogens, referred to as pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Crespo-Lessmann et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Delgado et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Esen and Kielian, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Chalifour et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Tobian et al., 2003</xref>) . TLRs are highly conserved from invertebrates to mammals, and are essential for mediating innate immunity and the production of cytokines in response to infectious agents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">O'Neill, 2000</xref>). All TLRs share common structural features, including multiple leucine-rich repeats (LRR), a transmembrane domain, and a conserved cytoplasmic Toll−interleukin 1 receptor (IL-1R) domain (TIR domain) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chuang and Ulevitch, 2004</xref>) . Specifically, LRR motifs from individual TLRs provide ligand binding sites for diverse PAMPs, whereas the TIR domain interacts with several intracellular proteins such as MyD88, which is essential for the transduction of downstream signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Fitzgerald et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Xu et al., 2000</xref>). Within the TLR family, TLR2 possesses the unique ability to recognize glycolipids, lipopeptides, lipoproteins, and lipoteichoic acids from gram-positive bacteria. Thus, TLR2 is the key element of innate immunity that defends against gram-positive bacteria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Raby et al., 2013</xref>). TLR2 is expressed not only in immune cells, but is also present in pulmonary alveoli and airway epithelial cells, suggesting that it plays a role in mucosal innate immunity and infection-induced lung injury (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Charles et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hertz et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Hoth et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Jiang et al., 2005</xref>). Interestingly, TLR2 deficient mice are highly susceptible to <italic>S. aureus</italic> infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Takeuchi et al., 2000</xref>), and in humans, a loss-of-function TLR2 mutation has been linked to susceptibility to infectious and inflammatory diseases, faster disease progression, and a more severe course of sepsis in critically ill patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bronkhorst et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Janardhanan et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Nachtigall et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Stappers et al., 2014</xref>). These studies illustrate the protective role of TLR2 in response to inflammatory insults and infectious diseases. Therefore, TLR2 augmentation may be a novel therapeutic strategy in the fight against gram-positive infection.</p><p>Ubiquitination of proteins brands them for degradation, either via the proteasome or the lysosome, and regulates diverse processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Tanaka et al., 2008</xref>). First, using ATP, the catalytically active cysteine (C) residue of the E1-activating enzyme forms a high energy thioester bond to the C-terminal glycine of ubiquitin (Ub) and then, using another ATP, transfers it to the active center C of the E2 Ub conjugating enzyme (Ubc) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Jin et al., 2007</xref>). Finally, the C-terminus of Ub is attached to the ε-amino lysine (K) residue of the substrate, mediated by an E3 ligase that typically targets a substrate marked by a particular post-translational degron (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Skaar et al., 2013</xref>). The mechanism of protein ubiquitination is dependent on the type of E3 ligase: SCF, RING finger, U-box, or HECT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Jin et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Skaar et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hatakeyama et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Dikic and Robertson, 2012</xref>). Of the many E3 ligases, the RING finger domain E3 superfamily remains poorly characterized. Functional data are available for only about a dozen of the over 300 predicted ligases, such as MDM2 and several RNF and TRIM proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Fang et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Joazeiro and Weissman, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Lorick et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Metzger et al., 2012</xref>). RING finger E3 ligases contain a unique RING (Really Interesting New Gene) finger domain that consists of two zinc finger type domains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Borden and Freemont, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Freemont et al., 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Lovering et al., 1993</xref>). In this study, we characterize a previously undescribed RING finger E3 ligase family member, PPP1R11, and identify its role in regulating cytokine secretion through targeted TLR2 protein ubiquitination and degradation. These studies describe a new molecular mechanism contributing to mucosal innate immunity.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>TLR2 polyubiquitination is regulated by RING E3 ligase PPP1R11</title><p>We first investigated TLR2 protein degradation using a transformed murine lung epithelial (MLE) cell line. MLE cells express high levels of TLR2 protein (Data not shown). Cells were stimulated with the TLR2 ligand, Pam3CSK4, and TLR2 protein levels decreased after 4 hr. However, co-treatment with the proteasomal inhibitor MG-132 preserved TLR2 protein levels, while treatment with the lysosomal inhibitor leupeptin did not. Further, cell lysates from these treatments were subjected to TLR2 immunoprecipitation and Ubiquitin immunoblotting. High molecular weight ubiquitin signals in TLR2 immunoprecipitate were detected only in cell lysates treated with MG-132 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Taken together, this suggests that the TLR2 ligand, Pam3CSK4, induces the polyubiquitination and subsequent degradation of TLR2 via the proteasome. We also investigated the type of ubiquitin linkage on TLR2 using a UbiCRest (Ubiquitin Chain Restriction Analysis) assay (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Hospenthal et al., 2015</xref>). Polyubiquitinated TLR2 was subjected to several deubiquitinating enzymes (DUB) that target specific ubiquitin linkages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>). As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>, USP2, a DUB that non-specifically targets all ubiquitin linkages, completely reduced polyubiquitinated TLR2. We also observed a drastic decrease in TLR2 ubiquitination in the OTUB1 treated sample, which suggests that TLR2 ubiquitination is regulated in part through K48 ubiquitin linkage. We also observed K48-specific ubiquitin linkage of TLR2 following TLR2 immunoprecipitation and immunoblotting (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref>). MG-132 dramatically increased the half-life of TLR2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C</xref>) and Ubiquitin overexpression drastically reduced TLR2 protein levels and half-life (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). These studies suggest that TLR2 protein degradation occurs in a ubiquitin-dependent manner.</p><p>Next, we tested over fifty E3 ligases that might be involved in TLR2 degradation (Data not shown) and found that overexpression of PPP1R11 decreased TLR2 levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2A</xref>). Ectopic expression of PPP1R11 triggered TLR2 degradation in a dose dependent manner (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>) without affecting its mRNA levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2B</xref>). Furthermore, ectopic PPP1R11 expression significantly decreased the half-life of TLR2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>), whereas PPP1R11 knockdown markedly increased its lifespan (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2C</xref>). Conversely, we observed no effect on TLR2 decay with the expression and silencing of fellow RING E3 ligase PCGF1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2D–E</xref>). To confirm PPP1R11 as an authentic TLR2 target, we performed an in vitro ubiquitination assay using TLR2 as the substrate and observed polyubiquitination of TLR2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>).<fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.18496.002</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>TLR2 polyubiquitination is regulated by PPP1R11.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Murine lung epithelial (MLE) cells were treated with Pam3CSK4 with or without MG-132 or Leupeptin in a time-dependent manner.

In control patients, we observed no correlation between PPP1R11 and TLR2 levels, but observed a significantly negative PPP1R11/TLR2 correlation in <italic>S. aureus</italic>-infected patients. We interpret these data to suggest that during <italic>S. aureus</italic> infection, TLR2 levels may be attenuated in part by PPP1R11 expression.

They are characterized by the unique property of auto-ubiquitination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Amemiya et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Deshaies and Joazeiro, 2009</xref>). We confirmed that PPP1R11 is an authentic ring finger E3 ligase by showing its ability to auto-ubiquitinate in the presence of ubiquitin, E1, and several different E2 conjugating enzymes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1H</xref>). We also showed that several E2 conjugating enzymes such as UBE2R1 and UBE2D2 preferably interact with PPP1R11 in vitro (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1I</xref>). Lastly, we showed that PPP1R11 interacts with endogenous UBE2D2 through cellular co-immunoprecipitation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1J</xref>). We also selectively mutated several key residues of PPP1R11 putative RING finger (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3A</xref>) and showed their loss-of-function in inducing TLR2 degradation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3B</xref>). H126 was chosen as negative control since it is outside of the RING finger domains. The effect of PPP1R11 was specific to TLR2, as an ectopic expression of PPP1R11 did not alter TLR3, TLR7, TLR8, or TLR9 protein levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1—figure supplement 4</xref>). These experiments suggest that PPP1R11 is an authentic RING finger E3 ligase that specifically induces TLR2 ubiquitination and degradation.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>PPP1R11 regulates Pam3CSK4-induced TLR2 protein degradation and inflammation</title><p>To further elucidate the PPP1R11/TLR2 pathway in cells, we treated MLE cells with the TLR2 ligand, Pam3CSK4. We observed a time-dependent increase in PPP1R11 protein levels and decrease in TLR2 protein levels with this treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). Further, cell lysates from these conditions were subjected to TLR2 immunoprecipitation, and high levels of PPP1R11 protein were detected in cells treated with Pam3CSK4 for 4 and 6 hr. PPP1R11/TLR2 association at these time points also reflects the highest degree of TLR2 protein loss (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). We also examined the role of PPP1R11 in Pam3CSK4-induced TLR2 protein degradation, and upon ectopic expression of PPP1R11, we observed an accelerated decay of TLR2 protein with Pam3CSK4 treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). Last, we performed PPP1R11 knockdown in MLE cells, and we observed stabilized TLR2 protein levels as well as less ubiquitination upon Pam3CSK4 treatment as compared to control siRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). TLR2 immunoprecipitation also showed protein ubiquitination beginning at 1 hr post Pam3CSK4 treatment, which is consistent with increased PPP1R11/TLR2 association (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>).

Mutation of lysine 754 to arginine (K754R) within TLR2 resulted in its highest level of stability, a much extended half-life (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A</xref>), and resistance to Pam3CSK4-induced degradation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1B</xref>). K754R TLR2 is also resistant to in vitro ubiquitination and degradation during PPP1R11 co-expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1C–D</xref>). We confirmed that the K754R mutant TLR2 is expressed and localized normally in cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1E</xref>). This suggests that the extended stability of the TLR2 K754R mutant is due to its inability to be ubiquitinated by PPP1R11 and that K754 is a potential PPP1R11 ubiquitination site within TLR2. Since Pam3CSK4 induces the TLR2 signaling pathway that leads to cytokine release, we hypothesized that by ubiquitinating TLR2, the E3 ligase PPP1R11 is able to suppress the TLR2 signaling pathway. Indeed, ectopic expression of PPP1R11 reduces both IL-6 and CXCL1 cytokines by 40–50% upon Pam3CSK4 treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D–E</xref>), whereas PPP1R11 knockdown significantly increased both IL-6 and CXCL1 cytokine release in MLE cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F–G</xref>). Cytokine release upon overexpression and knockdown of fellow RING E3 ligase Trim52 resulted in no significant difference relative to controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1F–G</xref>). Finally, we embarked on gene editing experiments to confirm the regulatory role of PPP1R11 on TLR2 and cytokine release. Utilizing CRISPR-Cas9 technology, we generated a 2 bp deletion in the first exon of <italic>Ppp1r11</italic> in MLE cells leading to an immediate pre-mature stop codon. Following colony expansion, we assayed protein half-life and observed stabilized TLR2 half-life in the <italic>Ppp1r11</italic> KO cells relative to control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2A</xref>). We also challenged PPP1R11 KO cells with PAM3CSK4, and observed increased IL-6 and CXCL1 cytokine release relative to control cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2B–C</xref>).

Here we show a novel mechanism by which the previously unrecognized RING finger E3 ligase, PPP1R11, attenuates TLR2 signaling in response to <italic>S. aureus</italic> infection by targeting TLR2 for proteasomal degradation. PPP1R11 (Protein Phosphatase 1 Regulatory Subunit 11) was originally described to interact with and inhibit protein phosphatase 1 activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Zhang et al., 1998</xref>) . It also has another name, TcTex5 (T-Complex-Associated-Testis-Expressed 5), and it was implied that mutation of TcTex5 is associated with a mouse sperm motility abnormality in sterile t-haplotype mutant mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Han et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Pilder et al., 2007</xref>). However, its E3 ligase activity has never been described. Canonical RING finger domains contain the consensus sequence C-X<sub>2</sub>-C-X<sub>[9-39]</sub>-C-X<sub>[1-3]</sub>-H-X<sub>[2-3]</sub>-C-X<sub>2</sub>-C-X<sub>[4-48]</sub>-C-X<sub>2</sub>-C, where both cysteine and histidine residues are involved in zinc coordination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Borden and Freemont, 1996</xref>). However, we believe that PPP1R11 has a non-canonical RING finger domain with all the characteristics of a Ring finger E3 ligase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G,H,I</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3A</xref>). We show the relative specificity of TLR2 targeting by PPP1R11, as none of the other TLRs tested were degraded by PPP1R11 expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1—figure supplement 4</xref>). However, it is possible that other E3 ligases target TLR2 for ubiquitination as this phenomenon has been well described with other substrates, e.g. SCF E3 ligase subunits Fbxw1, Fbxw7, Fbxw8, Fbxl1, Fbxo4, and Fbxo31 are all capable of ubiquitinating cyclin D1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Skaar et al., 2009</xref>). We do not rule out other RING finger E3 ligase or even other E3 ligase family members to potentially target TLR2 for ubiquitination, however, our data suggest that PPP1R11 targets TLR2 for proteasomal degradation via ubiquitination.</p><p>Targeted TLR2 degradation by PPP1R11 may act as a negative feedback mechanism in the lung to prevent a harmful, excessive inflammatory response that causes severe lung injury. We have observed similar function of other E3 ligase proteins such as Fbxl19 in acute lung injury and pneumonia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Zhao et al., 2012</xref>). Indeed, we showed that treatment of MLE cells with TLR2 ligand, Pam3CSK4, up-regulates PPP1R11 protein levels and gradually reduces TLR2 protein levels at about 4–6 hr (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). We also showed that ectopic expression of PPP1R11 in MLE cells significantly reduced Pam3CSK4-induced cytokine release, and gene editing of PPP1R11 significantly increases ligand-induced cytokine release (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D–E</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2B–C</xref>). This evidence suggests that PPP1R11 could be a natural inflammatory suppressor in cells, and this pathway could be utilized to target multiple types of stimuli-induced inflammation. While the targeted degradation of TLR2 may restrain excessive inflammatory responses, activation of this pathway is also critical for pathogen clearance. By manipulating levels of TLR2 in murine lungs through PPP1R11, we showed effects in downstream inflammation and <italic>S. aureus</italic> bacterial clearance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figures 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">4</xref>). These results are in line with previous studies showing TLR2 deficient mice were more susceptible to <italic>S. aureus</italic> infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Takeuchi et al., 2000</xref>). Specifically, higher inflammation in the lung might lead to lung injury, but also proved to be more efficient at clearing bacteria (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>), whereas reduced inflammation in the lung is tissue-protective but fails to clear bacteria, which leads to systemic bacteremia (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). One approach to potentially control the balance between the beneficial effects of the inflammatory pathway and the harmful and excessive responses to pathogens is to manipulate PPP1R11. These results suggest that PPP1R11 inhibition might confer a protective phenotype against <italic>S. aureus</italic> pneumonia by augmenting TLR2 signaling, which is critical for bacterial clearance. As a proof-of-concept investigation, we observed a negative correlation between TLR2 and PPP1R11 protein levels in WBC pellets from <italic>S. aureus</italic>-infected patients. Interestingly, no correlation between PPP1R11 and TLR2 levels was observed in control patients (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2D</xref>). This experiment suggests that the PPP1R11/TLR2 pathway is only active during <italic>S. aureus</italic> infection. It is likely that other regulators such as kinases are also involved in PPP1R11-driven TLR2 ubiquitination, which is common in E3 ligase substrate targeting (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chen et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Lear et al., 2016</xref>). Further studies are warranted to investigate regulators that influence PPP1R11 expression and activity.</p><p>In conclusion, we show that the previously uncharacterized RING E3 Ligase, PPP1R11, is up-regulated in response to the TLR2 ligand, Pam3CSK4, and subsequently targets TLR2 for proteasomal degradation by ubiquitinating it at lysine 754. Down-regulation of TLR2 levels by PPP1R11 reduces pro-inflammatory cytokine secretion but impairs bacterial clearance in response to <italic>S. aureus</italic>. Taken together, this study characterizes a novel innate immune regulatory mechanism involving PPP1R11-targeted degradation of the pattern recognition receptor TLR2.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Materials</title><p>Sources of the murine lung epithelial (MLE) cell line were described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chen and Mallampalli, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Ray et al., 2010</xref>).

Your article has been reviewed by Shao-Cong Sun (Reviewer #1) and Zhengfan Jiang (Reviewer #2) and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Tadatsugu Taniguchi as the Senior Editor.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>The authors demonstrate that RING finger E3 ligase PPP1R11 can modulates polyubiquitination and degradation of TLR2 via proteasome, thus regulating TLR2-triggered the innate immunity. PPP1R11 is up regulated by TLR2 ligation and subsequently ubiquitinates TLR2 at lysine 754 for degradation, thereby suppressing cytokine production induced by TLR2/gram-positive bacterial infection. This work identifies a previously unreported RING finger E3 ligase in TLR2 regulation.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>Further detailed investigation is needed for TLR2 polyubiquitination and degradation, and also in vitro experiments with CRISPR approach would be needed to improve the quality of this work. Another RING finger E3 ligase should be added as control to support the specificity of PPP1R11 in the regulation of TLR2.</p><p>Reviewer #1:</p><p>In this manuscript, authors present a series of studies suggesting that a novel RING finger E3 ligase, PPP1R11, regulates polyubiquitination and degradation of TLR2 via proteasome. PPP1R11 is up regulated in response to the TLR2 ligand, Pam3CSK4, and subsequently ubiquitinates TLR2 at lysine 754 for degradation, thereby suppressing cytokine production induced by TLR2 signaling pathway. Overexpression or knockdown of PPP1R11 in mouse affects lung inflammation and bacterial clearance in response to staphylococcus aureus infection. Together, they conclude that PPP1R11 targets TLR2 for ubiquitination and degradation in vitro and in vivo, which is involved in the regulation of innate immunity induced by gram-positive bacterial infection. These findings are significant, since they characterize a previously unreported RING finger E3 ligase and suggest a new mechanism of TLR2 regulation. However, the authors should consider the following comments to further strengthen the work.</p><p>Major Points:</p><p>1) In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C and E</xref>, protein level of TLR2 is significantly lower in lane 4 than lane 1; however TLR2 densitometry figures showed identical TLR2 densitometry in these lanes. The authors should explain how the densitometry was calculated and normalized. It appears that the main difference is in the untreated lanes.</p><p>2) In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>, it appears that TLR2 degradation started from 1h following Pam3CSK4 stimulation, whereas PPP1R11 binding did not occur until 4h. Pam3CSK-induced TLR2 ubiquitination also started at 1h post-stimulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). The authors should repeat this experiment to see whether this result is reproducible or due to experimental variations. If these data are reproducible, they would suggest the existence of another E3 that mediates the early stage of TLR2 ubiquitination. In such a case, the authors should discuss the results.</p><p>3) The mechanism underlying TLR2 ubiquitination was not investigated in depth. The authors should use chain-specific ubiquitin antibodies to examine whether TLR2 is conjugated with K48 ubiquitin chains or other chains (e.g. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">2C</xref>).</p><p>4) In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>, the protein level of TLR2 is drastically reduced after incubating TLR2 with E1, E2 and PPP1R11 in in vitro ubiquitin conjugation assays. Is this due to ubiquitination or degradation in the in vitro system? This result is quite different from that of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, central panel (MG-132).</p><p>5) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref> should indicate the amount of the individual DUBs and show a panel of DUB protein immunoblot.</p><p>6) In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref>, the authors find several key residues of PPP1R11 that are important for TLR2 degradation. It would be helpful if the authors the possible structural mechanisms and any rationales for testing these residues (e.g. are these conserved residues in certain domains?).</p><p>Reviewer #2:</p><p>TLR2 is an important pattern recognition receptor that senses the pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs), mainly those derived from gram-positive bacteria, to initiate downstream immune pathways and inflammation. As such, data on the regulation of TLR2 is important for our understanding of the immune response. The authors present data on the role of a novel RING finger E3 ligase PPP1R11 in regulating TLR2 abundance in both human and murine cell lines, as well as by gene-transfer in mice organs. Overall the manuscript is written in a clear logic and the experiments are well designed. The data presented are novel, and the regulatory effects for PPP1R11 on the pathogenesis of lung infection have been defined.</p><p>However, there are some major issues to be carefully considered before the manuscript is ready for publication on <italic>eLife</italic>.</p><p>First, most of the data in this manuscript are from ectopic expression or RNAi-mediated gene knockdown experiments. As gene-specific knockout using the CRISPR-Cas9 system is technically mature, data collected with those PPP1R11 knockout cell-lines or mice, if applicable, should undoubtedly make the conclusion more solid and reliable.</p><p>Second, the effects of PPP1R11 in TLR2-mediated infection are double faced. From the gene transfer experiments, we can see that the gain or loss of PPP1R11 results in a selection between a control of inflammation and bacteria clearance. This phenomenon, however, makes it a hard decision to manipulate this gene for an effective treatment of lung infection.

The authors should explain how the densitometry was calculated and normalized. It appears that the main difference is in the untreated lanes.</italic> </p><p>We have added more detail regarding our densitometry calculation to the figure legend and the methods. Briefly, we calculated densitometry through ImageJ and normalized to hour 0 for each condition. Lane 4 (hour 0 for both Ubiquitin overexpression and PPP1R11 overexpression) has lower TLR2 protein level to start due to the inherent enhanced derogatory environment of additional Ubiquitin and additional E3 ligase.</p><p><italic>2) In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>, it appears that TLR2 degradation started from 1h following Pam3CSK4 stimulation, whereas PPP1R11 binding did not occur until 4h. Pam3CSK-induced TLR2 ubiquitination also started at 1h post-stimulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). The authors should repeat this experiment to see whether this result is reproducible or due to experimental variations. If these data are reproducible, they would suggest the existence of another E3 that mediates the early stage of TLR2 ubiquitination. In such a case, the authors should discuss the results.</italic> </p><p>We have repeated this experiment and observed increased association of TLR2 and PPP1r11 at 1-hour post-stimulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). This is consistent with the data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>, in which TLR2 ubiquitination level increased at 1h following Pam3CSK4 treatment.</p><p><italic>3) The mechanism underlying TLR2 ubiquitination was not investigated in depth. The authors should use chain-specific ubiquitin antibodies to examine whether TLR2 is conjugated with K48 ubiquitin chains or other chains (e.g. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">2C</xref>).</italic> </p><p>This is an excellent point. We immunoprecipitated TLR2 and observed significant K48-linked ubiquitin signal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref>). This is consistent with our data from the UBICrest assay, which suggests K48-ubiquitin linkages on TLR2. However, this does not rule out other species of ubiquitin linkages not associated with the degradation of TLR2. While study of these linkages will further help elucidate TLR signaling, we believe it is beyond the scope of this manuscript.</p><p><italic>4) In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>, the protein level of TLR2 is drastically reduced after incubating TLR2 with E1, E2 and PPP1R11 in</italic> in vitro <italic>ubiquitin conjugation assays. Is this due to ubiquitination or degradation in the</italic> in vitro <italic>system? This result is quite different from that of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, central panel (MG-132).</italic> </p><p>The protein level is due to degradation in the system. The in vitro ubiquitination assay composition includes rabbit reticulocyte lysate as part of the protein synthesis process in the TnT kit. In the past we have noticed baseline degradation due to the presence of proteasome and other degradative mechanisms in the reticulocyte lysate. We also hypothesize accelerated degradation occurs due to the cell-free nature of the assay.</p><p><italic>5) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref> should indicate the amount of the individual DUBs and show a panel of DUB protein immunoblot.</italic> </p><p>Thank you for this comment; it is important as high concentrations of DUBs can lead to promiscuity. The working concentrations of the DUBs were 0.5 μM, except for OTUD7A which was 0.1 μM. This experimental detail has been added to the methods section. Additionally, we included a Coomassie gel to show the presence of DUB proteins in the reactions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>).</p><p><italic>6) In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref>, the authors find several key residues of PPP1R11 that are important for TLR2 degradation. It would be helpful if the authors the possible structural mechanisms and any rationales for testing these residues (e.g. are these conserved residues in certain domains?).</italic> </p><p>We have included a cartoon showing the non-canonical ring finger domain including cluster of residues we mutated in the study (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3A</xref>). We believe these residues form a putative set of atypical RING domains, granting PPP1R11 activity as an E3 Ligase. Further, we included a negative control mutation (H126A) which retains activity in TLR2 degradation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3B</xref>).</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic> </p><p><italic>[…] First, most of the data in this manuscript are from ectopic expression or RNAi-mediated gene knockdown experiments. As gene-specific knockout using the CRISPR-Cas9 system is technically mature, data collected with those PPP1R11 knockout cell-lines or mice, if applicable, should undoubtedly make the conclusion more solid and reliable.</italic> </p><p>We used CRISPR/Cas9 system to generate PPP1R11 knockout in MLE cells and have evaluated the KO cells in response to TLR2 ligand Pam3CSK4 in vitro. Utilizing sgRNAs designed by Santa Cruz Biotechnologies, we generated a 2 bp deletion in the first exon of PPP1R11 in MLE cells leading to an immediate pre-mature stop codon. PPP1R11 KO cells also show significantly prolonged TLR2 half-life, relative to control cells, and an increase cytokine release following ligand treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2A–C</xref>). This result is highly consistent with the PPP1R11 siRNA knockdown experiments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2C</xref>,5F–G).</p><p><italic>Second, the effects of PPP1R11 in TLR2-mediated infection are double faced. From the gene transfer experiments, we can see that the gain or loss of PPP1R11 results in a selection between a control of inflammation and bacteria clearance. This phenomenon, however, makes it a hard decision to manipulate this gene for an effective treatment of lung infection. The authors should carefully think over this issue and determine the physiological effects of PPP1R11.</italic> </p><p><italic>Third, while the manuscript is well written, there are areas that would benefit from re-working in terms of English grammar and usage.

This inconsistency should be corrected.</italic> </p><p>This most likely is due to experimental variations from immunoblotting. We do however showed the time-dependent decrease of TLR2 with Pam3CSK4 treatment in additional three experiments <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A,B and C</xref>. Nevertheless, we reran the samples and included new immunoblots that display the time-dependent decrease in TLR2 protein in the control condition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). We believe these results suggest ligand-induced TLR2 protein degradation occurs in a time-dependent manner, and is blocked by MG132 treatment.</p><p><italic>2) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E–F</xref>, another RING finger E3 ligase should be included in these experiments side by side with PPP1R11 to show that the latter is specific for TLR2. Using PCGF1 as in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref> is just fine.</italic> </p><p>We have conducted CHX chase experiments utilizing PCGF1 over-expression and siRNA silencing in MLE cells and observed no change in TLR2 protein decay relative to control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2D–E</xref>). We also calculated and plotted protein densitometry. PCGF1 is RING-domain E3 ligase, and hypothesized to function similar to PPP1R11. These experiments illustrate the specificity in the E3-substrate relationship.</p><p><italic>3) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F–G</xref>, an siRNA for another RING finger E3 ligase should be included in these experiments to show specificity. Using Trim52 as in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D–E</xref> is just fine.</italic> </p><p>We silenced Trim52 in MLE cells followed by Pam3CSK4 treatment, and measured IL-6 and CXCL-1 cytokine release through ELISA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1F–G</xref>). Similar to experiments with PCGF1(<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2D–E</xref>), we observe that a fellow RING E3 Ligase is unable to affect a functional phenotype related to PPP1R11 in regard to TLR2 degradation and cytokine release. While we do not claim PPP1R11 to be the sole-regulator of TLR2 degradation, it has proven sufficient to degrade TLR2 in contrast to fellow RING E3 family members.</p><p><italic>4) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3M</xref>, although a general trend is shown that PPP1R11 expression results in the loss of TLR2, individual consistency should be paid attention to, as gene transfer Mouse 1 should not display more TLR2 than Mouse 5 considering their PPP1R11 expression levels.</italic> </p><p>We have processed frozen tissue samples and re-immunoblotted for TLR2 and PPP1R11 resulting in more representative and more consistent protein signal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3M</xref>).
