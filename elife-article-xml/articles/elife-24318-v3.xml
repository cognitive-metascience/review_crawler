Mutations in the <italic>LRTOMT</italic> gene, which encodes a protein with homology to the catecholamine methyltransferase COMT that is linked to schizophrenia, cause deafness. Here, we show that <italic>Tomt/Comt2</italic>, the murine ortholog of <italic>LRTOMT</italic>, has an unexpected function in the regulation of mechanotransduction by hair cells. The role of mTOMT in hair cells is independent of mTOMT methyltransferase function and mCOMT cannot substitute for mTOMT function. Instead, mTOMT binds to putative components of the mechanotransduction channel in hair cells and is essential for the transport of some of these components into the mechanically sensitive stereocilia of hair cells. Our studies thus suggest functional diversification between mCOMT and mTOMT, where mTOMT is critical for the assembly of the mechanotransduction machinery of hair cells. Defects in this process are likely mechanistically linked to deafness caused by mutations in <italic>LRTOMT/Tomt</italic>.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.24318.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.24318.001</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>hair cell</kwd><kwd>mechanotransduction</kwd><kwd>hearing</kwd><kwd>Tomt</kwd><kwd>stereocilia</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd>None</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000055</institution-id><institution>National Institute on Deafness and Other Communication Disorders</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>DC015724</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Cunningham</surname><given-names>Christopher L</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>DC005211</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Lauer</surname><given-names>Amanda</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>DC000023</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Lauer</surname><given-names>Amanda</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000055</institution-id><institution>National Institute on Deafness and Other Communication Disorders</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>DC005965</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Müller</surname><given-names>Ulrich</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000055</institution-id><institution>National Institute on Deafness and Other Communication Disorders</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>124789</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Müller</surname><given-names>Ulrich</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000009</institution-id><institution>Foundation for the National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>124906</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Müller</surname><given-names>Ulrich</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-7"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Rubenstein fund</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Lauer</surname><given-names>Amanda</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Murine TOMT is essential for transport of mechanotransduction components to stereocilia in cochlear hair cells.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Hair cells in the mammalian cochlea convert sound-induced vibrations into mechanical signals to enable our sense of hearing.

Stereocilia contain bundles of parallel actin filaments with their barbed ends facing toward the tips of stereocilia. No vesicles have been observed within stereocilia. Membrane proteins and cytoplasmic components are thus thought to be transported into stereocilia at least in part by actin-based molecular motors of the myosin family (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Belyantseva et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Senften et al., 2006</xref>). Accordingly, MYO7A is required for the localization of harmonin, SANS and PCDH15 within stereocilia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bahloul et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Boëda et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Senften et al., 2006</xref>). MYO1C binds to CDH23 and is a candidate to participate in CDH23 transport (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Siemens et al., 2004</xref>). The extent to which myosin motor proteins participate in the transport of TMHS/LHFPL5, TMIE, and TMC1/2 is not known, but recent studies have shown that the tetraspan protein TMHS/LHFPL5facilitates the transport of both PCDH15 and TMC1 into stereocilia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Beurg et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Xiong et al., 2012</xref>). However, we have only a very limited understanding of the mechanisms by which different proteins control the transport and retention of proteins within the tip-link complex.</p><p>Recent studies have shown that mutations in the human <italic>LRTOMT</italic> gene are associated with profound non-syndromic hearing loss at the DFNB63 locus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Ahmed et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Du et al., 2008</xref>). <italic>LRTOMT</italic> appears to have evolved from the fusion of two neighboring ancestral genes <italic>LRRC51</italic> and <italic>TOMT</italic>. The former gene has no known function, while the latter is a homolog of COMT, which encodes a catechol-O-methyltransferase implicated in the etiology of schizophrenia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Männistö and Kaakkola, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Tunbridge, 2010</xref>). COMT regulates levels of catecholamines such as epinephrine, norepinephrine, and dopamine in the brain and periphery (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Männistö and Kaakkola, 1999</xref>). <italic>LRTOMT</italic> has two alternative reading frames that encode two different proteins named LRTOMT1 and LRTOMT2. Only the latter isoform encodes a protein with predicted enzymatic activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Ahmed et al., 2008</xref>). <italic>Lrrc51</italic> and <italic>Tomt/Comt2</italic> exist in rodents as alternative genes that are located adjacent on the same chromosome. However, no fusion transcripts have been observed between the two murine genes ([<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Ahmed et al., 2008</xref>] and our unpublished observations). In the following, we will refer to <italic>Tomt/Comt2</italic> with its official gene name <italic>Tomt</italic>. Recombinant mouse TOMT(mTOMT) has catechol-O-methyltransferase activity and a point mutation in the murine gene that reduces this activity causes deafness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Du et al., 2008</xref>). Some but not all the mutations in the human <italic>LRTOMT</italic> gene that cause deafness are also predicted to affect methyltransferase activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Ahmed et al., 2008</xref>), although this has so far not been demonstrated experimentally. However, the mechanisms by which mutations in <italic>LRTOMT</italic> and <italic>Tomt</italic> cause deafness are currently unknown and the extent to which catecholamines play a role in this process remains to be established.</p><p>Using genetically modified mice generated by ENU mutagenesis and CRISPR-mediated gene editing, we have now investigated the mechanisms by which <italic>Tomt</italic> regulates auditory function. Surprisingly, we demonstrate that <italic>Tomt</italic> is essential for mechanotransduction by hair cells, where it is required for the localization of some components of the mechanotransduction machinery of hair cells to the mechanically sensitive stereocilia. Using mutational analysis, we provide evidence that the function of <italic>Tomt</italic> in mechanotransduction is independent of its enzymatic function. Instead, mTOMT binds to components of the mechanotransduction machinery and our data are consistent with a role for mTOMT in protein transport. Our studies thus suggest functional diversification between mCOMT and mTOMT, where mTOMT has acquired a new role in hair cells that is independent of its methyltransferase activity but critical for the assembly of the mechanotransduction machinery of hair cells.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Generation of <italic>Tomt</italic>-deficient mice and measurement of auditory function</title><p>mTOMT is a homologue of mCOMT with similarity in the overall domain structure of the two proteins and conservation of key amino acids in the methyltransferase domains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B,C</xref>). mCOMT has two isoforms, one of which contains a transmembrane domain, but the extent to which mTOMT has a transmembrane domain is unclear; some algorithms predict a potential transmembrane domain while others do not (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>; and data not shown).</p><p>In order to investigate the function of <italic>Tomt</italic> in the inner ear, we took advantage of <italic>add</italic> mice that we previously generated in an ENU mutagenesis screen (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Du et al., 2008</xref>). <italic>Add</italic> mice carry a point mutation (R48L) in the <italic>Tomt</italic> gene (referred to as <italic>Tomt<sup>add</sup></italic>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D,F,I</xref>). Our previous studies have shown that recombinant mTOMT has catechola-O-methyltransferase activity in vitro, although the methyltransferase activity is significantly less compared to mCOMT. The <italic>add</italic> mutation reduces methyltransferase activity but could also affect protein stability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Du et al., 2008</xref>). To more thoroughly investigate the function of <italic>Tomt</italic>, we wanted to generate a null allele of the <italic>Tomt</italic> gene using CRISPR-mediated gene editing. We therefore designed a guide RNA targeting the first coding exon (exon 2) of the <italic>Tomt</italic> gene (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>) and injected the guide RNA together with Cas9 into fertilized murine zygotes on the C57BL/6 background. Offspring from injections were bred and screened by PCR for genetic modifications at the <italic>Tomt</italic> locus. One of the CRISPR-engineered alleles, referred to as <italic>Tomt<sup>D12</sup></italic>, carries a 12 base pair (bp) in-frame deletion near the N-terminus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E–I</xref>). The second allele, <italic>Tomt<sup>del</sup></italic>, carries a deletion of 77 bp leading to a frame-shift and premature stop codon near the N-terminus of mTOMT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E–I</xref>).

At P5, the bundles of outer hair cells (OHCs) in homozygous mutants appeared similar in size to those of wild-type mice and formed a normal staircase pattern (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A–D</xref>).

We took advantage of our <italic>Tomt-GFP</italic> cDNA and introduced a point mutation in a tyrosine residue that is conserved within the methyltransferase domain of mTOMT and mCOMT and critical for enzymatic activity (<italic>Tomt-Y108A-GFP</italic>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7N</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Zhang and Klinman, 2011</xref>). We also generated a cDNA containing only the predicted mTOMT methyltransferase domain sequence fused to a C-terminal GFP tag (mTOMT-MT-GFP), and we generated a cDNA encoding a C-terminal GFP fusion with mCOMT (mCOMT-GFP) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7N</xref>). The GFP tag on mCOMT has previously been shown not to affect its enzymatic activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Sei et al., 2010</xref>). We then tested the extent to which the recombinant cDNAs could rescue defects in mechanotransduction in hair cells from <italic>Tomt</italic>-deficient mice. Using injectoporation, we expressed the cDNAs in OHCs from <italic>Tomt<sup>add/add</sup></italic> mice at P3 and analyzed transducer currents after one day in culture (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7O–Q</xref>). OHCs from the mid-apical region of the cochlea expressing the cDNAs were identified by GFP fluorescence and mechanotransduction currents were evaluated by patch-clamp electrophysiology using a stiff glass probe to deflect hair bundles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7O–Q</xref>). Mechanotransduction defects were not rescued by expression of mTOMT-MT-GFP (32 ± 3 pA) or mCOMT-GFP (40 ± 0.5 pA). Unlike TOMT, COMT-GFP localized to stereocilia (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s2">Figure 7—figure supplement 2</xref>) but still could not rescue mechanotransduction defects. In contrast, mTOMT-GFP (231 ± 19 pA) and mTOMT-Y108A-GFP (278 ± 41 pA) rescued transduction to a similar extent. However, rescue of transduction was only partial since transducer currents in OHCs from control mice that were injectoporated with GFP (<italic>Tomt<sup>add/+</sup></italic> + GFP) were at 541 ± 41 pA. Partial rescue of transduction could be a consequence of differences in expression levels of transgenes expressed from heterologous promoters compared to endogenous protein levels in wild-type hair cells or modified function due to epitope tags, but further studies are necessary to address this point (see discussion). Nevertheless, the fact that both mTOMT-GFP and mTOMT-Y108A-GFP rescued transduction to a similar extent, while the methyltransferase mCOMT-GFP or the putative TOMT methyltransferase domain (mTOMT-MT-GFP) could not, suggests that methyltransferase activity is not essential for TOMT function in hair cells.</p></sec><sec id="s2-8"><title>Interaction of mTOMT with putative components of the mechanotransduction machinery</title><p>To further define the mechanism by which TOMT affects transduction, we tested the hypothesis that mTOMT might interact with putative components of the mechanotransduction channel of hair cells (TMC1, TMC2, TMIE, TMHS/LHFPL5) or with tip-link proteins (PCDH15, CDH23). We therefore co-expressed TOMT carrying either a C-terminal HA-tag (TOMT-HA) or a C-terminal FLAG tag (TOMT-FLAG) together with TMC1, TMC2, TMIE and TMHS/LHFPL5 in HEK293 cells.

Our analysis of tip-link cadherins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>) already suggested that TOMT was not essential for PCDH15 transport. To evaluate distribution of TMHS/LHFPL5, we carried out immunolocalization studies in hair cells from wild-types and mutants but did not observe any obvious effect of TOMT on the distribution of TMHS/LHFPL5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8F</xref>).

Myc-TMC1 and Myc-TMC2 were both transported into the stereocilia of hair cells from control animals, although Myc-TMC2 was consistently observed at much higher levels compared to Myc-TMC1. Strikingly, both Myc-TMC1 and Myc-TMC2 were absent from the stereocilia of <italic>Tomt</italic>-deficient hair cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8H,I,K</xref>).

Thus, reverse polarity currents have so far been observed consistently in hair cells from mice with mutations that affect mechanotransduction. These reverse-polarity currents depend on PIEZO2 ion channels that are localized at the base of stereocilia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Wu et al., 2017</xref>). We wondered whether reverse polarity currents could be evoked in hair bundles from <italic>Tomt</italic>-deficient mice. For this purpose, we used the fluid-jet stimulation system that has previously been used to deflect hair bundles in the normal-polarity and reverse-polarity direction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Beurg et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Kim et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Zhao et al., 2014</xref>). We recorded regular normal-polarity currents in hair cells from P4 control <italic>Tomt<sup>add/+</sup></italic> mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9A,B</xref>). Small normal-polarity currents were also observed in P4 <italic>Tomt<sup>add/add</sup></italic> mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9A,B</xref>), similar to results obtained when hair cells were stimulated at P4 with a stiff glass probe (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figures 5</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">7</xref>). However, unlike OHCs from any other mutant mouse strain with defects in mechanotransduction, we did not observe reverse polarity currents in OHCs from <italic>Tomt<sup>add/add</sup></italic> mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9A</xref>). Surprisingly, reverse polarity currents of similar amplitude could be evoked in hair cells from controls and <italic>Tomt<sup>add/add</sup></italic> mutants after treatment with BAPTA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9A,C</xref>). This result is striking and suggests that loss of TMC stereociliary localization alone is not sufficient to induce reverse polarity currents and that mTOMT is essential for the process of inducing reverse polarity currents in TMC mutant animals. Thus, mTOMT has a critical role in the generation of reverse polarity currents downstream of TMC (see Discussion).<fig id="fig9" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.24318.016</object-id><label>Figure 9.</label><caption><title>Forward and reverse polarity currents in <italic>Tomt</italic> mutants.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Representative mechanotransduction currents in response to sinusoidal deflection of hair bundles at P4 for OHCs from <italic>Tomt<sup>add/+</sup></italic> and <italic>Tomt<sup>add/add</sup></italic> mice with and without 5 mM BAPTA treatment.

CDH23 homodimers form the upper part of tip links and their cytoplasmic domains bind to protein-complexes that contain harmonin, SANS and MYO7A (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). PCDH15 homodimers form the lower part of tip links and can interact with TMHS/LHFPL5, TMIE, and TMC1/2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). The mechanisms that lead to the assembly of the asymmetric tip-link mechanotransduction complex are largely unknown. Here, we show that mTOMT has a critical function in this process by regulating the distribution of TMC1/2 proteins in stereocilia. This finding was unexpected since based on sequence homology between mTOMT and COMT it was initially proposed that mTOMT might affect hair cell function by the regulation of catecholamine levels in the inner ear (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Du et al., 2008</xref>). However, the findings presented here suggest that defects in the assembly and transport of the mechanotransduction machinery of hair cells are likely intricately linked to the mechanism by which mutations in <italic>Tomt</italic> in mice and <italic>LRTOMT</italic> in humans cause deafness. This process appears to be largely independent of the function of TOMT as a methyltransferase. Our findings do not exclude that mTOMT has additional functions in auditory hair cells that depend on its methyltransferase activity that have not been detected by our analysis.</p><p>The fact that proteins are precisely confined to specific domains within the tip-link complex makes it unlikely that proteins reach their position purely by random diffusion. It seems more likely that specific transport and retention mechanisms shape protein complexes at tip links. As one model, proteins that are targeted to the upper and lower end of tip links might be part of different transport complexes. In this model, CDH23 and its associated proteins harmonin, SANS and MYO7A might be pre-assembled into a multimeric complex within vesicles at the base of stereocilia. The vesicles might then fuse at the base of stereocilia with the plasma membrane, leading to insertion of CDH23 into the membrane and exposing its cytoplasmic interaction partners to the cytoskeleton of stereocilia, thus allowing for MYO7A-driven transport along the actin filaments. Similarly, PCDH15 might be preassembled with TMHS/LHFPL5, TMIE and TMC1/2 into complexes that travel together into stereocilia, possibly also by a myosin motor driven process. However, experimental evidence suggests that this model may be too simplistic. This has been most clearly demonstrated for proteins that interact with CDH23 at the upper end of tip links such as harmonin, and SANS. MYO7A has been implicated in the transport of harmonin and SANS to the UTLD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bahloul et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Boëda et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Senften et al., 2006</xref>), but CDH23 transport occurs in the absence of MYO7A (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Senften et al., 2006</xref>). CDH23 interacts with MYO1C (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Siemens et al., 2004</xref>), which is an alternative candidate protein to mediate CDH23 transport. It is currently unclear why different components of the protein complex at the upper tip-link end are transported by distinct mechanisms. As one possibility, different transport mechanisms might facilitate repair processes. Harmonin, SANS, and MYO7A are clustered at the electron dense UTLD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Grati and Kachar, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Grillet et al., 2009</xref>), which might be a stable structure. CDH23 replacement following damage might be possible without disassembly of the UTLD thus accelerating repair. Further studies will be necessary to test this model.</p><p>Our previous studies and the findings presented here suggest that proteins at the lower end of tip links are similarly targeted to their location by distinct mechanisms. The myosin motor proteins (if any) that might be involved in the transport of PCDH15, TMHS/LHFPL5, TMIE, and TMC1/2 still need to be defined, although MYO7A can bind to PCDH15 and might participate in PCDH15 transport (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Senften et al., 2006</xref>). However, protein-protein interactions alone reveal little about transport mechanisms. For example, TMHS/LHFPL5 binds to PCDH15 and TMIE, but it does not bind to TMC1/2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Beurg et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Xiong et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Zhao et al., 2014</xref>); only PCDH15 depends on TMHS/LHFPL5 for localization to the tip-link complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Xiong et al., 2012</xref>). Tip-link localization of TMC1, which does not bind to TMHS/LHFPL5, depends on TMHS/LHFPL5 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Beurg et al., 2015</xref>). Overall, the studies suggest that while PCDH15 can bind to TMHS/LHFPL5, TMIE, and TMC1/2, assembly of the entire protein complex is not critical for transport of all proteins into stereocilia. This concept extends to the findings reported here for mTOMT. While mTOMT can bind to several components of the transduction complex, it is essential only for the transport of TMC1/2. The data do not exclude that under normal conditions the proteins are transported together into stereocilia. However, even without full assembly of the protein complex due to mutations, some of the remaining proteins can still be effectively transported although it is conceivable that the rate of transport is somewhat reduced.</p><p>mTOMT differs significantly from other proteins implicated in shuttling components of the tip-link complex into stereocilia since mTOMT, unlike TMHS/LHFPL5 and MYO7A, cannot be detected within stereocilia. Based on the localization of mTOMT in the cytoplasm, it seems more likely that mTOMT acts in a transient transport compartment prior to the insertion of proteins into the membrane of stereocilia. Expression and localization studies in heterologous cells are consistent with this model.</p><p>We and others have shown that TMC1/2 proteins are retained in an intracellular compartment of heterologous cells that were transfected to express TMC1/2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s1">Figure 8—figure supplement 1</xref>, [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Beurg et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Labay et al., 2010</xref>]). We show here that mTOMT that is co-expressed with TMC1/2 is not sufficient for insertion of TMC1/2 into the cell membrane of heterologous cells. Other proteins including TMHS/LHFPL5 may cooperate with mTOMT in protein transport either in concert or possibly acting in a sequential manner in different subcellular compartments. Finally, while our data show that TMC1 and TMC2 when overexpressed do not travel effectively into the hair bundles of TOMT-deficient hair cells, TOMT might affect endogenous TMC1/2 also in other ways, for example by affecting protein levels of the two transmembrane proteins.</p><p>The data presented here are consistent with a model where mTOMT acts independently of its enzymatic function in regulating the localization of TMC1/2, possibly acting as an adaptor or shuttle protein. In support of this model, mTOMT binds to PCDH15, TMIE, TMHS/LHFPL5 and TMC1/2. Expression of the methyltransferase domain of mTOMT cannot rescue the mechanotransduction defect of mTOMT-deficient hair cells, while mTOMT carrying a mutation that is predicted to abolish methyltransferase activity still rescues transduction. It should be noted that methyltransferase activity of wild-type recombinant mTOMT when compared to mCOMT appears to be low, at least for prevalent substrates of mCOMT such as norepinephrine in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Du et al., 2008</xref>). However, mTOMT might have other substrates that are metabolized more efficiently than norepinephrine that are important for auditory function. For example, the catecholamine dopamine has been implicated in the regulation of auditory function by pharmacological and immunohistochemical evidence. Efferent neurons form synapses with OHCs and with the nerve endings of afferents that innervate IHCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Eybalin, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Puel, 1995</xref>). A small number of efferent fibers have been shown to be dopaminergic, and dopamine can modulate the activity of afferent neurons that synapse on IHCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Darrow et al., 2006</xref>). Dopamine can also modulate the activity of afferent neurons that synapse on IHCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Eybalin, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Puel, 1995</xref>). However, we note that there were no differences in Dopamine levels in the inner ear of <italic>Tomt<sup>add</sup></italic> mutants, and exogenous treatment with Dopamine did not affect mechanotransduction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). Intriguingly, catechol-o-methyltransferase activity is not completely abolished in the brain of mice with mutations affecting mCOMT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Gogos et al., 1998</xref>). It would thus be interesting to test the extent to which mTOMT is responsible for the remaining methyltransferase activity, for example by analyzing mice deficient for both mCOMT and mTOMT, and if so, which are endogenous substrates of mTOMT.</p><p>During the developmental maturation of hair cells, hair bundles slowly acquire directional sensitivity. Initially, transducer currents can be evoked even by deflection of the hair bundle in the opposite from normal direction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Beurg et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Kim et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kindt et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Marcotti et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Stepanyan and Frolenkov, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Waguespack et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Wu et al., 2017</xref>). Reverse polarity currents have also been consistently observed in mice with mutations that affect proteins of the complex that regulate transduction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Beurg et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Kim et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Stepanyan and Frolenkov, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Zhao et al., 2014</xref>). These reverse polarity currents depend on the PIEZO2 ion channel that is concentrated near the base of stereocilia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Wu et al., 2017</xref>). There has been a striking correlation between the loss of normal polarity currents and the emergence of reverse polarity currents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Beurg et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Kim et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Zhao et al., 2014</xref>). We were therefore surprised that both normal and reverse polarity currents are affected by mTOMT. How can these data be reconciled? Since reverse polarity currents can be evoked in hair cells lacking TMC1/2, the loss of these proteins from stereocilia, as observed in mTOMT-deficient hair cells, is alone insufficient to unmask reverse polarity currents. Instead, the data suggest that mTOMT might act in a molecular pathway with TMC1/2 to regulate the emergence of reverse polarity currents. Our previous studies suggest that reverse polarity currents are regulated by the intracellular calcium concentration that is increased in response to disruption of the mechanotranduction machinery of hair cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Wu et al., 2017</xref>). Perhaps, mTOMT has a role in regulating intracellular calcium levels for example by regulating not only the distribution and activity of TMC1/2 but also of other proteins such at PMCA2 that are important for calcium regulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Beurg et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Yamoah et al., 1998</xref>). While we did not observe changes in the distribution of PMCA2 in the stereocilia of mTOMT-deficient hair cells, it might be worthwhile to analyze the extent to which mTOMT regulates PMCA2 activity. Strikingly, reverse polarity currents can be evoked in mTOMT-deficient hair cells by disruption of tip links. Tip-link disruption in mTOMT-deficient hair cells might lead to additional functional perturbation that then affects intracellular calcium levels more severely, thus unmasking reverse-polarity currents. Alternatively, there might be more than one molecular pathway that leads to the activation of reverse polarity currents.</p><p>In recent years, remarkable progress has been made in defining the molecular pathogenesis of deafness. One emerging theme is that hair cells and their stereocilia are particularly sensitive to genetic insults (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Dror and Avraham, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Richardson et al., 2011</xref>). A significant number of the genes linked to deafness encode proteins that directly affect mechanotransduction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Kazmierczak and Müller, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Zhao and Müller, 2015</xref>). These findings suggest that a subset of hearing disorders can be classified as mechanotransduction diseases. An intriguing open question is whether proteins linked to mechanotransduction in hair cells regulate other mechanosensory phenomena such as the perception of touch, and whether they play a role in pathological mechanisms such as pain perception.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Mouse strains</title><p><italic>Tomt<sup>add</sup></italic> mice (Tomt<sup>m1Btlr</sup> RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/MGI:3805735">MGI:3805735</ext-link>) were generated using ENU mutagenesis as described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Du et al., 2008</xref>).

In whole-cell configuration, cochlear hair cells were patched at −70 mV holding potential with a patch clamp amplifier (EPC 10 USB, HEKA Electronics, Lambrecht/Pfalz, Germany). For mechanical stimulation, hair bundles were deflected with a glass probe mounted on a piezoelectric stack actuator (P-885, Physik Instrument, Karlsruhe, Germany). The actuator was driven with voltage steps that were low-pass filtered at a frequency of 10 KHz to diminish the resonance of the piezo stack.

Sinusoidal force stimulus was applied to a 27-mm-diameter piezoelectric disc to produce fluid jet. The position of the pipette delivering the fluid jet was positioned at the modiolar side of the hair bundles and adjusted to elicit maximal mechanical stimuli-induced currents. For BAPTA treatments, Organs of Corti were perfused with 5 mM BAPTA for 10 min prior to recording. The sinusoids (40 Hz) was generated with Patchmaster 2.35 software (HEKA) and filtered at 1.0 kHz with 900CT eight-pole Bessel filter (Frequency Devices, Ottawa, IL).</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Whole-mount immunohistochemistry, immunocytochemistry and imaging</title><p>Whole mount cochleas were dissected, fixed, and immunostained as described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Grillet et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Schwander et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Senften et al., 2006</xref>).

Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Richard Aldrich as the Senior Editor. The following individuals involved in review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: David Raible (Reviewer #1); Gregory I Frolenkov (Reviewer #2).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Cunningham et al. perform comprehensive analysis of roles of the catecholamine methytransferase family gene mTOMT in mechanosensory hair cells. Using a combination of in vivo and in vitro analyses, histology and physiology, they demonstrate a requirement for mTOMT in hair cell mechanotransduction. The authors show that mTOMT mouse mutants have profound hearing loss through ABR recordings and that their outer hair cells fail to function shown through a loss of DPOAEs. These defects appear to be due to a loss of mechanotransduction in Tomt mutant mice. It has previously been hypothesized that TOMT's role in hair cells was due to impaired catecholamine degradation. The authors provide data that this is likely not the case due to the fact that application of exogenous catecholamines and pharmacological inhibition of catecholamine degradation have no effect on hair cell activity. Also, a TOMT construct with a point mutation eliminating TOMTs methyltransferase activity is able to rescue TOMT mutants to a similar extent as wildtype TOMT. They additionally show that TOMT is able to interact with a number of proteins important for mechanotransduction activity including PCDH15, LHPL5, TMIE and TMC2 and that TMC1 and TMC2 fail to properly localize to the stereocilia in <italic>Tomt</italic> mutants.</p><p>Even though the mechanism of this regulation is unclear, this is the first identified molecule that may regulate trafficking of the MET channel components in the hair cells. Therefore, the study is significant despite all drawbacks described below.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>While this mislocalization is presumably responsible for mechanotransduction defects seen in <italic>Tomt</italic> mutants it is not sufficient for the emergence of reverse polarity currents that are normally seen in Tmc mutants. This major take-home message is based on three panels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8H-J</xref>), out of which only the panels I and J show somewhat convincing TMC2 labeling in one stereocilia bundle of an outer hair cell (OHC) in each panel. This is not very compelling for a crucial result of the study. Some sort of statistical analysis is needed. If such analysis is not possible, then perhaps presenting the images of all transfected cells from these experiments in the supplement could make the authors' claim more convincing.</p><p>Where is mTOMT localized within the cell? Does it promote overall stability or production of TMC1/2? That is, are overall levels of TMC1/2 higher in cells with mTOMT activity or is there differential localization?</p><p>It is surprising that characterization of the OHC function was limited to mechanotransduction, even though TOMT deficiency may affect trafficking of other proteins besides TMC1 and TMC2. In fact, the accompanying manuscript from Teresa Nicolson's group has indications for that. Similarly, Ahmed et al. suggested the role LRTOMT at the basolateral plasma membrane of OHCs (Nat. Genetics, 2008). The &quot;low hanging fruits&quot; are the resting membrane potential, voltage-gated ion currents, and electromotility (non-linear capacitance) of the OHCs. Without knowing the physiological condition of OHCs, it is hard to determine whether the lack of proper trafficking of TMC1 and TMC2 is a primary or secondary effect of TOMT deficiency.</p><p>The MET function was investigated in OHCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E-H</xref>) while tip link count and localization of tip-link proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>) were performed in the inner hair cells (IHCs).

To make an argument about the loss of MET without changes in tip links, the PCDH15-CD2 localization has to be explored in add/add mice, since MET recordings were performed in this mouse strain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E-G</xref>).</p><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8A</xref>: The hair cells may survive gentamicin treatment only if the resting MET current is completely abolished.

We would like to emphasize that consistent with findings by other laboratories, it is much more difficult to express TMC1 in hair cells compared to TMC2 (for example see the original publication on TMC1 in hair cells by Kawashami et al., 2011). Thus, the overall levels of TMC1 in the hair bundles are lower compared to TMC2, but TMC1 can clearly be localized to the bundle. We have revised the text to indicate that expression levels for TMC1 are low compared to TMC2.</p><p><italic>Where is mTOMT localized within the cell? Does it promote overall stability or production of TMC1/2? That is, are overall levels of TMC1/2 higher in cells with mTOMT activity or is there differential localization?</italic> </p><p>We have carried out additional experiments and have revised the text and figures accordingly: “We have now carried out a more detailed analysis of mTOMT localization in hair cells as well as in heterologous cells. […] On rare occasions (&lt;1/10 cells) we observed expression of mHA-TOMT in stereocilia (data not shown). However, the significance of this finding is currently unclear.”</p><p>We also would like mention that we have used CRISPR technology to generate a mouse line where the endogenous mTOMT protein was tagged with HA. The advantage of the mouse line is over injectoporation is that gene expression is driven by the genomic <italic>mTomt</italic> locus thus providing a greater chance that the transgene is expressed at normal levels. Consistent with the data shown in the manuscript, we observed mTOMT expression throughout the cell body of hair cells. We could show the data in the current manuscript but would prefer not to do so because we generated the mice as the foundation for a new study to further define the mechanisms of TOMT function in hair cells. Nevertheless, we provide here for inspection a figure to the reviewers that supports the conclusions put forward in the current manuscript.</p><p>The reviewer also wonders whether mTOMT might regulate endogenous levels of TMC1/2. While we cannot exclude this possibility, it does not affect the conclusion that TMC1/2 does not travel to stereocilia in <italic>mTomt</italic> mutant mice since we used overexpression of epitope tagged proteins to support our conclusion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>). However, we have revised the text to indicate that we cannot exclude that mTOMT might also regulate TMC1/2 levels. “Finally, while our data show that TMC1 and TMC2 when overexpressed do not travel effectively into the hair bundles of TOMT-deficient hair cells, TOMT might affect endogenous TMC1/2 also in other ways, for example by affecting protein levels of the two transmembrane proteins.”</p><p><italic>It is surprising that characterization of the OHC function was limited to mechanotransduction, even though TOMT deficiency may affect trafficking of other proteins besides TMC1 and TMC2. In fact, the accompanying manuscript from Teresa Nicolson's group has indications for that. Similarly, Ahmed et al. suggested the role LRTOMT at the basolateral plasma membrane of OHCs (Nat.

Without knowing the physiological condition of OHCs, it is hard to determine whether the lack of proper trafficking of TMC1 and TMC2 is a primary or secondary effect of TOMT deficiency.</italic> </p><p>We agree with the assessment of the reviewer and have included additional experiments to address these points: (i) In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref> we show data for resting membrane potential, voltage gated ion currents and non-linear capacitance. There was no difference between controls and <italic>Tomt<sup>add/add</sup></italic> mutants; (ii) in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref> we show that the distribution of CDH23, PCDH15-CD2, PMCA2, MYO7A, espin and whirlin is not altered in the mutant hair cells; (iii) in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref> we show that the distribution of LHFPL5 and TMIE is not affected in the mutant hair cells.</p><p>Naturally, we cannot exclude that other proteins not studied here might be affected by mTOMT-deficiency, but there is an incredible specificity for effects on TMC1/2 without affecting other components of the mechanotransduction machinery of hair cells (CDH23, PCDH15-DC2, MYO7A, LHFPL5, TMIE) and key proteins of hair bundles (PMCA2, espin, whirlin).</p><p><italic>The MET function was investigated in OHCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E-H</xref>) while tip link count and localization of tip-link proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>) were performed in the inner hair cells (IHCs).
