When a cell divides, each daughter cell must receive a copy of all of the original cell's genetic information. To this end, the chromosomes are replicated to form so-called ‘sister chromatids’, which are then segregated equally between the two daughter cells.</p><p>In contrast, sex cells such as eggs and sperm (also called gametes) have a single copy of each chromosome. When an egg and a sperm fuse to form a single cell (called a zygote), the zygote ends up with a full set of chromosomes. Gametes are formed by two successive rounds of cell division that occur after the chromosomes are replicated. The first round separates the pairs of chromosomes, and the second separates the sister chromatids to produce the gametes, each of which has half the original amount of genetic information.</p><p>If something goes awry in the production of gametes, a zygote can end up with the wrong number of chromosomes. Almost one-third of human zygotes inherit an aberrant complement of chromosomes, and many of these zygotes either fail to survive or develop into offspring with birth defects and developmental disorders.</p><p>To ensure that gametes receive the correct number of chromosomes, the sister chromatids remain bound together by a ring-shaped protein complex during the first cell division. Previous studies on how this protein complex—called cohesin—tethers the sister chromatids together were conducted on yeast and mammalian cells. Now, Severson and Meyer show that, in a microscopic worm called <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic>, cohesin functions differently from how it functions in the simpler yeast cells.</p><p>Severson and Meyer found that rather than using a single cohesin complex like in yeast, the worms use multiple cohesin complexes that have different versions of one key protein subunit. Changing this single subunit has a major impact on cohesin's function. Consequently, each complex plays a specific role in tethering and then releasing sister chromatids. One of the cohesin complexes is triggered to tether the sister chromatids when the chromosomes replicate. Unexpectedly, another complex only tethers the sisters once breaks occur in the DNA. These breaks allow sister chromatids that are produced from maternally- and paternally-derived chromosomes to cross over and swap genetic material—which increases the genetic diversity of any future offspring. After these genetic swaps occur, the cohesin complexes are then selectively removed by different mechanisms, first to release the pairs of chromosomes and then the sister chromatids.</p><p>The findings of Severson and Meyer establish a new model for the mechanisms of chromosome segregation during gamete production. Further studies are now needed to determine the roles and regulation of these protein complexes in other species—including plants and mammals, which use similar cohesin complexes.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.03467.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.03467.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author keywords</title><kwd>cohesin</kwd><kwd>sister chromatid cohesion</kwd><kwd>meiosis</kwd><kwd>gametogenesis</kwd><kwd>kleisin</kwd><kwd>aneuploidy</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>C. elegans</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000011</institution-id><institution>Howard Hughes Medical Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Investigator</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Meyer</surname><given-names>Barbara J</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000011</institution-id><institution>Howard Hughes Medical Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Research Associate</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Severson</surname><given-names>Aaron F</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100005237</institution-id><institution>Helen Hay Whitney Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Post-doctoral Fellowship</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Severson</surname><given-names>Aaron F</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100006466</institution-id><institution>Cleveland State University</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Severson</surname><given-names>Aaron F</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100005170</institution-id><institution>Ohio Department of Development</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>funded by a Third Frontier grant to Center for Gene Regulation in Health and Disease</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Severson</surname><given-names>Aaron F</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Mechanisms that tether and release replicated sister chromatids to produce sperm and eggs rely extensively on meiotic cohesin complexes that are endowed with unexpectedly different properties specified by a single interchangeable subunit, the α-kleisin.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>In all organisms, faithful segregation of chromosomes during cell division is essential for genome stability. Accurate chromosome transmission is required both for the proliferative cell divisions that occur during mitosis and the sequential divisions that occur during meiosis to reduce genome copy number from two in diploid germline stem cells to one in haploid gametes. Approximately 30% of human zygotes have abnormal chromosomal content at conception due to defects in meiosis. Such aneuploidy is a leading cause of miscarriages and birth defects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Hassold and Hunt, 2001</xref>), and is thought to result, in part, from defects in sister chromatid cohesion (SCC) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Chiang et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Jessberger, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Nagaoka et al., 2012</xref>). SCC tethers replicated sister chromatids during mitosis and meiosis and is critical for accurate chromosome segregation.</p><p>SCC is mediated by an evolutionarily conserved protein complex called cohesin. The cohesin complex is composed of two long coiled-coil proteins of the Structural Maintenance of Chromosomes (SMC) family, called Smc1 and Smc3, a non-SMC protein called Scc3, and a fourth subunit called the α-kleisin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Nasmyth and Haering, 2009</xref>). Smc1, Smc3 and the kleisin form a tripartite ring proposed to mediate SCC by encircling sister chromatids. The kleisin subunit differs between mitotic and meiotic cohesin complexes. During yeast meiosis, the mitotic kleisin Scc1 is replaced by the meiosis-specific kleisin Rec8 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Klein et al., 1999</xref>). This substitution is crucial for the reduction of ploidy.</p><p>We recently showed that the dual kleisin model derived for yeast is insufficient to explain how cohesin complexes facilitate the reduction of genome copy number in all organisms, since Rec8 is not the sole meiotic kleisin in many organisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Severson et al., 2009</xref>). Here, we establish a new model: multiple, functionally specialized cohesin complexes that differ in their kleisin subunit perform distinct roles in reducing ploidy. The kleisin influences nearly all aspects of meiotic cohesin function, including how a cohesin complex loads onto meiotic chromosomes, how a complex becomes cohesive once loaded, and when, where and how a complex is removed from chromosomes in meiotic prophase. We first summarize the known roles of meiotic kleisins to provide context for these findings.</p><p>Analysis of <italic>rec8</italic> mutants in numerous sexually reproducing organisms showed that Rec8 cohesin is essential for the three key events that are unique to meiosis and underlie the production of haploid gametes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">DeVeaux and Smith, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bhatt et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Klein et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Watanabe and Nurse, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Buonomo et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Pasierbek et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Yokobayashi et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bannister et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Parra et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chelysheva et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Severson et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Tachibana-Konwalski et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Shao et al., 2011</xref>). First, homologous chromosomes become covalently linked through reciprocal exchange of DNA during the process of crossover (CO) recombination. COs promote accurate homolog segregation during anaphase of meiosis I, and Rec8 cohesin is required for efficient CO formation and maintenance. Second, sister chromatids attach to microtubules from the same spindle pole (co-orient) in meiosis I to ensure that spindle forces pull homologs apart but not sister chromatids. Sister chromatids then attach to microtubules from opposite spindle poles (bi-orient) in meiosis II, as they do in mitosis. Rec8 cohesin facilitates co-orientation. Third, spatially-regulated release of meiotic SCC must occur in two steps to allow the sequential separation of homologs in anaphase I and then sisters in anaphase II. Rec8 cohesin is essential for the linkages that tether sisters until anaphase II.</p><p>The widely conserved meiotic defects of <italic>rec8</italic> mutants reinforced the view of Rec8 as the sole meiotic kleisin. Our recent work challenged this prevalent view by demonstrating that <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic> gametogenesis requires two nearly identical and functionally redundant predicted α-kleisins, called COH-3 and COH-4 (hereafter, COH-3/4), in addition to REC-8 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Severson et al., 2009</xref>). REC-8 and COH-3/4 together mediate meiotic SCC, and severe disruption of SCC occurs only when all three kleisins are removed, suggesting the formation of cohesin complexes that differ in their kleisin subunit. Moreover, REC-8 and COH-3/4 are required for CO recombination. CO recombination fails in <italic>rec-8</italic> single mutants and in <italic>coh-4 coh-3</italic> double mutants, causing homologs to remain detached.</p><p>Although REC-8 and COH-3/4 are both required for CO formation and act in concert to mediate SCC, they perform distinct roles in meiotic chromosome segregation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Severson et al., 2009</xref>). Unlike REC-8, COH-3/4 cannot co-orient sisters or mediate SCC that persists until anaphase II. Consequently, in <italic>rec-8</italic> mutants, sister chromatids are tethered by COH-3/4-dependent SCC until anaphase I, when they segregate prematurely toward opposite spindle poles (equational division). In contrast, in <italic>coh-4 coh-3</italic> mutants, REC-8 cohesin co-orients sisters during meiosis I and tethers sisters until anaphase II. Consequently, sister chromatids remain together while homologs segregate randomly during anaphase I.</p><p>Subsequent to the discovery of COH-3/4 in <italic>C. elegans</italic>, meiotic kleisins similar to COH-3/4 were identified in plants and mammals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Herran et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Ishiguro et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Lee and Hirano, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Llano et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Yuan et al., 2012</xref>). The involvement of these kleisins in meiotic SCC likely explains why cohesion persists in <italic>rec8</italic> mutants of <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>, maize, and mouse, as it does in <italic>C. elegans</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bhatt et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bannister et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chelysheva et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Xu et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Golubovskaya et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Severson et al., 2009</xref>). The involvement of multiple kleisins in gametogenesis is therefore widely conserved, and our current study dissects the mechanisms by which the kleisin subunit influences cohesin function.</p><p>Here, we show that REC-8 and COH-3/4 are bona fide kleisin subunits of meiotic cohesin complexes, and that the mechanisms that regulate cohesin loading, sister chromatid cohesion, and cohesin removal are strongly affected by the kleisin subunit. We identify factors required for association of REC-8 cohesin, but not COH-3/4 cohesin, with meiotic chromosomes, providing strong evidence of complex-specific loading mechanisms. We show that COH-3/4 cohesin is triggered to become cohesive, and thereby establish SCC, independently of DNA replication and requires the programmed, SPO-11-dependent double-strand DNA breaks (DSBs) that initiate meiotic recombination. This result was not expected, because prior work showed that yeast mitotic cohesin loads onto chromosomes during telophase or G1 of the cell cycle and becomes cohesive only during S phase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Uhlmann and Nasmyth, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Nasmyth and Haering, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Wood et al., 2010</xref>). The sole example of replication-independent SCC establishment occurs in mitotically proliferating yeast that suffer DNA damage in G2 or M of the cell cycle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Ström et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Unal et al., 2007</xref>). The SCC formed in response to DSBs is thought to reinforce the cohesion generated during S phase. Since Rec8 cannot generate SCC in response to DNA damage, damage-induced SCC was thought to occur only in proliferating cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Heidinger-Pauli et al., 2008</xref>). Our data indicate that damage-induced SCC is an essential feature of meiosis. Finally, we show that prior to homolog separation in anaphase I, REC-8 and COH-3/4 cohesins become selectively removed from complementary domains that flank the single CO of each worm chromosome in a separase-independent manner, consistent with their distinct roles in meiotic chromosome segregation: COH-3/4 becomes enriched where SCC is released at anaphase I and REC-8 becomes enriched where sister chromatids co-orient and SCC persists until anaphase II. Because REC-8 alone can co-orient sisters and mediate SCC that persists after anaphase I, this reciprocal pattern of cohesin removal may facilitate or underlie the stepwise separation of homologs and sister chromatids. This finding contrasts with the two-step cohesion release mechanism of yeast that utilizes only Rec8 and factors like Mei-S332/Shogushin to protect centromeric Rec8 cohesin from degradation during anaphase I, thereby ensuring sister cohesion until anaphase II. Our findings not only reveal unanticipated features of meiosis in <italic>C. elegans</italic>, but also establish models of meiotic cohesin function applicable to gametogenesis in plants and mammals.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>COH-3 and COH-4 are bona fide subunits of meiotic cohesin complexes</title><p>During <italic>C. elegans</italic> meiosis, the α-kleisin paralogs REC-8 and COH-3/4 function in sister chromatid cohesion (SCC) but perform specialized functions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Severson et al., 2009</xref>), suggesting their participation in independent cohesin complexes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Severson et al., 2009</xref>).

These expectations were met (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B–D</xref>). Long tracks of COH-3/4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>) and SMC-3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chan et al., 2003</xref>) staining were evident on meiotic chromosomes of <italic>rec-8</italic> single mutants, and both REC-8 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>) and SMC-3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>) persisted on chromosomes of <italic>coh-4 coh-3</italic> mutants.

The disorganized localization and reduced staining intensity of REC-8 and SMC-3 reflect the failure to form continuous chromosomal axes. Loss of COH-3/4 binding also reduces SMC-3 levels. In contrast, SMC-3 was nearly undetectable on meiotic chromosomes of kleisin triple mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). In converse experiments, binding of REC-8 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>) and COH-3/4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>) to meiotic chromosomes was severely disrupted in <italic>smc-1(RNAi)</italic> animals, as was binding of SMC-3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>).

To our surprise, COH-3/4 cohesin behaves differently: COH-3/4 become detectable during meiotic prophase, after completion of premeiotic replication.</p><p>To determine the precise timing of REC-8 and COH-3/4 accumulation, we examined the staining of each kleisin during the different stages of germ-cell development. In <italic>C. elegans</italic>, changes in chromosomal morphology and nuclear position distinguish germ-cell nuclei undergoing mitotic proliferation or premeiotic DNA replication from nuclei in meiotic prophase I (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref>). Chromosomes are dispersed in premeiotic nuclei, which occupy the most distal region of the gonad. Upon initiation of meiosis, chromosomes cluster in a crescent on one side of the nucleus, opposite the nucleolus, in a region of the gonad called the transition zone (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18a">Francis et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44a">MacQueen and Villeneuve, 2001</xref>). Nuclei in this region are in the leptotene and zygotene stages of prophase I, when synaptonemal complexes (SCs) assemble between homologs. In leptotene, linear structures called axial elements (AEs) form along the length of meiotic chromosomes. In zygotene, central region (CR) proteins assemble between homologous AEs, tethering homologs along their lengths in a process called synapsis. Chromosomes remain clustered until pachytene, when the fully-synapsed homologs redistribute around the nuclear periphery.</p><p>As shown previously, we detected REC-8 in all germ-cell nuclei of the gonad, including premeiotic nuclei, consistent with SCC establishment in premeiotic S phase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Pasierbek et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Hayashi et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Severson et al., 2009</xref>). In contrast, COH-3/4 was not detected in premeiotic nuclei, but intense COH-3/4 staining appeared abruptly on meiotic chromosomal axes in the transition zone and persisted through prophase I, suggesting that COH-3/4 first accumulates at the onset of meiosis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C</xref>). Two additional lines of evidence supported this conclusion. First, COH-3/4 staining was not detected in nuclei that expressed PCNA, an S phase-specific DNA polymerase processivity factor used for mitotic and premeiotic DNA replication (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). Second, in animals carrying a <italic>glp-1</italic> gain-of-function allele that blocks the initiation of meiosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5a">Berry et al., 1997</xref>), REC-8, but not COH-3/4, was strongly expressed in the mitotically proliferating nuclei that filled the entire gonad (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1D</xref>). Thus, COH-3/4 associates with chromosomes after premeiotic S phase is complete, suggesting that COH-3/4 and REC-8 cohesins may load onto chromosomes and become cohesive by different mechanisms.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>The kleisin subunit determines the mechanism of cohesin loading</title><p>The cohesin loading factors identified to date, exemplified by the heterodimeric Scc2/Scc4 complex, are required for the loading of all cohesin complexes examined, regardless of subunit composition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Ciosk et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Gillespie and Hirano, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Takahashi et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Lightfoot et al., 2011</xref>).

Prior experiments showed that γ-irradiation restored CO recombination in <italic>spo-11</italic> mutants and suppressed lethality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Dernburg et al., 1998</xref>). In our experiments, 12 Gy of γ-irradiation triggered CO recombination between most homolog pairs of <italic>spo-11</italic> mutants without causing chromosomal fragmentation or fusion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>). That dose also restored SCC: sisters were tethered in 75% of irradiated <italic>spo-11 rec-8</italic> double mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1 fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplements 1 and 2</xref>). Thus, programmed meiotic DSBs are essential for COH-3/4-dependent SCC, and the kleisin subunit determines whether a cohesin requires DSBs to establish cohesion. Moreover, our data suggest that meiotic SCC is established in successive waves: during premeiotic DNA replication, the nascent sister chromatids are tethered by Watson-Crick base pairing in unreplicated regions and by REC-8 cohesin in replicated regions. Subsequently, DSBs trigger COH-3/4 cohesin to become cohesive during meiosis. This second wave of SCC establishment reinforces the cohesion generated during DNA replication. Evidence supporting this model is described in the following paragraphs.</p></sec><sec id="s2-6"><title>A conserved mechanism mediates DSB-induced SCC in yeast mitosis and worm meiosis</title><p>The essential role for DSBs in COH-3/4-dependent meiotic SCC suggested that the pathway for establishing SCC in response to DNA damage during yeast G2/M phase might similarly trigger COH-3/4-mediated SCC during nematode meiosis. In the yeast model for DSB-induced SCC (DI-SCC), DNA breaks activate the Mec1/ATR kinase. Mec1 in turn stimulates the Chk1 kinase to phosphorylate the mitotic kleisin Scc1 on serine 83, which triggers cohesin to become cohesive (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Heidinger-Pauli et al., 2008</xref>). Yeast Rec8 lacks the Chk kinase phosphorylation site and consequently cannot become cohesive in response to DNA damage. Thus, DI-SCC was thought to occur only during G2/M of the mitotic cell cycle.</p><p>To determine whether a similar signaling cascade occurs in <italic>C. elegans</italic> meiosis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>), we first asked whether ATM and the related kinase ATR (ATM-1 and ATL-1, respectively) are required for the COH-3/4-dependent SCC that tethers sisters in <italic>rec-8</italic> mutants.

The persistence of cohesion between some chromatids likely results from incomplete ATL-1 depletion.

We conclude that ATM-1 and ATL-1 are required to trigger the cohesiveness of COH-3/4 cohesin, but not REC-8 cohesin.</p><p>We next asked whether CHK-1 or the paralogous kinase CHK-2 is required for SCC establishment by COH-3/4 cohesin.

However, exposure of <italic>rec-8; chk-2</italic> mutants to the dose of γ-irradiation that restored SCC in <italic>spo-11 rec-8</italic> worms failed to restore SCC in <italic>rec-8; chk-2</italic> mutants.

Since SCC-1 is required for mitotic proliferation of germline precursors, we used RNAi to partially deplete SCC-1 in kleisin triple mutants, then scored SCC in pachytene nuclei. Although LacI::GFP revealed extensive aneuploidy in premeiotic and transition zone nuclei of these animals, likely due to defective SCC during mitotic proliferation of the germline stem cells, only one or two LacI::GFP foci were detected in pachytene nuclei (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A,B</xref>, data not shown), indicating that nuclei with abnormal chromosomal number had not yet progressed into pachytene.

Co-orientation occurs at the long arms to ensure that the two sister chromatids interact with microtubules from the same spindle pole, and SCC is maintained at the long arms until anaphase II to keep sisters together. Cohesion at the short arms holds homologs together, and SCC release at short arms in anaphase I triggers disjunction of homologous chromosomes. In other words, the CO site, not a centromere, defines a region of each homolog in which co-orientation is implemented and SCC persists until anaphase II (Reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Schvarzstein et al., 2010</xref>).<fig id="fig6" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.03467.017</object-id><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><title>CO recombination triggers removal of REC-8 and COH-3/4 cohesins from reciprocal domains in late prophase/prometaphase of meiosis I.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) In worms, CO position determines where SCC will be removed in anaphase I.

In prophase, cohesin complexes are removed from chromosome arms via the prophase pathway, a non-proteolytic pathway that involves phosphorylation by Polo and Aurora B kinases. At anaphase onset, cohesin is removed from centromeres by proteolysis of the kleisin by the cysteine protease separase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Buonomo et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Uhlmann et al., 2000</xref>). The timing of removal of REC-8 and COH-3/4 suggested that cohesin complexes are triggered to dissociate from chromosomes in prophase, independently of separase. Consistent with this, removal of REC-8 from the short arm did not require the worm separase homolog SEP-1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>) but did require the Aurora B kinase AIR-2, which accumulates at the short arm in late diakinesis, prior to the reduction of REC-8 in this region (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C,D</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Rogers et al., 2002</xref>). These data are consistent with removal of REC-8 cohesin from the short arm by a meiotic prophase pathway. Dissociation of COH-3/4 from the long arm was also independent of SEP-1. However, neither removal of COH-3/4 from the long arm nor maintenance of COH-3/4 at the short arm required AIR-2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D</xref>). These data are consistent with our finding that COH-3/4 begins to disappear from the long arm in diplotene, well before the accumulation of AIR-2 at the short arm. Thus, the kleisin determines not only when and where, but also how a cohesin complex is removed from chromosomes. Kleisin-specified cohesin removal in late prophase could promote the stepwise separation of homologs and sisters, a model consistent with the mutant phenotypes of <italic>rec-8</italic> single and <italic>coh-4 coh-3</italic> double mutants.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><sec id="s3-1"><title>Kleisin subunits specify meiotic cohesin function</title><p>We showed that multiple, functionally distinct cohesin complexes mediate sister chromatid cohesion during meiosis. The cohesins differ in their α-kleisin subunit, and the kleisin influences nearly all aspects of meiotic cohesin function: the mechanisms for loading cohesins onto chromosomes, for triggering DNA-bound cohesins to become cohesive, and for releasing cohesins in a temporal- and location-specific manner during prophase I. Our findings establish a new model for cohesin function in meiosis: the choreographed actions of multiple cohesins, endowed with specialized functions by their kleisins, underlie the stepwise separation of homologs and sisters essential for the reduction of genome copy number.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>DSB-induced tethering of sister chromatids is an essential feature of meiosis</title><p>Our work demonstrated a critical and unexpected role for DSBs in triggering meiotic SCC. The importance of DSBs in inducing SCC was shown previously only in proliferating yeast cells that suffered DNA damage during G2/M. Because Rec8 cohesin failed to establish DSB-induced cohesion when replacing Scc1 in mitotic cells, the DSBs used to initiate CO recombination during meiosis were presumed not to trigger SCC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Heidinger-Pauli et al., 2008</xref>). To the contrary, we found meiotic DSBs to be the essential trigger that induces COH-3/4 cohesin to tether sisters. Mutants deficient in SPO-11 failed to form DSBs and failed to generate COH-3/4–dependent cohesion unless subjected to ionizing radiation. Thus, DSB-induced SCC is an essential, conserved process that functions not only in proliferating yeast cells suffering DNA damage, but also in nematode germ cells undergoing normal gametogenesis.</p><p>Unexpectedly, although SCC was severely disrupted in diakinesis nuclei of <italic>spo-11 rec-8</italic> mutants, indicating that DSBs are essential for tethering sister chromatids, the sisters were together in most pachytene nuclei of <italic>spo-11 rec-8</italic> mutants, raising the question of whether DSBs are essential for establishing COH-3/4-mediated cohesion. Several lines of evidence demonstrate a requirement for DSBs in triggering COH-3/4-mediated SCC. First, COH-3/4 was not detected in PCNA-positive nuclei, suggesting that a replication-independent mechanism initiates the process by which COH-3/4 cohesin becomes cohesive. DSBs are the only known trigger for establishing SCC outside of S phase. Second, the AE protein HIM-3 can tether sisters in pachytene nuclei independently of REC-8 in both <italic>rec-8</italic> single and <italic>spo-11 rec-8</italic> double mutants, thereby obscuring the role of DSBs in establishing COH-3/4-mediated SCC. Third, synaptonemal complexes form between sisters in <italic>rec-8</italic> and <italic>spo-11 rec-8</italic> animals. Disrupting DSB formation in <italic>rec-8</italic> mutants lacking the SC central region protein SYP-1 (<italic>i.e., spo-11 rec-8; syp-1</italic> triple mutants) increased the frequency of sister separation in pachytene nuclei relative to that of <italic>rec-8; syp-1</italic> double mutants proficient in DSB formation. This result strengthens the view that DSBs are required to establish SCC, but the requirement is partially masked by sister linkages mediated by SC proteins. Finally, sister separation is greater in pachytene nuclei of <italic>rec-8</italic> mutants with a defective ATM/ATR signaling pathway than in <italic>rec-8</italic> mutants with a functional pathway.</p><p>In <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic>, DNA damage in G2/M activates ATM and Chk1 kinases, leading to Chk1-dependent phosphorylation of Scc1 on serine 83. Unphosphorylatable S83A mutants fail to establish DI-SCC, while phosphomimetic S83D mutants establish DI-SCC independently of Chk1, showing the importance of S83 phosphorylation in inducing cohesion in response to DNA damage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Heidinger-Pauli et al., 2009</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">2008</xref>). Yeast Rec8 lacks an equivalent Chk1 consensus site, explaining its failure to establish DI-SCC. SPO-11-dependent DSBs appear to activate a similar signaling cascade to trigger meiotic DI-SCC through COH-3/4 cohesin in <italic>C. elegans</italic>. This cascade requires ATM, ATR, and CHK-2 and likely culminates in kleisin phosphorylation. Because <italic>rec-8; chk-2</italic> mutants exhibited reduced COH-3/4 staining and complete failure to tether sisters, CHK-2 may function in regulating cohesin loading as well as in triggering sister linkages. To assess whether the loading and SCC establishment defects are separable, the predicted CHK kinase phosphosites in COH-3/4 are being changed to alanine. S81 and/or T82 in COH-3/4 are the most plausible sequence homologs of S83 in yeast Scc1, but COH-3 and COH-4 also have four sites with a perfect match to the Chk kinase consensus sequence that might serve as targets of CHK-2 phosphorylation required for SCC establishment by COH-3/4 cohesin.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Meiotic cohesin complexes function in cohesion-independent processes</title><p>The crucial role of DSBs in establishing COH-3/4-dependent cohesion allowed us to answer a longstanding question: does SC assembly require only the chromosomal binding of cohesin or also the conversion of bound cohesin into a cohesive state? The strikingly different SC assembly defects in mutants that retain COH-3/4 binding but lack both REC-8- and COH-3/4-mediated cohesion (<italic>spo-11 rec-8)</italic> compared to mutants that lack COH-3/4 binding as well as REC-8- and COH-3/4-dependent cohesion (<italic>rec-8; coh-4 coh-3</italic>) revealed the answer. Robust SC assembled along chromosomes of <italic>spo-11 rec-8</italic> mutants, between sister chromatids or non-homologous chromosomes, but SC assembly failed on chromosomes of kleisin triple mutants. Thus, SC assembly requires COH-3/4 binding but not its conversion to a cohesive state, revealing that cohesin functions in cohesion-independent processes. These data also demonstrated that SC assembly is more sensitive to disruption of COH-3/4 cohesin than REC-8 cohesin, since we observed severe SC structural defects in <italic>coh-4 coh-3</italic> double mutants but not in <italic>rec-8</italic> single mutants (See also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Severson et al., 2009</xref>). Thus, the kleisin determines the role of cohesins in synaptonemal complex (SC) assembly.</p></sec><sec id="s3-4"><title>REC-8 and COH-3/4-independent mechanisms can tether sister chromatids during early meiosis</title><p>It was previously believed that meiosis-specific cohesin complexes were both necessary and sufficient to establish and maintain the linkages that tether sisters during gametogenesis. Eliminating REC-8- and COH-3/4-dependent SCC enabled us to discover the participation of mitotic kleisins and axial proteins in chromosome tethering during meiosis. In diakinesis nuclei, REC-8 and COH-3/4 cohesins are indispensable for holding sister chromatids together. In contrast, although REC-8 and COH-3/4 are critical for establishing meiotic SCC, weak linkages can occur between sisters in pachytene nuclei of mutants lacking the three meiotic kleisins. These linkages are mediated by SCC-1 cohesin, previously believed to function only during mitosis.</p><p>SCC-1 associates with meiotic chromosomal axes in transition-zone and pachytene nuclei of wild-type animals, suggesting that SCC-1 has the capacity to mediate SCC during wild-type meiosis. However, the role of SCC-1 during wild-type meiosis is not easy to determine. No obvious meiotic phenotypes were detected following depletion of SCC-1 in wild-type animals (data not shown); but this analysis was limited by the need to use partial loss-of-function conditions due to the essential role of SCC-1 in mitotic proliferation of germline precursors.</p><p>Mitotic kleisins also associate with meiotic chromosomes of budding yeast and mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Klein et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Xu et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Ishiguro et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Lee and Hirano, 2011</xref>). The Rad54 paralog Tid1 is necessary to remove Scc1-dependent linkages from yeast meiotic chromosomes to facilitate normal chromosome segregation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Kateneva et al., 2005</xref>), indicating that Scc1 cohesin can tether sisters during meiosis. Meiotic roles for mammalian Rad21/Scc1 have not yet been defined. Nevertheless, the association of Scc1 orthologs with meiotic chromosomes of widely diverged species suggests they play important roles in gametogenesis.</p><p>Although SCC-1 can tether sisters in pachytene nuclei of <italic>rec-8; coh-4 coh-3</italic> mutants, SC proteins do not associate with meiotic chromosomes. Thus, unlike REC-8 and COH-3/4, SCC-1 appears unable to promote even partial SC assembly. These data demonstrate that establishment of cohesion between sisters is insufficient to promote the formation of SC, consistent with our finding that SC assembly requires chromosomally bound COH-3/4 cohesin, but not conversion of COH-3/4 cohesin into a cohesive state.</p><p>We also found that axial element (AE) proteins can mediate cohesin-independent linkages between sister chromatids when <italic>rec-8-</italic> and DSB-dependent cohesion fail to occur. That is, HIM-3 tethers sisters independently of cohesin in <italic>spo-11 rec-8</italic> mutants, which have chromosome-bound COH-3/4 that is not cohesive. The HIM-3-dependent linkages are not mediated by an SC-like structure, given that disrupting the CR protein SYP-1 only partially weakened SCC in <italic>spo-11 rec-8</italic> double mutants, while mutations in <italic>him-3</italic> severely abrogated SCC. HIM-3-dependent linkages between sisters may not be essential in animals with wild-type REC-8, because REC-8-dependent SCC established during premeiotic DNA replication is likely sufficient to tether sisters until anaphase II (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Severson et al., 2009</xref>). However, HIM-3-dependent linkages may prevent newly replicated sister chromatids from drifting apart in <italic>rec-8</italic> mutants before DSBs trigger COH-3/4 to become cohesive, thus explaining the severe SCC defects observed in <italic>him-3 rec-8</italic> double mutants with wild-type <italic>spo-11</italic>.</p><p>Single molecule experiments have shown that purified Hop1, a HORMA domain protein that is the yeast ortholog of HIM-3, HTP-3, and HTP-1/2, can mediate <italic>trans</italic> interactions that bridge linear double-stranded DNA molecules and promote their restructuring and compaction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Khan et al., 2012</xref>). These interactions were proposed to facilitate pairing or synapsis of homologous chromosomes, but our data suggest a different role: HORMA-domain AE proteins such as HIM-3 may directly tether sister chromatids independently of cohesin in wild-type animals, as we have shown for cohesion-defective mutants.</p><p>The mutant analysis described here reveals the unexpected molecular complexity of meiotic SCC and suggests that the linkages that tether sisters in the germline are not formed synchronously during DNA replication, as occurs during mitosis, but rather through the sequential action of proteins that bind to chromosomes at temporally distinct times and generate cohesion by different mechanisms. Our data support the following model. REC-8 cohesin mediates the first wave of SCC establishment. SCC-1 may function together with REC-8 during that process. Both REC-8 and SCC-1 are present in all premeiotic nuclei and likely bind to chromatids prior to premeiotic S phase and become cohesive during DNA replication, a pattern similar to that described for cohesin complexes in mitotically proliferating cells. HIM-3 may mediate a second wave of cohesion, but through a mechanism distinct from that of cohesin. HIM-3 is expressed and loads onto chromosomes in leptotene, at the onset of meiosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Zetka et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">MacQueen et al., 2002</xref>), and our data suggest that HIM-3 tethers sisters independently of REC-8 and COH-3/4 cohesin. More definitive evidence for the involvement of HIM-3 in mediating cohesion will require a separation-of-function allele that disrupts SCC but not SC assembly or crossover recombination. A final wave of SCC establishment is mediated by COH-3/4 cohesin, which loads onto chromosomes at the onset of meiosis but is not triggered to become cohesive until the formation of SPO-11-dependent DSBs during leptotene and/or zygotene. Sequential mutational analysis in kleisin-defective animals enabled us to strip away the layers of chromosome tethering that are mediated by mitotic kleisin SCC-1, axial protein HIM-3, and SC to uncover the central roles of DSBs, REC-8, and COH-3/4 in establishing SCC.</p><p>Our data also suggest that the removal of linkages between sisters occurs in stages. In diplotene (our unpublished data) and diakinesis nuclei, sisters are held together by REC-8 and COH-3/4 cohesin alone, indicating that the HIM-3 and SCC-1-dependent linkages we demonstrated in pachytene are transient and are removed during late pachytene or early diplotene. In contrast, SCC mediated by COH-3/4 and REC-8 persists until anaphase I and II, respectively (see below).</p></sec><sec id="s3-5"><title>A model for the role of distinct cohesin complexes in reducing genome copy number during meiosis</title><p>Prior to this study and our earlier demonstration that COH-3/4 and REC-8 mediate meiotic SCC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Severson et al., 2009</xref>), the triggering and release of meiotic cohesion were thought to depend entirely on Rec8 cohesin.

Any model of <italic>C. elegans</italic> meiotic chromosome segregation must incorporate not only the removal of REC-8 cohesin by separase, but also the separase-dependent removal of COH-3/4 cohesin and the role of separase-independent cohesin removal that occurs in late prophase.</p><p>Our finding that different mechanisms trigger separase-independent removal of REC-8 from short arms and COH-3/4 from long arms indicates that AIR-2 is not the sole factor to direct the stepwise separation of homologs and sisters. REC-8 persists at high levels at the long arm but becomes markedly reduced and often undetectable at the short arm (our work and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">de Carvalho et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Rogers et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Harper et al., 2011</xref>). Removal of REC-8 from the short arm begins in late diakinesis or prometaphase and requires AIR-2. In contrast, COH-3/4 cohesin is removed from the long arm of wild-type animals beginning in diplotene, prior to AIR-2 accumulation at the midbivalent and coincident with the removal of SC from the long arm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Nabeshima et al., 2005</xref>). Both removal of COH-3/4 from the long arm and persistence of COH-3/4 at the short arm are independent of AIR-2 function. The factors that restrict COH-3/4 cohesin to the short arm are not known, but could include HTP-1/2, LAB-1, and PP1; however, if these factors regulate the distribution of COH-3/4 cohesin, they must do so in parallel with their regulation of AIR-2.</p><p>We propose two models for how separase-independent cohesin removal in prophase could promote the separation of homologs before sisters in <italic>C. elegans</italic>. In the first model, REC-8 cohesin is eliminated from the short arm by an AIR-2-dependent mechanism that is independent of kleisin proteolysis, allowing homolog disjunction at anaphase I to be triggered by separase-dependent cleavage of COH-3/4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7E</xref>). The separase-independent partitioning of REC-8 and COH-3/4 cohesins into reciprocal domains could explain why factors like Mei-S332/Shugoshin, which protect centromeric cohesin from separase-mediated cleavage during anaphase I in monocentric organisms, are not required in <italic>C. elegans</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">de Carvalho et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Severson et al., 2009</xref>).</p><p>In the second model, selective removal of REC-8 from the short arm does not determine the timing of separation for homologs vs sisters, but rather restricts co-orientation to the long arm. Once homologs have made proper attachments to microtubules and aligned on the metaphase plate, separase-dependent cleavage of COH-3/4 and any REC-8 remaining at the short arm would allow homologs to segregate toward opposite poles. Because REC-8 and COH-3/4 are both required for CO recombination, and hence the formation of bivalents with differentiated long and short arms, a direct test of these models will require versions of REC-8 and COH-3 or COH-4 that can be removed from chromosomes after COs have formed.</p></sec><sec id="s3-6"><title>A new model for meiotic cohesin function in higher eukaryotes</title><p>Our work reveals the unexpected degree to which kleisin variants influence virtually all facets of meiotic cohesin function. It establishes a new model for cohesin function during gametogenesis in higher eukaryotes. The orchestrated actions of multiple cohesins, endowed with specialized functions by their kleisins, reduce genome copy number to produce haploid gametes. The kleisin determines the mechanisms by which cohesin loads onto meiotic chromosomes, establishes SCC, and is removed from chromosomes prior to proteolytic cleavage by separase at anaphase I. Plants and mammals require similar sets of meiotic kleisins as those in <italic>C. elegans</italic>, demonstrating the widely conserved involvement of multiple kleisins in gametogenesis and highlighting the importance of understanding the mechanisms by which kleisins influence cohesin function. Our work represents a major stride toward achieving that goal.</p><p>The phenotypes of kleisin-deficient mice and the published localization patterns of mammalian kleisins suggest that the models established for <italic>C. elegans</italic> will apply to mammals. For example, as in <italic>C. elegans</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Severson et al., 2009</xref>), SC proteins in mice assemble between sister chromatids in <italic>Rec8</italic> single mutants but not in <italic>Rad21L Rec8</italic> double kleisin mutants, demonstrating the involvement of multiple kleisins in SC assembly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Llano et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Ishiguro et al., 2014</xref>). Moreover, the idea that factors other than known meiosis-specific cohesin complexes contribute to SCC during spermatogenesis is suggested by the persistence of partial cohesion in meiotic nuclei of mouse <italic>Rad21L Rec8</italic> double mutants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Llano et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Ishiguro et al., 2014</xref>). The mitotic kleisin RAD21 appears to associate with meiotic chromosomes of both wild-type and <italic>Rad21L Rec8</italic> mutants, suggesting that ‘mitotic’ cohesin might tether sisters during gametogenesis in mammals, as in worms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Prieto et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Parra et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Xu et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Ishiguro et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Lee and Hirano, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Llano et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>The published data for mice are also consistent with our findings that the kleisin determines the mechanisms of cohesin loading and SCC establishment. High levels of REC8 were detected in premeiotic mouse nuclei, consistent with REC8 cohesin becoming cohesive during DNA replication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Eijpe et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Ishiguro et al., 2014</xref>). In contrast, RAD21L staining was faint in PCNA-positive premeiotic testicular cells but greatly increased on meiotic chromosomes during leptotene and zygotene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Herran et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Lee and Hirano, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Ishiguro et al., 2014</xref>), indicating that substantial amounts of RAD21L cohesin load after meiotic entry. Thus, different mechanisms may promote the premeiotic loading of REC8 cohesin and the post-replicative loading of RAD21L cohesin, a model consistent with a role for programmed meiotic DSBs in triggering replication-independent SCC establishment by RAD21L cohesin.</p><p>Indeed, a <italic>Spo11</italic> disruption exacerbated the SCC defects of <italic>Rec8</italic> knockout mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Ishiguro et al., 2014</xref>). However, the partial sister separation observed in <italic>Spo11 Rec8</italic> double mutants could have resulted from defective SC assembly rather than a failure to establish DSB-induced SCC, since DSBs promote formation of SC between homologs of wild-type animals and between sister chromatids of <italic>Rec8</italic> mutant mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Romanienko and Camerini-Otero, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Xu et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Ishiguro et al., 2014</xref>). On the other hand, while DSBs may be critical for RAD21L cohesin to establish SCC, the sisters may have remained tethered in <italic>Spo11 Rec8</italic> mutants by RAD21 cohesin, thereby obscuring the essential role of DI-SCC. Thus, establishing whether DSBs are essential for mammalian meiosis will require an assessment of whether AE and/or SC CR proteins can tether sisters in mice, as they do in worms, and whether RAD21 cohesin contributes to meiotic SCC.</p><p>Finally, studies hint that the kleisin subunit of mammalian cohesin complexes may determine whether a complex will be removed during late prophase I via a separase-independent mechanism. Although REC8 persists at high levels at centromeres and chromosome arms until anaphase I in mouse spermatocytes and oocytes, RAD21L and RAD21 proteins progressively diminish in abundance during late prophase at chromosome arms of spermatocytes and at arms and centromeres of oocytes.

This crossing scheme allows self progeny of the hermaphrodite to be identified by the absence of GFP::LacI staining, ensuring that all examples of two GFP foci in the same nucleus resulted from defective SCC establishment in <italic>syIs44</italic> heterozygotes rather than a recombination defect in <italic>syIs44</italic> homozygotes. For quantification of distances between sister chromatids, Z-stacks of 1024 × 1024 pixel, unbinned images were acquired at 0.2 µm axial spacing on a Deltavision microscope (Applied Precision, Issaquah, WA) equipped with a 100x/1.4 NA objective lens. The X, Y, and Z positions of GFP foci were marked by hand in ImageJ and the distance between spots calculated by the three dimensional generalization of the Pythagorean theorem. Distances were measured in the −1 and −2 oocyte and in mid and late pachytene nuclei. For the analyses presented here, data were combined into ‘diakinesis’ and ‘pachytene’ datasets. In synapsis-defective mutants, distances were measured in nuclei that occupied similar positions in the gonad as mid and late pachytene nuclei in wild-type animals.
