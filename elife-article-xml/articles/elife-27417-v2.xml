Meiosis requires transient removal of the outer kinetochore, the complex that connects microtubules to chromosomes. How the meiotic gene expression program temporally restricts kinetochore function is unknown. We discovered that in budding yeast, kinetochore inactivation occurs by reducing the abundance of a limiting subunit, Ndc80. Furthermore, we uncovered an integrated mechanism that acts at the transcriptional and translational level to repress <italic>NDC80</italic> expression. Central to this mechanism is the developmentally controlled transcription of an alternate <italic>NDC80</italic> mRNA isoform, which itself cannot produce protein due to regulatory upstream ORFs in its extended 5’ leader. Instead, transcription of this isoform represses the canonical <italic>NDC80</italic> mRNA expression in <italic>cis</italic>, thereby inhibiting Ndc80 protein synthesis. This model of gene regulation raises the intriguing notion that transcription of an mRNA, despite carrying a canonical coding sequence, can directly cause gene repression.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.27417.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>DNA stores the genetic information needed to make proteins and other molecules inside cells. To make a protein, cells use a particular section of DNA as a template to make molecules of messenger RNA (or mRNA for short), which are then translated into the corresponding protein.</p><p>Inside yeast, humans and other eukaryotic organisms, DNA is organized into structures called chromosomes. When these cells divide to make sex cells, such as egg cells and sperm, they undergo a process known as meiosis to make four daughter cells with only half as many chromosomes as the parent cell. During meiosis the parent cell’s chromosomes need to be separated twice in quick succession. Large assemblies of proteins known as kinetochores are essential for this process. At the beginning of meiosis the kinetochores are inactive, which prevents the chromosomes from being separated too soon. Later on, the kinetochores are activated to allow the chromosomes to be separated. In budding yeast cells, control of kinetochore activity is achieved by regulating the levels of a single protein within the kinetochore known as Ndc80. It was not clear, however, how this regulation occurs.</p><p>Chen, Tresenrider et al. show that two yeast mRNAs with opposing activities are the key to regulating when Ndc80 is produced during meiosis. These two mRNAs carry the same protein-coding message but one mRNA is longer and contains an extension that prevents it from being translated into protein. The sole role of the longer mRNA is to prevent the shorter mRNA from being produced. The longer mRNA is only made in early meiosis, which prevents new Ndc80 proteins from being made during this time and results in the kinetochores being inactivated. The chromosomes only separate when production of the shorter mRNA returns later in meiosis and higher levels of Ndc80 protein allow the kinetochores to reform.</p><p>These findings demonstrate that even if an mRNA molecule does carry protein-coding information, it may not actually act as a messenger to make that protein, but instead, it can serve a regulatory role by blocking that protein’s production. The key components involved in regulating Ndc80 during meiosis are found in many organisms ranging from yeast to humans, suggesting that similar mechanisms could be used to control proteins involved in other processes in cells.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>meiosis</kwd><kwd>kinetochore</kwd><kwd>gene regulation</kwd><kwd>uORF translation</kwd><kwd>budding yeast</kwd><kwd>transcription</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>S. cerevisiae</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000912</institution-id><institution>March of Dimes Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>5-FY15-99</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Unal</surname><given-names>Elcin</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000875</institution-id><institution>Pew Charitable Trusts</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>00027344</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Unal</surname><given-names>Elcin</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100001642</institution-id><institution>Glenn Foundation for Medical Research</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Unal</surname><given-names>Elcin</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100010438</institution-id><institution>Francis Crick Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>van Werven</surname><given-names>Folkert Jacobus</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000001</institution-id><institution>National Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Chen</surname><given-names>Jingxun</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001348</institution-id><institution>Agency for Science, Technology and Research</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Chia</surname><given-names>Minghao</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund7"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100001021</institution-id><institution>Damon Runyon Cancer Research Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>35-15</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Unal</surname><given-names>Elcin</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Rather than being a protein coding unit, an mRNA molecule can serve a purely regulatory function to inhibit protein synthesis of its corresponding gene.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Cellular differentiation programs depend on temporally controlled waves of gene activation and inactivation.

Differentiation models ranging from <italic>Bacillus subtilis</italic> sporulation to mouse embryogenesis have elucidated how transcription factor handoffs temporally activate the expression of gene clusters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Errington, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Zernicka-Goetz et al., 2009</xref>). In comparison, much less is understood about how gene repression is coordinated with the transcription factor-driven waves of gene expression and how this inactivation is mechanistically achieved.</p><p>One critical morphogenetic event that relies on inactivation is the loss of kinetochore function during meiotic prophase. The kinetochore is a protein complex that binds to centromeric DNA and serves as the attachment site for spindle microtubules to mediate chromosome segregation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Musacchio and Desai, 2017</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). In multiple systems, it has been shown that kinetochores do not bind to microtubules in meiotic prophase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Asakawa et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Kim et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Meyer et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Miller et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Sun et al., 2011</xref>). Furthermore, this temporal inactivation is achieved through removal of the outer kinetochore, the site where microtubule attachments occur (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Asakawa et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Kim et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Meyer et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Miller et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Sun et al., 2011</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>).

Importantly, the kinetochore is reactivated when the outer kinetochore reassembles upon transition from prophase to the meiotic divisions.

Entry into meiosis marks a clear cell-fate transition defined by the induction of Ime1, a master transcription factor. Ime1 activates the expression of genes involved in DNA replication and meiotic recombination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Kassir et al., 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">van Werven and Amon, 2011</xref>). Successful completion of recombination, in turn, induces a second transcription factor Ndt80, which activates the expression of genes involved in meiotic divisions and gamete development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Chu and Herskowitz, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Xu et al., 1995</xref>). Thus, the landmark morphogenetic events in budding yeast meiosis are coordinated by the relay between these two transcription factors. Furthermore, a high-resolution map of the gene expression waves that drive meiosis has been generated for budding yeast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Brar et al., 2012</xref>). Importantly, analysis of this dataset revealed that, of the 38 genes that encode kinetochore subunits, <italic>NDC80</italic> displays the most regulated expression pattern between meiotic prophase and the subsequent division phases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Miller et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>Ndc80 is the namesake member of an evolutionarily conserved complex that forms the microtubule-binding interface of the outer kinetochore (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Tooley and Stukenberg, 2011</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Numerous lines of evidence indicate that the tight regulation of <italic>NDC80</italic> is essential for the timely function of kinetochores during meiosis. First, the decline of Ndc80 protein in meiotic prophase correlates with the dissociation of the outer kinetochore from the chromosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Kim et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Meyer et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Miller et al., 2012</xref>). Second, even though the other outer kinetochore subunits are expressed in meiotic prophase, they do not localize to the kinetochores (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Meyer et al., 2015</xref>). Third, the subsequent increase in Ndc80 protein coincides with outer kinetochore reassembly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Meyer et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Miller et al., 2012</xref>). Finally, in the presence of a spindle, prophase misexpression of <italic>NDC80</italic> disrupts proper meiotic chromosome segregation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Miller et al., 2012</xref>). Together, these results indicate that <italic>NDC80</italic> regulation is necessary for the proper timing of kinetochore function in meiosis and highlight the importance of controlling Ndc80 protein levels during meiotic differentiation.</p><p>Here we uncovered how the timely function of kinetochores is achieved through the regulation of Ndc80 protein synthesis during budding yeast meiosis. This mechanism is based on the use of two <italic>NDC80</italic> mRNA isoforms, which have opposite functions and display distinct patterns of expression. In addition to the canonical protein-translating <italic>NDC80</italic> mRNA, we found that meiotic cells also expressed a 5’-extended <italic>NDC80</italic> isoform. Despite carrying the entire <italic>NDC80</italic> open reading frame (ORF), this alternate isoform cannot produce Ndc80 protein due to the presence of regulatory upstream ORFs (uORFs) in its extended 5’ leader. Rather, its transcription plays a repressive role to inhibit transcription of the canonical <italic>NDC80</italic> mRNA in <italic>cis</italic> and thereby inhibit Ndc80 protein synthesis. Furthermore, we found that the expression of the 5’-extended isoform was activated by the meiotic initiator transcription factor Ime1. Upon exit from prophase, the mid-meiotic transcription factor Ndt80 activated the expression of the canonical <italic>NDC80</italic> mRNA isoform. Taken together, this study uncovers how <italic>NDC80</italic> gene repression is achieved and how inactivation and subsequent reactivation of the kinetochore is coordinated with the transcription factor-driven waves of meiotic gene expression.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Ndc80 is the limiting component for kinetochore function in meiotic prophase</title><p>The Ndc80 complex consists of four subunits, namely Ndc80, Nuf2, Spc24, and Spc25 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). All the subunits other than Ndc80 persist in meiotic prophase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Meyer et al., 2015</xref>). Consistent with this report, we found that even in an extended meiotic prophase arrest, Ndc80 was the only subunit of its complex whose abundance decreased at this meiotic stage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>).

To test this prediction, we overexpressed each of the Ndc80 complex subunits (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>), in conjunction with the B-type cyclin Clb3, under an inducible <italic>CUP1</italic> promoter (<italic>pCUP</italic>). <italic>CLB3</italic> misexpression causes bipolar spindle assembly in meiotic prophase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Miller et al., 2012</xref>). In <italic>pCUP-CLB3</italic> cells, if kinetochores are functional in meiotic prophase, they attach to the spindle microtubules prematurely. These premature attachments, in turn, cause sister chromatid segregation in meiosis I, essentially disrupting proper meiotic chromosome segregation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Miller et al., 2012</xref>). When <italic>NDC80</italic> was overexpressed in <italic>pCUP-CLB3</italic> cells during meiotic prophase, over 30% of the cells displayed an abnormal segregation pattern in meiosis I. In contrast, misexpression of <italic>CLB3</italic> alone resulted in only a 7% segregation defect. Importantly, this defect was not further enhanced by the overexpression of <italic>NUF2</italic>, <italic>SPC24</italic> or <italic>SPC25</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). Based on this observation, we conclude that kinetochore function is repressed in meiotic prophase due to limiting levels of Ndc80. Following prophase, Ndc80 becomes highly abundant during the meiotic divisions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Miller et al., 2012</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1C</xref>, 10 h time point), consistent with its role in facilitating chromosome segregation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Wigge and Kilmartin, 2001</xref>). Together, these results demonstrate that Ndc80 is the sole subunit of its complex that is tightly regulated during meiotic differentiation and strongly support the notion that <italic>NDC80</italic> downregulation and re-synthesis govern kinetochore functionality in meiosis.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Two distinct <italic>NDC80</italic> transcript isoforms exist in meiosis</title><p>To dissect the molecular mechanism for the strict temporal regulation of the <italic>NDC80</italic> gene in meiosis, we first took advantage of the high-resolution RNA-seq and ribosome profiling dataset generated for budding yeast meiosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Brar et al., 2012</xref>).

However, in cells undergoing synchronous meiosis, two distinct <italic>NDC80</italic> transcript isoforms became evident: a longer, meiosis-specific isoform, and a shorter isoform that was also present under non-meiotic conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>). The longer isoform appeared after meiotic entry, persisted throughout meiotic prophase and gradually disappeared during the meiotic divisions. The shorter isoform was present in vegetative cells prior to meiotic entry, but was weakly expressed during S phase and meiotic prophase. Its abundance dramatically increased during the meiotic divisions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplements 2B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">3</xref>).

Furthermore, we confirmed that the number of cells analyzed per sample per experimental repeat (&gt;95 cells) exceeded the minimal number of cells required to achieve a stable sampling average (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s5">Figure 2—figure supplement 5</xref>), and thus our sample size is large enough to reflect the population mean.</p><p>To differentiate between the two <italic>NDC80</italic> isoforms, we used another two sets of probes: one set (Q 670), conjugated to Quasar 670, is complementary to the sequences common between the short and the long isoforms. The other set (CF 590), conjugated to CAL Fluor Red 590, is unique to the long isoform. The long isoforms were identified as the spots where the signal from both probe sets colocalized, whereas the short isoforms were identified as the spots with signal only from Q 670 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C and D</xref>).</p><p>The smFISH analysis revealed that the expression of the two <italic>NDC80</italic> isoforms was temporally regulated. Vegetative cells expressed only the short <italic>NDC80</italic> isoform; fewer than 2% of these cells expressed the long isoform (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C and D</xref>). In meiotic prophase, a stage defined by the presence of the synaptonemal complex component Zip1, 100% of cells expressed the long isoform, and over 50% of them had more than 20 transcripts per cell. During the same stage, the level of the short isoform significantly decreased in comparison to its levels in vegetative growth (p=0.0260, two-tailed Wilcoxon Rank Sum test, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>) and pre-meiotic starvation (p=0.0090, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s6">Figure 2—figure supplement 6</xref>).

In the absence of Ime1, Ume6 represses early meiotic genes in mitosis by binding to a consensus site called the upstream repressive sequence (URS1) in the promoters of these genes. Upon meiotic entry and subsequent interaction with Ime1, the Ume6-Ime1 complex activates the transcription of these early meiotic genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bowdish et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Park et al., 1992</xref>).

This transient inactivation is achieved by the removal of the outer kinetochore from chromosomes and has been described in organisms ranging from yeast to mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Asakawa et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Kim et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Meyer et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Miller et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Sun et al., 2011</xref>). In budding yeast, we found that outer kinetochore removal is mediated by limiting the abundance of a single subunit, Ndc80. Ndc80 is the only member of its complex whose protein abundance is essentially absent in meiotic prophase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Meyer et al., 2015</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). Furthermore, prophase overexpression of <italic>NDC80</italic>, but none of the other Ndc80 complex subunits, promotes premature spindle attachments and causes meiotic chromosome segregation errors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). Thus, in the case of the meiotic kinetochore, the cell regulates the activity of a multi-protein complex by limiting the availability of a single subunit.</p><p>The control of protein complex activity through the limitation of a key subunit is a more general principle. A genome-wide study that analyzed the composition of protein complexes during the cell cycle revealed that in budding yeast, most protein complexes have both constitutively and periodically expressed subunits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">de Lichtenberg et al., 2005</xref>). It is proposed that due to the periodically expressed subunits, these protein complexes assemble &quot;just-in-time&quot; to restrict their function to specific cell cycle stages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">de Lichtenberg et al., 2005</xref>). The luti-mRNA-dependent regulatory circuit described here may more broadly address how regulated subunits are provided &quot;just-in-time&quot; and, importantly, at no other time.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title><italic>NDC80<sup>luti</sup></italic> is an mRNA that does not produce protein</title><p>A key aspect of the work presented here is the surprising finding that an mRNA can serve a purely regulatory function. Indeed, <italic>NDC80<sup>luti</sup></italic> is a bona fide mRNA. It is poly-adenylated, is engaged by the ribosome and, most importantly, when the uORF start codons are ablated, Ndc80 protein is translated from this extended mRNA isoform (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Brar et al., 2012</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). Moreover, <italic>NDC80<sup>luti</sup></italic> is likely a RNA Polymerase II transcript because its promoter is occupied by the pre-initiation complex member Sua7 (TFIIB) and because Pol II-associated chromatin marks are detected downstream of the <italic>NDC80<sup>luti</sup></italic> promoter when this transcript is made (Chia et al., accompanying manuscript). <italic>NDC80<sup>luti</sup></italic> cannot be decoded by the ribosome due to the presence of AUG-uORFs contained in its extended 5’leader. By competitively engaging the ribosome, these uORFs prevent translation of Ndc80 protein. The polypeptides that the uORFs encode are unlikely to play a role in the repression of kinetochore function as the uORFs can be minimized to 2-codon units while maintaining <italic>NDC80<sup>luti</sup>-</italic>based repression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). Interestingly, upstream AUG codons are also present in the putative <italic>NDC80<sup>luti</sup></italic> mRNAs predicted from the other fungal species. Three regions were enriched for the presence of such AUGs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9s1">Figure 9—figure supplements 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9s2">2</xref>), but the sequences and the length of these putative uORFs did not seem to be conserved (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1G</xref>). This observation is consistent with the idea that the act of uORF translation, rather than the identity of the uORF peptides, serves as a conserved feature in evolution.</p><p>The repressive nature of the uORFs contained in <italic>NDC80<sup>luti</sup></italic> mirrors those found in the uORF-containing prototype transcript, <italic>GCN4</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Mueller and Hinnebusch, 1986</xref>). However, in the case of <italic>GCN4</italic>, changes in nutrient availability can relieve the uORF-mediated translational repression, whereas for <italic>NDC80<sup>luti</sup></italic>, the uORF-mediated repression appears to be constitutive. In both cases, <italic>GCN4</italic> and <italic>NDC80</italic> can exist in on and off states. For <italic>GCN4</italic>, this switch is manifested in the two translational states of the same mRNA molecule. For <italic>NDC80</italic>, the switch is manifested instead by two distinct transcripts, one, which results in protein synthesis and one, which represses protein synthesis. It is important to note that for other potential luti-mRNAs, the precise mechanism of translational repression may not be conserved and could instead involve other means such as RNA hairpins or binding sites for translational repressors.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>The function of <italic>NDC80<sup>luti</sup></italic> mRNA is purely regulatory</title><p>Why do meiotic cells express an mRNA that does not encode any functional polypeptides?

Multiple lines of evidence support this model. First, disruption of <italic>NDC80<sup>luti</sup></italic> expression in meiosis results in elevated levels of <italic>NDC80<sup>ORF</sup></italic> and Ndc80 protein in meiotic prophase, leading to premature kinetochore activation (this study and Chia et al., accompanying manuscript).

Indeed, efficient and timely reduction of Ndc80 protein levels may require regulated proteolytic mechanisms not yet elucidated. Further studies are necessary to determine if proteolysis plays a role in the rapid removal of the outer kinetochore in meiotic prophase and if so, by what means this proteolysis is achieved.</p></sec><sec id="s3-4"><title>Transcription factor-driven gene repression by luti-mRNA: an evolutionary perspective</title><p>Why do budding yeast cells use this seemingly complex mechanism, which relies on the transcription of an undecoded mRNA isoform, to repress a kinetochore gene during meiosis? We would argue from an evolutionary point of view that this solution could be both economical and highly flexible. First, the meiotic cell is co-opting two existing transcription factors, Ime1 and Ndt80, for roles in activating <italic>and</italic> repressing gene expression, obviating the need to evolve novel trans-acting factors. This mechanism also ensures temporal coordination of gene activation <italic>and</italic> inactivation using the same transcription factor. In the case of <italic>NDC80</italic>, the luti-mRNA rides the Ime1 wave of gene expression to shutoff kinetochore function while the protein-coding mRNA rides the subsequent Ndt80 wave to reactivate the kinetochore for the division phases. While transcription factors have previously been implicated in the repression of downstream promoters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bird et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Martens et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Shearwin et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">van Werven et al., 2012</xref>), our study is the first clear demonstration that it is the choice of promoter and the identity of the resulting mRNA isoform that governs whether a gene is turned on or turned off by a given transcription factor.</p><p>This mode of gene repression relies on two sets of <italic>cis</italic>-regulatory sequences, which are evolutionarily flexible (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Carroll, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Stern and Orgogozo, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Wittkopp and Kalay, 2011</xref>). The first <italic>cis</italic>-acting sequence is the distal transcription factor-binding site, which induces transcription of <italic>NDC80<sup>luti</sup></italic>, and, in concert with co-transcriptional chromatin modifications, silences the downstream canonical promoter activity. The second <italic>cis</italic>-acting sequence is the AUG-uORFs within the extended 5’ leader of the luti-mRNA, which prevents downstream ORF translation. Inherent to a mechanism that is so heavily reliant on <italic>cis</italic>-regulatory elements is the notion that minor changes in the DNA sequence can impact gene expression at a multitude of levels, thus tuning gene output. This tuning can be manifested at the level of nucleosome spacing, strength of transcription factor binding and translational regulation. Therefore, the cell has a vast evolutionary space, which can be explored through small changes in DNA sequence.</p></sec><sec id="s3-5"><title>Pervasiveness of luti-mRNA biology in yeast meiosis and beyond</title><p>The defining sequence features of the <italic>NDC80</italic> luti-mRNA are a 5’-extended mRNA leader coupled with repressive uORFs contained in this extended leader. Analysis of the mRNA-seq and ribosome profiling datasets of meiotic yeast revealed hundreds of transcripts with potential luti-like signatures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Brar et al., 2012</xref>). In support of this idea, two other genes, <italic>ORC1</italic> and <italic>BOI1</italic>, have been shown to express meiosis-specific transcript isoforms with uORF-containing leader extensions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Xie et al., 2016</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Liu et al., 2015</xref>). Rather than dissecting each candidate luti-mRNA on a case by case basis, future studies that integrate additional genome-wide datasets to measure stage-specific transcription factor binding sites, transcription-coupled chromatin modification states, mRNA translation status with isoform specificity and protein abundance would result in a high-confidence map of luti-mRNAs and aid in the dissection of their cellular functions.</p><p>Beyond budding yeast meiosis, can the regulatory circuit described in our study be present in other developmental programs and in other organisms? We would argue so, because various organisms also possess the three principles of this module, namely, alternative promoter usage, transcription-coupled repression, and uORF-mediated translational repression. Alternative promoter usage is widespread in development and among different cell types. For example, in the fruit fly, more than 40% of developmentally expressed genes have at least two promoters with distinct regulatory programs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Batut et al., 2013</xref>). Half of human genes have more than one promoter, resulting in the expression of mRNA isoforms with 5’ heterogeneity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kimura et al., 2006</xref>). Furthermore, transcription-based interference mechanisms, as well as transcription-coupled histone modifications, have been described in a variety of organisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Corbin and Maniatis, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Eissenberg and Shilatifard, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Shearwin et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Wagner and Carpenter, 2012</xref>). Finally, recent studies have shown that uORF translation is much more widespread than traditionally believed and acts in a regulatory manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Calvo et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Chew et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Johnstone et al., 2016</xref>). Therefore, we envision that the regulatory circuit described here can be used as a roadmap in future studies to uncover transcription-coupled gene repression during cell fate transitions across multiple species.</p></sec><sec id="s3-6"><title>Interpreting genome-wide data in the context of luti-mRNA biology</title><p>A key implication of this model of gene regulation is a blurring of the line between &quot;coding&quot; and &quot;non-coding&quot; RNAs. Seminal work has uncovered multiple classes of non-coding RNAs that play regulatory functions in the cell, such as long non-coding RNAs, microRNAs, small interfering RNAs, and piwiRNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Ambros, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Batista and Chang, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Cech and Steitz, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Guttman et al., 2009</xref>). Our study demonstrates that mRNAs, which are deemed protein coding units, can themselves be direct regulators of gene expression by at least two simultaneous means: they can induce transcription-coupled silencing of a downstream promoter, and features in their 5’ leaders, such as the presence of uORFs or secondary structures, could directly impact translation efficiency in a positive or negative manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Arribere and Gilbert, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Brar et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Rojas-Duran and Gilbert, 2012</xref>). Notably, multiple studies have reported poor correlation between mRNA and protein abundance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Maier et al., 2009</xref>). For those mRNAs that anti-correlate with their protein levels, this apparent contradiction might be due to a luti-mRNA being misattributed as a canonical protein-coding transcript. Our study could dramatically transform the way we understand the function of alternate mRNA isoforms and aid in the proper biological interpretation of genome-wide transcription studies.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Yeast strains and plasmids</title><p>All the strains used in this study are described in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1A</xref> and are derivatives of SK1.

Images were acquired as described in the fluorescence microscopy method section, and analysed using the FIJI image processing software (RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/SCR_002285">SCR_002285</ext-link>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Schindelin et al., 2012</xref>). First, maximum-intensity projection was performed. Second, projected spindle length (defined as the distance between Spc42-mCherry foci) was measured using the &quot;measure&quot; plugin. The distribution of the projected spindle length was graphed as violin plots using (BoxPLotR RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/SCR_015629">SCR_015629</ext-link>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Spitzer et al., 2014</xref>). Third, in cells with separated spindle poles, the status of the Spc42-mCherry association with CENV-GFP dots was categorized as 1) each Spc42-mCherry focus is associated with a CENV-GFP dot, 2) only one Spc42-mCherry focus is associated with CENV-GFP dots (either one or both of the GFP dots), or 3) neither Spc42-mCherry focus is associated with a CENV-GFP dot. After categorizing the localization of the CENV-GFP dots, the projected spindle length was measured for spindles in category 2 and 3, and the spindle length distributions were graphed as violin plots using (BoxPLotR RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/SCR_015629">SCR_015629</ext-link>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Spitzer et al., 2014</xref>). Finally, in cells with separated spindle poles, the location of the spindle was recorded as 1) in the mother, 2) across the bud neck, or 3) in the bud. The percentage of spindles that were both less than 2.0 μm and abnormally localized (across the bud neck or in the bud) was calculated. For each analysis, 100 cells were counted.</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>Indirect immunofluorescence</title><p>Tubulin indirect immunofluorescence was performed as described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kilmartin and Adams, 1984</xref>) using a rat anti-tubulin antibody (MCA78G, <italic>Bio-rad Antibodies, Kidlington, UK</italic>) at a dilution of 1:200 and a pre-absorbed anti-rat FITC antibody (712-095-153, <italic>Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, Inc. West Grove, PA</italic>) at a dilution of 1:200. The meiotic stage of a cell was determined based on its spindle and DAPI morphologies. Metaphase I spindles were defined as a short bipolar spindle spanning a single DAPI mass; an anaphase I spindle was defined as a single elongated spindle spanning two DAPI masses; a pair of metaphase II spindles were defined as two short bipolar spindles each spanning a distinct DAPI mass within a single cell; and finally, a pair of anaphase II spindles was defined as two elongated spindles with 4 DAPI masses within a single cell. To image spindle samples for characterization of spindle length, z stacks (8–10 slices) were acquired with a step size of 0.5 μm using the DeltaVision microscope (<italic>GE Healthcare</italic>) described in the fluorescence microscopy section. To measure the projected spindle length, maximum-intensity projection of these images was generated by FIJI (RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/SCR_002285">SCR_002285</ext-link>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Schindelin et al., 2012</xref>). Next, the projected spindle length (defined as the spindle pole-to-pole distance) was measured using the &quot;measure&quot; plugin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Schindelin et al., 2012</xref>), and cells were staged to be in either meiosis I or meiosis II depending on the number of bipolar spindles. For cells undergoing meiosis II, both spindles were quantified, but only the longer of the two was reported. For each time point, the percentage of cells in each category was quantified: 1) meiosis I spindles that were less than 2 μm, 2) meiosis I spindles that were over 2 μm, 3) meiosis II spindles that were less than 2 μm, and 4) meiosis II spindles that were over 2 μm. Over 100 cells per time point were quantified.</p></sec><sec id="s4-10"><title>Northern blotting</title><p>A previously described northern blot protocol was modified as below (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Koster et al., 2014</xref>). RNA was extracted with acid phenol:chloroform:isoamyl alcohol (125:24:1; pH 4.7) and then isopropanol precipitated. RNA samples (8–10 µg) were denatured in a glyoxal/DMSO mix (1 M deionized glyoxal, 50% v/v DMSO, 10 mM sodium phosphate buffer pH 6.5–6.8) at 70°C for 10 min and then separated on a 1.1% agarose gel for 3 hr at 80 V. RNAs were transferred onto nylon membranes overnight by capillary transfer. The membranes were blocked for at least 3 hr at 42°C in ULTRAhyb Ultrasensitive Hybridization Buffer (<italic>Thermo Fisher</italic>) before hybridization. Radioactive probes were synthesized using a Prime-It II Random Primer Labelling Kit (<italic>Agilent, Santa Clara, CA</italic>).

For all the images, the LUT (lookup table) was inverted. Then, a rectangular box was drawn around a band of interest. The mean signal intensity (gray-scale) within the box area was calculated using the &quot;measure&quot; plugin. For background subtraction, the same box was moved directly above and below the band, the signal intensity of these two regions was measured, and the average background intensity (top and bottom) was calculated. After subtracting the average background intensity of a given lane from the signal intensity of the band in that lane, this corrected value for each time point was then normalized to the initial time point. The same-sized box was used for all the time points in one experiment.</p></sec><sec id="s4-11"><title>Single-molecule RNA FISH</title><p>Single-molecule RNA FISH was performed as described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Raj et al., 2008</xref>) with modifications. All the probes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1E</xref> for probe sequences) were designed, synthesized, and labelled by Stellaris (<italic>Biosearch Technologies, Novato, CA</italic>). The unique region of <italic>NDC80<sup>luti</sup></italic> was targeted by twenty 20-mer oligonucleotide probes coupled to CAL Fluor Red 590. Thirty 20-mer probes, coupled to Quasar 670 dye, were targeted to the coding region of <italic>NDC80.</italic> To measure our detection quality, 54 alternating probes (odd and even probes, 27 probes in each set) were designed to target the common region of <italic>NDC80<sup>luti</sup></italic> and <italic>NDC80<sup>ORF</sup></italic>, and coupled with Quasar 670 dye and CAL Fluor Red 590 dye, respectively.</p><p>For meiosis experiments, cells were sporulated as described above. To fix cells, 160 μL of 37% formaldehyde was added into 1840 μL of meiotic cultures and incubated at room temperature for 20 min with gentle agitation. The fixed samples were moved to 4°C to continue fixing overnight. For vegetative samples, cells were grown in YPD to an OD<sub>600</sub> of 0.4–0.6, fixed in formaldehyde at room temperature for 20 min, and then prepared for digestion as below.</p><p>Cells were washed three times in 1.5 mL cold Buffer B (0.1 M potassium phosphate [pH 7.5], 1.2 M sorbitol) and resuspended in 425 μl digestion buffer (425 μL Buffer B mixed with 40 μL 200 mM Vanadyl ribonucleoside complex (VRC) (<italic>NEB</italic>) with 50 μg of zymolyse (zymolase 100T, <italic>MP Biomedicals, Santa Ana, CA</italic>). Cells were digested at 30°C until approximately 70% of cells were digested. This took about 15–20 min for early meiotic and vegetative samples and 30–35 min for pachytene and post meiotic prophase samples. Digested cells were gently washed with 1 mL of cold Buffer B and resuspended in 1 mL of 70% EtOH for 3.5–5 hr to allow permeabilization. To prepare for hybridization, cells were first incubated in 1 mL of 10% formamide wash buffer (10% formamide, 2X SSC) at room temperature for at least 15 min. For hybridization, each probe set (to a final concentration of 500 nM) and 20 mM VRC were added to hybridization buffer (1% Dextran sulfate (<italic>EMD Millipore, Billerica, MA</italic>), 1 mg/mL <italic>E</italic>. coli tRNA (<italic>Sigma</italic>), 2 mM VRC, 0.2 mg/mL BSA, 1X SSC, 10% formamide (<italic>Thermo Fisher</italic>) in nuclease-free water). Hybridization was performed overnight at 30°C with gentle agitation. Samples were then incubated in the dark for 30 min at 30°C in 1 mL of 10% formamide wash buffer, the buffer was then washed away, cells were stained with DAPI, and resuspended in 50 μL of glucose-oxygen-scavenging buffer (GLOX buffer (10 mM Tris [pH 8.0], 2x SSC, 0.4% glucose)) solution without enzymes. Prior to imaging, 15 μL of GLOX solution with enzyme (1% v/v catalase, 1% v/v glucose oxidase (<italic>Sigma</italic>), 2 mM Trolox (<italic>Sigma</italic>)) was added to the sample. Images were acquired with the DeltaVision microscope (<italic>GE Healthcare</italic>) as described in the fluorescence microscopy section with two additional filters: TRITC (EX542/27, EM597/45) for CAL Fluor Red 590 and CY5 (EX632/22, EM679/34) for Quasar 670. Series of z-stacks (15–25 slices) were acquired with a step size of 0.2 μm.</p><p>To quantify FISH spots, maximum-intensity projection of the z-stacks was first generated in (RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/SCR_002285">SCR_002285</ext-link>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Schindelin et al., 2012</xref>), different channels were split, and these processed images were analysed with custom software written in Matlab (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">McSwiggen, 2017</xref>)(<italic>Mathworks</italic>, <italic>Sunnyvale, CA</italic>). Cell boundaries were hand-drawn. The spot detection code first filtered the raw images using an eight pixel Gaussian kernel to remove background signal. Diffraction-limited spots corresponding to single mRNA were detected using an adaptation of the MTT spot-detection algorithm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Sergé et al., 2008</xref>), using the following detection parameters: NA: 1.4; detection box: 5 pixels; error rate: 0.1; deflation loops: 0. With these detection settings, many low-intensity fluctuations in background fluorescence were detected as spots. To identify bona fide mRNA molecules, we plotted the signal (defined as the integrated value of the pixel intensities) against the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR; defined as the signal divided by the variance of the pixel values around the detected spot), identified a population of detections that were well separated from the background detections, and chose these signal and SNR values as thresholds. To confirm these threshold choices, we plotted the number of spots detected as a function of the threshold chosen, and found that these thresholds fell within a ‘plateau’, as others have described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Senecal et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Raj et al., 2006</xref>), where an increase in the choice of threshold has little effect on the total number of mRNA detected. Inspection of detected mRNAs, post-threshold, was in good agreement with spots that were manually counted. Once chosen, the same &quot;signal&quot; and &quot;SNR&quot; thresholds were applied to all the images within a replicate. In general, we found that thresholds between replicates varied only slightly (For CF 590 probes, signal = 1100–1500 and SNR = 2.5–3; for Q670 probes, signal = 1000–2000 and SNR = 2–3).</p><p>After detection, spots between the CF 590 and Q 670 probe sets need to be paired to identify <italic>NDC80<sup>luti</sup></italic> and <italic>NDC80<sup>ORF</sup></italic> transcripts. Pairing was done using the <italic>knnsearch</italic> Matlab function to separately identify the closest CF 590 spot for each detected Q 670 spot, and vice versa. Two spots are only considered paired if they are mutual nearest neighbors. Using this as a criterion for pairing, greater than 95% of spot pairs occurred within 2 pixels of each other, which is well within the expected value given any chromatic and detection artifacts between the two color channels. By comparison, fewer than 10% of unpaired spots had nearest neighbor distance of less than four pixels, showing that the probability of misidentifying a spot pair is low. The number of cells with a given number of <italic>NDC80<sup>luti</sup></italic> or <italic>NDC80<sup>ORF</sup></italic> transcripts per cell was graphed as relative frequency histograms. The largest bin of each histogram was normalized to the same length across all the histograms.</p></sec><sec id="s4-12"><title>Statistical analysis of smFISH data</title><p>Per-cell statistics of paired spots (<italic>NDC80<sup>luti</sup></italic> mRNA), Q 670-only spots (<italic>NDC80<sup>ORF</sup></italic>), and CF 590-only spots (false positives, early terminated transcripts, and degradation products) were collected and pooled between biological replicates. First, to determine whether sufficient data had been collected for a given data set, bootstrap analysis of the data was performed. For 500 iterations, statistics from a single cell was randomly sampled from the data, and the mean and variance calculated. This process was repeated for two cells randomly selected from the data, without replacement; then for three cells randomly selected, etc. until one half of the total data set size was reached. A plot of the mean and standard deviation of paired and unpaired spots shows that the mean is stable and that the change in the variance plateaus at a number far below the number of cells assayed, suggesting that our sample size is sufficiently large (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s5">Figure 2—figure supplement 5</xref>). For each sample, over 95 cells were counted and three independent experiments were performed. Thus, for each data set, we could ensure that enough cells were measured to accurately account for the biological variation intrinsic to the data set. To compare across different strains and conditions, the two-tailed non-parametric Wilcoxon Rank Sum test was applied to the pooled data obtained from three independent experimental repeats. The p-value was determined using the <italic>ranksum</italic> function in Matlab (<italic>Mathworks</italic>).</p><p>Explanation about <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6H</xref>: Based on our smFISH statistical analysis, the <italic>NDC80<sup>ORF</sup></italic> transcript level in the <italic>urs1∆</italic> cells did not differ significantly from that of wild type cells, even though there was a clear difference in the northern blot analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6I</xref>). We consider the possibility that our smFISH quantification method has a technical limitation when the <italic>NDC80<sup>luti</sup></italic> isoform is highly expressed. Since we identified <italic>NDC80<sup>ORF</sup></italic> based on the presence of the Q 670 signal (both transcripts) and the absence of CF 590 signal (<italic>NDC80<sup>luti</sup></italic> unique probes), a missed localization in the CF 590 channel would cause us to over-estimate the number of <italic>NDC80<sup>ORF</sup></italic>. In our control experiments using alternating probes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s4">Figure 2—figure supplement 4</xref>), we measured that ~ 6% of the Q 670 spots lack colocalizing signal from the CF 590 channel. In conditions where the <italic>NDC80<sup>luti</sup></italic> isoform is expressed to the high level observed in wild type meiotic prophase, we expect to miss ~1 CF 590 spot per cell, which would then be interpreted as an extra <italic>NDC80<sup>ORF</sup></italic> molecule. Since the total number of <italic>NDC80<sup>luti</sup></italic> transcripts between wild type and the <italic>urs1∆</italic> mutant was quite different during meiotic prophase (the median of <italic>NDC80<sup>luti</sup></italic> transcripts is 15 in wild type, that of <italic>urs1∆</italic> is merely 5, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6H</xref>), the number of mRNA being mis-classified as <italic>NDC80<sup>ORF</sup></italic> mRNA would also be higher in wild type cells, due to a missed signal from the CF 590 channel. Therefore, it is possible that we over-estimated the number of <italic>NDC80<sup>ORF</sup></italic> mRNA in the wild type strain. Given these limitations, we propose that the difference in transcript levels between the wild type and <italic>urs1∆</italic> mutant is too subtle to be detected by our smFISH analysis.</p></sec><sec id="s4-13"><title>Spot growth assay</title><p>Cells were grown on YPG (2% glycerol + YEP) plates overnight, resuspended in milliQ H<sub>2</sub>O, and then diluted to an OD<sub>600</sub> of 0.2. 5-fold serial dilutions were performed, and cells were spotted onto YEP-RG plates with or without supplement of 1 μM β-estradiol.

Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Jessica Tyler as the Senior Editor.

Previous work showed that proper control of meiosis requires temporary removal of the outer kinetochore during early stages of meiosis (prophase). In this study, the authors demonstrate that Ndc80 is the limiting outer kinetochore component, whose levels decrease in prophase and increase in meiosis I. The authors uncover a regulatory mechanism controlling Ndc80 levels in which expression of Ndc80 is inhibited by a long, 5'-extended isoform (termed &quot;luti&quot;) of the <italic>NDC80</italic> mRNA that is expressed antagonistically with the coding isoform. Translation of the luti mRNA is inhibited by 9 uORFs. Removing all uORF AUG codons relieved repression of <italic>NDC80</italic> mRNA translation consistent with the notion that the upstream AUG codons capture scanning ribosomes to prevent main ORF translation. Inserting stop codons did not affect regulation, indicating that translation in the leader (and not the encoded peptides of the upstream ORFs) is sufficient to block main ORF translation. Additional experiments establish details of the differential regulation of luti vs. <italic>NDC80</italic> mRNA by Ime1 and Ndt80. Interestingly, the 5' regulatory region of luti can be transferred to a different gene and cause that gene to be down-regulated in prophase. Furthermore, up-regulation of <italic>NDC80<sup>luti</sup></italic> significantly inhibits growth of mitotic cells and causes defects in chromosome segregation.</p><p>Overall, this is a very comprehensive and high quality study that addresses an interesting mode of gene regulation. At this point, the field has numerous examples of <italic>cis</italic>-acting noncoding RNAs regulating the expression of a neighboring gene, first shown for the <italic>SER3</italic> gene in yeast involving a non-coding upstream RNA. What makes this study significant is the interesting link to a critical step in meiosis combined with the switch in promoter utilization, which relies on the temporal involvement of two transcriptional regulators of meiotic genes. Also of note is the finding that the luti mRNA is translationally inactive due to uORFs in the leader, a theme that the authors extend in the Discussion. The conclusions in this paper are supported by convincing data, often acquired through complementary approaches, and a carefully written document.</p><p>The analysis is very extensive and the supporting data are comprehensive. There are however a few instances in which an important control was lacking, or quantification of results from replicate experiments should be added to bolster the conclusions. Statistical analysis of data from replicates is frequently lacking.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>: verify by western analysis that overexpression of Nuf2, Spc24, and Spc25 has actually occurred.</p><p>2) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>: analyze an unregulated mRNA as loading control, as the nuclease-resistant Pol I rRNA transcript is not the best control for establishing equal recovery of unstable Pol II mRNA transcripts.

Also, where do these deletions map with respect to the 5' end of the luti mRNA? It would be valuable for the authors to include a supplemental figure that shows the nucleotide sequence for the 5' region of the <italic>NDC80</italic> gene. It would be helpful to highlight the nine AUG codons and show the predicted peptide sequence of the respective ORFs. Also, it would be helpful to highlight the MSE element and URS1 on this sequence and to denote the mutations used to alter the AUG codons and to introduce the stop codons. Relatedly, do any of the mutations impact the MSE? While the simplest model is that translation of the uORFs prevents downstream translation, if a mutation disrupted the MSE more complex models could be imagined.</p><p>9) Are the upstream AUG codons in the longer <italic>NDC80<sup>luti</sup></italic> mRNA conserved through evolution? Is the presence of these precise AUG codons conserved in other fungal species? If not, do all fungi have additional AUG codons in the putative longer <italic>NDC80</italic> mRNAs? If these elements are not conserved in closely related species, the possibility of alternate mechanisms controlling the translation of the long <italic>NDC80</italic> mRNA could be considered.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.27417.038</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>: verify by western analysis that overexpression of Nuf2, Spc24, and Spc25 has actually occurred.</p></disp-quote><p>We have now verified the overexpression of Ndc80, Nuf2, Spc24, and Spc25 by western blot analysis.

However, this turns out to be a very difficult task for meiosis experiments, since the gene expression pattern is highly dynamic with more than ⅔ of genes undergoing more than 10-fold change in expression (Brar et al., 2012). Upon quantitative analysis of a published mRNA-seq dataset from a dense meiotic time course (Brar et al., 2012), we have been unable to find any Pol II transcripts that remain constant throughout meiosis. The analysis was performed as follows: For each gene, we calculated the deviation of the RPKM value for a given time point from the mean RPKM value across all meiotic time points. We then used a sliding window to determine whether the RPKM value for a given time point is within the desired range when compared to the mean (% change over mean RPKM). When the interval was set to 40%, there were only 22 genes that fulfill this criterion. All of these genes were expressed at low levels (max RPKM= 168, mean RPKM= 71). Among these genes, we tested the 6 with the highest mRNA abundance: <italic>NPL6, MSB3, TSC10, COQ5, YMR31</italic> and <italic>GRX5</italic>. We were only able to detect two of them by Northern, though the data quality was poor due to weak expression.</p><fig id="respfig1"><label>Author response image 1.</label><graphic mime-subtype="jpeg" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-27417-resp-fig1-v2"/></fig><p>Next we tested four abundant genes (max RPKM = 7589, mean RPKM= 2617) that differ less than four fold across all time points: <italic>PFY1, ZEO1, CIT1</italic> and <italic>SEC17</italic>. Among these genes, <italic>CIT1</italic> was the most reasonable candidate as a Pol II loading control, in terms of its size and consistency. However, <italic>CIT1</italic> transcript still shows a noticeable variability, especially during the early time points (0-3h) and therefore cannot be used as a reliable loading control during these stages. It is also worth noting that the rRNA quality seems to be a reasonable estimate for the mRNA quality, since in the samples where we detect reduced or no signal with <italic>rRNA</italic>, the corresponding Pol ll transcript displays a very similar trend.</p><fig id="respfig2"><label>Author response image 2.</label><graphic mime-subtype="jpeg" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-27417-resp-fig2-v2"/></fig><p>As an alternative loading control for the northern blots, we used a Pol III transcript, <italic>SCR1</italic>, the RNA subunit of the signal recognition particle. Although not a Pol II transcript, <italic>SCR1</italic> is less abundant than the rRNA and therefore can be detected in a more quantitative manner using radioactivity. In addition, it has been previously used as a loading control for meiosis (Frenk et al., 2014). Together, we think that this is the best possible loading control to use, in addition to rRNA, during a process in which very few, if any, Pol II transcribed mRNAs are expressed at a consistent level. In the experiments where thegels were run for a longer time, we used <italic>CIT1</italic> as a loading control instead of <italic>SCR1</italic> due to the larger molecular weight of <italic>CIT1</italic>.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Also for this figure, at early times in prophase, fairly high levels of Ndc80p are present, yet the primary transcript is clearly the luti mRNA.

We do think that the pool of Ndc80 protein in early meiosis is persisting from pre-meiotic conditions. Upon entry to meiotic prophase, Ndc80 is degraded through a regulated process.

Deletion of this region results in high steady-state level of Ndc80 protein in meiotic prophase, but does not disrupt the luti-mRNA mediated repression.</p><p>c) Meiotic depletion of Aurora B kinase (Ipl1 in budding yeast) leads to high steady-state level of Ndc80 (Meyer et al., 2015), but does not alter the luti-mRNA mediated repression.</p><p>We are currently dissecting the mechanism of this post-translational regulation further for a follow-up manuscript under preparation.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Subsection “Two distinct NDC80 transcript isoforms exist in meiosis”, last paragraph: provide statistical support that this decrease in the short form is significant.

For <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>, we hybridized these blots with a <italic>CIT1</italic> probe. However, these membranes are rather old and the data we collected for <italic>CIT1</italic> were not of publication quality.

We consider the possibility that our smFISH quantification method has a technical limitation when the <italic>NDC80<sup>luti</sup> </italic>isoform is highly expressed. Since we identified <italic>NDC80<sup>ORF</sup></italic> based on the presence of the Q 670 signal (both transcripts) and the absence of CF 590 signal (<italic>NDC80<sup>luti</sup></italic> unique probes), a missed localization in the CF 590 channel would cause us to over-estimate the number of <italic>NDC80<sup>ORF</sup></italic>transcripts. In our control experiments using alternating probes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s5">Figure 2—figure supplement 5</xref>), we measured that ~6% of the Q 670 spots lack colocalizing signal from the CF 590 channel. In conditions where the <italic>NDC80<sup>luti</sup></italic> isoform is highly expressed, such as wild-type meiotic prophase, we expect to miss ~1 CF 590 spot per cell, which would then be interpreted as an extra <italic>NDC80<sup>ORF</sup> </italic>molecule. During meiotic prophase, the number of <italic>NDC80<sup>luti</sup></italic> transcripts in wild-type is higher in comparison to that of the <italic>urs1∆</italic> mutant cells (the median of <italic>NDC80<sup>luti</sup></italic> transcripts is 15 in wild-type, that of <italic>urs1∆</italic> is merely 5, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6H</xref>), therefore the number of mRNA molecules being mis-classified as <italic>NDC80<sup>ORF</sup></italic> would also be higher in wild-type cells. Thus, it is possible that we have over-estimated the number of <italic>NDC80<sup>ORF</sup></italic> transcripts in the wild-type strain. Given these limitations, we consider that the difference in the transcript level between the wildtype and <italic>urs1∆</italic> mutant is too subtle to be detected by our smFISH analysis.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>8) The promoter deletions remove large sections of the region upstream of the luti 5'-end. What information was used to guide the construction of these deletions? Is the region conserved between fungal species beyond the Ume6 and Ndt80 binding sites shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>? While some of this information comes up in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>, the authors should justify their choice of promoter deletions in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref> by showing conservation of this region and highlighting putative transcription factor binding sites and core promoter elements. Also, where do these deletions map with respect to the 5' end of the luti mRNA? It would be valuable for the authors to include a supplemental figure that shows the nucleotide sequence for the 5' region of the NDC80 gene. It would be helpful to highlight the nine AUG codons and show the predicted peptide sequence of the respective ORFs. Also, it would be helpful to highlight the MSE element and URS1 on this sequence and to denote the mutations used to alter the AUG codons and to introduce the stop codons. Relatedly, do any of the mutations impact the MSE? While the simplest model is that translation of the uORFs prevents downstream translation, if a mutation disrupted the MSE more complex models could be imagined.</p></disp-quote><p>To address the reviewers’ comments, we have generated two annotated nucleotide sequence files:</p><p>a) 5’ region of the <italic>S. cerevisiae NDC80</italic> gene along with the engineered mutations used in this study (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>).</p><p>b) Clustal alignment of the 5’ intergenic regions from five fungal species (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9s1">Figure 9—figure supplement 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9s2">2</xref>), as well as a table listing all the predicted peptide sequence for each uORF in each fungal species (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1G</xref>). These files include all the information requested by the reviewers.</p><p>We identified the region required for <italic>NDC80<sup>luti</sup></italic> mRNA expression empirically by systematically replacing different segments of the <italic>NDC80</italic> upstream intergenic region with a selectable marker: 1) ∆-600 to -300, 2) ∆-600 to -400, and 3) ∆-600 to -500. We chose these three deletions based on our conservation analysis of the Ume6 and Ndt80 binding sites. In these deletion constructs, we removed the predicted Ume6 binding site, but retain the Ndt80 binding site intact (See <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>). There are a few conserved regions based on the Clustal alignment, which may correspond to the core promoter and/or transcription factor binding sites. We currently don’t have further information about the specific identity of these regions. We corrected the text and figures and replaced “<italic>NDC80<sup>luti</sup></italic> promoter deletion (∆p<italic>NDC80<sup>luti</sup></italic>)” with “<italic>NDC80<sup>luti</sup></italic> deletion (∆<italic>NDC80<sup>luti</sup></italic>)” to more accurately describe the genotypic changes in the strains.</p><p>We don’t think that the <italic>∆9AUG</italic> and the <italic>mini uORF</italic> mutations affect the MSE site. They are also unlikely to regulate the Ndc80 protein levels through a mechanism that depends on the Ndt80 transcription factor. Our reasoning is as follows:</p><p>a) In both the <italic>∆9AUG</italic> mutant and the <italic>mini uORF</italic> mutants, both <italic>NDC80<sup>ORF</sup></italic> mRNA and Ndc80 protein levels increase between 5.5 hr to 6.5 hr time points, which correspond to the timing of <italic>NDT80</italic> expression and activity (See <xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig6">Author response image 6</xref> for a full time course of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). This suggests that the Ndt80-dependent wave of <italic>NDC80<sup>ORF</sup></italic> mRNA and Ndc80 protein induction is unaltered in the <italic>∆9AUG</italic> and <italic>mini uORF</italic> mutant, consistent with a functional MSE sites in these mutants.</p><fig id="respfig6"><label>Author response image 6.</label><graphic mime-subtype="jpeg" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-27417-resp-fig6-v2"/></fig><p>a) The <italic>∆9AUG</italic> mutant is unlikely to cause a high steady-state level of Ndc80 protein during meiotic prophase, in an <italic>NDT80</italic>-dependent manner. First, the expression and activity of Ndt80 protein is subject to the meiotic recombination checkpoint, which inhibits Ndt80 function until exit from meiotic prophase. Therefore, during the time when the Ndc80 protein levels are elevated in the <italic>∆9AUG</italic> mutant, Ndt80 is not expected to induce its target mRNAs, including <italic>NDC80<sup>ORF</sup></italic>. Second, in the strains where the promoter of <italic>NDT80</italic> is replaced with <italic>pGAL</italic> promoter, Ndt80 is not expressed prior to <italic>pGAL</italic> induction by estradiol. In this case, even when Ndt80 is not expressed, high steady-state level of Ndc80 protein is still observed in the <italic>∆9AUG</italic> strain (See <xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig7">Author response image 7</xref> for a time course comparing wild-type and <italic>∆9AUG</italic> in the absence of Ndt80 induction), suggesting that the Ndt80 transcription factor is not responsible for the elevated Ndc80 protein levels observed in the <italic>∆9AUG</italic> strain.</p><fig id="respfig7"><label>Author response image 7.</label><caption><title>Wild-type (UB3380) versus <italic>∆9AUG</italic> (UB3683) cells were arrested in pachytene using the <italic>pGAL-NDT80GAL4-ER</italic> system.</title><p>Cells were transferred to SPO at 0 hour.

Combined with the observation that <italic>NDC80<sup>luti</sup></italic> is the predominant transcript isoform in this stage, these data are most consistent with the interpretation that the long <italic>NDC80</italic> mRNA isoform is translated into Ndc80 protein in the absence of the AUG uORFs in its 5’ leader.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>9) Are the upstream AUG codons in the longer <italic>NDC80<sup>luti</sup></italic> mRNA conserved through evolution? Is the presence of these precise AUG codons conserved in other fungal species? If not, do all fungi have additional AUG codons in the putative longer NDC80 mRNAs? If these elements are not conserved in closely related species, the possibility of alternate mechanisms controlling the translation of the long NDC80 mRNA could be considered.</p></disp-quote><p>All five fungal species that we examined have at least 5 upstream AUG codons in the leader sequence of the putative <italic>NDC80<sup>luti</sup></italic> mRNA (defined as the intergenic region at least 50 bps downstream of the predicted URS1 site up to the ORF translation start site). The exact number and locations of these AUG codons are not conserved, although three regions appear to be enriched for the presence of upstream AUGs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9s1">Figure 9—figure supplement 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9s2">2</xref>). Given that the <italic>∆6AUG</italic> mutant can readily repress the coding ability of <italic>NDC80<sup>luti</sup></italic>, we consider that it only takes a few upstream AUGs to generate an un-decoded <italic>NDC80<sup>luti</sup></italic>. The range of the upstream AUG codons (at least 5) among the five fungal species falls within this possibility. In addition, the sequences and the length of these uORFs also do not seem to be conserved (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1G</xref>), consistent with the idea that the regulatory role of these uORFs come from the act of uORF translation, rather than the identity of the uORF peptides themselves. We have now discussed the results of this uORFs conservation analysis in our Discussion.</p></body></sub-article></article>
