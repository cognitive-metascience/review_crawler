Spinal cord stimulation (SCS) is a promising intervention for FoG in patients with PD, however, its effects on distinct domains of postural control is not well known. The aim of this study is to assess the effects of SCS on FoG and distinct domains of postural control. Four patients with FoG were implanted with SCS systems in the upper thoracic spine. Anticipatory postural adjustment (APA), reactive postural responses, gait and FoG were biomechanically assessed. In general, the results showed that SCS improved FoG and APA. However, SCS failed to improve reactive postural responses. SCS seems to influence cortical motor circuits, involving the supplementary motor area. On the other hand, reactive posture control to external perturbation that mainly relies on neuronal circuitries involving the brainstem and spinal cord, is less influenced by SCS.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>gait analysis</kwd><kwd>parkinsonism</kwd><kwd>postural instability and gait disorders (PIGD)</kwd><kwd>balance</kwd><kwd>neuromodulation</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100003593</institution-id><institution>Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Científico e Tecnológico</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>302628</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Teixeira</surname><given-names>Luis Augusto</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001807</institution-id><institution>Fundação de Amparo à Pesquisa do Estado de São Paulo</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>20265–3</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Teixeira</surname><given-names>Luis Augusto</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>University of São Paolo</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Fonoff</surname><given-names>Erich Talamoni</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>High-frequency stimulation of the upper thoracic spinal cord corrects anticipatory postural adjustments and improving gait efficiency and inhibiting freezing of gait episodes in advanced Parkinson's disease.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Postural instability and gait disorders (PIGD) are debilitating phenomena that frequently impair locomotion and can significantly affect the quality of life in Parkinson’s disease (PD) patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Perez-Lloret et al., 2014</xref>). PIGD is the most common cause of falls, which are associated with increase in morbimortality in PD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bloem et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Delval et al., 2014</xref>). Freezing of gait (FoG) is described as brief and episodic absence or marked reduction of the anterior progression of the feet, despite the intention to walk (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Giladi and Nieuwboer, 2008</xref>). While taking a step forward in unsupported biped position, the body weight is shifted toward the supporting leg. Normal gait requires an exact coordination of postural adjustment in advance of each step forward, namely anticipatory postural adjustment (APA) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">de Lima-Pardini et al., 2017</xref>). During imminent FoG episodes, the intention to walk is uncoupled from the triggering of APA, with consequent failure of the forward movement. This often results in knee trembling and failure to initiate gait. In PD, FoG episodes are associated with deficient APA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Mancini et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Schlenstedt et al., 2018</xref>). Physiological evidence, functional imaging and clinical-pathological studies suggest that FoG is mainly associated with disorders of frontal cortical regions (e.g. supplementary motor area - SMA) that comprise a known brain circuitry dedicated to APA control (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">de Lima-Pardini et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Jacobs et al., 2009a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bolzoni et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>The occurrence of FoG is highly influenced by attention, environmental triggers and dopaminergic drugs, suggesting the existence of complex mechanisms involving brainstem locomotor networks, the basal ganglia and cortical regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Jacobs et al., 2009a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Deecke, 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Coelho and Teixeira, 2017</xref>). On the other hand, automatic balance control seems to be mediated mainly by brainstem circuits, being less sensitive to attentional and environmental disturbances (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Horak and Diener, 1994</xref>).</p><p>Since the first experimental report from Fuentes <italic>et al.</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Fuentes et al., 2009</xref>) showing that SCS could enhance locomotion in PD models in mice, and more recently in primates by possibly shifting the brain pathological oscillatory activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Santana et al., 2014</xref>), SCS began to figure as a possible treatment for FoG in PD. Increasing evidence suggests that spinal cord stimulation (SCS) improves treatment-resistant postural and gait disorders in patients with PD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">de Andrade et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Nishioka and Nakajima, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Yadav and Nicolelis, 2017</xref>). In primates, SCS increases neuronal firing of the primary motor cortex, and decreases pathological cortico-striatal synchronous low-frequency waves showing that SCS does influence the oscillatory activity in brain motor circuits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Fuentes et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bentley et al., 2016</xref>). In fact, SCS may disrupt the aberrant inhibition of the globus pallidus internus onto thalamus and SMA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Brudzynski et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Takakusaki, 2017</xref>). As part of the circuit that controls APA, the SMA has cortifugal projections to pedunculopontine nuclei (PPN), a region particularly involved in gait initiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Takakusaki, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Aravamuthan et al., 2009</xref>). Since the activity of SMA, globus pallidus and PPN are impaired in patients with FoG (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Snijders et al., 2016</xref>), SCS would be able to modulate this circuit and improve APA and gait initiation. Recently, our group reported positive effects of high-frequency SCS (300 Hz) on gait, improving the performance in various gait tests, which were reproduced during double-blinded assessments. Also, continuous SCS chronically reduced FoG episodes, improved unified Parkinson's disease rating scale (UPDRS)-III motor scale scores and of self-reported quality of life (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Pinto de Souza et al., 2017</xref>). These results are in line with previous clinical observations and findings recorded in Parkinsonian animal models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Fuentes et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Santana et al., 2014</xref>). Overall, these preliminary results (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Pinto de Souza et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Landi et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Agari and Date, 2012</xref>) suggest that SCS may be a promising approach to attenuate gait disabilities generated by FoG. However, the mechanisms by which SCS affects FoG in PD patients remain unknown. So far, it has been shown that SCS can improve FoG in advanced stages of PD patients; however, the effects of SCS over APA and reactive balance control measurements in patients with PD with PIGD are still unknown. We hypothesize that SCS improves PIGD in patients with PD by improving balance. To test this hypothesis, we studied APA and reactive control of posture and balance using instrumental analysis.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>During 300 Hz-SCS, all participants showed significant decrease of APA duration compared to OFF (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>) (p=0.042).

In the present study, data showed that SCS at 300 Hz was effective in reducing the duration of APA and reducing the time of FoG. Conversely, we observed that SCS at 60 Hz failed to improve gait and APA. Corroborating clinical results, there was no significant improvement in FoG in the present study, neither in our preliminary report when 60 Hz-SCS was applied (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Pinto de Souza et al., 2017</xref>). Unexpectedly, two patients did not experience any FoG episodes during laboratory examination, even when SCS was OFF for a period longer than their carry-over effect lasted. Being the FoG an episodic phenomenon, even severe patients may not exhibit FoG in the laboratory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Nutt et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Giladi et al., 2000</xref>). Conversely, the time of FoG was reduced in the other 2 subjects during 300 Hz SCS. In the previous report, we showed that all subjects did experience frequent FoG episodes and were responsive to 300 Hz SCS in the outpatient clinic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Pinto de Souza et al., 2017</xref>). Nonetheless, our findings suggest that SCS at 300 Hz is more effective than SCS at 60 Hz (both with pulse width at 90 μs and amplitudes at 105% of sensory threshold) in improving FoG and correcting APAs. However, recent studies have shown that SCS at higher density stimulation parameters (200–500 μs/30–130 Hz) also improved gait and FoG in PD patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Samotus et al., 2018</xref>) or at 70–100 Hz in primary freezing of gait when applied at T8-T10 spinal segments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Rohani et al., 2017</xref>). Yet, none of the reports presented data on SCS at higher frequencies such as 300 Hz. Earlier reports also show that SCS improved gait but these studies did not employ a systematic assessment of gait, posture and FoG, comparing different stimulation frequencies as we showed here (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">de Andrade et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>Circuits involving the supplementary motor area (SMA) are thought to modulate APA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Takakusaki, 2017</xref>), specifically in its timing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Jacobs et al., 2009a</xref>). Our results showed that timing, but not amplitude of APA was improved by SCS at 300 Hz, which could indicate that motor circuits involving SMA were also influenced. Although data showing that SCS directly modulates SMA still lacks, extensive data show that SCS modulates cortical function of primary sensory and motor areas, in addition to the prefrontal, cingulate and insula cortices, and thalamus in humans and animals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Fuentes et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Santana et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bentley et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Stancák et al., 2008</xref>). Inputs from ascending leminiscal and extralemniscal pathways to the brainstem and thalamus that may modulate SMA are also highly connected to the pedunculopontine nucleus (PPN), a locomotor region in the brainstem involved in the control of movement initiation and body equilibrium (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Takakusaki, 2017</xref>). It is thought that ascending stimulation of the thalamic-cortical-striatum loop delivered by SCS may disrupt the aberrant inhibition of the globus pallidus internus onto thalamus and PPN, facilitating the reticulospinal tract and, consequently, activating central pattern generators (CPG) in the spinal cord (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Brudzynski et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Takakusaki, 2017</xref>). According to previous studies in animals, facilitation of the thalamic-cortical-striatum loop occurs due to the inhibition of abnormal synchronous beta frequency neuronal oscillations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Fuentes et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Santana et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Yadav and Nicolelis, 2017</xref>).</p><p>We also observed that the reactive posture control was not affected by SCS in both conditions. In fact, one of the participants showed poorer reactive postural control in both stimulation frequencies, but still exhibiting positive response in APA and FoG. While a case study also found improvements in gait with no changes in reactive postural control after SCS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Landi et al., 2013</xref>), another report showed an effect of SCS in reactive postural responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Agari and Date, 2012</xref>). These studies, however, assessed responses to perturbation by the pull test, which is a qualitative measurement influenced by a subjective impression of the evaluator. Here, we show a more robust and reliable kinetic analysis of postural control. It is worth noting that we employed a systematic method to quantify FoG, considered more reliable than the Freezing of Gait Questionnaire (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Giladi et al., 2000</xref>) alone. Based on the present data and in our previous results, SCS apparently improves FoG and APA and does not influence reactive posture control. It is possible that SCS might differently affect these two mechanisms of postural control – reactive and anticipatory. APA mechanisms are dependent of thalamo-cortical-striatum loops highly influenced by attentional and environmental changes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Takakusaki, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Jacobs and Horak, 2007</xref>). On the other hand, unlike APAs, reactive posture control to external and unpredictable triggers relies on neuronal circuitries involving the brainstem and spinal cord with less cortical influence from the cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Jacobs and Horak, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Honeycutt et al., 2009</xref>). It is possible that circuits that depend on cortical influence are more sensitive to SCS, given the increasing in cortical input to the striatum that reaches structures involved in planning of movement, required during APAs but not during unpredictable external perturbations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Krishnamurthi et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bleuse et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Liu et al., 2006</xref>). Similarly to what have been found for DBS, our results suggest that SCS did not improve reactive postural control (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">St George et al., 2012</xref>). Although there is evidence that DBS initially improves FoG and gait (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Schlenstedt et al., 2017</xref>), biomechanical and laboratory findings on APA are still conflicting. A few studies show that DBS impairs APA during step initiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Muniz et al., 2010</xref>) even when administered in the ON levodopa state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Rocchi et al., 2012</xref>). These results suggest that continuous stimulation of circuits in the subthalamic region may lead to plastic changes that impaired step initiation. While DBS corrects cardinal symptoms of PD and dyskinesias, it does not seem to substantially affect APA and FoG. In contrast, SCS can improve FoG and APA in both DBS ON and OFF medication conditions. These collective results suggest that SCS and DBS could be mechanistically and clinically complementary.</p><p>In conclusion, our findings suggest that the effects of SCS observed clinically in FOG are followed by an improvement in APA during step initiation, but not by changes in reactive postural control. We note, however, that our findings were recorded in a small number of participants. In the future, following clinical trials with larger sample, the use of similar methods of instrumented posture and gait assessment, may possibly contribute to better understanding the effects of SCS in different gait and postural situations.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><p>The study was approved by the department review board and in the ethics committee at Hospital das Clinicas of University of São Paulo and registered in the national clinical research database (CAPPESQ-HCFMUSP #12690213.0.0000.0068), which requires all participants to be previously instructed about the procedures and to give written informed consent prior to study inclusion. Patients included in the present study participated in the clinical trial also registered in the clinicaltrials.gov (#NCT02388204). All experiments were performed in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">World Medical Association, 2002</xref>). Four patients with PIGD previously treated with bilateral STN DBS were implanted with SCS systems in the upper thoracic spine (T2-T4) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Pinto de Souza et al., 2017</xref>). Patients were tested for the effects of SCS on APA, and postural reactive responses related to postural and balance control. Assessments were performed in the following conditions: (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Perez-Lloret et al., 2014</xref>) OFF SCS; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bloem et al., 2004</xref>) ON SCS at 60 Hz; and (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Delval et al., 2014</xref>) ON SCS at 300 Hz with or without medication (ON/OFF meds) for at least 12 hr. These conditions were randomized and tested at least one week apart. 60 Hz SCS and 300 Hz were applied as active condition since they generated undistinguished paresthesias, but in average 60 Hz exerted no significant effects in gait, while 300 Hz elicited substantial improvement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Pinto de Souza et al., 2017</xref>).</p><sec id="s4-1"><title>Data collection</title><p>FoG was assessed using a wireless accelerometer (Delsys, Trigno Delsys Inc., USA; filter: Butterworth, low-pass at 10 Hz) placed on the lumbar region during a 10 m walk task. Three 10 m walking trials were performed. To quantify APA, the patients were next assessed during step initiation with the less affected leg, having both feet positioned on a force platform (AMTI, OR6-6, Advanced Mechanical Technology Inc., USA; with an internal analog low-pass filter with a cutoff frequency set at 100 Hz). A reflective marker on the less affected leg (defined from the UPDRS part III) was used to identify the onset of the step through a motion analysis system (Vicon Nexus V.1.8, UK, with four cameras T10 - RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/SCR_015001">SCR_015001</ext-link>). The APA forces of the more affected side (contralateral limb to the stepping leg) were considered for the analysis. The single step was completed and the moving leg returned to the initial position. To maintain the same feet position over subsequent trials, the original positioning was outlined with tape on the force platform. Participants performed a single block of 10 trials of step initiation, with intertrial intervals of approximately 30 s. They used no physical support or sensory cueing to perform the step. At all times an experimenter remained close by to ensure safety of patients.</p><p>We also evaluated reactive postural responses to unanticipated mechanical perturbations. Reactive postural control was assessed using a custom-built movable force platform with an integrated force plate as the base of support (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Coelho and Teixeira, 2017</xref>). Platform displacement was controlled through software developed in LabVIEW (LabVIEW, National Instruments Corp., USA - RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/SCR_014325">SCR_014325</ext-link>). Participants were tested in the upright posture with the feet positioned hip-width apart and slightly oriented sidewards (self-selected as preferred), keeping the arms folded on the chest. The task consisted of recovering stable body equilibrium following unanticipated backward displacement of the supporting platform, while maintaining the feet in place. The following parameters for platform perturbations were used: amplitude of 12 cm, peak velocity of 15 cm/s, and peak acceleration of 100 cm/s<sup>2</sup>. Perturbations were preceded by randomly varied preparatory intervals, ranging 1–3 s, to prevent anticipation.</p></sec><sec id="s4-2"><title>Data analysis</title><p>The duration of FoG was calculated in the frequency domain based on the method proposed by Moore et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Moore et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Moore et al., 2008</xref>), in which the frequency band of the acceleration during normal gait (0–3 Hz) and freezing (3–8 Hz) may be distinguished during walking through changes in frequency power (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A,B,C</xref>). Sampling windows of 7.5 s of the lumbar acceleration were defined for the spectrum analysis. In each sampling window, the peak power was calculated for the FoG band (3–8 Hz) and divided by the peak power of the normal gait (0.5–3 Hz). This metric is referred to as the index of FoG. Values above the clinical threshold of 2 were considerate as FoG events (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Moore et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Moore et al., 2008</xref>).</p><p>For analysis of the stepping task, onset of the APA was defined as the time between the abrupt increase of the mediolateral displacement, defined as two standard deviations above the mean of the baseline force, and the onset of the step, defined as two standard deviations above the mean of the baseline foot displacement in the anteroposterior direction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). Based on these measurements, the time of APA was calculated as the time between the onset of APA and the onset of the step. Mediolateral force amplitude during the step task was normalized by the individual foot size (unit in N/cm).</p><p>For analysis of reactive postural control during perturbation trials, root mean square of anteroposterior displacement of the center of mass (COM<sub>ap</sub>) and center of pressure (COP<sub>ap</sub>) were assessed. To calculate COM<sub>ap</sub>, spherical reflective markers were attached at the following anatomical points on the right hemibody: ﬁfth metatarsophalangeal joint, lateral malleolus, lateral knee joint center, greater trochanter and the approximate axis of shoulder rotation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2DE</xref>).</p><p>Data were extracted and processed with MATLAB (Mathworks, Natick, MA - RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/SCR_001622">SCR_001622</ext-link>) routines, following preliminary visual inspection of signals for individual trials. Data sampling frequency was set at 200 Hz for kinematics and ground reaction forces. Kinematic and ground reaction force data were digitally low-pass filtered with a cut-off frequency of 10 Hz. Signals were filtered through a dual-pass fourth-order Butterworth filter. Estimation of CoM<sub>ap</sub> displacement was based on the anthropometric model proposed by Winter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Winter, 1991</xref>), assuming symmetric displacement between two body sides.</p></sec><sec id="s4-3"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>Analysis was performed on trial averages of each subject and each stimulation condition (OFF, 60 Hz, 300 Hz) for the four subjects.

A lightly edited version of the letter sent to the authors after peer review is shown, indicating the most substantive concerns; minor comments are not usually included.</p></boxed-text><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Effects of spinal cord stimulation on postural control in Parkinson's disease patients with freezing of gait&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by two peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Richard Ivry as the Senior Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>General Assessment:</p><p>The reviewers find the attempt to study the effects of SCS on distinct aspects of postural control very interesting, particularly because freezing of fait is a major concern in Parkinson's Disease patients.</p><p>Conclusions:</p><p>1) Freezing of gait (FoG) is a major feature of Parkinsonism and although SCS seems to be a promising intervention for FoG, its effect on the particular domains of postural control is not known.</p><p>2) SCS led to improvement in duration and amplitude of Anticipatory Postural Adjustment (APA).</p><p>3) SCS improved FoG and gait time.</p><p>4) SCS did not improve Reactive Postural Control (RPC).</p><p>5) APA and RPC are managed by different brain circuits and SCS is more effective on APAs but not on RPC due to its influence on the specific circuits that modulate APAs.</p><p>This work builds on a previous report from the authors and subsequently aims to identify the effect of SCS on individual aspects of postural control. The objective methods used for quantification of FoG, APA, and RPC such as wireless accelerometers, force platforms, motion analysis systems, and spectrum analysis add to the overall strengths of the paper.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>The reviewers have highlighted a number of concerns that must be adequately addressed before the paper can be accepted.</p><p>1) The rationale for using SCS has been alluded to previous studies in rodents, primates, and humans, however for the convenience of readers it would be worthwhile to add few sentences in the Introduction, to explain the rationale for using SCS for treating PD gait disorders.</p><p>2) Figure 1: Needs clarification if time axis in 1A correspond to the same axis in 1C. Vertical axis in D and E need to be clearly labeled.</p><p>3) Figure 2 could be improved. Label panel A) as APA and show the duration of APA in the group means. It looks like the peak of APAs also changed but this was not mentioned. B) Label each plot as Gait, APA, RPC, etc. Explain why, in Figure 2B (top), there is lot of change in FoG time and gait time with the placebo 60 Hz stimulation.</p><p>4) Although light detection systems are widely used for the evaluation of movement, the authors fail to describe the specific motion analysis system implemented for APA and perturbation response quantification. The Vicon system has a wide variety of products.</p><p>5) References need editorial work. Last reference has two different versions. DBS not improving postural responses should include references from St. George et al.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.37727.007</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>The reviewers have highlighted a number of concerns that must be adequately addressed before the paper can be accepted.</p><p>1) The rationale for using SCS has been alluded to previous studies in rodents, primates, and humans, however for the convenience of readers it would be worthwhile to add few sentences in the Introduction, to explain the rationale for using SCS for treating PD gait disorders.</p></disp-quote><p>We added sentences that clarified for the readers how SCS started to be considered a possible new treatment for FoG in PD, and possible neuromodulation of pathways involving brain regions in control of gait initiation.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Figure 1: Needs clarification if time axis in 1A correspond to the same axis in 1C.

The duration of APA (time of APA) of group mean is displayed on panel C. The group mean of amplitude of APA (peak) is also shown on panel C. We made clearer the sentence about the increase in amplitude (peak) of APA in the Results section.</p><p>We labelled each plot of Figure 2B as suggested. 60Hz was applied as active placebo in the first report and compared to 300Hz, which showed in average better outcomes in gait measures when compared to OFF condition and 60Hz. However, it seems like there are subjects that also experience some response to lower frequencies. As it is not the primary interest in this report, we decided to refer to it as two different active conditions (60Hz and 300Hz) with similar parestesias.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) Although light detection systems are widely used for the evaluation of movement, the authors fail to describe the specific motion analysis system implemented for APA and perturbation response quantification.
