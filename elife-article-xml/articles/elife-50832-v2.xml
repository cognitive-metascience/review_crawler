disease, caused by defects in the genes encoding NPC1 or NPC2. We previously reported the dramatic stimulation of NPC2 cholesterol transport rates to and from model membranes by the LE/LY phospholipid lysobisphosphatidic acid (LBPA). It had been previously shown that enrichment of NPC1-deficient cells with LBPA results in cholesterol clearance. Here we demonstrate that LBPA enrichment in human NPC2-deficient cells, either directly or via its biosynthetic precursor phosphtidylglycerol (PG), is entirely ineffective, indicating an obligate functional interaction between NPC2 and LBPA in cholesterol trafficking. We further demonstrate that NPC2 interacts directly with LBPA and identify the NPC2 hydrophobic knob domain as the site of interaction. Together these studies reveal a heretofore unknown step of intracellular cholesterol trafficking which is critically dependent upon the interaction of LBPA with functional NPC2 protein.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.50832.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Cholesterol is a type of fat that is essential for many processes in the body, such as repairing damaged cells and producing certain hormones. Normally, cholesterol enters cells from the bloodstream and is then moved to the parts of the cell that need it via a process known as ‘trafficking’.</p><p>When cholesterol trafficking goes wrong, abnormally large amounts of cholesterol and other fats accumulate within the cell. Over time, these fatty deposits become toxic to cells and eventually damage the affected tissues. Niemann-Pick type C disease (NPC) is a severe genetic disorder affecting cholesterol trafficking. It is characterized by cholesterol build-up in multiple tissues, including the brain, which ultimately causes degeneration and death of nerve cells.</p><p>Two proteins, NPC1 and NPC2, are involved in NPC disease. Both proteins normally help move cholesterol out of important trafficking compartments (known as the endosomal and lysosomal compartments) to other areas of the cell where it is needed. Patients with the disease can have mutations in either the gene for NPC1 or the gene for NPC2. This means that cells from NPC1 patients do not make enough functional NPC1 protein (but contain working NPC2), and vice versa.</p><p>Previous studies had shown that giving cells with NPC1 mutations large amounts of the small molecule lysobisphosphatidic acid (LBPA for short) could compensate for the loss of NPC1, and stop the toxic build-up of cholesterol. McCauliff, Langan, Li et al. therefore wanted to explore exactly how LBPA was doing this. They had shown that LBPA dramatically increased the ability of purified NPC2 protein to transport cholesterol, and wondered if the effect of LBPA in the cells without NPC1 depended on NPC2. They predicted that boosting LBPA levels would not work in cells lacking NPC2.</p><p>Biochemical experiments using purified protein showed that LBPA and NPC2 did indeed interact directly with each other. Systematically changing different building blocks of NPC2 revealed that a single region of the protein is sensitive to LBPA, and when this region was altered, LBPA could no longer interact with NPC2. Since LBPA is naturally produced by cells, they then stimulated cells grown in the laboratory to generate more LBPA using its precursor phosphatidylglycerol. They used cells from patients with mutations in either NPC1 or NPC2 and demonstrated that LBPA’s ability to reverse the accumulation of cholesterol was dependent on its interaction with NPC2. Thus, increasing LBPA levels in cells from patients with NPC1 mutations was beneficial, but had no effect on cells from patients with NPC2 mutations.</p><p>These results shed new light not only on how cells transport cholesterol, but also on potential methods to combat disorders of cellular cholesterol trafficking. In the future, LBPA could be developed as a genetically tailored, patient-specific therapy for diseases like NPC.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>Niemann Pick C</kwd><kwd>lysosomal storage disease</kwd><kwd>cholesterol</kwd><kwd>NPC2</kwd><kwd>lipid-protein interaction</kwd><kwd>lysobisphosphatidic acid</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100001790</institution-id><institution>Ara Parseghian Medical Research Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ilnytska</surname><given-names>Olga</given-names></name><name><surname>Storch</surname><given-names>Judith</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000968</institution-id><institution>American Heart Association</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>11PRE7330012</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>McCauliff</surname><given-names>Leslie A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000968</institution-id><institution>American Heart Association</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>18CDA34110230</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ilnytska</surname><given-names>Olga</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000968</institution-id><institution>American Heart Association</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>14GRNT19990014</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Storch</surname><given-names>Judith</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>GM 1125866</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Storch</surname><given-names>Judith</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Sterol kinetics and cell-based assays reveal a heretofore unknown step in cholesterol trafficking through the endolysosomal compartment, involving a direct functional interaction between NPC2 and lysosbisphosphatidic acid.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Cholesterol is a small, hydrophobic molecule that is a vital building block of cell membranes and a precursor for steroid hormones, bile salts, vitamin D, and oxysterol ligands for transcription factors. Intracellular transport of cholesterol is a highly regulated but, as yet, incompletely understood process. Perturbations can lead to detrimental outcomes such as in the lysosomal storage disorder Niemann Pick Type C (NPC) disease, where LDL-derived cholesterol becomes trapped within the late endosomal/lysosomal (LE/LY) system. The sterol particularly enriches LE/LY inner membranes which develop during endosome maturation as a means of compartmentalizing its contents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Gruenberg, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Gruenberg, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Matsuo et al., 2004</xref>). The accumulation of cholesterol in NPC disease is associated with amassing of other lipids in the LE/LY, disruption of post-lysosomal cholesterol metabolism, and ultimately clinical manifestations including organomegaly and neurological deterioration. In 95% of NPC cases, mutations in the large LE/LY transmembrane protein, NPC1, prevent proper export of cholesterol from the LE/LY to other cellular compartments. The remaining 5% of cases are caused by mutations in the small, 132-amino acid, soluble LE/LY protein, NPC2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Peake and Vance, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Vanier, 2010</xref>).</p><p>Similarities in the cellular and clinical phenotypes resulting from either NPC1 or NPC2 deficiency led to the suggestion that these two proteins function cooperatively in normal LE/LY cholesterol trafficking (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Kwon et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Sleat et al., 2004</xref>); a proposed model shows cholesterol directly transferred from NPC2, in the LE/LY lumen, to NPC1, located in the limiting membrane of the compartment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Estiu et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Wang et al., 2010</xref>). Recent tertiary structural analyses identifying a potential NPC2 interacting domain on the NPC1 protein support this mode of cholesterol egress from the LE/LY compartment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">Zhao et al., 2016</xref>). It is further proposed that cholesterol transfer from NPC2 to the luminally localized N-terminal domain of NPC1 allows sterol passage through the glycocalyx found at the luminal surface of the LE/LY limiting membrane, via concerted effort from membrane glycoproteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Li et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>NPC2 binds cholesterol with a 1:1 stoichiometry (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Xu et al., 2007</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Ko et al. (2003)</xref> showed that cholesterol binding was necessary but not sufficient for its cholesterol efflux function, and we later demonstrated that cholesterol transport was the second critical component of NPC2 functionality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Cheruku et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Xu et al., 2008</xref>). We further showed that cholesterol transfer by NPC2 occurs via protein-membrane interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Cheruku et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Xu et al., 2008</xref>). Using model membranes, we demonstrated a remarkable, order of magnitude stimulation in wild type NPC2 cholesterol transfer rates by the incorporation of lysobisphosphatidic acid (LBPA), also known as bis-monoacylglycerol phosphate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Cheruku et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Xu et al., 2008</xref>). LBPA is a structural isomer of phosphatidylglyerol with an atypical phospholipid stereoconfiguration. It is localized primarily to inner LE/LY membranes and is thought to be involved not only in the formation of these internal membranes and their architecture, but also in the sorting and efflux of LE/LY components, including cholesterol (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Gruenberg, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Hullin-Matsuda et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Kobayashi et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Kobayashi et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Möbius et al., 2003</xref>). Incubation of BHK cells and macrophages with an anti-LBPA monoclonal antibody results in cholesterol accumulation in the LE/LY compartment, resembling the NPC phenotype (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Delton-Vandenbroucke et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Kobayashi et al., 1999</xref>).</p><p>Interestingly, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Chevallier et al. (2008)</xref> showed that by enriching NPC1-deficient cells with exogenously added LBPA, the cholesterol accumulation was reversed ; the underlying molecular mechanism for LBPA stimulated LE/LY cholesterol egress remains unknown. Based on the dramatic effects of LBPA on NPC2-mediated cholesterol transfer, we hypothesized that the mechanism of LBPA action involves its specific functional interaction with NPC2, such that LBPA enrichment of cells deficient in NPC2 would <italic>not</italic> reverse cholesterol accumulation, in contrast to what had been found in NPC1-deficient cells.</p><p>In the present studies we demonstrate that, indeed, LBPA enrichment does not lead to the clearance of cholesterol in NPC2-deficient cells despite the presence of functional NPC1. We show for the first time that the mechanism involves an obligate direct interaction of NPC2 with LBPA, identify the LBPA-sensitive domain on the NPC2 surface, and establish the essential functional nature of NPC2-LBPA interactions in cholesterol egress from the LE/LY compartment. The results identify a novel, heretofore unknown step in LE/LY cholesterol egress which is dependent upon LBPA interaction with the hydrophobic knob of NPC2 protein. This in turn suggests that LBPA enrichment may be used to effect cholesterol egress in cells with defective NPC1 but functional WT NPC2, and NPC2 with disease-causing mutations outside the hydrophobic knob domain.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Predicted orientation of NPC2 in membranes</title><p>Our previous kinetics analyses strongly suggested that the mechanism of cholesterol transfer between NPC2 and membranes was via protein-membrane interaction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Cheruku et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">McCauliff et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Xu et al., 2008</xref>). NPC2 does not contain any apparent transmembrane domains, nor are there experimentally documented membrane interactive domains to date. For de novo predictions we therefore employed the Orientation of Proteins in Membranes (OPM) Database, a curated online resource that predicts the spatial positions of known protein structures relative to the hydrophobic core of a lipid bilayer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Lomize et al., 2012</xref>). Using the crystal structure of bovine NPC2 (PDB ID: 1NEP), a loop domain consisting of hydrophobic residues as highlighted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> was predicted to be highly membrane interactive, with a ΔG of −4.6 kcal/mol. This domain corresponds to 56-HGIVMGIPV-64 and consists primarily of the hydrophobic residues I58, V59, M60, I62, P63, and V64, plus the non-polar residues G61 and G57. Structurally, this domain forms a hydrophobic knob which presents prominently on the surface of the NPC2 protein. OPM predicts that this knob domain inserts into the hydrophobic space of the membrane model, positioning the sterol binding pocket of NPC2 near the membrane surface (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>) and, thus, in proximity to membrane sterols. These computational observations suggest that this knob domain may play a key role in the mechanism by which NPC2 is able to transport cholesterol between inner membranes of the LE/LY compartment. Of note, and as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>, the primary sequence of the hydrophobic knob domain is conserved in mammalian NPC2 proteins but not in the yeast NPC2 homologue. Hydrophobicity scales for NPC2 as well as a Kyte-Doolittle plot of the hydrophobicity scores along the primary protein sequence indicate that the hydrophobicity of the knob domain is conserved amongst mammalian NPC2 proteins, in contrast to the low hydrophobicity in the yeast NPC2 protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>).</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.50832.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>OPM predicts NPC2 stably inserts into membranes via a conserved hydrophobic knob region.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Holo bovine NPC2 (PDB ID: 2HKA) is predicted by OPM to insert its prominent hydrophobic knob region (red ribbon) into the hydrophobic space of a model membrane, positioning the cholesterol in the sterol binding pocket in close proximity to the membrane surface (red line).

Since cholesterol transfer rates to and from NPC2 are very rapid, on the order of seconds or faster, this physical separation method serves only to provide an equilibrium distribution of the sterol between protein and membranes, but nevertheless indicates that the changes in NPC2 tryptophan fluorescence are reflecting sterol transfer between protein and membranes. Although there is order of magnitude more rapid sterol transfer from NPC2 to LBPA-containing vesicles relative to EPC vesicles, no appreciable differences in the equilibrium distribution of cholesterol between NPC2 and the different membranes were found.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>LBPA restores normal NPC2 cholesterol transfer rates for proteins with mutations outside the hydrophobic knob</title><p>Using zwitterionic PC membranes we recently reported that point mutations in multiple regions on the NPC2 surface, including in the hydrophobic knob domain, led to diminished rates of cholesterol transfer between NPC2 and membranes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">McCauliff et al., 2015</xref>); the impact of LBPA on cholesterol transfer by these NPC2 mutants was not investigated.

HTRF, which has been recently demonstrated to be an effective and sensitive assay for lipid-protein interaction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Fleury et al., 2015</xref>), is a fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) based technology that utilizes specific fluorophores that emit long-lived fluorescence signals when involved in a FRET process.

This allows for time-resolved measurements of, in this case, protein-lipid interactions, with the ability to easily subtract background signals. The NPC2-interaction with LBPA at pH 5.0 was substantially greater than with other negatively charged lipids or with zwitterionic PC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>), in general agreement with the lipid-blot results.

The results show that mutations in most of the hydrophobic knob residues markedly reduce interactions, relative to WT NPC2. For example, studies analyzing binding to various isomers of LBPA show that the hydrophobic knob mutants I62N and V64A bound the <italic>S,S</italic> and <italic>S,R</italic> di-oleoyl isomers at only ~20% of WT levels, and the C18:1 <italic>R,R</italic> isomer at approximately 40% of WT.

The I62D and V64A mutants exhibited greater interaction with the 18:1 Semi LBPA species, which has three oleoyl acyl chains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>), binding approximately 70% relative WT NPC2. Mutations in other hydrophobic knob residues also reduced the interaction of NPC2 with the di-oleyol <italic>S,S</italic> LBPA on blots using various phospholipids.

In the present studies we discovered an unanticipated impact of LBPA incorporation into membranes, in which some NPC2 mutants that were highly defective in sterol transfer to phosphatidylcholine membranes, were essentially normalized when LBPA was present. These ‘LBPA-sensitive’ NPC2 mutations were, almost exclusively, present in surface domains outside of the hydrophobic knob. NPC2 proteins with mutations in the hydrophobic knob, that were highly defective in cholesterol transfer to phosphatidylcholine membranes, remained insensitive to LBPA in the membranes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). Based on this structure-based difference in LBPA sensitivity, we hypothesized that increasing the LBPA levels in NPC2 deficient cells would enhance the activity of mutants outside the hydrobphobic knob that responded to LBPA in the kinetic assays, whereas cellular LBPA enrichment would not enhance the action of the hydrophobic knob mutants that were insensitive to LBPA. To test these predictions, NPC2 deficient fibroblasts were incubated with purified wild type or mutant NPC2 proteins, with or without PG supplementation, and cholesterol accumulation was assessed by filipin staining as described. The results in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref> demonstrate that NPC2 proteins with mutations outside the hydrophobic knob, such as Q29A, D113A, and D72A, which were unable to reduce cholesterol accumulation in unsupplemented NPC2 deficient cells, were indeed able to ‘rescue’ cells that were enriched with LBPA via PG supplementation. By contrast, the hydrophobic knob mutants I62D and G61A, which were insensitive to LBPA in cholesterol transfer assays, were unable to clear cholesterol from LBPA-enriched NPC2 deficient cells. Thus, the results show that a combination of increased cellular levels of LBPA and LBPA-sensitive NPC2 protein was able to rescue the NPC2 deficient cells, beyond the ability of the mutant protein alone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>). As before, WT cells supplemented with PG alone showed no change in cholesterol accumulation, and cells supplemented with purified WT NPC2, with or without PG, showed significantly reduced filipin staining. The results in patient cells again mirror the results of sterol kinetics experiments, suggesting that return to normal sterol trafficking can be achieved for NPC2 mutations outside the hydrophobic knob that are otherwise dysfunctional, when the LBPA content of the cells is increased.</p><fig id="fig9" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.50832.012</object-id><label>Figure 9.</label><caption><title>LBPA–sensitive but not insensitive NPC2 mutants reverse cholesterol accumulation in NPC2–deficient cells when co-treated with PG.</title><p>NPC2 deficient fibroblasts were incubated with purified WT or mutant NPC2 proteins alone or in the presence of PG SUVs, as described under Methods, and cholesterol accumulation was quantified by filipin staining.

In this study we have, for the first time, shown that LBPA function in cholesterol trafficking is obligately dependent upon its interaction with the NPC2 protein within the endo-lysosomal system. At the molecular level, we show that this novel step in intracellular cholesterol trafficking involves direct interaction of LBPA with the hydrophobic knob domain on NPC2. This surface domain is located near the cholesterol binding pocket, thus its insertion into the bilayer would position the protein to efficiently exchange cholesterol with the membrane. Recent molecular dynamic simulations show that LBPA, but not other phospholipids, may position NPC2 in an orientation that could promote protein-membrane sterol exchange (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Enkavi et al., 2017</xref>), potentially inducing a conformational change in the binding pocket of NPC2 such that the off-rate of cholesterol is markedly increased, allowing for rapid transfer of cholesterol between protein and LBPA-enriched membranes.</p><p>A decade ago, the Gruenberg laboratory reported that viral-mediated supplementation of NPC1-deficient cells with exogenous LBPA reversed cholesterol accumulation in the diseased cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Chevallier et al., 2008</xref>). Here we show that LBPA enrichment is, conversely, completely ineffective in cells expressing NPC1 but lacking NPC2, underscoring the required functional interaction of LBPA with the NPC2 protein. In our efforts to establish the molecular basis of this interaction, we found that several NPC2 mutants that could not reverse cholesterol accumulation in unsupplemented NPC2<italic>-</italic>deficient cells, became effective if the cells were first enriched with LBPA. The NPC2 mutations which were ‘rescued’ by LBPA enrichment are all localized outside of the hydrophobic knob domain. By contrast, mutations within the hydrophobic knob were insensitive to LBPA enrichment apart from H56A, which may be on the limiting edge of this region. Thus, LBPA is able to normalize deficient transfer by mutant NPC2 as long as the mutation is outside of the hydrophobic knob. Interestingly, direct interaction between NPC2 and NPC1, residing in the limiting LE/LY membrane, has also been identified as involving the hydrophobic knob region on NPC2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Li et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Wang et al., 2010</xref>). This highlights further the critical nature of this domain in intracellular cholesterol trafficking, such that the NPC2 hydrophobic knob is involved in both LBPA-dependent binding of cholesterol by NPC2 at inner-LE/LY membranes, and the delivery of cholesterol by NPC2 to the NPC1 N-terminal domain. Primary amino acid sequence comparisons reveal a high degree of conservation within the NPC2 hydrophobic knob domain for all species with the exception of yeast; interestingly, yeast lacks the LBPA phospholipid, indirectly supporting a functional interaction between the mammalian NPC2 hydrophobic knob and LBPA. Thus, we propose that the hydrophobic knob on NPC2 interacts with LBPA in the inner LE/LY membranes, leading to cholesterol extraction, with NPC2 then subsequently involved in the ‘handoff’ of the sterol to NPC1 in the limiting membrane of these organelles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Deffieu and Pfeffer, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Infante et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Li et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Wang et al., 2010</xref>).</p><p>In healthy cells, the enrichment of inner LE/LY membranes with LBPA and concurrent decline in cholesterol content may be reflective of the efficient role LBPA plays in normal LE/LY cholesterol efflux. If direct interactions between LBPA and NPC2 are integral to this mechanism of efflux, a rate determining step may be their frequency of interaction and, thus, be partially dependent upon the concentration of both phospholipid and protein in the LE/LY compartment. While the concentration of LE/LY LBPA has been shown to increase in parallel with cholesterol and other lipids in NPC disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Davidson et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Sleat et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Vanier, 1983</xref>), as also found here, it is possible that LBPA levels nevertheless remain too low, as previously suggested (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Chevallier et al., 2008</xref>), to provide support for NPC2-mediated transport of the elevated cholesterol load. Our results using PG supplementation to augment LBPA levels further indicate that LBPA may become limiting in NPC1 disease. Importantly, we show here that LBPA enrichment cannot reverse cholesterol accumulation caused by NPC2 deficiency unless the mutation is outside the hydrophobic knob domain in which case PG supplementation is effective, as it is in NPC1-deficient cells. Interestingly, Chen et al. observed a pronounced association of the NPC2 protein with inner LE/LY membranes in cells of <italic>Npc1</italic><sup>-/-</sup> mice (Balb/c <italic>Npc1<sup>nih</sup></italic>), relative to WT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chen et al., 2005</xref>), suggesting that increased recruitment of NPC2 to inner LE/LY membranes in NPC1 disease, where LBPA concentration is high, may be a compensatory mechanism to alleviate sterol accumulation.</p><p>Beyond its obligate interaction with NPC2 within the LE/LY, it is not yet clear how increased LBPA leads to the efflux of LE/LY cholesterol in the absence of NPC1 protein, although in recent studies we have found that increased concentrations of cellular LBPA increase macroautophagy in NPC1 deficient cells (data not shown). It is well known that impaired autophagy is present in NPC disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Liao et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Lieberman et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Seranova et al., 2017</xref>), and stabilization of this pathway has been shown to reduce cholesterol accumulation in NPC1 disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Dai et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Ordonez et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Sarkar et al., 2013</xref>). LBPA also displays a variety of other unique functions within the endo/lysosomal system that could potentially promote cholesterol efflux. Studies have demonstrated, for instance, that its transient interaction with the ESCRT-associated protein, ALIX, is required for the proper formation of multivesicular structures within the LE/LY (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Matsuo et al., 2004</xref>), where cholesterol is localized (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Fivaz, 2002</xref>); it is also found, along with cholesterol, on exosomes derived from fusion of inner lamellae with the limiting LE/LY membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Matsuo et al., 2004</xref>). Furthermore, it has recently been proposed that LBPA may influence cholesterol homeostasis beyond the confines of late endosomes and lysosomes, having been shown to be necessary for lipid droplet formation via Wnt signaling within the endoplasmic reticulum, where cholesteryl esters are synthesized (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Scott et al., 2015</xref>). Within the endo/lysosomal system, however, our results demonstrating that cellular enrichment of LBPA cannot reverse cholesterol accumulation in cells lacking functional NPC2 protein indicate that the cholesterol efflux mechanism utilized by LBPA is dependent upon its interaction with NPC2.</p><p>LBPA is reported to comprise only 1% of total cellular phospholipids, but about 15 mol% of total phospholipids in the LE/LY (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Chevallier et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Kobayashi et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Kobayashi et al., 2002</xref>). There is no agreement regarding which isomeric form of LBPA is predominant in cells, as the fatty acids can be linked at the sn-2 or sn-3 positions of each glycerol in the <italic>S</italic> or <italic>R</italic> conformation, though the sn-2, sn-2’ positions are currently favored (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Chevallier et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Kobayashi et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Kobayashi et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Mason et al., 1972</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Matsuo et al., 2004</xref>). The 2,2’-LBPA was shown to be quite effective at mobilizing cholesterol in NPC1 disease cells while the 3,3’- and semi-LBPA isoforms were unable to promote sterol efflux. No difference in efficacy between <italic>S</italic>,<italic>S</italic>, <italic>S</italic>,<italic>R</italic>, and <italic>R</italic>,<italic>R</italic> LBPA isomers were noted, however, suggesting that the conformation of LBPA has no bearing on its ability to reverse cholesterol accumulation in NPC1 deficient cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Chevallier et al., 2008</xref>). In agreement with this observation, we previously showed that the <italic>S,S</italic>, <italic>S,R</italic>, and <italic>R,R</italic> configurations of LBPA had little to no effect on in vitro cholesterol transfer rates by NPC2 protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Xu et al., 2008</xref>). Similarly, in the present studies we observed little variation in NPC2 binding to these different LBPA stereoisomers. Regardless, we chose to use the presumed precursor and structural isomer of LBPA, phosphatidylglycerol, to increase the cellular LBPA content in these studies, obviating any potential concern about the LBPA isoform as the cells presumably generate the physiologically accurate form. PG is thought to convert to LBPA along the endo/lysosomal system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Hullin-Matsuda et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Poorthuis and Hostetler, 1978</xref>), and studies have demonstrated that exogenously administered PG can be converted to LBPA in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Somerharju and Renkonen, 1980</xref>), although the anabolic pathway of this conversion remains unknown. The present demonstration that PG supplementation specifically increases the LBPA content of all cells tested supports the hypothesis that PG is a precursor to LBPA. Cellular conversion of PG to LBPA has also been demonstrated in mammalian alveolar macrophages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Waite et al., 1987</xref>), lymphoblasts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Hullin-Matsuda et al., 2007</xref>) and RAW macrophages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bouvier et al., 2009</xref>).</p><p>In addition to variations in stereochemistry, the cellular fatty acyl chain components of LBPA have been found to vary (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bouvier et al., 2009</xref>), with oleic acid and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) reported to be selectively incorporated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Besson et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Luquain et al., 2001</xref>). Here we found acyl chain-dependent differences in NPC2-LBPA interactions, with reduced binding to the 14-carbon saturated dimyristoyl-LBPA species relative to the 18-carbon monounsaturated dioleoyl-LBPA species. In prior work we showed that cholesterol transfer from NPC2 to membranes containing dioleoyl-LBPA was &gt;2 fold faster than transfer to vesicles with dimyristoyl-LBPA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Xu et al., 2008</xref>). Taken together, the results suggest that the acyl composition but not the steroconfiguration of LBPA may be important in normal LE/LY cholesterol efflux. Ongoing studies focused on identifying the specific acyl-chain species that are most effective at stimulating LE/LY cholesterol clearance in an NPC phenotype, for instance, should inform both our understanding of intracellular cholesterol transport and the development of therapies for lysosomal storage disorders.</p><p>Based on the present results, we propose that the NPC2 hydrophobic knob domain inserts into LBPA enriched inner LE/LY membranes, interacting directly with the phospholipid. Given the ability of NPC2 to promote membrane-membrane interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abdul-Hammed et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">McCauliff et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">McCauliff et al., 2015</xref>), we speculate that this interaction between LBPA and NPC2 is involved in the formation of membrane contact sites which could potentially exist between closely apposed inner LE/LY membranes and facilitate rapid transfer of sterol. Membrane contact sites have been shown to be important in intermembrane lipid transfer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Helle et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Holthuis and Levine, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Prinz, 2014</xref>), although none have yet been specifically described within the multivesicular LE/LY. Our results show that NPC2 promotes membrane-membrane interaction, and further indicate the ability of NPC2 to bind to LBPA; this interaction may represent one membrane contact point on inner LE/LY membranes. Our previous kinetic studies suggested that NPC2 interacts with other membrane phospholipids as well, and preliminary molecular dynamics simulations indicate that unlike LBPA, where NPC2 interacts at the hydrophobic knob, these interactions occur at NPC2 surface sites other than the knob domain (data not shown); such interactions could represent a second contact point within the inner LE/LY membranes. Interestingly, it has now been demonstrated that NPC2 also binds directly to NPC1 which resides in the limiting LE/LY membrane, and possibly also with LAMP proteins in these same membranes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Li et al., 2016</xref>). These could also be potential tether points for the NPC2 and would effectively bring inner LE/LY cholesterol-laden membranes in closer proximity to the limiting LE/LY membrane, which cholesterol must ultimately cross to exit the compartment.</p><p>The key finding of the present studies is that the primary mechanism by which LBPA stimulates LE/LY cholesterol efflux is critically dependent upon its interaction with functional NPC2. LBPA first appears on the internal vesicles and membranes of cholesterol rich multivesicular bodies characteristic of late endosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Gruenberg, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Möbius et al., 2003</xref>) and increases in concentration through the pathway to cholesterol depleted lysosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Möbius et al., 2003</xref>). This localization overlaps with NPC2, targeted to late endosomes/lysosomes via the mannose-6-phosphate receptor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Naureckiene et al., 2000</xref>). While NPC1 is also targeted to late endosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Garver et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Higgins et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Neufeld et al., 1999</xref>), Blanchette-Mackie and colleagues observed that most NPC1 localizes to a specific set of LAMP2 positive, mannose 6-phosphate receptor negative vesicles that are distinct from cholesterol enriched LAMP2 positive lysosomes, where LBPA and NPC2 reside, suggesting that transient interactions between NPC1 positive organelles and cholesterol rich lysosomes occur to effect normal cholesterol egress via NPC2-NPC1 interaction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Neufeld et al., 1999</xref>). While several groups have reported NPC1-independent egress of cholesterol from the LE/LY (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Boadu et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Goldman and Krise, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Kennedy et al., 2012</xref>), it is not clear whether these function in the normal situation, or whether they are manifested secondary to NPC1 dysfunction.</p><p>Under normal conditions it is likely that the critical functional interaction between NPC2 and LBPA, demonstrated in the present studies, is followed by an interaction between NPC2 and NPC1 at the limiting lysosomal membrane, allowing for cholesterol to egress from the endolysosomal system. However, our studies have also implied that in the presence of intact NPC2, bypassing dysfunctional NPC1 may be achieved via PG-mediated or direct LBPA enrichment. LBPA enrichment may also be effective in NPC2 cases where the mutation is in a residue outside of the hydrophobic knob. For example, a human mutation in D72 has been reported to be disease causing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Biesecker et al., 2009</xref>), and we found here that PG supplementation/LBPA enrichment allowed NPC2 deficient cells to be effectively cleared by the D72A protein; supplementation with D72A-NPC2 was entirely ineffective prior to LBPA enrichment. In a recent high-throughput screen for drugs that raise LBPA levels, (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Moreau et al., 2019</xref>) showed that a compound which increased LBPA levels cleared cholesterol from an NPC2 patient cell line; the mutated residue in this instance, C93, lies outside the hydrophobic knob. Thus, the in vitro evidence strongly suggests that LBPA enrichment can affectively ameliorate cellular cholesterol accumulation in the majority of NPC disease cases, including potentially all NPC1 mutations as well as NPC2 mutations outside the hydrophobic knob.</p><p>Currently there is no cure for NPC disease. Pharmacological options are limited, and palliative care remains the standard for treatment of the disease, focusing on increasing the length and quality of life for affected patients. Based on the existing in vitro evidence, we propose that cellular LBPA enrichment is worth exploring as a possible therapy. Aerosolized phospholipids such as dipalmitoyl phosphatidylcholine are widely used to enhance pulmonary drug delivery (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Duret et al., 2014</xref>), and can be adequately nebulized without losing compositional integrity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Schreier et al., 1994</xref>). PG itself, administered intranasally, has been used as a therapy by the Voelker group to effectively inhibit respiratory syncytial virus infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Numata et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Numata et al., 2013</xref>) and influenza A virus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Numata et al., 2012</xref>). Moreover, lipid based colloidal carriers are able to cross the blood brain barrier (BBB) when administered intranasally (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Ganesan et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Mittal et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Patel and Patel, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Tapeinos et al., 2017</xref>) and have recently been shown to be efficient drug delivery vehicles in the treatment of intrinsic brain tumors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">van Woensel et al., 2013</xref>) and neurodegenerative diseases including Alzheimer’s (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Agrawal et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Tapeinos et al., 2017</xref>) and Parkinson’s (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Tapeinos et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Yang et al., 2016</xref>). Given the historical difficulties in treating the neurological effects of NPC disease, the development of a minimally invasive, effective treatment with intrinsic ability to cross the BBB is of interest.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th>Reagent type <break/>(species) or resource</th><th>Designation</th><th>Source or reference</th><th>Identifiers</th><th>Additional information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Cell line (<italic>C. griseus</italic>)</td><td>CHO-KI cells, NPC2-800#7</td><td>PMID: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17018531">17018531</ext-link></td><td/><td>Dr. Peter Lobel <break/>(Robert Wood Johnson Medical School)</td></tr><tr><td>Cell line (<italic>Homo sapiens</italic>)</td><td>WT fibroblasts</td><td>Coriell Institute for Medical Research</td><td>Cat# GM03652; RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/CVCL_7397">CVCL_7397</ext-link></td><td>Human skin fibroblasts from an apparently healthy 24 year old male</td></tr><tr><td>Cell line (<italic>Homo sapiens</italic>)</td><td>NPC2 fibroblasts</td><td>Coriell Institute for Medical Research</td><td>Cat# GM18455; RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/CVCL_DA79">CVCL_DA79</ext-link></td><td>Human skin fibroblasts from male identified as compound heterozygote at the NPC2 gene locus: results in E20X and C47F</td></tr><tr><td>Cell line (<italic>Homo sapiens</italic>)</td><td>NPC1 fibroblasts</td><td>Coriell Institute for Medical Research</td><td>Cat# GM03123; RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/CVCL_7374">CVCL_7374</ext-link></td><td>Human skin fibroblasts from 9 year old female identified as compound heterozygote at the NPC1 gene locus: results in P237S and I1061T</td></tr><tr><td>Cell line (<italic>Homo sapiens</italic>)</td><td>HeLa (ATCCCCL-2) cells</td><td>ATCC</td><td>Cat # CCL-2; RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/CVCL_0030">CVCL_0030</ext-link></td><td>Human epithelial cells from cervix of a 31 year old female with adenocarcinoma</td></tr><tr><td>Antibody</td><td>Rabbit polyclonal anti-c-myc-tag</td><td>GenScript</td><td>Cat# A00172-40; RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/AB_914457">AB_914457</ext-link></td><td>IF (0.5 µg/ml)</td></tr><tr><td>Antibody</td><td>Donkey anti-rabbit IgG HRP-conjugated</td><td>GE Healthcare</td><td>Cat# NA934; RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/AB_772206">AB_772206</ext-link></td><td>IF (1:20,000)</td></tr><tr><td>Antibody</td><td>Mouse monoclonal anti-myc- tag</td><td>Millipore</td><td>Cat# 05–724; RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/AB_309938">AB_309938</ext-link></td><td>IF (1:2,000)</td></tr><tr><td>Antibody</td><td>Anti-mouse IgG IRDye-800CW conjugated</td><td>Li-Cor</td><td>Cat# 925–32210; RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/AB_2687825">AB_2687825</ext-link></td><td>IF (1:10,000)</td></tr><tr><td>Antibody</td><td>Streptavidin-d2</td><td>Cisbio</td><td>Cat# 610SADLA</td><td>IF (50 µg/ml)</td></tr><tr><td>Antibody</td><td>Monoclonal anti-6His-Eu cryptate</td><td>Cisbio</td><td>Cat# 61HISKLA</td><td>IF (12.5 µg/ml)</td></tr><tr><td>Antibody</td><td>Rabbit monoclonal anti-NPC1</td><td>Abcam</td><td>Cat# ab134113; <break/>RRID: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/AB_2734695">AB_2734695</ext-link></td><td>WB (1:2,000)</td></tr><tr><td>Recombinant DNA reagent</td><td>Plasmid: myc 6xHis-tagged NPC2</td><td>PMID: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12591949">12591949</ext-link></td><td/><td>Dr. Matthew P.

In this study, they report on the existence of an NPC2-dependent but NPC1-independent pathway of cholesterol egress from lysosomes. They do not claim that the extensively-characterized NPC2-NPC1 hydrophobic handoff model does not exist, but rather that there is also an NPC1-independent pathway. This alternative pathway is crucially dependent on the lipid, LBPA, which is enriched in lysosomal membranes. The authors report mutations in NPC2 near a putative hydrophobic knob that are responsible for this LBPA-dependent transport pathway.</p><p>The new findings here rest on the characterization of mutations in the hydrophobic knob region that are important in the LBPA-dependent transfer of cholesterol from NPC2 to membranes in a NPC1-independent manner. However, the experimental results do not fully support this, and the following points need addressing.</p><p>1) Transfer of cholesterol from NPC2 to liposomes is measured by dequenching the tryptophan fluorescence of NPC2 (which is quenched by the bound cholesterol). This does not show that cholesterol has been transferred to the liposome. While this is the likely outcome, direct measurement of transfer of cholesterol needs to be done (with radiolabeled cholesterol or analysis of cholesterol in liposomes by other means). This is a critical point of this paper.</p><p>2) The central point of this paper is that the LBPA-mediated pathway is independent of NPC1. The authors need to show the hydrophobic knob in the context of the NPC2/NPC1 hydrophobic tunnel (Li et al., 2016), and need to show the effect of their LBPA-sensitive mutations on NPC1-mediated cholesterol transfer, using the methodology of Wang et al., 2010. Without this, it is premature to say that the LBPA-dependent pathway is NPC1-independent.</p><p>3) Does binding to LBPA affect the binding to cholesterol? According to the author's model, one might expect that LBPA might displace the bound cholesterol from NPC2 so that it can be transferred to liposomes.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic></p><p>This is a well-documented paper on the interaction of NPC2 protein with LBPA (otherwise known as BMP). However, given the previous publications from this group and others, I don't find the results particularly novel. It is more like working out some additional details from further mutations.

Intensity measurements are made easily with any image analysis software package.</p><p>4) Much of the Discussion section seemed repetitive of earlier sections. More importantly, it did not provide mechanisms that I understood for enhanced cholesterol efflux when LBPA and/or NPC2 levels were increased.</p><p>A) How would membrane:membrane interactions of LBPA-enriched membranes facilitate efflux? Most papers have suggested that LBPA is mainly on internal membranes and not on the limiting membrane. Contacts with the limiting membrane would need to clear areas of the glycocalyx, which is considered to protect the limiting membrane against hydrolysis. Merely being near the limiting membrane but bound to a LAMP protein would still leave a large aqueous gap to be traversed by cholesterol.</p><p>[Editors’ note: what now follows is the decision letter after the authors submitted for further consideration.]</p><p>Thank you for resubmitting your work entitled &quot;Intracellular cholesterol trafficking is dependent upon NPC2 interaction with Lysobisphosphatidic Acid&quot; for further consideration at <italic>eLife</italic>.

As the reviewer surmised, we had in fact addressed this question in a previous publication (Xu et al., 2008), showing that the tryptophan emission of NPC2 was quenched in the presence of liposomes, indicative of protein-membrane interaction, and the apparent Kd for binding of liposomes by NPC2 obtained using these methods was reported. We agree that these previous data lend support to the present studies and have thus included a brief description of the results in subsection “Predicted orientation of NPC2 in membranes”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) The authors discuss NPC1-independent routes of cholesterol export.

We agree that this point, in addition to addressing LBPA’s potential role in MVB exocytosis, would provide a greater understanding of how the present work sheds light on potential mechanisms of LE/LY cholesterol export. In the discussion of pathways of LE/LY cholesterol egress, in the Discussion section, we have now incorporated comments on the localization and overlap of LBPA and the NPC proteins in the endo/lysosomal system. Also, in the Discussion section we have addressed studies not only indicating LBPA involvement in exosome formation but also the identification of both LBPA and cholesterol in these bodies (where we address other roles of LBPA in the endo/lysosomal system).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Figure 5C needs color as it is impossible to decipher</p></disp-quote><p>At the reviewer’s useful suggestion, we have included color in Figure 5C for enhanced readability.</p><p>Reviewer #2:</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>[…] The new findings here rest on the characterization of mutations in the hydrophobic knob region that are important in the LBPA-dependent transfer of cholesterol from NPC2 to membranes in a NPC1-independent manner.

This is a critical point of this paper.</p></disp-quote><p>We are confident that the observed changes in NPC2 tryptophan fluorescence are indicative of cholesterol transfer between the protein and liposomes: In our studies of cholesterol movement between NPC2 and membranes, we have shown that the directionality of the transfer is reflected by opposing behavior of the tryptophan signal, where de-quenching is observed when NPC2 acts as the cholesterol donor versus quenching when NPC2 is the sterol acceptor, as demonstrated in Cheruku et al., (2006) and Xu et al., (2008). Such opposing fluorescence intensity changes would not occur if transfer of sterol on or off of NPC2 were not occurring; if sterol were not transferring and the protein and membranes were interacting, the fluorescence changes would be similar whether the cholesterol was initially bound to the protein or to the membranes.</p><p>It is also worth noting that such fluorescence-based methodologies have been used for decades to monitor protein-ligand binding and transfer kinetics (Atkinson et al., 2004; Bian and De Camilli, 2019; Nemecz et al., 1988; Nichols and Pagano, 1983); arguably this approach is preferable to traditional equilibrium distribution assays in which physical separation of donor and acceptor populations is relatively slow and cannot be used to determine the kinetics of very rapid transfer, as is the case in the present studies.</p><p>To support the interpretation that the fluorescence dequenching is indicating cholesterol transfer from NPC2 to membranes, we have conducted in vitro assays using <sup>3</sup>H-cholesterol to monitor transfer from holo-NPC2 to vesicles, and from <sup>3</sup>H-cholesterol-containing membranes to apo-NPC2. In these experiments NPC2 and membranes were separated by ultracentrifugation, as described in the Materials and methods section. The results show that the labeled cholesterol transfers from the protein to the membranes and the reverse, from membranes to protein. We have included the partition coefficient which describes the distribution of sterol at equilibrium in subsection “LBPA markedly stimulates sterol transfer rates between NPC2 and membranes”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) The central point of this paper is that the LBPA-mediated pathway is independent of NPC1. The authors need to show the hydrophobic knob in the context of the NPC2/NPC1 hydrophobic tunnel (Li et al., 2016), and need to show the effect of their LBPA-sensitive mutations on NPC1-mediated cholesterol transfer, using the methodology of Wang et al., 2010. Without this, it is premature to say that the LBPA-dependent pathway is NPC1-independent.</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewer raises a valid issue regarding the ability to declare that the pathway utilized by NPC2 and LBPA is independent of NPC1, as our cellular model (Coriell GM03123; compound heterozygote, C709T and T3182C) does indeed express the NPC1 protein, though defective in its ability to traffic cholesterol normally. Another interesting point is the fact that there is overlap between the LBPA-interactive domain identified here and the NPC1interactive domain on NPC2 identified by Wang et al., (2010). To further support the apparently NPC1-independent egress of cholesterol by LBPA enrichment shown here and in Chevallier et al., (2008), we have added data from two new experiments, now included as Figures 8C and D. First, we generated HeLa cells where NPC1 expression was eliminated using CRISPR-Cas9, and show that in in these cells, incubation with PG leads to significantly reduced cholesterol levels. Secondly, we used the U18666A compound, known to generate a phenocopy of NPC disease at the cellular level and recently demonstrated to target NPC1 specifically (Lu et al., 2015); here too we find that PG incubation leads to significant reductions in cellular cholesterol levels. The aforementioned limitation of our studies using the NPC1 line from Coriell has been mentioned in subsection “PG supplementation/LBPA enrichment reduces cholesterol accumulation in NPC1- but not NPC2-deficient 289 fibroblasts” in the revised manuscript. Two additional researchers, who aided in conducting these studies, have also been added to the authors’ list and their contributions cited appropriately.</p><p>We respectfully wish to point out that the highly novel aspect of our findings is that there is an obligate interaction between NPC2 and LBPA that is required for cholesterol egress from the LE/LY. Our main point is not really the existence of a potentially NPC1independent mechanism of cholesterol egress, and indeed we are not the first to propose this possibility; three different groups that have also shown the apparently NPC1-independent egress of cholesterol are cited on page 16 of the manuscript. In the case of LBPA, it was known 10 years ago that increasing the LBPA content of NPC1 deficient cells could clear the accumulated cholesterol (Chevallier et al., 2008), but the mechanism of this ‘rescue’ was not known. In this manuscript we present the discovery that the mechanism of LBPA action is critically dependent on functional NPC2 protein. This is the case whether the cholesterol egress stimulation is independent of NPC1 or not. Thus, we demonstrate a heretofore unanticipated step in intracellular cholesterol trafficking, namely the obligate interaction of NPC2 and LBPA, and go on to provide molecular level details of the NPC2-LBPA interaction that have implications for potential therapeutic application of the findings (e.g. that PG treatment/LBPA enrichment can potentially be used in NPC2 cases where mutations are outside the identified LBPA interaction domain). We hope we have now done a better job of highlighting the new step in intracellular sterol trafficking that we’ve found, secondarily supporting the hypothesis that LBPA-stimulated sterol egress can be NPC1-independent, but only if there is functional NPC2 available.</p><p>We do not have in hand the NPC1 construct with which to repeat the experiments of Wang with our NPC2 mutants, however this is certainly planned for ongoing experiments. Please note that the assay used in Wang is essentially an equilibrium distribution analysis, with time courses shown in minutes, much faster than the rates of NPC2-mediated sterol transfer (seconds), particularly in the presence of membrane LBPA.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Does binding to LBPA affect the binding to cholesterol? According to the author's model, one might expect that LBPA might displace the bound cholesterol from NPC2 so that it can be transferred to liposomes.</p></disp-quote><p>This is an interesting question. We don’t think that LBPA is competitively displacing cholesterol from the NPC2 binding site, as follows: The tertiary structure of holo-NPC2 with bound cholesteryl sulfate (Friedland et al., 2003) shows a hand-in-glove fit for the sterol which would not likely accommodate a diacylated phospholipid. Moreover, a substrate specificity analysis using two different binding assays from the Lobel lab (Liou et al., 2006) shows not a single phospholipid being bound to NPC2, including LBPA. Rather than a displacement, we hypothesize that the interaction of the NPC2 hydrophobic knob with LBPA (a) positions the protein with its ligand binding pocket right at the membrane surface, and (b) may cause a conformational change in the binding pocket such that the cholesterol off-rate is markedly increased, as we found in our kinetics analyses. This is now more clearly stated in the Discussion section of the revised manuscript.</p><p>Reviewer #3:</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>This is a well-documented paper on the interaction of NPC2 protein with LBPA (otherwise known as BMP). However, given the previous publications from this group and others, I don't find the results particularly novel. It is more like working out some additional details from further mutations.

We respectfully disagree, however, that the manuscript is simply a repetition with some extension of our earlier mutagenesis work; the work published in McCauliff et al., (2015) focused on the surface domains of NPC2 that were necessary for cholesterol transport to zwitterionic EPC vesicles and did not include LBPA! It wasn’t until subsequent investigations that we realized that only one of the domains identified in that paper was involved in the dramatic stimulation effect of LBPA on cholesterol transfer rates by NPC2 (Xu et al., 2008). Those subsequent experiments, using LBPA-containing vesicles (and reported herein) initiated our efforts to understand the molecular basis of the effect of LBPA on cholesterol clearance in NPC1-deficient cells, which had been shown a decade ago (Chevallier et al., 2008); these studies ultimately led to the novel discovery that not only does NPC2 directly interact with LBPA in membranes, but that the mechanism of LBPA action is critically dependent on functional NPC2 protein. In order to emphasize these points, we have trimmed and modified the Introduction and Discussion section and altered the Abstract and title. We hope we have now done a better job of explaining what we consider to be a novel aspect of intracellular cholesterol trafficking within the LE/LY compartment.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The mouse NPC2 sequence in Figure 1 shows a glutamate in the middle of the hydrophobic knob sequence. Is the mouse protein defective in transport? If not, why?</p></disp-quote><p>The mouse NPC2 protein does indeed have a glutamate residue (E60) within the hydrophobic domain. We did not focus on this residue in our mutagenesis studies as we chose to primarily focus on highly conserved residues within the hydrophobic knob region and, as Figure 1 shows, this is not one of the most highly conserved, nor does it have an appreciable hydrophobicity score. Additionally, we have previously shown that both human and bovine NPC2 proteins have normal cholesterol transport properties (Cheruku et al., 2006; Xu et al., 2008), each with a methionine in this position (Figure 1), and that incorporation of LBPA into membranes elicits the same change in cholesterol transfer rate by human NPC2 (Xu et al., 2008) that we show for the mouse form of the protein, suggesting that this particular residue is not integral to the function of the domain. However, what our present work emphasizes is not the individual residues within the knob that are necessary for cholesterol transport and LBPA binding by NPC2, but the region itself. We have modified our discussion to make the point that these studies suggest that this hydrophobic knob domain, which also overlaps with the NPC1 interactive domain, is highly critical for the function of NPC2.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) In measuring the amounts of filipin labeling (Figure 6), they should measure the filipin intensity rather than the area of filipin labeling. This would be a much better indicator of the amount of cholesterol in the membranes.</p></disp-quote><p>As addressed to reviewer #1 above, we thank you for pointing out this error in our text. The data presented do indeed represent the intensity of the filipin stain, and appropriate changes have been made.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) The same is true for measuring LBPA (Figure 7).

Most papers have suggested that LBPA is mainly on internal membranes and not on the limiting membrane.

Merely being near the limiting membrane but bound to a LAMP protein would still leave a large aqueous gap to be traversed by cholesterol.</p></disp-quote><p>This is clearly the next key question — how does the increased LBPA content lead to cholesterol clearance from the LE/LY compartment? What we have learned here is that in order for the LBPA to function, it must interact with NPC2. In the revised manuscript, we include additional indirect supporting evidence from the literature for this association, regarding NPC2 localization in cells from mice with NPC1 disease, and further discuss potential mechanisms, including our recent findings of increased macro autophagy in LBPA-enriched NPC1 deficient cells. Finally, we have proposed that, while a secondary mechanism of cholesterol efflux may function independently of NPC1, the contribution of this pathway may be either very small or possibly non-existent under “normal” conditions, but in NPC1 disease the accumulation of LBPA may be a compensatory mechanism aimed at increasing the NPC2mediated transfer of cholesterol out of the inner LE/LY membranes, thereby revealing the presence of this secondary pathway of LE/LY cholesterol egress.</p><p>We hope that these changes have more clearly defined how the results support our conclusion that there exists a highly specialized domain on the NPC2 protein which specifically interacts with LBPA, and that this obligate interaction is required for normal LE/LY cholesterol export. Further, the exploitation of this interaction, via increases in LBPA levels, may be used not only in NPC1-deficient cells but also in functional mutations in NPC2 where the mutation is outside of the hydrophobic knob.</p><p>[Editors' note: the author responses to the re-review follow.]</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Please show quantitation of at least some of the key NPC2 mutants (vs. wild type) in terms of their actual endocytosed levels and correlated abilities to correct the filipin staining phenotype shown in Figure 9.</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewers request quantification of the amount of WT or mutant NPC2 protein taken up by cells and correlation with cholesterol accumulation (Figure 9). We’d like to respectfully point out, however, that unlike experiments where plasmids encoding for various WT and mutant proteins are transfected and where non-equivalent expression levels can be an important variable, we used purified NPC2 proteins (not conditioned media) and added the identical amounts of each protein to identical cultures of NPC2 deficient cells. Further, we draw attention to prior literature in which investigators incubated NPC2 proteins with NPC2-deficient cells. In none of the following reports, which to our knowledge are the only studies published, was quantification of the amount of different proteins taken up performed:</p><p>1) Ko et al., (2003), WT NPC2 and point mutants</p><p>2) Liou et al., (2006), different NPC2 glycoforms</p><p>3) Wang et al., (2010) WT and NPC2 point mutants</p><p>4) McCauliff et al., (2015) WT and NPC2 point mutants</p><p>Our reasonable assumption is that the different proteins are taken up equivalently, given (1) the proteins all fold properly as evidenced by their cholesterol binding affinities, thus their shapes and sizes are virtually if not entirely identical and (2) the uptake of exogenous proteins, and even other macromolecules added to media such as cyclodextrins, into fibroblasts occurs via endocytosis. Since the fibroblasts themselves are not variable, all the cell culture wells are reasonably assumed to endocytose equal amounts of culture media. We have now included these assumptions in the manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Please discuss more fully the NPC1-dependence or -independence of the LBPA/NPC2 pathway.

While normal LE/LY cholesterol efflux is also dependent upon functional NPC1 protein, our studies have additionally indicated, as have others (Boadu et al., 2012; Goldman and Krise, 2010; Kennedy et al., 2012), that cholesterol can pass the limiting lysosomal membrane in the absence of functional NPC1 in a yet to be fully determined pathway; it is the contribution of this NPC1-independent pathway that we are referring to. In our previous letter, we indeed indicated that we are unable to determine whether or not this NPC1-independent pathway functions under normal conditions or is a compensatory mechanism for correcting cholesterol accumulation in NPC1 disease. In a non-disease state, where both NPC1 and NPC2 proteins are functional, it seems likely that the main pathway of cholesterol egress involves (1) an obligate interaction between NPC2 and LBPA to transfer cholesterol from inner-LE/LY membranes to NPC2 and (2) “hydrophobic handoff” of cholesterol from NPC2 to NPC1 at the limiting membrane with NPC1 facilitating final stage of efflux from the endolysosomal compartment. We apologize if the statements made in our letter caused confusion, and have modified the discussion to ensure that the dependence of intracellular cholesterol trafficking on the NPC2-LBPA interaction is clear. Again, our main point is not the existence of a potentially NPC1-independent mechanism of cholesterol egress; the highly novel aspect of our findings is that there is an obligate interaction between NPC2 and LBPA that is required for cholesterol egress from the LE/LY.</p><p>The additional citation (Li et al., 2016) has been added in reference to NPC2-NPC1 interaction. Thank you for pointing this out.</p></body></sub-article></article>
