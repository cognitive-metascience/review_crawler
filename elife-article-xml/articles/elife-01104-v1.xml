biases. For example, forensic entomology is widely used to assess the postmortem interval (PMI), but errors can range from days to months. Microbes may provide a novel method for estimating PMI that avoids many of these limitations. Here we show that postmortem microbial community changes are dramatic, measurable, and repeatable in a mouse model system, allowing PMI to be estimated within approximately 3 days over 48 days. Our results provide a detailed understanding of bacterial and microbial eukaryotic ecology within a decomposing corpse system and suggest that microbial community data can be developed into a forensic tool for estimating PMI.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.01104.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.01104.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.01104.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Our bodies—especially our skin, our saliva, the lining of our mouth and our gastrointestinal tract—are home to a diverse collection of bacteria and other microorganisms called the microbiome. While the roles played by many of these microorganisms have yet to be identified, it is known that they contribute to the health and wellbeing of their host by metabolizing indigestible compounds, producing essential vitamins, and preventing the growth of harmful bacteria. They are important for nutrient and carbon cycling in the environment.</p><p>The advent of advanced sequencing techniques has made it feasible to study the composition of this microbial community, and to monitor how it changes over time or how it responds to events such as antibiotic treatment. Sequencing studies have been used to highlight the significant differences between microbial communities found in different parts of the body, and to follow the evolution of the gut microbiome from birth. Most of these studies have focused on live animals, so little is known about what happens to the microbiome after its host dies. In particular, it is not known if the changes that occur after death are similar for all individuals. Moreover, the decomposing animal supplies nutrients and carbon to the surrounding ecosystem, but its influence on the microbial community of its immediate environment is not well understood.</p><p>Now Metcalf et al. have used high-throughput sequencing to study the bacteria and other microorganisms (such as nematodes and fungi) in dead and decomposing mice, and also in the soil beneath them, over the course of 48 days. The changes were significant and also consistent across the corpses, with the microbial communities in the corpses influencing those in the soil, and vice versa. Metcalf et al. also showed that these measurements could be used to estimate the postmortem interval (the time since death) to within approximately 3 days, which suggests that the work could have applications in forensic science.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.01104.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.01104.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author keywords</title><kwd>decomposition</kwd><kwd>microbial succession</kwd><kwd>time since death</kwd><kwd>forensics</kwd><kwd>postmortem interval</kwd><kwd>microbial ecology</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Amazon Web Services (AWS) in Education Researchers Grant</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Knight</surname><given-names>Rob</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>National Institutes of Justice</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>2011-DN-BX-K533</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Metcalf</surname><given-names>Jessica L</given-names></name><name><surname>Fierer</surname><given-names>Noah</given-names></name><name><surname>Carter</surname><given-names>David O</given-names></name><name><surname>Knight</surname><given-names>Rob</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Howard Hughes Medical Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Knight</surname><given-names>Rob</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>High-throughput sequencing has been used to analyze the microbiome of mouse corpses over a period of 48 days, and to provide an accurate estimate of the time since death.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Forensic science is concerned with identifying and interpreting physical evidence. Long-standing forms of physical evidence include fingerprints, bloodstains, hairs, fibers, soils, and DNA. However, any object can serve as physical evidence if it provides reliable insight into the activities associated with a death scene or crime. Physical evidence is often of critical importance to a criminal investigation because testimonial evidence, the statements provided by victims, suspects, and witnesses, is frequently incomplete and inaccurate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Saks and Koehler, 2005</xref>). To address these limitations of testimony, an investigator will compare the statements to the interpretation of physical evidence. For example, an investigator will require a suspect to provide an alibi to describe his or her whereabouts during the time period of a crime and compare their statement to mobile phone activity.</p><p>One of the most difficult forms of physical evidence to establish is the amount of time that has lapsed since death, the postmortem interval (PMI). Establishing the PMI is critical to every death investigation because it facilitates the identification of victims and suspects, the acceptance or rejection of suspect alibis, the distribution of death certificates, and the allocation of assets outlined in wills. However, PMI is difficult to establish because we have a relatively poor understanding of corpse decomposition. To improve the ability to estimate PMI, forensic science has incorporated an ecological perspective. When an animal dies it becomes a large nutrient resource that can support a complex and phylogenetically diverse community of organisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Mondor et al., 2012</xref>). As this decomposer community recycles nutrients, the corpse progresses through several forensically recognized stages of decomposition, including Fresh (before decomposition begins), Active Decay, which includes Bloating and Rupture, and Advanced Decay (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Carter et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Parkinson et al., 2009</xref>). Biotic signatures associated with these stages of decomposition, such as the development rate of blow fly larvae (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Amendt et al., 2007</xref>), succession of insects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Horenstein et al., 2010</xref>), and changes in the biochemistry of corpse-associated ‘gravesoil’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Tullis and Goff, 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Vass et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Benninger et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Carter et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Horenstein et al., 2010</xref>), can be used to estimate PMI. However, no method is successful in every scenario (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Tibbett and Carter, 2008</xref>). For example, limitations of forensic entomology include uncertainty in the interval between death and egg deposition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Tomberlin et al., 2011</xref>), lack of insects during particular weather events or seasons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Archer and Elgar, 2003</xref>), and region-specific blowfly larval growth curves and insect communities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Gallagher et al., 2010</xref>). Using microbial community change to track the progression of decomposition may circumvent many of these limitations because microbes are ubiquitous in the environment, located on humans before death, and can be reliably quantified using high-throughput DNA sequencing.</p><p>Microbes play an important role in decomposition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Vass, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Hopkins, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Mondor et al., 2012</xref>). For example, from the Fresh stage to the Bloat stage, enteric microbes likely contribute to putrefaction by digesting the corpse macromolecules, which in turn generates metabolic byproducts that cause the corpse to bloat (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Mondor et al., 2012</xref>). Evans proposed that a major shift in microbial communities occurs at the end of bloat when the body cavity ruptures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Evans, 1963</xref>), as this key event likely shifts the abdominal cavity from anaerobic to aerobic. Additionally at the Rupture stage, nutrient rich body fluids are released into the environment often increasing pH (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Carter et al., 2010</xref>) likely altering endogenous microbial communities. The microbiology of corpse decomposition can now be investigated in detail by utilizing sequencing advances that enable entire communities to be characterized across the timeline of decomposition. These data will not only allow us to understand the underlying microbial ecology of corpse decomposition, but also the feasibility of using microbes as evidence. We must rigorously test whether microbial community change is sufficiently measurable and directional during decomposition to allow accurate estimates of past events such as the PMI. Recently, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Pechal et al. (2013)</xref> demonstrated that skin and mouth bacterial communities followed a consistent trajectory of change during decomposition of three swine corpses over 5 days. Here, we expand upon these initial promising results by characterizing microbial community change in three external sites and one invasively sampled internal site in 40 destructively sampled mouse corpses over 48 days. In addition to characterizing bacterial community change of skin samples, we provide the first high-throughput sequencing characterization of microbial communities in the abdominal cavity and corpse-associated soils. Furthermore, we present the first high-throughput sequencing characterization of microbial eukaryotic community change (e.g., fungi, nematodes, and amoeba) associated with skin sites, the abdominal cavity and corpse-associated soils.</p><p>We conducted a laboratory experiment to characterize temporal changes in microbial communities associated with mouse corpses as they decomposed on soil under controlled conditions for 48 days. We characterized bacteria, archaea, and microbial eukaryotes using a combination of culture-independent, high-throughput DNA sequencing approaches for each sample. To characterize the composition and diversity of bacterial and archaeal communities, we extracted DNA and sequenced partial 16S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) genes for each sample. To characterize the microbial eukaryotic community of each sample, we sequenced partial 18S rRNA genes. To accurately characterize these highly diverse microbial communities, we sequenced ∼100 base pairs of both 16S and 18S amplicons at a depth of millions of sequences using the Illumina HiSeq platform. In order to gain species and genus level taxonomic resolution of key taxa, a much longer fragment of the rRNA gene (roughly 800 base pairs for 16S amplicons and 1200 base pairs for 18S amplicons) was also sequenced at a level of thousands of sequences for a subset of early and late stage decomposition samples on the Pacific Biosciences RS platform. Together, these data allowed us to assess hypotheses long-held by the forensic community about the role of microbes in corpse decomposition, and rigorously test whether changes in microbial communities are predictable over the timeline of decomposition, which is crucial for assessing whether microbes can be used as a ‘clock’ to estimate PMI.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results|discussion"><title>Results and discussion</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Study design and data generation</title><p>We sampled the microbial communities from the mouse corpse abdominal cavity and skin (head and torso), as well as from the associated gravesoil from five replicate corpses over eight time points that spanned 48 days (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Supplementary file 1A</xref>). By using a mouse model, we were able to perform a highly replicated experiment with destructive sampling that enabled us to sample both the surface and interior of each corpse at each sampling time point. Importantly, this approach facilitated access to the abdominal cavity prior to natural corpse rupture, and thus our data addresses forensic hypotheses that the abdominal microbes play a key role in corpse decomposition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Evans, 1963</xref>). This approach contrasts with typical forensic studies of decomposition where one to three donated corpses of human or swine (used as a human model) are used for experiments where only externally accessible body sites are sampled (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Pechal et al., 2013</xref>). A further advantage of using a mouse model system is that the large number of samples allowed us to assess to what extent the intra-individual variation of microbiota that we know is present in living humans and other mammals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Costello et al., 2009</xref>) extends to microbial community change during decomposition.<table-wrap id="tbl1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.01104.003</object-id><label>Table 1.</label><caption><title>Total number of samples collected for each site and abdominal, skin (head and body), soil (with and without corpses)</title><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.01104.003">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.01104.003</ext-link></p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th>Sample type</th><th>Samples collected</th><th>Samples sequenced (16S HiSeq)</th><th>Samples sequenced (18S Hiseq)</th><th>Samples sequenced (PacBio)</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Abdominal</td><td align="char" char=".">65</td><td align="char" char=".">43</td><td align="char" char=".">23</td><td align="char" char=".">12</td></tr><tr><td>Skin of body</td><td align="char" char=".">53</td><td align="char" char=".">33</td><td align="char" char=".">31</td><td align="char" char=".">0</td></tr><tr><td>Skin of head</td><td align="char" char=".">40</td><td align="char" char=".">36</td><td align="char" char=".">29</td><td align="char" char=".">6</td></tr><tr><td>Soil with corpse</td><td align="char" char=".">53</td><td align="char" char=".">46</td><td align="char" char=".">60</td><td align="char" char=".">8</td></tr><tr><td>Soil no corpse</td><td align="char" char=".">12</td><td align="char" char=".">9</td><td align="char" char=".">8</td><td align="char" char=".">0</td></tr><tr><td>Sum</td><td align="char" char=".">223</td><td align="char" char=".">167</td><td align="char" char=".">152</td><td align="char" char=".">26</td></tr></tbody></table><table-wrap-foot><fn><p>We show the number of successfully sequenced samples for each data type, including Illumina Hiseq and Pacific Biosciences.

We assessed the progression of decomposition in two ways. First, we recorded a visual body score estimate for the head and torso according to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Megyesi et al. (2005)</xref> at the time samples were collected. Visual body score estimates suggested that day 0 and 3 primarily included mice considered in the Fresh stage. Days 6, 9, and 13 included mouse corpses that were primarily scored as Active Decay, including the Bloat stage on ∼days 6–9. Finally, mice on days 20, 34, and 48 were primarily categorized as Advanced Decay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Second, after the conclusion of the experiment, we measured the pH of soil samples to estimate the timeframe during which the purging of fluids or Rupture had likely occurred. It is well established that decomposition fluids are released from a body during decomposition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Carter et al., 2007</xref>).

The 16S and 18S Illumina HiSeq datasets were used for downstream statistical analyses (e.g., Mantel tests, PERMANOVA tests, and PMI estimates).

Rupture is a crucial stage during decomposition, in which bloating due to putrefaction breaks open the abdominal cavity, and is expected to result in shifts of the microbial community because the cavity becomes aerobic. Early culture-based investigations conducted without soil lent support to this assumption by showing that many bacteria exploiting a carcass are members of the gut microbiota (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Ingram and Dainty, 1971</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Corry, 1978</xref>). Our results also lend support to these long-held hypotheses. During the Bloating Stage (approximately days 6–9), endogenous anaerobes and facultative anaerobes that are known to be common members of the gut community such as Firmicutes in the families Lactobacillaceae (e.g., <italic>Lactobacillus</italic>) and Bacteroidetes in the family Bacteroidaceae (e.g., <italic>Bacteroides</italic>) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Supplementary file 1B</xref>) increase in the abdominal cavity.

Similar results were discovered for 18S data, but results are not shown.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.01104.013">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.01104.013</ext-link></p></caption><graphic xlink:href="elife-01104-fig6-v1.tif"/></fig></p><p>Overall, bacteria did not perform significantly better in our PMI estimates than microbial eukaryotes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Supplementary file 1D</xref>; two tailed, Wilcoxon signed rank test) and combining both 16S and 18S datasets resulted in the best estimates of PMI (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Supplementary file 1D</xref>), although the improvement was not significant (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Supplementary file 1D</xref>). For each sample site, we estimated the ‘importance’ of each taxon, a measure of its contribution to the PMI estimate, by removing each taxon from the predictive model and calculating the mean percent increase in mean squared error (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Supplementary file 1E</xref>). For bacteria, taxa in the Order Rhizobiales were among the most important predictive taxa at each sample site. For microbial eukaryotes, <italic>Oscheius</italic> was the most important taxon for skin and abdominal sites and the second most important for gravesoil. Fungal taxa of the family Boletales were the most important contributors to PMI regressions for gravesoil. An analysis of models built using small numbers of highly predictive taxa indicates that 5–10 taxa provide approximately the same prediction accuracy as models built with all taxa, as assessed by leave-one-out analyses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>). This holds across domains and sample sites, and identifying diagnostic taxa may be a fruitful avenue for forensic investigation. Future studies involving varied habitat conditions, soil types, etc are needed to identify the most general subset of predictive taxa.</p><p>In all regression analyses, we directly evaluated the predictive strength of the fitted models by holding out one sample, fitting a regression using the remaining <italic>n</italic>–1 samples, and then using the fitted model to predict PMI for the held out sample. This is a more rigorous inference task than simply fitting a regression to all points jointly; it directly assesses the ability of the model to generalize to data it has not seen before. This distinguishes our approach from prior work in which regression models were evaluated by their ability to explain variation in all data points, after being fit to all data points (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Pechal et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>We have provided a proof-of-principle demonstration that microbial community ecology of decomposing corpses has potential to be developed into a complementary forensics tool for estimation of PMI. Additionally, we have provided the first bacterial high-throughput sequence time-series dataset for the abdominal cavity and gravesoil as well as the first microbial eukaryotic high-throughput sequence time-series dataset for the abdominal cavity, gravesoil, and skin sites of a decomposing animal. We also demonstrated that combining complementary sequencing technologies yields high-resolution taxonomic data. Furthermore, the approach described here has several advantages that make widespread adoption of these techniques likely in the future, including continued rapid decline in the cost of DNA sequencing and the ease and familiarity of swab-based sampling at potential crime scenes to law enforcement officers. Given the accuracy of our estimates of PMI, our work suggests a potentially expanded role for microbiological forensic indicators within the criminal justice system. However, the degree to which microbial community changes are sensitive to factors including environmental and edaphic conditions, variation in the human microbiome, and differences among host species, remain to be established in future work. It is promising that <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Pechal et al. (2013)</xref> recently discovered a similar consistent change of skin bacterial communities on three decomposing swine in an outdoor setting. Future studies are crucial because previous forensic investigations using traditional indicators has shown that environmental parameters such as temperature, moisture, soil type, and soil texture can affect the rate at which decomposition occurs and the ability of decomposer organisms to function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Carter et al., 2008</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">2010</xref>). It is likely that these parameters will affect postmortem microbial communities. Consequently, the relationship between these parameters, decomposition, and postmortem microbial communities must be understood to develop a method to estimate PMI that is admissible as physical evidence within the criminal justice system. However, the present work strongly indicates that decomposition is sufficiently reproducible as an indicator of PMI to motivate these additional studies.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s3-1"><title>Experimental set-up and sample collection</title><p>We performed a laboratory experiment in which 40 mice were allowed to decompose on soil graves in the University of Colorado Transgenic Facility, which provides a clean, well-controlled environment. Mice (strain B6C3F1) ranged in age from 36–109 days old and were co-housed by date of birth. To avoid biases by age or relatedness, mice were randomly assigned to one of the eight destructive sampling events. Mice were humanely sacrificed using CO<sub>2</sub> gas followed by cervical dislocation and placed on their right side on top of approximately 200–300 × <italic>g</italic> of soil in a clean 500 ml plastic (Tupperware-type) container with a small hole drilled into each side above soil level to prevent anaerobic conditions. Soil (pH ∼6) was collected from the organic layer of a dry creek bed in Eldorado Creek near Boulder, Colorado and brought to ∼55–60% water holding capacity.</p><p>We destructively sampled five mice across eight time points over 48 days with sampling events occurring more frequently (every 3 days) over the first 2 weeks when the rate of decomposition was greatest. At each time point before sampling the five mouse corpses, we recorded a visual body score estimate for the head and torso following <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Megyesi et al. (2005)</xref>. The head of mice were scored using the following key: <bold>Fresh</bold>: no discoloration (1 point); <bold>Active Decay</bold> (early decomposition): Discoloration (2 points), Purging of decomposition fluids out of eyes, nose, or mouth (3 points), Bloating of neck and/or face (4 points); <bold>Advanced Decay</bold>: Sagging of flesh (5 points), Sinking of flesh (6 points), Caving in of flesh (7 points), Mummification (8 points). The key for the torso is the same as above except that Bloating of abdominal cavity (3 points) precedes Rupture and/or purging of fluids (4 points). (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Supplementary file 1A</xref>, columns ‘KEY_HEAD’ and ‘KEY_TORSO’).</p><p>At each time point, microbial communities of corpses were sampled at one internal and two external body sites while still in an aboveground position on the gravesoil. Sterile swabs (BD BBL, CultureSwab, Becton Dickinson, USA) were used to sample the skin of the head near the mouth and the skin of the belly. Swabs were vigorously rubbed across each skin site. To sample the internal abdominal cavity, we utilized two techniques depending on whether the abdominal cavity could hold liquid or not. In early time points (abdominal cavity integrity, day 0–20), we used a 26 G 1 ml syringe with 0.5 ml of saline to flush and extract microbes from the abdominal cavity. For later time points (day 34 and 48), we made an incision into the cavity and used a swab to sample the site. For day 34, we utilized both sampling techniques. We also sampled soil from underneath each mouse corpse during the experiment. Immediately after sampling and removing the corpse, surface soil was sampled from under the mouse for a total of four samples associated with each decomposing mouse corpse (or five samples total for mice for which two abdominal samples were taken). Additionally, we collected soil samples at days 0, 6, 20, and 48 from a set of no-corpse control soils that were set up the same as the mice graves (∼200–300 × <italic>g</italic> of soil in a clean 500 ml plastic container). For each soil sample, we suspended 1 × <italic>g</italic> of each soil sample in 5 ml of deionized water and measured pH using an Orion 3 Star benchtop pH meter (Thermo Scientific, USA). For each sample, triplicate pH measurements were averaged for a final pH estimate for each sample.

These reads were 100 bp in length. We classified sequence reads into Operational Taxonomic Units (OTUs) on the basis of sequence similarity. Because our sample set included soil and highly decomposed material, we suspected that a substantial number of sequences would not be represented in the reference Greengenes alignment. Therefore, we utilized the QIIME software open-reference OTU picking protocol. Briefly, sequence reads were initially clustered against the February 2011 release of the Greengenes 97% reference dataset (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://greengenes.secondgenome.com/">http://greengenes.secondgenome.com</ext-link>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">DeSantis et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">McDonald et al., 2012</xref>).

We explored taxon abundance patterns by tracking changes in the abundance of taxa over time using custom python scripts. We determined the most changing taxa by assessing abundance at final time point minus abundance at initial time point (using both percentage, count, and combined measures). We tested whether sample sites during Advanced Decay had similar taxa become abundant by comparing weighted UniFrac distances between sites in each the Fresh stage and the Advanced Decay stage. Alpha diversity was estimated using the phylogenetic diversity metric as well as Shannon diversity. These analyses were performed using the QIIME software. To assess the correlation between microbial community change and time, we performed Mantel tests (with recommended option for single factor tests: unrestricted permutation of raw data) using the software package PRIMER v6 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21a">Clarke and Gorley, 2006</xref>). Additionally, we tested for significant changes in microbial communities between the Fresh and Advanced Decay stages for each site and data type with a PERMANOVA test in PRIMER v6 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21a">Clarke and Gorley, 2006</xref>). For statistical analysis, duplicates of samples (e.g., abdominal swab and abdominal liquid/syringe) were removed.</p><p>We regressed PMI directly on the taxon relative abundances (derived from the Illumina HiSeq data) using the Random Forests model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Breiman, 2001</xref>) with version 4.6–7 of the <italic>randomForest</italic> package in <italic>R (</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Liaw and Wiener, 2002</xref>) with default settings. We directly assessed the predictive performance of the regression using leave-one-out (LOO) error estimation, predicting the PMI of each sample using a model trained on the remaining samples. From these LOO errors we calculated the mean error, and standard deviation of the errors with units of days. We performed these regressions within each sample site separately and for bacteria and eukaryotes separately with and without the first and last time points (0 and 48 days) to determine the best body site and timeframe for predicting PMI. Since skin and soil demonstrated the best predictive power (‘Results’), we also merged OTU tables from skin and soil sites as well as marker type to potentially further improve our PMI estimates.</p><p>Since we sampled the internal abdominal cavity using two techniques because of the inability for the abdominal cavity to hold liquid after ∼20–34 days, we controlled for sampling technique. To do this, we sampled day 34 mice using both techniques. Bacterial sequence data generated using both techniques did not reveal significant difference between communities (PERMANOVA pseudo-F = 0.72, p=0.75) and therefore data generated using both sampling techniques were utilized in downstream analyses.</p><p>We found evidence for inhibition in our soil sample DNA extractions. For time points 0–34 days, we extracted DNA from approximately 0.30 × <italic>g</italic> of soil and found that a 1:20 dilution of DNA resulted in the highest percentage of successful amplifications. For the last time point, we extracted DNA from ∼0.10 × <italic>g</italic> of soil to reduce inhibition. To assess whether extracting less soil and relieving inhibition pressure would result in a bias such as a change in amplification efficiency for some bacterial groups, we also re-extracted 0.10 × <italic>g</italic> of soil for a subset of previously collected soil samples (day 0 and day 13). We discovered that the extracting less soil did decrease inhibition, but also resulted in an increase in the relative abundance of actinomycetes across all samples (0.3 × <italic>g</italic> vs 0.1 × <italic>g</italic> soil mean abundance actinomycetes: day 0—mean 0.041 vs 0.26, <italic>t</italic> test p&lt;0.001; day 13—mean 0.06 vs 0.29 <italic>t</italic> test p&lt;0.0001). Therefore the day 48 soil 16S sequence data were not directly comparable to 16S sequence data generated for days 0–34 and were excluded from downstream analyses.

Your article has been favorably evaluated by a Senior editor, Detlef Weigel, myself (as a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors), and two expert reviewers.</p><p>We have discussed our impressions on the manuscript and we have reached a clear consensus. While we all like the data that you have collected and how you have processed it, we feel that the paper is rather “thin” on discussion of the methodology and the implications of the results. In short, we want to see the text extensively revised to offer a more in-depth discussion. Not only of how specific numbers were arrived at, e.g., post-mortem interval estimates, but also of the implications of the work. Also, a more detailed discussion of how the current work represents a major leap beyond <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Pechal et al. 2013</xref> would be welcome. As you will see, we all made individual recommendations which, after discussing amongst ourselves, feel need to be addressed. Thus, I have included them below to help guide you in the revisions. Please note that at this point we feel that aside from the revisions, no additional data collection/experiments are deemed necessary. Also, we feel that as it currently stands <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref> does not add to the manuscript and should be deleted. Alternatively, if you provide a strong case for leaving it in and revise the manuscript to clarify how it supports your findings and main points, it could ultimately be useful.</p><p>Below are the individual comments from the three of us.</p><p><italic>Reviewer 1 (Roberto Kolter)</italic>:</p><p>My comments need to be prefaced with a statement that I am not an expert on these sorts of analyses. I am swayed by the general importance of the work and, from my naïve perspective, feel that the work was properly carried out. However, I do have two main concerns that I feel need to be addressed before we make a final decision on this paper. The first is that I feel that the paper is written too much for the experts in the field and not for a broad scientific audience. Expanded explanation of the significance of the methodologies used and, in particular, the data analyses employed would make for a much improved manuscript. Second, I do have a concern that the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Pechal et al. 2013</xref> publication may take some of the wind out of the sails of the current manuscript. The authors do state that their analysis is much more extensive and controlled. It will be important to expand a bit further on that.</p><p><italic>Reviewer 2</italic>:</p><p>This is an interesting application of cultivation-independent methods for characterizing successional changes during the microbial decomposition of mice corpses. The data indicate that changes in the skin microbiome after death and gravesoils were more reproducible than succession in the abdomen. The authors do not say much about why this was the case.</p><p>Overall, I found that discussion of the study design and findings were “thin” and unsatisfying. I would like to see the manuscript ‘fleshed out’ (no pun intended). Here are examples of questions and issues that the authors might elaborate upon. Why were processes in the abdomen less consistent/reproducible than those that occurred on corpse skin? Would the appearance and abundance of generalist nematodes offer advantages because their numbers might simply reflect total bacteria and be more independent from the specific taxa present? The samples in the time series were from corpses that were ‘incubated’ under controlled conditions – would the outcome change if the environment (climate) was more variable? Were there specific taxa that were particularly good indicators of PMI (and can this approach be tested as a means to improve the usefulness of abdominal samples)? Why are the successional processes on decomposition skin more reproducible than those of the abdomen? Is this likely to be the case with other species? ... and so on. The authors can make this manuscript more interesting than it is in its present form.</p><p><italic>Reviewer 3</italic>:</p><p>This manuscript describes how microbial community composition changes through time following death in a mouse model system. The objectives of the study were to characterize changes in bacterial and microbial eukaryotic communities during decomposition, and to determine if these changes could be used to accurately predict time since death (the post-mortem interval (PMI)). Overall I found the manuscript to be a significant contribution to the field. Suggestions for improvement are outlined below.</p><p>1) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1 fig3">Figures 1 &amp; 3</xref> would benefit from more work. I couldn't locate in the manuscript what all of the time intervals correspond to (3, 6, 9, 12, T5, 24, 48 days?). Given the emphasis of the manuscript is prediction over time, I suggest explicitly marking time on the x axis throughout these figures, and including the point of rupture on all graphs. From an ecology perspective, I would have liked to see all stages of decomposition on the graphs: fresh, bloating, rupture, active &amp; advanced decay. What taxa is denoted by orange in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>? It's not obvious that the skin and soil are similar in late stage decomposition as stated in the manuscript text.</p><p>2) Controls. It would be valuable to have more information about the soil controls. How many soil controls were there? Why is the control soil data averaged in 1A? Were there bacterial or microbial eukaryotes that changed significantly with time in the controls?</p><p>3) Sequence data. It's unclear how the short and long reads were integrated for the analyses. The manuscript reads as if for both 16s and 18s, OTU classification and phylogenetic inference was carried out separately for the short and long reads. To carry out all downstream analyses of taxon and phylogenetic diversity, what was done? What value was added by including the Pacific Biosciences data? How would the results have changed without those long sequences?</p><p>4) PMI estimates. To estimate PMI the authors outline three regression approaches. If I understand correctly, only the results from one approach (regression known PMI against taxon relative abundances) are presented. Why? How, for example, were the stats based on regressing known PMI against the PC1 of a PCoA of unweighted UniFrac distances among samples used? I suggest providing graphs illustrating observed versus predicted PMI values for each site. This would give the reader a visual sense of PMI variation across samples in concert with the predictive performance of the microbial data.</p><p>5) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>: this figure doesn't add much value. It's not evident what is being connected to what in the bipartite network. I can see that white and yellow points are more clearly separated in the left versus right figure. The main clustering in the left figure is eukaryote versus bacteria while the patterns in the right figure are more dominated by sample type with the eukaryote/bacteria samples mixed up. These observations don't transparently relate to the one statement in the paper about the figure, “later stage bacterial communities did share more OTU's and taxa than early stage communities”.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.01104.016</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p>Reviewer 1 (Roberto Kolter):</p><p><italic>My comments need to be prefaced with a statement that I am not an expert on these sorts of analyses.

Accordingly, our predictive model is substantially better.</p><p>Reviewer 2:</p><p><italic>This is an interesting application of cultivation-independent methods for characterizing successional changes during the microbial decomposition of mice corpses.

Is this likely to be the case with other species</italic>?</p><p>We can only speculate at this point about why the changes in microbial communities are more consistent across skin sites and soil than in the abdominal cavity. We think it is worth noting that the environmental change that the abdominal microbial community is exposed to after rupture is much more drastic (anaerobic vs aerobic) than the skin and soil microbial communities experience. Perhaps this dramatic change in environment leads to more stochastic responses by the abdominal microbial community. We have added a brief discussion of this to the manuscript.</p><p><italic>Would the appearance and abundance of generalist nematodes offer advantages because their numbers might simply reflect total bacteria and be more independent from the specific taxa present</italic>?</p><p>We did not collect the type of data necessary (bacterial biomass and total count of nematodes) to directly address this question. Related to this question, we found that microbial eukaryotes alone did not perform better in our PMI estimates than bacteria and that the nematode was not always the most important contributor to PMI estimates based on 18S data. The overall method that we are championing here is to use the Tree of Life to the fullest extent. However, we did also include a new analysis indicating that using 5-10 highly predictive taxa provide approximately the same leave-one-out prediction accuracy as models built with all taxa (see new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). Future studies using contrasting soil types may lend more insight into whether particular taxa are more universal and therefore, potentially useful as taxa-specific forensic indicators.</p><p><italic>The samples in the time series were from corpses that were ‘incubated’ under controlled conditions – would the outcome change if the environment (climate) was more variable</italic>?</p><p>Yes, this is very likely, but we do not know yet. The goal for this study was to establish if microbial succession was a fundamental property of decomposition. Future studies will address how much these properties are affected by such parameters as temperature, moisture, etc. We have expanded our discussion of the implications of our experiment.</p><p><italic>Were there specific taxa that were particularly good indicators of PMI (and can this approach be tested as a means to improve the usefulness of abdominal samples)</italic>?</p><p>Yes, for each PMI regression we have added results from a test of the “importance” values for the taxa. We list the mean percent increase in mean squared error when the taxon is removed from the predictive model, so higher numbers are better. Additionally, we performed an analysis of models built using small numbers of highly predictive taxa and results indicate that 5-10 taxa provide approximately the same leave-one-out prediction accuracy as models built with all taxa.</p><p><italic>The authors can make this manuscript more interesting than it is in its present form. Other than this I have no substantive concerns</italic>.</p><p>Reviewer 3:</p><p><italic>This manuscript describes how microbial community composition changes through time following death in a mouse model system. The objectives of the study were to characterize changes in bacterial and microbial eukaryotic communities during decomposition, and to determine if these changes could be used to accurately predict time since death (the postmortem interval (PMI)). Overall I found the manuscript to be a significant contribution to the field. Suggestions for improvement are outlined below</italic>.</p><p><italic>1)</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1 fig3"><italic>Figures 1 &amp; 3</italic></xref> <italic>would benefit from more work. I couldn't locate in the manuscript what all of the time intervals correspond to (3, 6, 9, 12, T5, 24, 48 days?). Given the emphasis of the manuscript is prediction over time, I suggest explicitly marking time on the x axis throughout these figures, and including the point of rupture on all graphs. From an ecology perspective, I would have liked to see all stages of decomposition on the graphs: fresh, bloating, rupture, active &amp; advanced decay. What taxa is denoted by orange in</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1"><italic>Figure 1B</italic></xref><italic>? It's not obvious that the skin and soil are similar in late stage decomposition as stated in the manuscript text</italic>.</p><p>We have made a number of changes in response to these comments and questions:</p><p>In the first two paragraphs of the Results and Discussion, we have substantially expanded our text providing an overview of the experiment and we have added text and data (visual body score data collected during the experiment) to estimate stages of decomposition.</p><p>To provide a visual overview of the stages of decomposition, we have added a new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> (which includes the pH data previously shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). In panel A of this figure, we provide a scatterplot of visual body score results, which align well with soil pH results (panel B). Together data displayed in panels A and B allow us to estimate a general timeline for the progression of decomposition during our experiments.</p><p>The likely time point of rupture has been made more prominent and added to all results images in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2 fig3">Figures 2 and 3</xref> (16S and 18S results figures). We did not add all stages of decomposition to these figures as we felt it would be too busy.</p><p>We have modified text and figures to consistently list sampling intervals in days (0-48) and not in sampling time point (T0-T7).</p><p>The orange line in original <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref> (now <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>) represents taxa in the family <italic>Alcaligenaceae</italic>. We have re-ordered the color legend so that bacterial families appear in the order that they appear in the line graphs. We hope this makes it easier to match the line colors to the bacterial family.</p><p>We have added new text and statistics supporting the finding that bacterial communities became more similar in the Advanced Decay stage, although they did not converge. We discovered that similar bacterial groups became abundant in later stage communities. We showed that weighted (abundance) UniFrac distances among sites in the Advanced Decay stage were significantly lower than among sites in the Fresh stage.</p><p><italic>2) Controls. It would be valuable to have more information about the soil controls. How many soil controls were there? Why is the control soil data averaged in 1A? Were there bacterial or microbial eukaryotes that changed significantly with time in the controls</italic>?</p><p>Soil controls were originally averaged simply to simplify the 16S and 18S data figures. We have modified both figures to include soil controls shown by time point collected. We have also added methods text describing the collection of control soils and statistical analyses of the microbial communities in the control soils.</p><p><italic>3) Sequence data. It's unclear how the short and long reads were integrated for the analyses. The manuscript reads as if for both 16s and 18s, OTU classification and phylogenetic inference was carried out separately for the short and long reads. To carry out all downstream analyses of taxon and phylogenetic diversity, what was done? What value was added by including the Pacific Biosciences data? How would the results have changed without those long sequences</italic>?</p><p>In the Introduction and Methods sections, we have added and reorganized text to clarify the length of sequence reads for each data type and how the different data types were used in analyses.</p><p><italic>4) PMI estimates. To estimate PMI the authors outline three regression approaches. If I understand correctly, only the results from one approach (regression known PMI against taxon relative abundances) are presented. Why? How, for example, were the stats based on regressing known PMI against the PC1 of a PCoA of unweighted UniFrac distances among samples used? I suggest providing graphs illustrating observed versus predicted PMI values for each site. This would give the reader a visual sense of PMI variation across samples in concert with the predictive performance of the microbial data</italic>.</p><p>We have streamlined and improved text about the method for estimating PMI. We removed the PCoA-based regression analyses because we thought they were confusing and did not add to the paper. We have also added an additional figure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>) to help visualize the PMI results.</p><p><italic>5)</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5"><italic>Figure 5</italic></xref><italic>: this figure doesn't add much value. It's not evident what is being connected to what in the bipartite network. I can see that white and yellow points are more clearly separated in the left versus right figure. The main clustering in the left figure is eukaryote versus bacteria while the patterns in the right figure are more dominated by sample type with the eukaryote/bacteria samples mixed up. These observations don't transparently relate to the one statement in the paper about the figure, “later stage bacterial communities did share more OTU's and taxa than early stage communities”</italic>.</p><p>We have deleted this figure (previous <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>) as requested. We have added an analysis based on the abundance of taxa (weighted UniFrac) and modified text to describe these results.</p></body></sub-article></article>
