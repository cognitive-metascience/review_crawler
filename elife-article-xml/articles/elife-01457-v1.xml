While a broad T cell repertoire requires diverse positively selecting self-peptides, how a single positively selecting ligand influences naive T cell precursor frequency remains undefined. We generated a transgenic mouse expressing a naturally occurring self-peptide, gp250, that positively selects an MCC-specific TCR, AND, as the only MHC class II I-E<sup>k</sup> ligand to study the MCC highly organized immunodominance hierarchy. The single gp250/I-E<sup>k</sup> ligand greatly enhanced MCC-tetramer<sup>+</sup> CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells, and skewed MCC-tetramer<sup>+</sup> population toward V11α<sup>+</sup>Vβ3<sup>+</sup>, a major TCR pair in MCC-specific immunodominance. The gp250-selected V11α<sup>+</sup>Vβ3<sup>+</sup> CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells had a significantly increased frequency of conserved MCC-preferred CDR3 features. Our studies establish a direct and causal relationship between a selecting self-peptide and the specificity of the selected TCRs. Thus, an immunodominant T cell response can be due to a dominant positively selecting self-peptide.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.01457.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.01457.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.01457.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>The immune system protects against disease by recognizing invading pathogens, such as bacteria and viruses, and launching various responses to eliminate them. In vertebrates, such as mice and humans, this response often involves both an ‘innate’ and an ‘adaptive’ component. The innate immune response is fast but it is not targeted at the specific pathogen that needs to be eliminated. The adaptive immune response is slower, but it is also stronger and tailored to combat the specific pathogen that is attacking the host. In general, both the innate and adaptive immune responses work together to combat the infection.</p><p>The innate immune system is activated when host cells are damaged or stressed, or when ‘foreign’ molecules that are tell-tale signs of microbes and pathogens are detected. It enlists white blood cells that engulf and digest infected host cells or pathogens, and then display the digested fragments via proteins called major histocompatibility complexes. The adaptive immune response relies on other white blood cells called B cells (which make antibodies) and T cells (which carry out a variety of roles).</p><p>Each T cell will respond to a very specific fragment of protein displayed by a major histocompatibility complex. Although a bacteria or virus can generate thousands of protein fragments, only a select few will stimulate an immune response. This phenomenon is known as immunodominance.</p><p>As T cells mature in the thymus—a specialized organ located in the chest—they undergo both positive and negative selection. To survive positive selection, the T cells must be able to recognize fragments from the host’s own proteins. Negative selection removes T cells that interact too strongly with these ‘self-peptides’ because such interactions will cause the T cells to destroy the host’s tissues and cause auto-immune diseases. Positive selection is thought to have an important role in immunodominance because it shapes the population of T cells released from the thymus, but it has been difficult to test this hypothesis.</p><p>Now Lo et al. have explored this question by engineering transgenic mice in which gp250—a self peptide that positively selects T cells that respond to a foreign protein called MCC—was the only self peptide to be presented during positive selection. Subsequent experiments showed that the mature T cells released by the thymus increased the fraction of T cells that were capable of responding to the dominant fraction of possible MCC fragments. By establishing a clear connection between positive selection and immunodominance, the work of Lo et al. could assist the development of more effective vaccines.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.01457.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.01457.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author keywords</title><kwd>positive selection</kwd><kwd>self-peptide</kwd><kwd>immunodominance</kwd><kwd>MCC response</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>AI-24157</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Allen</surname><given-names>Paul M</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funder had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The T cell repertoire can display immunodominance to an epitope as a result of optimal positive selection in the thymus by one self-peptide/MHC ligand.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>An individual pathogen encodes thousands of potentially immunogenic epitopes, yet during the course of an infection, generally only a fraction of epitopes actually stimulate T cell response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Sercarz et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Sant et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Weaver and Sant, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Jenkins et al., 2010</xref>). This fundamental feature of T cell responses is known as immunodominance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Sercarz et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Chen et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Yewdell and Del Val, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Yewdell, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Sant et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Weaver and Sant, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Jenkins and Moon, 2012</xref>). Most of the effort in immunodominance studies has focused on the antigen presentation and processing pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Deng et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">van Ham et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Nanda and Sant, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Chen et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Crowe et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Chen and McCluskey, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Lazarski et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Yewdell, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Weaver and Sant, 2009</xref>). Yet immunodominance is also defined by the frequencies of naive T cells specific for individual antigens (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Kotturi et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Jenkins and Moon, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Kwok et al., 2012</xref>). Given that thymic positive selection serves as a major developmental process to generate mature T cell repertoires (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Jameson et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Morris and Allen, 2012</xref>), one may reason positive selection would play a role in determining naive T cell precursor frequency to dictate immunodominance. However, this possibility has been difficult to address directly, due to several technological issues. First, the frequency of T cells specific for individual peptide–MHC ligands is at most about 20–100 cells per million naive T cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Jenkins and Moon, 2012</xref>), making it difficult to identify such an infrequent population. Second, to directly test the potential role of positive selection in immunodominance requires the knowledge of what T cell population specific for a defined antigen a positively selecting ligand is capable of selecting. Therefore, the low frequency of naive T cell precursor and the ignorance of essential information have limited the examination of the roles of positive selecting ligands in dictating naive T cell precursor frequency and immunodominance.</p><p>The murine CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell response against cytochrome <italic>c</italic> is an outstanding model system to investigate the impact of positively selecting ligands on immunodominance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Solinger et al., 1979</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Schwartz, 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Engel and Hedrick, 1988</xref>). Only one single dominant epitope emerges from the immunization of H−2<sup>k</sup> mice with the whole protein of moth cytochrome <italic>c</italic> (MCC) or closely related pigeon cytochrome <italic>c</italic> (PCC) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Hedrick et al., 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Winoto et al., 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Hedrick et al., 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">McHeyzer-Williams and Davis, 1995</xref>). Also, the MCC- or PCC-stimulated CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell response shows highly organized immunodominance hierarches. The MCC- or PCC-specific responses are highly dominated by Vα11<sup>+</sup> TCR, and exhibit several conserved CDR3 features (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Winoto et al., 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Hedrick et al., 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">McHeyzer-Williams and Davis, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">McHeyzer-Williams et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Mikszta et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Newell et al., 2011</xref>). During MCC-specific responses, the Vα11<sup>+</sup>Vβ3<sup>+</sup> CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells are the most dominant responders, while Vα11<sup>+</sup> TCRs pairing with Vβ6<sup>+</sup>, Vβ8<sup>+</sup>, or Vβ14<sup>+</sup> are the subdominant responders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Miyazaki et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Malherbe et al., 2004</xref>). Based on the structural data, certain positions at CDR3α and CDR3β regions, where TCR make contact with MCC peptide, present highly conserved amino acid usages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">McHeyzer-Williams et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Newell et al., 2011</xref>). These features constitute the strength of utilizing cytochrome <italic>c</italic> as a model antigen to study CD4<sup>+</sup> immunodominance. Moreover, the MCC/I-E<sup>k</sup> tetramers have been shown to be able to detect most primary MCC-specific T cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Savage et al., 1999</xref>). Importantly, our laboratory had previously identified a naturally occurring positively selecting self-peptide, termed gp250, for its ability to positively select the MCC-specific TCR: AND (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Lo et al., 2009</xref>). In this study, we have generated a transgenic mouse line, the gp250 single chain (SC) mouse, in which the gp250/I-E<sup>k</sup> was the only MHC class II ligand presented. Combining MCC tetramer analysis and our gp250 SC mice permitted us to elucidate the relationship between positively selecting ligands and antigen specificities of post-selection CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell repertoires.</p><p>Several studies have attempted to investigate the antigen specificities of the post-selection T cell repertoire by limiting the diversity of positively selecting self-peptides (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kouskoff et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Ignatowicz et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Miyazaki et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Fukui et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Grubin et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Ignatowicz et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Nakano et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Surh et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Tourne et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Gapin et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Barton and Rudensky, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Chmielowski et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Barton et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Huseby et al., 2005</xref>).

Altogether these studies concluded that a single peptide could select a large repertoire of T cells and that the recognition of positively selecting ligands is the driving force behind determining the antigen specificities of post-selection T cell repertoire (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Ignatowicz et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Fukui et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Grubin et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Ignatowicz et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Surh et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Fukui et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Gapin et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Barton and Rudensky, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Chmielowski et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Barton et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Huseby et al., 2005</xref>). However, these studies were unable to examine immunodominance because they did not utilize a naturally occurring positively selecting ligand for a defined foreign antigen.</p><p>The selection of Vα11<sup>+</sup>Vβ3<sup>+</sup> TCRs was greatly enhanced in our gp250 SC mice. CDR3 sequencing revealed that gp250 skewed the positive selection toward MCC-reactive conserved CDR3 features, especially those CDR3s with serine at α91 and asparagine at β97. Our hypothesis that gp250 favors the positive selection of MCC-reactive T cells was further supported by the greatly expanded MCC-tetramer<sup>+</sup> population in gp250 SC mice.

To examine gp250’s effect on the post-selection MCC-specific T cell repertoire, we constructed a transgenic mouse line using the MHC class II promoter in which all of the MHC class II molecules contained the gp250 self-peptide via a covalent linkage of the peptide to the MHC class II β chain. We obtained one B6 founder in which the gp250 covalently linked I-E<sup>k</sup> β chain had successfully integrated and was expressed. The I-E<sup>k</sup> α chain was introduced into the founder by crossing to previously generated I-E<sup>k</sup>α transgenic mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Griffiths et al., 1994</xref>).

The single gp250/I-E<sup>k</sup> ligand selected a full TCR Vβ repertoire, in that we did not observe any complete absence of Vβs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). However, the frequencies of some TCR Vβs were decreased, including Vβ2<sup>+</sup>, Vβ4<sup>+</sup>, Vβ8.1/8.2<sup>+</sup>, suggesting gp250/I-E<sup>k</sup> did not positively select individual Vβs with a uniform selection capability (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A</xref>).

Given gp250/I-E<sup>k</sup> was the only ligand presented by MHC class II molecules in gp250 SC mice, it was possible that the increased Vβs were caused by the lack of negative selection.

After a 12-week reconstitution, in B6.K &gt; gp250 chimeras, the frequencies of Vβ5<sup>+</sup>, Vβ11<sup>+</sup> and Vβ12<sup>+</sup> were indistinguishable when compared with B6.K &gt; B6.K chimeras (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1C,D</xref>).

Considering that the size of the CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell population in gp250 SC mice was around 40% of the CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell population in B6.K mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>), the augmented MCC-tetramer<sup>+</sup> frequency was even more impressive. While T cell populations specific for other foreign antigens very likely became smaller, T cells specific for MCC increased in percentage, or at least stayed comparable to T cells selected by diverse self-peptide repertoire in terms of the absolute number. Indeed, the MCC tetramer<sup>+</sup> population was uniquely expanded in the gp250-selected CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell repertoire, as the frequency of the hemoglobin antigen (Hb) tetramer-bound CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell population was equivalent, if not slightly decreased (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C,D</xref>). To show that the increased MCC tetramer<sup>+</sup> population was the product of gp250-mediated positive selection not due to the lack of negative selection, we generated radiation bone marrow chimeras (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E,F</xref>).

We hypothesized that recognition of a positively selecting ligand may influence a specific antigen response through optimizing the selection of dominant TCRs. We therefore included the TCR Vα11 staining in MCC-tetramer experiments to examine the Vα11<sup>+</sup> TCR expression in gp250-selected MCC-specific CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A,B</xref>). In B6.K CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells, the MCC tetramer<sup>+</sup> populations that used Vα11<sup>−</sup> vs Vα11<sup>+</sup> were about equal, whereas in gp250 SC mice, the vast majority of MCC tetramer<sup>+</sup> population expressed Vα11<sup>+</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A,B</xref>). It was the increased Vα11<sup>+</sup> MCC tetramer<sup>+</sup> cells that specifically contributed to the enlarged MCC tetramer<sup>+</sup> population in gp250 SC mice, since the frequency of Vα11<sup>−</sup> MCC tetramer<sup>+</sup> population in gp250 SC mice was comparable with the frequency in B6.K mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). The exclusively enlarged Vα11<sup>+</sup> MCC tetramer<sup>+</sup> population in gp250 SC mice suggested that gp250/I-E<sup>k</sup> specifically favored the positive selection of Vα11<sup>+</sup> TCR, thus resulting in a T cell repertoire profile with the enhanced MCC tetramer-bound population. The MCC tetramer<sup>+</sup> T cells were responsive to MCC, as the sorted MCC tetramer<sup>+</sup> CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells upregulated CD69 while stimulated overnight with MCC-pulsed APC in vitro (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C,D</xref>).<fig id="fig4" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.01457.007</object-id><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><title>The majority of gp250-selected MCC-specific CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells express Vα11<sup>+</sup> TCR.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold> and <bold>B</bold>) The Vα11 expression of MCC-tetramer<sup>+</sup> peripheral CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells in B6.K or gp250 SC mice.

Observing gp250-mediated selection promoted the MCC-specific CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells toward the usage of Vα11<sup>+</sup>, we next examined the selection of MCC-preferred dominant and subdominant TCR pairs in gp250 SC mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). The Vα11<sup>+</sup>-expressing CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells significantly increased in the thymus and periphery in gp250 SC mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A,B</xref>), suggesting gp250/I-E<sup>k</sup> actively skewed the post-selection TCR usages to influence antigen specificities. While examining the TCR Vβ expression among gp250-selected Vα11<sup>+</sup> CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells, MCC-preferred dominant pair Vα11<sup>+</sup>Vβ3<sup>+</sup> increased about 1.4-fold in thymic CD4SP and at least twofold in periphery (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C–E</xref>).

Interestingly, for some Vβs, found commonly to pair with Vα11 in normal mice (such as Vβ2 and Vβ4), the frequencies were unchanged (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>). This observation argued that gp250 specifically promoted the selection of MCC-specific TCR usages, and was not merely functioning as a good selecting ligand for all Vα11<sup>+</sup>. The increased frequency of Vα11<sup>+</sup>Vβ3<sup>+</sup> did not result from the absence of negative selection in gp250 SC mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F</xref>). While reconstituted lethally irradiated gp250 SC mice with B6.K HSC cells, the negative selection in gp250 SC mice was restored due to the presence of B6.K HSC-derived antigen presenting cells in the thymus.

In B6.K mice, about 20% of Vα11<sup>+</sup>Vβ3<sup>+</sup> CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells expressed serine at CDR3 α91, whereas in gp250 SC mice, the frequency was increased 1.5-fold to become about 30% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A,B</xref>). We observed a similar 1.5-fold increase of serine at α91 in single cell repertoire analysis compared to the published data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">McHeyzer-Williams et al., 1999</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>). However, gp250-mediated selection had little impact on skewing the amino acid residue at CDR3 α89, as α89E usages of Vα11<sup>+</sup>Vβ3<sup>+</sup> CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells were comparable with the frequency seen in B6.K (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A,B</xref>). The large-scale bulk CDR3β sequencing showed gp250-mediated positive selection dramatically escalated the usages of β97N, slightly increased the frequency of β99A, and had no effect on the frequency of β99G (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C,D</xref>). Nevertheless, B6.K CDR3β features were highly similar to the published CDR3β’s (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">McHeyzer-Williams et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C,D</xref>). The CDR3 β97N residue was hypothesized to hydrogen bond with MCC P8 backbone carbonyl and MCC P8 threonine side-chain hydroxyl groups (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Newell et al., 2011</xref>). The significantly increased usages of CDR3 α91S and β97N in gp250-selected Vα11<sup>+</sup>Vβ3<sup>+</sup> T cells may also help explain the augmented MCC-tetramer bound population in gp250 SC mice.</p><p>Altogether, our data changed our current understanding of the relationship between positively selecting self-peptides and post-selection T cell repertoire (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). With the well-defined MCC’s highly organized immunodominance hierarchy, we discovered gp250’s active role in promoting the positive selection of good MCC responders. The self-peptide gp250 enhanced the selection of Vα11<sup>+</sup>Vβ3<sup>+</sup> T cells, which were the dominant TCR pair against MCC. These gp250-selected Vα11<sup>+</sup>Vβ3<sup>+</sup> T cells also exhibited conserved MCC-reactive features, including the specific amino acid usages at CDR3 α91 and β97. Our studies showed an ideal positively selecting self-peptide may be a key determinant to optimize immune response against a specific antigen, by enhancing the positive selection of good responders.<fig id="fig7" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.01457.013</object-id><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><title>The evolving concepts of the relationship between positively selecting self-peptide and post-selection T cell repertoire.</title><p>The figures show the progress of our understanding about the relationship between thymic self-peptides and post-selection CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell repertoire, and are arranged in chorological order. The first finding from late 90′ revealed that one positively selecting self-peptide was capable of selecting many different TCRs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Ignatowicz et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Ignatowicz et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Liu et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Huseby et al., 2005</xref>). A few years later, Barton and Rudensky proposed that even though one self-peptide may select many TCRs, a diverse low abundant self-peptide repertoire is required to generate a full TCR repertoire (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Barton and Rudensky, 1999</xref>). Subsequently, with the publication of a series of single chain mice, the model was further refined because even though the TCR repertoire selected by one single ligand was not reduced significantly enough to allow an visualization of a repertoire ‘hole’, the postselection T cells in each single chain mouse showed different degrees of self-peptide reactivity in mixed lymphocyte culture (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Barton et al., 2002</xref>). These studies showed that a diverse collection of positively selecting self-peptides were necessary to generate a full T cell repertoire (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Barton and Rudensky, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Barton et al., 2002</xref>). This present study involving the gp250 self-peptide showed increased frequency of Vα11<sup>+</sup>Vβ3<sup>+</sup> CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells with MCC-preferred CDR3 features in gp250 SC mice. The Vα11<sup>+</sup>Vβ3<sup>+</sup> CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells with specific CDR3 features were the dominant responders to promote MCC primary and memory responses. Therefore, gp250’s selecting capability provided a possible explanation to elucidate Vα11<sup>+</sup> TCR-driven MCC immunodominance: a positively selecting self-peptide may favor the selection of TCR pairs and CDR3 features that were specific for MCC responses.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.01457.013">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.01457.013</ext-link></p></caption><graphic xlink:href="elife-01457-fig7-v1.tif"/></fig></p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Immunodominance describes a common phenomenon of T cell immune responses. Yet the role of positive selection in immunodominance has not been established. In this study, we reported that CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells specific for a defined antigen are positively selected by a common self-peptide. The self-peptide gp250 positively selected AND TCR, supporting our previous in vitro study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Lo and Allen, 2013</xref>), and also selected many other TCRs that have been reported as good MCC responders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Hedrick et al., 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">McHeyzer-Williams et al., 1999</xref>). Our data reveal for the first time that positive selection may influence the TCR V(D)J preference and specific CDR3 junction sequences, and thus shape T cell response to a specific antigen. Our studies therefore offer direct evidence and a new perspective on how to generate a post-selection CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell repertoire with desired antigen specificities, through engineering the positively selecting self-peptide.</p><p>The gp250-selected CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell repertoire analysis uncovered several very interesting results regarding the specificity of recognizing a positively selecting self-peptide, as well as the relationship between a positively selecting self-peptide and post-selection T cells. In the bulk population TCR repertoire analysis, the CDR3α was found for the well-characterized AND, 5c.c7 and 226 TCRs and also for the majority of published MCC-preferred clones. These findings suggested that one selecting ligand can select as many CDR3s with conserved features for specific antigen recognition as a full self-peptide repertoire could select. Previously, the Davis laboratory and we have shown in vitro that the self-peptide for AND and 5c.c7 TCRs were mutually exclusive with each other (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Ebert et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Lo and Allen, 2013</xref>). The basis for why 5c.c7 was selected in vivo but not in vitro by gp250 probably reflects the relative inefficiency of the in vitro positively selecting assays. Our data suggest these strong MCC-reactive TCR clones may share a common positively selecting ligand, and support our hypothesis that positive selection may be the foundation of T cell immunodominance.</p><p>Our finding that gp250 was sufficient to generate a reduced but still a large number of mature CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells, with a full but skewed range of TCR usages, was similar to the observations in other single peptide mice, such as Eα-, CD22-, or Rab-mediated positive selection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Ignatowicz et al., 1996</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Barton and Rudensky, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Barton et al., 2002</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). However, in those previously published studies, the specificity of post-selection repertoire was only examined at a cursorily level by stimulating the CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells with random known antigens. The gp250 SC mice, however, successfully provided some key insights toward the relationship between positively selecting self-peptide and post-selection CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells. Thanks to the well-studied MCC polyclonal T cell responses, we were thus able to discover some unique features of positive selection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">McHeyzer-Williams and Davis, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">McHeyzer-Williams et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Mikszta et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Malherbe et al., 2004</xref>). We found positively selecting self-peptide may favor some unique CDR3 features, which may serve as a good primary and memory responder toward a specific antigen in the periphery.</p><p>Consistent with previous studies, the gp250 peptide was able to select a large number of CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells. This observation makes sense when one considers that the number of selecting self-peptides presented in cortical thymic epithelial cells is smaller than the size of mature CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell repertoire (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Lo and Allen, 2013</xref>). Therefore, one positively selecting self-peptide has to select a large number of CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell with diverse, unrelated antigen specificities, to be able to generate a full CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell repertoire. The thymic development of regulatory T cells is also dependent upon self-peptides, and requires the strong interaction with these self-peptide MHC ligands (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Gottschalk et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Ohkura and Sakaguchi, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Corse et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Ohkura et al., 2013</xref>). However, our preliminary analysis of CD25 expression of CD4SP in the gp250 SC mice did not reveal any significant differences from B6.K mice. The comparable regulatory T cell frequencies in gp250 SC mice and B6.K mice suggested that merely altering the self-peptide diversity was not sufficient to manipulate the affinity threshold for regulatory T cell selection. The finding was perhaps not surprising, given the potential TCR diversity through CDR3 recombination mechanism is nearly infinite, and both the TCR and the self-peptide determine the strength of interaction.</p><p>Our data showed gp250 could select many different Vα11 TCRs. How could a peptide influence the selection of many different Vα chains, with a range of CDR3α sequences? The general binding mode of TCR to pMHC has the CDR1 and CDR2 contacting the MHC, and the CDR3 contacting the peptide. One explanation comes from the crystal structure of the 226 TCR bound to MCC/I-E<sup>k28</sup>. The side chain of the Arg29 residue of the Vα11 CDR1 makes a hydrogen bond with the backbone carbonyl oxygen of the P3 residue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Newell et al., 2011</xref>). Thus gp250 could position the P3 carbonyl oxygen ideally to form this hydrogen bond, and thus favoring Vα11 TCRs. Further structural studies will be needed to reveal the molecular basis of how a single peptide can select defined TCRs.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Mice</title><p>B6.K (H-2<sup>k</sup>) (JAX 001148) and B6 MHC class II<sup>−/−</sup> (JAX 003584) mice were obtained from the Jackson Laboratory.

Your article has been favorably evaluated by a Senior editor and 2 reviewers, one of whom, Michel Nussenzweig, is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the other, Steve Hedrick, has also agreed to reveal his identity.</p><p>The Reviewing editor and the other reviewers discussed their comments before we reached this decision, and the Reviewing editor has assembled the following comments to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>The present paper examines the role of thymic positive selection to a single self-peptide in determining the frequency of T cells specific for a foreign peptide/MHC II that end up in the naïve CD4 repertoire; based on the work of others, they equate this with the phenomenon of immunodominance in the T cell immune response. This is a valuable piece of basic research and contributes new quantitative data to our understanding of what positive selection of the repertoire actually means. They have chosen a good model system to use in this study as a lot is known about the molecular specificity of CD4 T cell recognition of moth/pigeon cytochrome c peptides bound to I-E<sup>k</sup>. This allows them to see subtle but significant increases in the frequency of certain contact amino acid residues (α91S and β97N) in the naïve repertoire when only gp250/I-E<sup>k</sup> self-ligand is the selecting element. Their chimera experiments show that these observations are not due to negative selection. This work we think adds significantly to the literature and should be published.</p><p>1) Our only concern about the paper is the discussion of the specificity controls involving the 5c.c7 TCR. Intriguingly, previous in vitro experiments from Mark Davis' lab showed that the major self-peptide (GP peptide) selecting that particular moth cytochrome c-specific TCR is different from the one used for the AND TCR. Thus, one would suspect that the repertoire changes seen with gp250 might not include those seen with the GP peptide and vice versa. While doing the complete crisscross set of experiments with a GP-peptide, antigen transgenic would be the ideal science to test this hypothesis, we think that would require several more years of research and would be asking far too much to be done for any journal. Instead, the authors try to argue that the TCR CDR3α signature sequence for 5c.c7 (as well as that for the 226 T cell) was not found in their single cell TCR Vα11 sampling and thus was not enriched by gp250/I-E<sup>k</sup> mono-selection. However, they only sequence a total of 38 Vα11 clones, among which they found only 2 had the AND CDR3α sequence. This is not a large enough sample size to reach a significant conclusion. We therefore think they should repeat this CDR3α single cell sequencing experiment to increase their sample size to a number from which they can show statistical significance for the enrichment of AND CDR3α and still no detectable 5c.c7 and 226 CDR3α sequences.</p><p>2) In the first figure it seems that gp250 preferentially selects for CD8 T cells. Have the authors examined these cells for TCR receptor usage, and do they differ from the CD4s?</p><p>3) Please describe in more detail the B6K&gt;gp250 chimeras and why this relates to negative selection (i.e., increases the selecting self peptides...).</p><p>4) <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl3">Table 3</xref>: the authors might want to reference the initial sequence description of many of the TCR sequences presented, Science, March, 1988. The description and points made in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref> are unclear. Please re-write this section. Again, in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref>, please make clear why this experiment restores negative selection.</p><p>5) It is not entirely clear how the present data suggest a model different from that of Barton and Rudensky. Did B and R really specify that all the T cell clones specific for a given antigen-peptide originate from a single positively selecting peptide? Or is the proposed model more of a modification of the B and R proposal?</p><p>6) The authors sequenced 38 TCR chains and did not detect the 5c.c7 or 226 TCR CDR3α chains. They conclude that the gp250 peptide does not select this TCRα sequence. To bolster this claim, they could analyze the frequency of repeat sequences and from this calculate the total number of sequences selected by gp250. Without sequencing more chains, they might be able to predict the likelihood that another unique sequence will be found. Either way they can use this analysis to comment on the possibility that they have just missed the 5c.c7 sequence.</p><p>7) Overall there are some very rough stretches of writing. This is particularly true of the Discussion. “What our data reveal for the first time, to our knowledge, is alternation of positively selecting self-peptide repertoire can lead to gain-of- function specificity of post-selection T cell repertoire.” We don't know what that means, and grammatically it is a little awkward. The following sentence including, “imprint the post-selection T cells toward the recognition of a specific antigen...” We don't think that is what the authors intend. Our interpretation of the data is that positive selection can influence the TCR V(D)J preference and specific junctional sequence usage in the T cell response to a specific antigen. Positive selection can imprint preferential VDJ sequences on an antigen response. It doesn't imprint the post-selection T cells toward the recognition of a specific antigen-that issue is not addressed in this study. We recommend a close examination of the Discussion.</p><p>In addition, this manuscript is written for a specialist in the field, and it could be made to be more suited to a general interest journal.</p><p>Overall this is a lovely study using a newly created mouse strain to probe the nuances of positive selection in the thymus, and its influence on an antigen response. With a little more analysis and editing, it would make a strong contribution to the literature on T cell development.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.01457.015</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>1) and 6) Our only concern about the paper is the discussion of the specificity controls involving the 5c.c7 TCR […] Without sequencing more chains, they might be able to predict the likelihood that another unique sequence will be found.

Among the 38 sequences, we did not find 5c.c7 TCRs. The reviewers raised an excellent point that we probably simply missed the 5c.c7, given the limited size of our single cell repertoire database. We were very intrigued by the question that whether or not gp250 can select 5c.c7 TCR, and believed the manuscript would be strengthened by having a definitive answer. We therefore collaborated with Dr. Chyi Hsieh to perform bulk population repertoire analysis of CDR3α sequences. We sorted Vα11<sup>+</sup>Vβ3<sup>+</sup> CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells from gp250 SC mice or B6.K mice, generated Vα11<sup>+</sup> TCR library, and sequenced using Illumina MiSeq technology at the Washington University Genome Sequencing Center. In gp250-selected CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells, we identified about 2900 unique CDR3α sequences, and we did find 5c.c7 TCR as well as AND (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl3">Table 3</xref>). More importantly, now with such a large dataset of CDR3α sequences, we were able to re-examine the MCC-preferred CDR3α features in gp250 SC and B6.K mice. Consistent with the previous observation, gp250-mediated positive selection enriched the usage of serine at CDR3 α91 residue. In B6.K mice, about 20% of Vα11<sup>+</sup>Vβ3<sup>+</sup> CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells expressed serine at CDR3 α91, whereas in gp250 SC mice, we observed about 1.5 fold increase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). With these thousands of sequences, we believe our conclusion on the gp250-enriched MCC-preferred CDR3 features were further strengthened. We included the new data in the newly revised <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl3">Table 3</xref>. We also revised the Results and Discussion accordingly.</p><p><italic>2) In the first figure it seems that gp250 preferentially selects for CD8 T cells. Have the authors examined these cells for TCR receptor usage, and do they differ from the CD4s</italic>?</p><p>Given that the gp250 SC mice expressed normal class I molecules, we did not anticipate any direct effect on CD8 T cell development, but there could have been some indirect effect. We now included quantification of CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells displayed in absolute numbers in the newly revised <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>. While examining absolute cell numbers of CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells, we did not find any significant difference between gp250 SC mice and B6.K mice. We also examined TCR Vβ repertoire of CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells in B6.K HSC reconstituted gp250 SC chimeras, and the TCR Vβ repertoire was comparable to CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells in B6.K HSC reconstituted B6.K chimeras (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2–figure supplement 1</xref>). In marked contrast, certain Vβ usages in gp250-selected CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells were decreased, including Vβ2, Vβ4, and Vβ8.1/8.2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2–figure supplement 1</xref>). Overall, we only noticed the significant change in MHCII-restricted positive selection but not MHCI-restricted positive selection. We reasoned this observation was in line with what was expected, because we had only manipulated the class II peptides being presented.

We have generated a revised figure to address this concern (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). In previous work, Barton and Rudensky compared the OVA or HEL specific responses of CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells selected by four different single peptide ligands, and found no difference among the T cell proliferation against OVA or HEL in these four mice. While conducting mixed lymphocyte culture with wild type antigen presenting cells, they found T cells from these four single peptide mice exhibited different degrees of proliferation against self-peptides. They concluded each single positively selecting ligand was capable of selecting CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells specific for the antigens they tested, but each postselection population was unique in terms of self-reactivity. In gp250 SC mice with the well-established MCC-specific T cell features, we argued one positively selecting self-peptide enhanced the selection of certain TCRs with conserved CDR3 features to dominate in a given antigen response (such as gp250 favors the selection of MCC-specific T cells). The revised illustration model is now provided in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>.</p><p><italic>7) Overall there are some very rough stretches of writing</italic>.</p><p>The text of this version has been extensively revised to develop a more clear and cohesive storyline that focuses on and better explains the major findings of our study.
