Here we describe a human cell surface receptor that couples ligand binding and force to trigger a chemical event which controls the adhesive properties of the receptor. Our studies of the secreted platelet oxidoreductase, ERp5, have revealed that it mediates release of fibrinogen from activated platelet αIIbβ3 integrin. Protein chemical studies show that ligand binding to extended αIIbβ3 integrin renders the βI-domain Cys177-Cys184 disulfide bond cleavable by ERp5. Fluid shear and force spectroscopy assays indicate that disulfide cleavage is enhanced by mechanical force. Cell adhesion assays and molecular dynamics simulations demonstrate that cleavage of the disulfide induces long-range allosteric effects within the βI-domain, mainly affecting the metal-binding sites, that results in release of fibrinogen. This coupling of ligand binding, force and redox events to control cell adhesion may be employed to regulate other protein-protein interactions.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.34843.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Many proteins embedded in a cell’s surface allow the cell to interact with its surroundings. Integrins are a group of cell surface proteins that have many uses in different cells. Integrins become activated when they come into contact with other specific proteins, which like other molecules that bind to proteins are referred to collectively as “ligands”. Much research has focused on how ligands become attached to integrins and how this activates these cell surface proteins. Yet how integrins release ligands and become inactive has not been studied before.</p><p>One type of integrin, called αIIbβ3, is involved in blood clotting. Found on the surface of blood platelets – the fragments of cells in the blood that play a central role in clotting, this integrin binds to a ligand called fibrinogen. Fibrinogen links platelets together to form clots by building bridges between integrins. Passam, Chiu et al. have now studied platelets from donated human blood to understand how the integrin αIIbβ3 disengages from fibrinogen.</p><p>The investigation showed that an enzyme called ERp5 aids the release of fibrinogen from the integrin. ERp5 can be released by blood vessel walls and by activated platelets. The experiments revealed that ERp5 breaks a chemical link, called a disulfide bond, in the integrin, but only when the protein is already bound to its ligand. Breaking the disulfide bond (a chemical process known as reduction) changes the integrin’s structure so that it lets go of fibrinogen. Moreover, when physical forces such as blood flow put the integrin under strain, the ERp5 enzyme becomes more effective.</p><p>These findings show how ligand binding and mechanical force work together to control the breaking of a chemical bond in a human integrin. This chemical event then in turn controls the release of the integrin's ligand. It is possible that other protein-protein interactions may involve similar mechanisms, but this remains to be explored.</p><p>Lastly, Passam, Chiu et al. suggest that the release of fibrinogen might help to limit the growth of blood clots so they do not block the blood vessels. Further studies should test this hypothesis. Inappropriate clotting can have severe health effects including heart attacks and strokes. As such, this investigation may hint at a more subtle way to regulate clotting through integrin αIIbβ3, such as boosting fibrinogen release to see if it helps slow or reduce clotting without stopping it altogether.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>redox</kwd><kwd>allosteric disulfide</kwd><kwd>integrin</kwd><kwd>mechanical

sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Protein function is controlled by a variety of chemical modifications to amino acid side chains, cleavage or isomerization of peptide bonds and cleavage or formation of disulfide bonds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Butera et al., 2014a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Cook and Hogg, 2013</xref>). These chemical reactions are usually facilitated by enzymes and their cofactors. Mechanical force is another factor that is increasingly being recognized to control protein chemical reactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Garcia-Manyes and Beedle, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Cross, 2016</xref>). Mechanical force can markedly reduce the reaction energy barrier. Reactions that are too slow become relevant on a biological time scale and others would not occur at all without the input of force. Low forces can trigger bond rotation and rupture of hydrogen bonds, while high forces can break or form covalent bonds. A number of cell surface receptors have been shown to be regulated by mechanical forces (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chen et al., 2017</xref>), including the integrins.</p><p>Vertebrates express 24 different integrins that comprise one of 18 different α-subunits and one of 8 different β-subunits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Hynes, 2002</xref>). Integrin-mediated adhesion and signalling events regulate virtually all cell growth and differentiation, while dysregulation of integrins are involved in the pathogenesis of cancer, auto-immune conditions and vascular thrombosis. The integrin heterodimers recognize overlapping but distinct sets of ligands on other cells, extracellular matrix or on pathogens. The integrins are type one trans-membrane proteins that consist of large extracellular segments characterized by various domains and small transmembrane and cytoplasmic segments.</p><p>Most integrins exist on the cell surface in an inactive state that does not bind ligand or signal. Integrins are activated by intracellular stimuli such as talin binding through a process termed inside-out signalling, and by ligand occupancy that transduces extracellular signals into the cytoplasm through outside-in signalling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Tadokoro et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Luo et al., 2007</xref>). Affinity for ligands is mostly controlled by global and local conformational rearrangements of the integrin ectodomains. The extracellular segments exist in at least three conformational states: the bent conformation with closed headpiece (low affinity for ligand), the extended conformation with closed headpiece (intermediate affinity) and the extended conformation with open headpiece (high-affinity) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Zhu et al., 2013</xref>). While much is known about the structure and function of resting and activated integrins, little is known about how integrins disengage from their ligands.</p><p>For instance, when cells migrate, integrins adhere at the leading edge and de-adhere at the trailing edge. Force has been suggested as one of the mechanisms to explain both the engagement and disengagement of ligand (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Zhu et al., 2008</xref>). It was proposed that binding of the integrin β subunit cytoplasmic domain to actin filaments results in lateral translocation of the integrin heterodimer on the cell surface that causes integrin extension. Engagement of immobilised extracellular ligand greatly increases this lateral force that favours the high-affinity, open headpiece conformation. Disassembly of the actin cytoskeleton and dissociation of the β subunit cytoplasmic domain removes the lateral force that results in the closed headpiece conformation and ligand disengagement. In support of this model, cells become highly elongated and stop migrating when integrins are locked in the high-affinity conformation or when actin disassembly is blocked in the uropod (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Smith et al., 2007</xref>). Here we report a chemical modification of an activated integrin that results in disengagement of ligand.</p><p>Platelet clumping at sites of blood vessel injury is mediated by cross-linking of platelet αIIbβ3 integrin by the bivalent ligand, fibrinogen. This integrin is critical for thrombus formation and is the target of successful anti-thrombotic agents in routine clinical use for acute coronary syndrome. ERp5 is a protein disulfide isomerase (PDI) family member oxidoreductase released from platelets upon activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Jordan et al., 2005</xref>), and from platelets and endothelial cells at sites of thrombosis in mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Passam et al., 2015</xref>). Human platelets contain about 13,300 molecules of ERp5 per platelet (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Burkhart et al., 2012</xref>), while mouse platelets contain an estimated 60,000 molecules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Zeiler et al., 2014</xref>). Secreted ERp5 binds to the β3 subunit of platelet surface αIIbβ3 integrin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Jordan et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Passam et al., 2015</xref>). Systemic inhibition of ERp5 with function-blocking antibodies inhibits thrombosis in mice, which implies an essential role for secreted ERp5 in this biology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Passam et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>Our studies indicate that ERp5 mediates de-adhesion of activated platelet αIIbβ3 integrin from fibrinogen. Ligand binding to extended αIIbβ3 integrin triggers cleavage of the βI-domain Cys177-Cys184 disulfide by ERp5, which is enhanced by mechanical force. Cleavage of the disulfide results in release of fibrinogen due to allosteric effects at the metal-ion-dependent adhesion (MIDAS) site.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>ERp5 triggers fibrinogen dissociation from αIIbβ3 integrin</title><p>Immunoblotting of human platelet lysate and releasate indicates that approximately half of the platelet ERp5 molecules are released into the supernatant upon activation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). ERp5 binds to β3 integrin with a dissociation constant in the low micromolar range (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Passam et al., 2015</xref>), and an anti-ERp5 antibody has been reported to inhibit fibrinogen binding to activated platelets and platelet aggregation in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Jordan et al., 2005</xref>). These findings suggested that ERp5 directly regulates platelet αIIbβ3 integrin function, although the mechanism remains elusive. We examined the effect of soluble ERp5 on platelet αIIbβ3 integrin activation and fibrinogen binding.</p><p>Incubation of washed platelets with ERp5 did not trigger αIIbβ3 integrin activation, and ERp5 had no effect on integrin activation by ADP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Integrin activation was measured by binding of PAC-1, an antibody that recognizes the fully activated integrin with an open headpiece (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Shattil et al., 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Luo et al., 2003</xref>). This result indicated that ERp5 is not directly involved in integrin activation, so we explored a role for ERp5 in post-activation events. Effect of soluble ERp5 on the kinetics of adhesion of washed platelets to fibrinogen as a function of fluid shear force was examined (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). There was a biphasic effect of ERp5 on platelet binding to fibrinogen at two wall shear stress (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). At 10 dyn/cm<sup>2</sup> (1000 s<sup>−1</sup>) platelet adhesion in the first 4 min of flow was unaffected by ERp5 and reduced with time thereafter. The negative effect of ERp5 on platelet adhesion was more pronounced at 30 dyn/cm<sup>2</sup> (3000 s<sup>−1</sup>).

Briefly, reduced disulfide bond cysteines in purified platelet β3 integrin were alkylated with 2-iodo-N-phenylacetamide (IPA), and the oxidized disulfide bond cysteines with a stable carbon-13 isotope of IPA following reduction with dithiothreitol (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). Sixty-eight cysteine containing peptides (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>) reporting on 24 of the 28 β3 integrin disulfides were resolved by mass spectrometry and quantified (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>).

Purified platelet αIIbβ3 integrin was incubated with 2- or 10-fold molar excess of ERp5 or PDI and the redox state of the disulfides quantified. PDI was used to test the substrate specificity of ERp5. PDI is the archetypal member of the PDI family of oxidoreductases, which includes ERp5, and is also secreted by platelets and endothelial cells at sites of thrombosis in mice and binds to surface β3 integrin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Cho et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Cho et al., 2012</xref>). Reactions were also performed with redox-inactive ERp5 and PDI to test the redox dependence of their action. Redox-inactive ERp5 and PDI were produced by replacing the active-site cysteines with alanines.</p><p>In accordance with crystal structures of the integrin ectodomain, all 24 disulfide bonds in untreated β3 integrin were &gt;90% oxidized, with one exception (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D and E</xref>). Approximately 10% of the βI-domain Cys177-Cys184 bond was reduced in the β3 preparations. Incubation of the integrin with ERp5 or PDI did not significantly change the redox sate of any of the 24 disulfide bonds (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D and E</xref>). Our fibrinogen binding studies suggested that ERp5 was having an effect on the extended/activated integrin. The native integrin exists predominantly in a bent conformation with closed headpiece. Soaking of the αIIbβ3 integrin headpiece with RGD peptide ligand results in variably extended configurations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Zhu et al., 2013</xref>). Six intermediate conformations and fully extended conformation with open headpiece have been described. Incubation of RGD-bound αIIbβ3 integrin with ERp5 resulted in significant cleavage of only one of the 24 β3 disulfides: the βI-domain Cys177-Cys184 bond. There was dose-dependent cleavage of the disulfide by ERp5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref>) and the bond was not cleaved by PDI (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3G</xref>), indicating selectivity for ERp5. Control RGE peptide that does not bind the integrin did not facilitate cleavage of the disulfide by ERp5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>). As anticipated, redox-inactive ERp5 did not cleave the bond (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref>). These results indicate that ERp5 specifically cleaves the βI-domain Cys177-Cys184 disulfide in one or more of the extended/open αIIbβ3 conformations. Approximately 30% of the Cys177-Cys184 disulfide bond in the purified integrin preparation is cleaved by 10-fold molar excess of ERp5 under static conditions, which is a ~20% increase over baseline. The force spectroscopy findings suggest that extent of cleavage is likely to be higher when the integrin is subject to mechanical shearing. ERp5-mediated dissociation of fibrinogen from αIIbβ3 is greatly enhanced when force goes beyond 15 pN and is complete at 40 pN (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>).</p><p>The βI-domain Cys177-Cys184 disulfide bond is also cleaved on the platelet surface by platelet ERp5.

Lysis of platelets releases stored ERp5 and fibrinogen that was predicted to mediate cleavage of the Cys177-Cys184 disulfide bond. The Cys177-Cys184 disulfide bond was reduced in ~10% of the integrin population in untreated or control antibody treated platelet lysate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3H</xref>), which is in accordance the redox state of this bond in purified platelet αIIbβ3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D–G</xref>).

We now report that ERp5 cleaves the βI-domain Cys177-Cys184 disulfide bond nearby the fibrinogen binding pocket of extended activated integrin that results in release of fibrinogen (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). Two coupled events control cleavage of the disulfide bond: ligand binding and mechanical force. RGD-ligand binding to the integrin and shear force facilitate ERp5 reduction of the disulfide. Stretching of sulfur-sulfur bonds, either by internal pre-stress or external forces, increases their susceptibility to cleavage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Baldus and Gräter, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Li and Gräter, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Wiita et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Wiita et al., 2007</xref>). Our data suggest that ERp5 cleavage of the disulfide is enabled by ligand- and force-dependent stretching of the sulfur-sulfur bond. However, the experimental data are also consistent with a force-dependent, ligand-bound conformation that provides enhanced access of the disulfide to ERp5. This force-coupled ligand binding redox event is an intriguing example of mechano-chemically coupled catalysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Neumann and Tittmann, 2014</xref>). Our findings are also of significance in understanding how platelets harness force to balance haemostasis and thrombosis functions.</p><fig id="fig7" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.34843.013</object-id><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><title>ERp5 regulation of fibrinogen release from activated αIIbβ3 integrin.</title><p>Activation of αIIbβ3 integrin results in transition from a bent (low affinity) to an extended (high affinity) structure. While much is known about the structure and function of resting and activated integrins, little is known about how integrins disengage from their ligands. Our findings indicate that ERp5 regulates fibrinogen release from extended αIIbβ3 integrin by reducing the βI domain Cys177-Cys184 disulfide bond (light blue oval). Cleavage of the disulfide is controlled by both ligand binding and mechanical force. It is feasible that the disulfide bond could reform and the integrin reengage fibrinogen (dotted arrow).</p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-34843-fig7-v3.tif"/></fig><p>The Cys177-Cys184 disulfide bond is exposed to solvent and accessible to ERp5 on a face of the βI-domain that is not involved in ligand binding. Cleavage of the disulfide bond, however, results in long-range allosteric effects within the βI-domain of αIIbβ3, mainly affecting the metal-binding sites, along with a higher conformational mobility of the whole βI-domain. Interestingly, we do not observe significant changes of α-helix 7, which has been previously shown to regulate the affinity of the integrin for (RGD) ligands (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Luo and Springer, 2006</xref>). Our data instead suggest that the increased mobility due to disulfide bond scission leads to local effects around the RGD-binding MIDAS site, which in turn are directly responsible for the observed affinity reduction of αIIbβ3 for fibrinogen upon Cys177-Cys184 reduction by ERp5. We note that we cannot exclude allosteric effects on the α-helix seven on longer time scales.</p><p>Both the N- and C-terminal catalytic domains of ERp5 are required for specificity of cleavage of the Cys177-Cys184 disulfide. Although the individual domains, when expressed and tested separately, were found to cleave the Cys177-Cys184 disulfide with comparable efficiency, removal of the N-terminal thioredoxin-like domain from ERp5 resulted in a fragment that markedly promoted platelet clumping on a fibrinogen-coated surface under fluid shear and enhanced PAR-1 mediated platelet aggregation. Interestingly, the C-terminal thioredoxin domains of ERp57 and PDI also potentiate platelet aggregation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Zhou et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Wang and Essex, 2017</xref>). The PDI C-terminal thioredoxin domain mediates P-selectin expression and ATP secretion in a αIIbβ3-independent manner. The effects of the isolated thioredoxin domains are likely the result of cleavage of other disulfide bond(s) in platelet proteins. These findings highlight the possibility that proteolytic processing of the oxidoreductases in the circulation may generate fragments with independent activities. They also suggest that care that needs to be taken when targeting oxidoreductases for development of new anti-thrombotics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Flaumenhaft et al., 2015</xref>). Inhibiting different aspects of the factors may have unintended consequences.</p><p>Our studies of ERp5’s role in thrombus formation in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Passam et al., 2015</xref>) and ERp5 effects on platelet adhesion under flow shown herein, indicate that ERp5 is involved in propagation of the thrombus and not thrombus initiation. ERp5 accumulates in the developing thrombus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Passam et al., 2015</xref>), which may be a mechanism to limit thrombus growth by shifting the balance between fibrinogen cross-linking of platelet αIIbβ3 and fibrinogen dissociation from this receptor. Testing this theory in vivo will be complicated by the likely possibility that ERp5 has more than one substrate in the thrombus. For instance, our preliminary results indicate that ERp5 significantly enhances binding of platelets to von Willebrand factor.</p><p>The βI Cys177-Cys184 disulfide bond is conserved in 7 of the 8 β integrins, or 23 of the 24 vertebrate integrins (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp3">Supplementary file 3</xref>). β4 of the α6β4 laminin receptor is the only β integrin that does not contain the bond. Notably, PDI and ERp57, like ERp5, have been shown to bind to β3 integrins. PDI binds to β3 integrins in the thrombus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Cho et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Kim et al., 2013</xref>) and αvβ3 integrin on endothelial cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Swiatkowska et al., 2008</xref>), while ERp57 binds to platelet surface β3 integrin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Holbrook et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Wang et al., 2013</xref>). It is possible that different oxidoreductases regulate de-adhesion of different integrins by cleaving the βI-domain disulfide bond. Neutrophil PDI, for instance, modulates ligand binding to αMβ2 integrin and neutrophil recruitment during venous inflammation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hahm et al., 2013</xref>).

Briefly, the BFP utilizes two micropipettes, one aspirating a biotinylated human red blood cell (RBC) with a glass bead to serve as a force transducer, termed ‘probe’. The bead is attached on the RBC apex via biotin-SA interaction. The probes spring constant, set to 0.25–0.3 pN/nm, is determined by the aspiration pressure and the radii of the micropipette and the RBC-bead contact area. The other micropipette aspirates a second bead, termed ‘target’. The probe and target beads are respectively coupled with purified human fibrinogen and αIIbβ3 with maleimide-PEG3500-NHS (JenKem, USA) in carbonate/bicarbonate buffer (pH 8.5). The force spectroscopy traces are obtained by measuring the RBC-bead deflection from the probe beads edge tracking. Bond formation/dissociation and force application are enabled and monitored in controlled BFP touch cycles (~2.5 s each). Other details are found in published protocols (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chen et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Ju et al., 2017</xref>). RBCs are isolated, biotinylated with Biotin-PEG3500-NHS (JenKem, TX) and stored (up to 2 weeks) for BFP experiments.</p><p>In each cycle, the αIIbβ3-bearing target bead is driven to approach and contact the fibrinogen-probe bead with a 20-pN compressive force for a certain contact time (0.2 s) that allows for bond formation. The target is then retracted at a constant speed (3.3 μm/s) for bond detection. During the retraction phase, a ‘bond’ event is signified by a tensile force. Conversely, no tensile force indicates a ‘no-bond’ event. For the adhesion frequency assay, ‘bond’ and ‘no-bond’ events are enumerated to calculate an adhesion frequency in 50 repeated cycles for each probe–target pair. For a force-clamp assay to measure bond lifetimes, upon detection of ‘bond’ event in a similar BFP cycle, a feedback loop pauses the retraction at a desired clamped force (5–60 pN) until bond dissociation. After that, the target is recoiled to the original position to complete the cycle. Lifetimes are measured from the instant when the force reaches the desired level to the instant of bond dissociation.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Redox states of the β3 integrin disulfide bonds</title><p>The redox states of 24 of the 28 β3 integrin disulfide bonds was measured in isolated human platelet β3 integrin (Abcam).

The integrin was eluted from the beads with 0.1 M glycine, the pH neutralized with 0.1 M Tris, pH 9.5 buffer and the β3 subunit resolved on SDS-PAGE and processed as above.</p><p>cDNA of β3 was cloned in pcDNA3 vector (carrying the neomycin resistance gene) and cDNA of αIIb was cloned into pCEP4 vector (carrying the hygromycin resistance gene) as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Mor-Cohen et al., 2008</xref>). The β3 C177,184S mutant was created in the pcDNA β3 vector by site-directed mutagenesis using the QuikChange kit from Stratagene. Verification of mutations was confirmed by DNA sequencing. Plasmids were linearized using PVUI for β3/pcDNA3 and AvrII for αIIb/pCEP4. BHK cells, grown in DMEM supplemented with 2 mg/ml L-glutamine and 5% FCS, were co-transfected with 1 µg of wild type or mutant pcDNA/β3 and 1 µg of pCEP4/αIIb with lipofectamine. Cells were also transfected with empty pcDNA and pCEP4 vectors as negative control. Transfected cells were grown in media containing 0.5 mg/ml hygromycin and 0.5 mg/ml G418. Two separate transfections for wild type and mutant construct were performed. Cells were sorted for comparable expression of the integrin by staining with fluorescene-conjugated anti-CD61 antibody (RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/AB_929170">AB_929170</ext-link>) and flow cytometry.</p><p>For fibrinogen binding assays, near-confluent transfected cells were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and detached by adding 1 mM EDTA. Cells were suspended in DMEM, pelleted and washed twice before resuspending 0.5 × 10<sup>6</sup> in 0.1 mL PBS supplemented with 1 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 1 mM CaCl<sub>2</sub> without or with 1 mM MnCl<sub>2</sub>. Cells were incubated wth 10 µg/mL CD61-APC and 0.1 mg/mL fibrinogen-FITC for 30 min at 25ºC, washed with PBS, fixed with 1% paraformaldehyde, washed twice more with PBS and binding measured by flow cytometry on a BD FACS Canto II. Binding is expressed as the % of CD61+ cells that bound fibrinogen. For cell adhesion assays, near confluent cells were washed in PBS and detached by adding 5 mM EDTA. Cells were suspended to 10<sup>6</sup> cells/mL in 0.5 mL of 20 mM HEPES pH 7.4 buffer containing 0.1 M NaCl<sub>2</sub>, 1 mM CaCl<sub>2,</sub>1 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub> without or with 1 mM MnCl<sub>2</sub>. Flat bottom 96 well MaxiSorp Nunc-Immuno plates (Thermo Fisher) were coated overnight with 40 µg/mL fibrinogen and blocked for two hours with 10 mg/mL denatured BSA. Cells, 100 μL of 10<sup>6</sup> cells/mL, were added to the wells, allowed to adhere for 2 hr at 37°C, and then gently washed three times with 200 µL PBS. The wells were overlayed with 100 µL PBS and imaged at 10x magnification using an inverted light microscope. Experiments were performed in triplicate and three images were taken per well. The number of attached cells were counted using ImageJ and a custom macro written for this purpose. Cell attachment is represented in absolute numbers.</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>Molecular dynamics simulations</title><p>The crystal structures of the bent conformation of αIIbβ3 (PDB code 3fcs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Zhu et al., 2008</xref>]), extended apo conformation of αIIbβ3 (PDB code 3fcu [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Zhu et al., 2008</xref>]), and extended holo conformation of αIIbβ3 (PDB code 2vdo [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Springer et al., 2008</xref>]) were prepared by separating the headpiece from the other domains (β-propeller residues 1–452, βI-domain residues 105–353, and 14 residue bound-peptide in the holo). The termini were capped in PyMOL version 1.8 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Schrodinger LLC, 2015</xref>) (acetyl group on N-terminus, N-methylaminly group on C-terminus), sugars were neglected and calcium and magnesium ions were kept in the system. The protonation states of the amino acids were calculated using PROPKA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Rostkowski et al., 2011</xref>). A dodecahedric box, leaving at least 1.5 nm distance between protein and box boundaries, was considered. The box was filled with water and the total system charge was neutralized with sodium and chloride ions (150 mM). For calcium and magnesium ions the default Amber parameters were used, for sodium and chloride the optimized Joung parameters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Joung and Cheatham, 2008</xref>) were considered, and TIP3P (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Jorgensen et al., 1983</xref>) was used as water model. MD simulations of each redox state (C177-C184 in the βI-domain oxidized and reduced) were performed with GROMACS 2016 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abraham et al., 2015</xref>), using the Amber99sb*-ILDN force field for the protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Lindorff-Larsen et al., 2010</xref>). Energy minimization was performed using the steepest-descent algorithm, followed by 500 ps of NVT-ensemble equilibration (Berendsen thermostat (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Berendsen et al., 1984</xref>) with τ = 0.1 ps) with position restraints on the protein (restraint force constant = 1000 kJ mol<sup>−1</sup> nm<sup>2</sup>) while random starting velocities were assigned to each trajectory. Next, 1 ns of NPT-ensemble equilibration with position restraints on the protein was performed. The LINCS algorithm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Hess, 2008</xref>) was used to constraint bonds involving protein hydrogen atoms, while SETTLE (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Miyamoto and Kollman, 1992</xref>) was used to constraint both bonds and angles of water molecules, enabling an integration time step of 2 fs.</p><p>The temperature was kept constant at 300 K by coupling the system to the V-rescale (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Berendsen et al., 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bussi et al., 2007</xref>) thermostat with τ = 0.1 ps. The pressure was kept constant at 1 bar coupling isotropically the system to a Parinello-Rahman barostat (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Parrinello and Rahman, 1981</xref>), with τ = 5 ps and compressibility 4.5 × 10<sup>−5</sup> bar<sup>−1</sup>. Lennard-Jones interactions were calculated using a cut-off of 1 nm and long-range electrostatics were calculated by particle-mesh Ewald summation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Darden et al., 1993</xref>). The Verlet-buffer scheme was employed to treat the non-bonded neighbour interactions. For each of the three structures and each redox state, five independent trajectories were calculated, in production runs of 200 ns in length each, while saving system coordinates every 10 ps. From each run the first 50 ns were accounted as equilibration time and discarded for subsequent analysis, resulting in 750 ns of cumulative simulation time per redox state for each of the starting structures.</p><p>Principal Component Analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Amadei et al., 1993</xref>), consisting in the calculation and diagonalization of the atomic-position covariance matrix, was performed using the GROMACS 2016 analysis tools, on the least-squares fitted trajectories of the backbone atoms. Eigenvectors of the covariance matrix were calculated of all ten concatenated runs (both oxidized and reduced). Each concatenated trajectory of each redox states was then individually projected along the first two eigenvectors, which accounted for approximately 30% of the collective motions.</p><p>Force distribution analysis (FDA) of MD simulations provides insight into mechanical signal propagation within a protein of interest upon an external perturbation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Stacklies et al., 2011</xref>), such as the reduction of the Cys177-Cys184 bond in the βI-domain of αIIbβ3 by ERp5 investigated here. FDA was performed on the trajectories of both redox states (Cys177-Cys184 oxidized and reduced), using the FDA implementation in GROMACS 5.0.7 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Stacklies et al., 2011</xref>) and the corresponding FDAtools 1.0. The pairwise inter-residue forces Fij between residues i and j, were calculated from each frame. Pairwise forces within the atoms of the protein were used, whereas forces from water and ions were neglected. The time-average &lt;Fij&gt; was computed for each redox form and pairs of residues for which &lt;Fij(reduced)&gt; - &lt;Fij(oxidized)&gt; was larger than specified threshold cut-off values were presented.</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>αIIbβ3 integrin modeling</title><p>To model the open structure of the complete αIIbβ3 integrin ectodomain, the bent configuration (PDB code 3fcs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Zhu et al., 2008</xref>]) was used as the starting structure. In order to open the structure, two peptide bonds were broken: residues 600–601 in chain A to simulate the opening of the hinge between calf1 and the thigh (‘α knee’), and residues 475–476 in chain B to simulate the opening of the hinge between EGF-1 and EGF-2 (‘β knee’). The opened model was structurally aligned to its appropriate domains in the opened model structure of the αVβ3 integrin ectodomain (PDB code 3ije [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Zucker et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Xiong et al., 2009</xref>]).

Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Anna Akhmanova as the Senior Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>Passam et al. examine the influence of the oxidoreductase ERp5 on the binding of platelet <underline>αIIbβ3</underline> to fibrinogen. They find that the presence of ERp5 decreases platelet adhesion to fibrinogen-coated coverslips under fluid shear stress, and decreases the binding lifetime between <underline>αIIbβ3</underline> and fibrinogen in a biomembrane force probe assay. This is attributed to breakage of a key disulfide bond in <underline>αIIbβ3</underline> integrin promoted by mechanical stress. The reviewers feel that the paper potentially represents a significant finding of the potential role of force-dependent redox control of integrin activity by ERp5. However, there are a number of conceptual and experimental issues that need to be addressed.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The absence of experimental data on fibrin is a major limitation. Specifically, the authors argue that reduction of the β3 integrin chain can potentially help drive a switch in binding preference from fibrinogen to fibrin during thrombus formation. However, they present very little data to demonstrate that this is indeed the case. Therefore, the experiments in Figures 1 and 2 that showed ERp5 weakened binding to fibrinogen should be repeated with fibrin.</p><p>As it stands, the majority of the data support the parsimonious interpretation that reduction of C177-C184 should decrease integrin affinity for both fibrinogen and fibrin, a result that is in apparent contradiction with ERp5's role in thrombosis. Given this, it seems possible that ERp5 could be acting on additional protein(s) to influence clot formation. These possibilities must be discussed in a revised manuscript.</p><p>2) The impact of the C-terminal fragment on platelet &quot;adhesion&quot; is so dramatic as to require additional analysis to assess potential alternative or additional mechanisms beyond cleavage of disulfide bonds. The authors should assess whether the C-terminal fragment directly aggregates platelets. They should also discuss the possibility that in vivo ERp5 might be proteolyzed, allowing the C-terminal domain to activate integrins.</p><p>3) The proposed mechanism of strain-induced disulfide cleavage is not supported by the data. Changes in bond lengths and angles cited in the &quot;strain&quot; argument are extremely small relative to the inherent error in crystallographic coordinates, even with the distributions shown. This part of the manuscript can be removed without harm to the essential findings.</p><p>4) There are apparent contradictions in the estimates of ERp5 present in platelets, which raises a concern about the physiologic plausibility of their findings. First, this information would be more useful at the beginning of the manuscript. More importantly, the authors conclude that platelets contain 6000-times more ERp5 than αIIβ3. In contrast, a previous study (Zeiler et al., 2014) used quantitative proteomics in murine platelets to determine a copy number of about 100,000 β3 integrin molecules and about 60,000 ERp5 (i.e. PDIA6) copies in platelets. Burkhart et al. (2012) reported that by quantitative MS total human platelet protein is 2 X 107 molecules, corresponding to 1.5 mg of protein/109 platelets; their estimated copy number for αIIbβ3 is about 64,200-83,300 per platelet and their estimated copy number for ERp5 (PDIA6) is 13,300 per platelet. These discrepancies must be discussed in a revised manuscript.</p><p>5) A diagram of the authors' proposed model of how de-adhesion from fibrinogen leads to enhanced thrombus formation would be helpful, complete with the authors' estimated concentrations of ERp5 and the percentage of cleaved C177-C184 bonds at different stages.</p><p>6) There is a discordance between the percentage of αIIbβ3 undergoing C177-C184 cleavage, which is ·5% over baseline at 2 ·M and ·15% over baseline at &quot;10X&quot; and the reduction in platelet adhesion at 3000 s<sup>-1</sup>, which is ·60%. This should be discussed.</p><p>7) The fibrinogen binding studies using the cells expressing wt αIIbβ3 differ from previous reports in the literature in that, as described, no activator (e.g., mAb, PT25-2, DTT, or Mn<sup>2+</sup>) was added. In addition, there was no test of the specificity of the binding (e.g., with a mAb or αIIbβ3 antagonist). Moreover, since only a single data point is shown without an error bar, the authors should indicate the number of experiments performed.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were requested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for resubmitting your article &quot;Mechano-redox control of integrin de-adhesion&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>.

The fourth paragraph in the Discussion now reads:</p><p>‘Our studies of ERp5’s role in thrombus formation in vivo (Passam et al., 2015) and ERp5 effects on platelet adhesion under flow shown herein, indicate that ERp5 is involved in propagation of the thrombus and not thrombus initiation. ERp5 accumulates in the developing thrombus (Passam et al., 2015), which may be a mechanism to limit thrombus growth by shifting the balance between fibrinogen cross-linking of platelet αIIbβ3 and fibrinogen dissociation from this receptor. Testing this theory in vivo will be complicated by the likely possibility that ERp5 has more than one substrate in the thrombus. For instance, our preliminary results indicate that ERp5 significantly enhances binding of platelets to von Willebrand factor.’</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) The impact of the C-terminal fragment on platelet &quot;adhesion&quot; is so dramatic as to require additional analysis to assess potential alternative or additional mechanisms beyond cleavage of disulfide bonds.

This result is shown in new Figure 4E (subsection “Both catalytic domains of ERp5 are required for substrate specificity”, last paragraph). Aggregation of washed platelets activated with the PAR-1 agonist, TRAP, in the absence or presence of 2 µM ERp5 or ERp5 CTD was measured. The data points and errors are from 3 different healthy donor platelets.</p><p>The possibility that ERp5 is proteolyzed in vivo to expose new functions of the resulting fragments has been discussed in the revised manuscript (Discussion, third paragraph).

These discrepancies must be discussed in a revised manuscript.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for pointing out these studies, which have been discussed in the Introduction of the revised manuscript (fifth paragraph). We have now tested the veracity of our ELISA results using an immunoblotting approach, with reference to a standard curve generated using recombinant ERp5, to estimate the level of platelet ERp5 and quantity released into the supernatant upon activation (new Figure 1—figure supplement 1). We estimate that a human platelet contains ~47,500 molecules of ERp5 and release approximately half of this into the supernatant upon activation (subsection “ERp5 triggers fibrinogen dissociation from αIIbβ3 integrin”, first paragraph). This ERp5 level is in the range of the literature values. Our ELISA was reporting spuriously high values and has been removed from the revised manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) A diagram of the authors' proposed model of how de-adhesion from fibrinogen leads to enhanced thrombus formation would be helpful, complete with the authors' estimated concentrations of ERp5 and the percentage of cleaved C177-C184 bonds at different stages.</p></disp-quote><p>A diagram of our proposed model appears in new Figure 7 of the revised manuscript. Inclusions of estimated ERp5 concentrations and fraction of cleavage of the C177-C184 bond would be overstating the experimental evidence we have at this stage.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) There is a discordance between the percentage of αIIbβ3 undergoing C177-C184 cleavage, which is ·5% over baseline at 2 ·M and ·15% over baseline at &quot;10X&quot; and the reduction in platelet adhesion at 3000 s<sup>-1</sup>, which is ·60%. This should be discussed.</p></disp-quote><p>This is a good point. The following discussion has been added to the revised manuscript (Results, subsection “ERp5 cleaves the βI-domain Cys177-Cys184 disulfide bond): ‘Approximately 30% of the Cys177-Cys184 disulfide bond in the purified integrin preparation is cleaved by 10-fold molar excess of ERp5 under static conditions, which is a ~20% increase over baseline. […] ERp5-mediated dissociation of fibrinogen from αIIbβ3 is greatly enhanced when force goes beyond 15 pN and is complete at 40 pN (Figure 2D).’</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7) The fibrinogen binding studies using the cells expressing wt αIIbβ3 differ from previous reports in the literature in that, as described, no activator (e.g., mAb, PT25-2, DTT, or Mn<sup>2+</sup>) was added.

Moreover, since only a single data point is shown without an error bar, the authors should indicate the number of experiments performed.</p></disp-quote><p>This result has been expanded in the revised manuscript (Results, subsection “Cleavage of the βI disulfide results in reduced affinity for fibrinogen due to increased βI-domain flexibility and high stresses at the MIDAS site”, first paragraph). Binding of soluble or immobilized fibrinogen to HEK cells expressing wild-type or disulfide mutant (C177,184S) αIIbβ3 integrin has been measured in the absence or presence of the integrin activator, Mn<sup>2+</sup> (new Figure 5). Expression of wild-type (64.8% of cells) and disulfide mutant integrin (82.9% of cells) was confirmed by staining with anti-β3 antibody (new Figure 5A). Soluble fibrinogen bound to less than 20% of wild-type or disulfide mutant β3 positive cells in the absence of Mn<sup>2+</sup> (new Figure 5B). In the presence of Mn<sup>2+</sup>, binding of soluble fibrinogen to αIIbβ3 with a broken Cys177-Cys184 disulfide bound was impaired (p &lt; 0.05) compared to wild-type integrin (new Figure 5B). Cells expressing wild-type integrin adhered to immobilized fibrinogen in the absence and presence of Mn<sup>2+</sup>, whereas adherence of the disulfide mutant integrin was severely impaired in both conditions (p &lt; 0.0001 in the absence of Mn<sup>2+</sup> and p &lt; 0.001 in the presence of Mn<sup>2+</sup>) (new Figure 5C). Data points and errors (SD) are from 3-4 biological replicates.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were requested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>Given the known sensitivity of integrin conformation to force, the data are at least, if not more so, consistent with a model in which force-coupled ligand binding promotes a conformation accessible to the enzyme, without invoking direct force-induced strain; the simulation data do not provide sufficient evidence for the latter.
