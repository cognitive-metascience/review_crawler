Although originally identified as an angiogenic factor, VEGF also signals directly to neurons to regulate their development and function. Here we show that VEGF and its receptor VEGFR2 (also known as KDR or FLK1) are expressed in mouse hippocampal neurons during development, with VEGFR2 locally expressed in the CA3 region. Activation of VEGF/VEGFR2 signaling in isolated hippocampal neurons results in increased axon branching. Remarkably, inactivation of VEGFR2 also results in increased axon branching in vitro and in vivo. The increased CA3 axon branching is not productive as these axons are less mature and form less functional synapses with CA1 neurons. Mechanistically, while VEGF promotes the growth of formed branches without affecting filopodia formation, loss of VEGFR2 increases the number of filopodia and enhances the growth rate of new branches. Thus, a controlled VEGF/VEGFR2 signaling is required for proper CA3 hippocampal axon branching during mouse hippocampus development.</p></abstract><kwd-group

networks relies on the establishment of specific patterns of connectivity between axons and dendrites. In this respect, proper regulation of axon branching during development is crucial to ensure precise axonal connections with multiple synaptic targets. Hippocampus development starts in mice around embryonic day E14 and continues through the first postnatal weeks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Tole et al., 1997</xref>). During this process, CA3 pyramidal neurons project their collateral axons to other CA3 neurons (associational connections) and to the CA1 hippocampal field via the Schaffer collaterals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Witter, 2007</xref>). During the first two postnatal weeks, CA3 axon collaterals undergo a process of growth, branching, remodeling and maturation to establish their connective network (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Gomez-Di Cesare et al., 1997</xref>). Although some molecular cues are described to regulate CA3 axon guidance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Skutella and Nitsch, 2001</xref>), the cues that regulate CA3 axon branching remain largely unknown.</p><p>De novo formation of axon branches, directly from the axon shaft (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Gallo, 2011</xref>), comprises the major mechanism for establishing axon connectivity in the mammalian central nervous system (CNS) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Kalil and Dent, 2014</xref>). Target-derived cues such as extrinsic axon guidance cues (Netrin, Slits, Semaphorins or Ephrins), growth factors (Neurotrophins, BDNF, FGF-2, NGF) or morphogens (WNTs) can regulate axon branching by different dynamic strategies including promoting branch growth, repulsion, pruning or stabilization of branches (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Kalil and Dent, 2014</xref>). Axon branching can also be regulated by activity-dependent mechanisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Yamamoto and López-Bendito, 2012</xref>). In all cases, cytoskeleton reorganization is required for the initiation and growth of axon branches. Initiation of a new axon branch occurs when actin filaments accumulate along the axon (actin patches) and expand to membrane protrusions from which filopodia will emerge. Subsequently, microtubules will invade the filopodia thus giving rise to new axon branches (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Gallo, 2011</xref>). Several of the molecular cues that regulate axon branching have been shown to regulate actin or microtubule dynamics. For example, Netrin-1 promotes axon branching in cortical neurons by inducing a rapid accumulation of actin filaments in filopodia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Dent et al., 2004</xref>). Also, asymmetric EGFR signaling has been shown to regulate actin dynamics and thereby axon branch pruning in <italic>Drosophila</italic> dorsal cluster neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Zschätzsch et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>Vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGFA, from here on termed VEGF) has been implicated in various neurodevelopmental processes including neurite outgrowth, neuronal survival and migration, as well as axon guidance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Carmeliet and de Almodovar, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Erskine et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Meissirel et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Ruiz de Almodovar et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Ruiz de Almodovar et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Schwarz et al., 2004</xref>). Those direct effects on neurons are mediated by signaling via VEGFR2 (also known as KDR and FLK1) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Carmeliet and de Almodovar, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Erskine et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Meissirel et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Ruiz de Almodovar et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Ruiz de Almodovar et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Schwarz et al., 2004</xref>) or via Neuropilin 1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Erskine et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Schwarz et al., 2004</xref>). Whether direct signaling of VEGF on neurons can regulate axon branching still remains unknown. Here we show that VEGF/VEGFR2 signaling regulates axon branching in CA3 hippocampal neurons. We find that VEGFR2 is expressed in CA3 hippocampal neurons during development and that VEGF is temporally and dynamically expressed in CA1-CA3 hippocampal neurons as well as in glial cells. We show that VEGFR2 is dynamically distributed along the axon and that VEGF stimulation increases VEGFR2 motility and localization towards actin-rich structures. We further show that CNS-specific VEGFR2 knockout mice display increased hippocampal axon branching in vivo, with branches that appear to be less mature and that form less functional synapses with CA1 neurons. Mechanistically, while VEGF stimulation results in increased axon branching by promoting the growth of newly formed branches in a Src Family Kinases (SFKs)-dependent manner, VEGFR2 inactivation leads to an increase in filopodia number that subsequently leads to increased branch formation.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>VEGFR2 and VEGF are expressed in the developing mouse hippocampus</title><p>Previous studies have demonstrated the expression of VEGF and its receptors in the adult murine hippocampus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Licht et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Wang et al., 2005</xref>). To characterize their expression during hippocampal development, we performed in situ hybridization (ISH) at late embryonic (E18.5) and early postnatal (P4 and P8) stages. As expected, the mRNA encoding VEGFR2 was expressed in blood vessels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). In addition, we also detected VEGFR2 mRNA transcripts specifically in the CA3 hippocampal region throughout all developmental stages analyzed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). To further characterize the expression of VEGFR2, we took advantage of a transgenic knock-in mouse line in which GFP expression reliably reflects endogenous expression of VEGFR2 (<italic>Vegfr2</italic>-GFP, where exon 1 of the <italic>Kdr</italic> gene is replaced by GFP [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Ema et al., 2006</xref>]). Immunostaining of postnatal brains at P4 and P8 with an antibody against GFP revealed specific labeling of the CA3 hippocampal region but not in the CA1, in addition to the strong labeling of endothelial cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B–1D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>). These results indicate that expression of VEGFR2 mRNA is not only detected in endothelial cells but also in cells of the CA3 region. In order to determine the CA3 cell types that express VEGFR2 mRNA we co-immunostained brain sections from P8 of <italic>Vegfr2</italic>-GFP mice with the pan-neuronal marker NeuN and the interneuron-specific marker calretinin. Analysis revealed that VEGFR2 is specifically expressed in pyramidal neurons, but not in interneurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B–1D</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref>). This spatiotemporal analysis showed that VEGFR2 mRNA is expressed in CA3 pyramidal neurons during the first two postnatal weeks. As a third approach to characterize VEGFR2 protein localization, we performed immunostainings using a specific anti-VEGFR2 antibody previously used to detect VEGFR2 in both neurons and blood vessels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bellon et al., 2010</xref>).

To study these events in vitro, we transfected primary hippocampal neurons with a plasmid containing the calponin homology domain of the F-actin binding protein Utrophin (Utr-CH) fused to mCherry (mCherry-UtrCH) in order to visualize F-actin in the axon (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Burkel et al., 2007</xref>) and performed time-lapse movies over the course of 2 to 10 min.

Thus, we next investigated whether VEGF-induced axon branching in hippocampal neurons may also require the activation of SFKs. To address this, we first determined the levels of SFKs activation upon VEGF stimulation of 1 DIV neurons. We immunostained control and VEGF treated hippocampal neurons with a specific antibody that detects the activated form of SFKs. Quantitative analysis of the fluorescence intensity showed an increased activation of SFKs at axonal growth cones (GC) as well as in the primary axon upon treatment with VEGF (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>).</p><p>We next explored whether SFKs activity is required for the VEGF-induced morphological changes in hippocampal neurons. To this end, we used 1 μM PP2 (a widely used SFK inhibitor) to block SFKs activity in cultured hippocampal neurons or its inactive analog, PP3, as a control. Analysis of the axon branch number and length revealed a significant increase in PP3-treated control neurons upon VEGF stimulation, which was completely abolished upon PP2 treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F and G</xref>). The requirement of SFKs activity was further confirmed by monitoring branching dynamics using time-lapse video microscopy in 1 DIV hippocampal neurons. Blocking SFKs completely abrogated the VEGF-mediated increase in the number of axon branches and the branch growth rate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4H and I</xref>).</p><p>Thus, VEGF can induce axon branching via both the mobilization of VEGFR2 to actin-rich structures and the activation of SFKs.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>Nervous system specific VEGFR2 knockout mice show increased axon branching and deficits in synapse development in vivo</title><p>To investigate whether VEGFR2 is crucial for the development of hippocampal neurons, we genetically deleted the gene encoding VEGFR2 (<italic>Kdr</italic>) in the nervous system by crossing <italic>Kdr<sup>lox/-</sup></italic> mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Haigh et al., 2003</xref>) with the <italic>Nestin-cre</italic> mouse line (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Tronche et al., 1999</xref>).

These expression patterns are consistent with later postnatal and adult stages where VEGF expression becomes restricted to adult astrocytes and VEGFR2 is primarily found in vessels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Licht et al., 2011</xref>) and at the postsynaptic side of CA1 neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">De Rossi et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>We demonstrate that in hippocampal neurons VEGF activates VEGFR2 and SFKs to induce axon branching. While Nrp1 is also expressed in hippocampal neurons, its blockage does not inhibit VEGF-mediated increase in axon branching. Previous reports show that VEGF regulates cerebellar granule cell migration or commissural axon guidance in a SFK-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Meissirel et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Ruiz de Almodovar et al., 2011</xref>). Here we show that VEGF-induced axon branching requires VEGFR2 internalization and SFK activation. We found that VEGF stimulation induces activation of SFKs at growth cones and along the axon shaft. Thus, SFK activation seems to be a crucial step in VEGF-mediated effects in neurons. Upon VEGF stimulation, VEGFR2 motility and migration towards actin-rich protrusions and filopodia is enhanced, suggesting that localization of VEGFR2 in those cellular structures contributes to the final outcome of increased axon branching.</p><p>Interestingly, we observed that both stimulation with VEGF as well as the inactivation of VEGFR2 result in an increased number of axon branches (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). In all cases we see that branch growth is enhanced and that there are no differences in branch retraction. How can the activation and the loss of the same signaling receptor lead to a similar phenotype? We show that although the phenotypic outcome is the same, the cause for the increase in axon branch number differs between the activation and the loss of VEGFR2. In the case of VEGFR2 activation we find that VEGF stimulation does not change the percentage of forming filopodia but it does increase the number of branches (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). VEGF stimulation further increases the growth rate of axon branches. We propose, that VEGF induces axon branching by stabilizing and promoting the growth of branches once the filopodia have already been formed. In contrast, upon VEGFR2 loss, the percentage of forming filopodia increases, as well as the growth rate, overall resulting in an increased number of axon branches (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). One hypothesis could be that in absence of the receptor the axon branch cannot be properly stabilized and grow, and thus the axon branches that are formed remain shorter.</p><fig id="fig7" position="float"><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><title>Working model for VEGF/VEGFR2 function in hippocampal axon branching.</title><p>VEGF stimulation induces axon branching by promoting the growth of newly formed branches without affecting filopodia formation. Loss-of-functional VEGFR2 also results in increased axon branching, but in this case from an increased number of filopodia and enhanced growth rate. However, in the loss of function situation, the generated branches are shorter and non-functional.</p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-49818-fig7-v1.tif"/></fig><p>Similarly, disruption of VEGFR2 signaling in vivo (in <italic>Nes-cre;Kdr</italic><sup>lox/-</sup> mice) results in axonal hyperbranching of CA3 hippocampal neurons. Despite the increase in axon branch number, we observed a reduced number of synapses in the CA1 area, indicating that the branches are not functional and rather immature. An increase in the number of immature non-functional axon branches has been described in DCN neurons in <italic>Drosophila</italic> upon inhibition of EGFR signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Zschätzsch et al., 2014</xref>). In our case, the overshooting of branches could occur as a compensatory response with the aim to restore proper axon branching.</p><p>The accompanying manuscript by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Harde et al. (2019)</xref> shows that the VEGF/VEGFR2 signaling effect is not limited to the axon, but this ligand/receptor pair also regulates dendritic development and spine morphogenesis in hippocampal neurons. While in both compartments the internalization of VEGFR2 is required for VEGF signal transduction, the presence of EphrinB2 and its regulatory function seems to specifically contribute to dendritic development and to be dispensable for axonal branching. In line with this, we find that inactivation of VEGFR2 has an opposite effect in the axon and in the dendrites. While absence of VEGFR2 results in increased branching of hippocampal axons, it leads to a less branched dendritic network. A differential effect in dendrites and axons has been also described for other signaling molecules such as Sema3A, which promotes dendritic growth but restricts axon growth in cultured hippocampal neurons, or the leucine zipper kinase (DLK) pathway, which restrains dendritic growth but promotes axon growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Wang et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Wang et al., 2014</xref>). Therefore, VEGF/VEGFR2 signaling falls into the category of bimodal regulators that differentially direct axonal and dendritic development in an opposite manner.</p><p>A study in <italic>Drosophila</italic> elegantly showed that intrinsic asymmetry in EGFR localization and local activation of EGFR signaling within filopodia is required for proper axon branching of dorsal cluster neurons and that both EGFR activation and loss of function results in increase axon branching due to a defect in pruning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Zschätzsch et al., 2014</xref>). Our data provide for the first time evidence that in mammals similar processes can also modulate axon branching. In particular, we find that appropriate levels of VEGFR2 signaling in hippocampal neurons are required for proper axon branching by a mechanism that involves branch growth but not branch pruning. We show that upon VEGF stimulation and activation of VEGFR2 signaling, VEGFR2 motility increases within actin protrusions and filopodia, correlating with an increase in branch number. Two possibilities, non-exclusive, could explain the increased axon branching upon VEGFR2 deletion. On the one hand, the lack of VEGFR2 could lead to a decrease in the dynamics of protrusions turnover and thus increase the probability of a protrusion to become a filopodium. Our data support such a model as we observe that the absence of VEGFR2 increases the percentage of filopodia. On the other hand, a compensatory mechanism, yet unidentified, might become activated to overcome the inhibition of VEGFR2, resulting in higher branch number than in control conditions.</p></sec><sec

Neurons were voltage clamped at –70 mV while the series resistance was left uncompensated during the recordings. mEPSCs were analyzed offline using Stimfit software (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Guzman et al., 2014</xref>) employing a template matching algorithm. Selected mEPSC events were individually screened with an amplitude threshold of &gt;5 pA and an exponential decay. Recordings were started 5 min after patching and the minis are usually recorded for 10 min. Statistical differences between experimental conditions were determined by the unpaired students t-test. The experimenter was blind to the identity of the mice during acquisition.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>Preparation of neuronal cultures</title><p>Hippocampal neuron cultures were prepared from E16.5 mouse embryos as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Segura et al., 2007</xref>) and cultured on coverslips or tissue culture plates coated with poly-L-lysine (1 mg/ml, Sigma) and laminin (20 µg/ml, Sigma). Neurons were maintained in neurobasal medium (Life technologies) supplemented with B27 (Invitrogen) and 0.5 mM Glutamine (GIBCO). For morphological analysis at 3 DIV neurons were cultured at a density of 20.000 neurons/coverslip.</p></sec><sec id="s4-10"><title>Neuronal transfection</title><p>For subcellular localization of the VEGFR2-GFP and tracking of actin dynamics, neurons were plated on four well Labtek chambers (Thermo Scientific, 155383) at a density of 100.000 neurons/well. At 1 DIV neurons were co-transfected with an hVEGFR2-GFP fusion plasmid and UtrCH-mCherry plasmid using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) following manufacture instructions. mCherry-UtrCH plasmid was described in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Burkel et al. (2007)</xref> and provided by Dr. Ulrike Engel (University of Heidelberg Heidelberg, Germany).</p></sec><sec id="s4-11"><title>Morphological analysis of neuronal cultures</title><p>1 DIV hippocampal neurons were stimulated for 48 hr with or without 100 ng/ml VEGF, fixed for 20 min in 4% PFA/4% sucrose at RT and stained for beta-III-tubulin. Where indicated, neurons were pre-treated with 2 µg/ml α-VEGFR2 blocking antibody (αVEGFR2 (DC101), gift from Dr. T Schmidt), anti-Nrp1 blocking antibody (αNrp1), respective IgG control, 1 µM PP2 (Calbiochem) or 1 µM PP3 (Calbiochem) for 2 hr prior to VEGF stimulation. The neurons were imaged using a Zeiss Axiovert 200 epifuorescence microscope. The longest neuronal process was defined as the axon and the number and length of axonal branches were quantified using the ImageJ plugin NeuronJ.</p></sec><sec id="s4-12"><title>Time-lapse video microscopy</title><p>For time-lapse video microscopy 50.000 neurons/well were plated in a 12 well plate. At 1 DIV neurons were pre-treated for 2 hr with 2 µg/ml α-VEGFR2 blocking antibody, respective IgG control, 1 µM PP2, 1 µM PP3. To block internalization, neurons were pre-treated with 80 µM dynasore or the equal volume of DMSO vehicle control for 30 min. Subsequently, 50 ng/ml VEGF was added and at least 10 neurons per condition were imaged simultaneously at the Nikon Imaging Center, Heidelberg, over the course of 4 hr at 4 min intervals using an inverted Nikon Ti microscope with Nikon perfect focus system and encased by an environmental box to keep temperature, CO<sub>2</sub> and humidity constant. Phase contrast images were acquired using a Nikon Plan Fluor 10x NA 0.3 phase contrast objective. Newly formed and growing axon branches were defined as extension, while loss and shrinkage of branches were defined as retraction. The number and length of extending and retracting axon branches were quantified using the ImageJ plugin NeuronJ and the growth rates calculated. The number of newly formed filopodia was quantified within the first 80 min of the time-lapse movies.</p></sec><sec id="s4-13"><title>Dynamic VEGFR2-GFP movement and actin tracking</title><p>1 DIV hippocampal neurons were double transfected with VEGFR2-GFP and mCherry-UtrCH. At 3 DIV neurons were imaged using an inverted Nikon Ti microscope with objective TIRF illumination (Nikon Apo TIRF 60x NA 1.49) and equipped with an on-stage incubation chamber from TokiaHit for temperature, CO<sub>2</sub>- and humidity control. GFP and mCherry were imaged sequentially with 488 nm and 561 nm excitation and emission filters 520/40 nm and 630/60 nm onto an EM-CCD (Andor Xion). To follow actin nucleation and patch formation, mCherry-UtrCH was imaged for 2 min at a frame rate of 1.6 fps before and 5 min after stimulation with 100 ng/ml VEGF. To investigate protrusion dynamics, mCherry-UtrCH images were acquired every 5 s over the course of 10 min before and after stimulation with 100 ng/ml VEGF. VEGFR2-GFP trafficking was observed for 1 min at a frame rate of 1.6 fps before and 5 min after stimulation with 100 ng/ml VEGF.</p></sec><sec id="s4-14"><title>Western Blotting</title><p>Neurons were harvested in ice-cold lysis buffer (150 mM NaCl, 20 mM Tris, 5 mM EDTA, 10% glycerol, 1% Igepal, protease and phosphatase inhibitor tablets (Roche)), lysed for 30 min on ice and cleared by centrifugation at 15.000 rpm for 15 min at 4C. Protein concentrations were determined using Roti-Quant Universal kit (Roth). Protein samples were loaded on 7.5% or 10% polyacrylamide gels for SDS-PAGE. Following transfer to 0.2 µm pore-size PVDF membranes, blots were blocked in 5% BSA in TBST for 1 hr at RT. Blots were then probed with antibodies against VEGFR2, (phospho-) VEGFR2 (Y1175), GFAP and VE-Cadherin. After incubation with appropriate HRP-conjugated secondary antibodies, bands were detected with ECL Western Blotting detection reagent (Millipore) and visualized using ImageQuant LAS 4000 (GE Healthcare).</p></sec><sec id="s4-15"><title>Reverse transcription PCR</title><p>Total RNA was prepared from neuronal and primary endothelial culture, as well as from postnatal brains using Superscript II (Invitrogen).

Perhaps a term like &quot;regulates&quot; or &quot;contributes to&quot; are more appropriate in the title, but I leave that to the discretion of the authors.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic> </p><p>The manuscript by Urban et al. investigates the role of VEGF-A signaling in CA3 neurons in the hippocampus with regard to axon branching. Expression of both ligand and receptor VEGFR2 is investigated, then primary culture of neurons is used to show that VEGF stimulation leads to excess branching. However, in vivo the neuron-specific conditional genetic loss of the receptor also leads to excess branches, although these are thought to be less mature. A blocking antibody to VEGFR2 recapitulates the excess branching seen in vivo in primary cultures. The signaling is linked to Src-like kinases using inhibitors, and some very elegant cell biology indicates that VEGFR2 relocalizes to actin patches upon stimulation.</p><p>Overall the data is rigorous and uses both in vitro and in vivo approaches. It is known that VEGF-A signaling is important in neuronal development. The major novelty here is that the neuronal loss of VEGFR2 leads to excess branching of a subset of hippocampal neurons that does not appear to lead to productive synapse formation, while VEGF-A stimulation in primary neurons also leads to excess branching. The authors speculate that the lack of synapses may lead to a feedback loop with more short axon branches. It would strengthen the work to test some other ideas – for example perhaps VEGF-A is not the relevant ligand in vivo since VEGF-C and VEGF-D also bind to VEGFR2. What are the effects of alternate ligands on the parameters in primary neuron culture?</p><p>The other aspect of the novelty is the idea that VEGFR2 relocalizes upon VEGF-A stimulation to actin patches, where it supposedly promotes neurite outgrowth. It would strengthen the work to move the kymographs to the main figures and label better to highlight these novel findings, and if possible, to include the movies from which the kymographs were derived (the co-labeling of actin and VEGFR2). Also, would strengthen to show spatial changes by a different approach – is it possible to use Proximity Ligation Assay or pull down to investigate VEGFR2 association with something localized to the actin patches and/or filopodia?</p><p>Also, as described in review of co-submitted paper, it would be useful to better integrate the findings from the co-submitted paper in the Discussion section – it appears that endocytosis is important for dendrite biology, is it also important for the axon branching effects of VEGF/VEGFR2? Are SPKs important for dendrites as well as axons? It is not clear whether axons and dendrites use different mechanisms or whether they were tested differently.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.49818.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The comments are relatively favorable, complimentary and constructive.

In addition, as indicated by this reviewer, in the Discussion section of our manuscript, we have further discussed the complex behavior of axons upon activation as wells as loss of VEGFR2.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1) Together with the accompanying manuscript by Harde et al., this work shows the opposite effect of the loss of VEGFR2 on the branching of axons and dendrites in hippocampal neurons. How does the axon sense the VEGF cue in the absence of VEGFR2? What about other VEGF receptors?</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for his comment. In the submitted manuscript, we show that stimulation of hippocampal neurons with VEGF increased axon branching via activation of its cognate receptor VEGFR2. At the same time, blockage, as well as knockout of VEGFR2 showed the same phenotype of increased axonal branching, both in vitro and in vivo (in <italic>Nes-cre;Kdr<sup>lox/-</sup></italic> mice). In our manuscript we speculate that the increased axon branching observed upon loss of VEGFR2 is a compensatory mechanism. In this regard, as this reviewer suggested, it might be possible that interference with VEGFR2 function shifts the signaling of VEGF to other VEGF receptors, thus in turn being the reason for the increase in axon branching. Equally likely, the compensatory mechanism that is activated could be totally independent of VEGF receptor signaling.</p><p>To address whether VEGF could be binding to other VEGF receptors in the absence of VEGFR2 we focused on VEGFR1 (Flt1) and Neuropilin 1 (Nrp1), the other two receptors via which VEGF can induce a signal transduction cascade independent of VEGFR2 (de Vries et al., 1991; Soker et al., 1998; Roth et al., 2016).</p><p>VEGFR1</p><p>We have analyzed the expression of <italic>Vegfr1</italic> in the hippocampus at similar time points as we did for VEGFR2 (late embryonic (E18.5) and early postnatal stages P4 and P8) using ISH. At these time points <italic>Vegfr1</italic> mRNA is primarily detected in blood vessel structures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig1">Author response image 1A and 1B</xref>). Similar to our results, the data provided by the Allen Brain Atlas for the developing mouse brain (http://developingmouse.brain-map.org) shows <italic>Vegfr1</italic> mRNA expression primarily in blood vessels in the hippocampus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig1">Author response image 1C</xref>).</p><fig id="respfig1"><label>Author response image 1.</label><caption><title>Flt1 is expressed by blood vessels during hippocampal development.</title><p>(<bold>A, B</bold>) <italic>Flt1</italic>-ISH was performed in the mouse hippocampus at E18.5, P4 and P8 developmental stages.

Based on this expression pattern we believe that VEGFR1 is a rather improbable receptor for VEGF in hippocampal neurons during development.</p><p>Nrp1</p><p>Nrp1 is a known mediator of the repulsive effect exerted by Semaphorins on axon development, which is also specifically described for the hippocampus (He and Tessier-Lavigne, 1997; Chedotal et al., 1998). Nrp1 is also described to function as co-receptor for VEGFR2 as well as to transduce VEGF signals independent of VEGFR2 (Soker et al., 1998; Roth et al., 2016; Erskine et al., 2011). To investigate whether Nrp1 could act as a receptor for VEGF and regulate axonal branching in hippocampal neurons, we first analyzed its expression pattern during hippocampal development using ISH. We detected <italic>Nrp1</italic> mRNA in the CA1, CA2 and CA3 hippocampal regions, as well as in the dentate gyrus at late embryonic (E18.5) and early postnatal (P4 and P8) stages (Figure 5—figure supplement 4A of our revised manuscript). This is in line with our expression analysis in isolated hippocampal neurons (1 DIV and 3 DIV; Figure 1—figure supplement 1D of our revised manuscript) and with previous publications showing the expression of <italic>Nrp1</italic> mRNA in the hippocampus and neocortex during development (Chedotal et al., 1998; Kawakami et al., 1996). The spatiotemporal expression of <italic>Nrp1</italic> is similar to the one of <italic>Vegfr2</italic> and <italic>Vegf</italic>, raising the possibility that Nrp1 can act either alone or together with VEGFR2 to mediate VEGF signaling in the developing hippocampus.</p><p>First, to elucidate whether VEGF could also signal via Nrp1 to modulate axon branching, we blocked Nrp1 using a previously described α-Nrp1-neutralizing antibody (Ruiz de Almodovar et al., 2011) and analyzed the VEGF-mediated effect on axonal branching as before. While axon branch number and length was significantly increased in control neurons upon VEGF stimulation, this effect was not blocked in the presence of α-Nrp1-neutralizing antibody (Figure 5—figure supplement 4B and C of our revised manuscript). This result suggests that Nrp1 is dispensable for VEGF-induced axon branching.</p><p>Second, we also considered the possibility that the increase in axon branching upon α-VEGFR2 treatment could be due to a swift towards VEGF-Nrp1 signaling. To test this hypothesis, we co-administered α-Nrp1-neutralizing antibody together with αVEGFR2 in hippocampal neurons and analyzed axon branching in the different conditions. Consistent with our data, α-VEGFR2 led to an increase in axon branch number and length (Figure 5—figure supplement 4D and C of revised manuscript). This effect was however not blocked with the addition of the α-Nrp1-neutralizing antibody (Figure 5—figure supplement 4D and C of revised manuscript), indicating that Nrp1 is not the receptor that leads to increased axon branching upon inactivation of VEGFR2.</p><p>Collectively, these data show that Nrp1 does not mediate the effect of VEGF in axon branching by itself, nor does it represent a strong compensatory mechanism that takes over when VEGFR2 is blocked. Our data also suggests that this compensatory mechanism might be independent of VEGF signaling. In the revised version of our manuscript we have now integrated the data for Nrp1 in Figure 5—figure supplement 4 of the revised manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Does the VEGFR2 interact with EphrinB2 for its internalization in the axon?</p></disp-quote><p>To address the reviewer’s question of whether VEGFR2 interacts with EphrinB2 for its internalization in the hippocampal axon, similar as it occurs in dendrites (shown in the accompanying manuscript by Harde et al., we isolated hippocampal neurons from EphrinB2 knockout mice (from here on EphrinB2<sup>-/-</sup>) and analyzed the number and length of axonal branches in the presence and absence of VEGF. Stimulation of hippocampal neurons from EphrinB2<sup>-/-</sup> with VEGF resulted in a similar increase of axon branch number and length as in neurons from control littermates (Figure 6—figure supplement 1C and D of revised manuscript), indicating that EphrinB2 is not necessary for the VEGF-induced effect on axonal branching.</p><p>To confirm this in vitro data, we further analyzed CA3 hippocampal axon branching in vivo in VEGFR2 and EphrinB2 compound mice (from here on <italic>Nes-cre;Kdr<sup>+/-;</sup>ephrinB2<sup>+/-</sup></italic>), which showed a phenotype in dendritic branching in the accompanying paper (Harde et al.,) Using the same DiI-labeling and quantification approach we used for analyzing CA3 axon branching in <italic>Nes-cre;Kdr<sup>lox/-</sup></italic>, we labeled single axons of CA3 pyramidal neurons in wildtype and <italic>Nes-cre;Kdr<sup>+/-</sup>;ephrinB2<sup>+/-</sup></italic> littermates and analyzed their branching. This analysis revealed no significant differences between the genotypes (Figure 6—figure supplement 1E of revised manuscript), indicating that the interaction between VEGFR2 and EprhinB2 is not necessary for the VEGF-mediated regulation of hippocampal axon branching.</p><p>Altogether, these new results show that VEGF utilizes different receptor complexes and molecular mechanisms to regulate axon and dendritic branching in hippocampal neurons. The new data generated with EphrinB2 are now integrated in the updated version of our manuscript (Figure 6—figure supplement 1 of revised manuscript).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Hippocampal neurons appear to be in proximity of blood vessels. Does the loss of neuronal VEGFR2 gene affect angiogenesis in neighboring vessels due to the potential increase of free VEGF level?</p></disp-quote><p>We understand the reviewer’s reasoning that upon loss of neuronal VEGFR2 expression there might be potential increase of free VEGF level, which subsequently might affect angiogenesis in neighboring vessels. A similar mechanism has been described before in the developing mouse retina (Okabe et al., 2014). To address this question, we analyzed the area covered by blood vessels in the hippocampus of <italic>Nes-cre;Kdr<sup>lox/-</sup></italic> mice at P10 using ImageJ. We did not observe a significant difference in blood vessel density in the hippocampus of <italic>Nes-cre;Kdr<sup>lox/-</sup></italic> mice when compared to their control littermates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig2">Author response image 2A</xref>).</p><fig id="respfig2"><label>Author response image 2.</label><caption><title>Neuronal loss of VEGFR2 does not affect blood vessel density in the hippocampus.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Blood vessels were stained using Isolectin-B4 at P10 in control and <italic>Nes-cre;Kdr<sup>lox/-</sup></italic>animals.

They transfected primary hippocampal neurons from wildtype mice with a plasmid expressing EGFP at 11 DIV, stimulated the neurons with 50 ng/ml VEGF for 24h or 48h and analyzed spine morphology and number at 14 DIV. Quantification revealed a significant increase in the number of mature spines upon VEGF stimulation when compared to unstimulated control neurons. The authors further show that the effect of VEGF is mediated through activation of its receptor VEGFR2.</p><p>Previous studies have also attributed a role for VEGF in regulating synapse formation and synaptic plasticity in the adult hippocampus (De Rossi et al., 2016; Kim et al., 2008; Latzer et al., 2019; Licht et al., 2011). De Rossi et al. for example demonstrated that VEGF signaling via VEGFR2 increases the postsynaptic responses mediated by a specific type of glutamate receptors (GluNRs) in hippocampal neurons, thus highlighting the potential of VEGF signaling in neurons for regulating proper synaptic function (De Rossi et al., 2016). Using conditional transgenic systems to reversibly overexpress VEGF or block endogenous VEGF in the hippocampus of adult mice, Licht et al. demonstrated a crucial role for VEGF in modulating plasticity of mature neurons and subsequently regulating/affecting memory formation and LTP responses (Licht et al., 2011).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Altogether, although we did not specifically analyzed synapses in the axon upon VEGF stimulation, the above-mentioned studies point to a role for VEGF in synapse formation and plasticity.</p><p>2) In reference to the accompanying manuscript, is VEGFR2 internalization also required for its role in axonal branching?</p></disp-quote><p>To investigate whether VEGFR2 internalization is required for its role in axonal branching, we followed a similar approach as in the accompanying manuscript (Harde et al.). We inhibited VEGFR2 internalization with dynasore, a dynamin inhibitor that 6 blocks both clathrin-dependent and clathrin-independent endocytic pathways, and analyzed the VEGF-mediated effect on axonal branching. Hippocampal neurons from wildtype mice were pretreated with dynasore or DMSO (as control) at 1 DIV for 30 min, followed by stimulation with 50 ng/ml VEGF. Time-lapse videos were recorded over the course of 4h and the dynamics of axon branching was analyzed. Treatment with dynasore blocked the increase in branch number and length induced by VEGF when compared to control conditions (DMSO treated neurons) (Figure 6—figure supplement 1A-B of revised manuscript).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>These results indicate that internalization of VEGFR2 is also required for the VEGF-mediated effect on axon branching. However, in contrast to what occurs for dendritic branching, the internalization of VEGFR2 required for regulating axon branching is not dependent of EphrinB2 as we did not observed any significant inhibition of VEGF-induced axon branching in primary hippocampal neurons isolated from EphrinB2 knockout mice (see response to reviewer #1, comment 2 and Figure 6—figure supplement 1C-E of revised manuscript).</p><p>3) Very recent work from the Hiesinger lab (Ozel et al., Dev Cell 2019) shows how filopodial dynamics regulate synapse formation in Drosophila. Given the role of VEGFR2 shown here in actin regulation and branching, discussing potential regulation of filopodial dynamics by VEGFR2 in this context might be interesting.</p><p>We thank the reviewer for pointing out this interesting study to us. Indeed, we show that loss of VEGFR2 changes filopodia dynamics resulting in an increased number of filopodia and increased axon branching. With this in mind and considering that we also observe a reduced number of functional synapses on CA1 pyramidal neurons, it could very well be the case that the presence of VEGFR2 is somehow required for the competitive distribution of synaptic building material between synaptogenic filopodia. If this is the case, based on our data, we could speculate that in the absence of VEGFR2 the synaptic building material is reduced or distributed aberrantly, allowing only the formation and maturation of a reduced number of synapses. As in its current stage this is all speculation, and perhaps a bit far from the focus of our study, we prefer not to discuss it in our manuscript, but will consider following up on this possibility in further studies.</p><p>4) In my personal opinion terms like &quot;X controls Y process&quot; are outdated and reflect linear deterministic models that are no longer relevant in modern biology and should in my view no longer be used. Perhaps a term like &quot;regulates&quot; or &quot;contributes to&quot; are more appropriate in the title, but I leave that to the discretion of the authors.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer’s suggestion.

Expression of both ligand and receptor VEGFR2 is investigated, then primary culture of neurons is used to show that VEGF stimulation leads to excess branching. However, in vivo the neuron-specific conditional genetic loss of the receptor also leads to excess branches, although these are thought to be less mature. A blocking antibody to VEGFR2 recapitulates the excess branching seen in vivo in primary cultures. The signaling is linked to Src-like kinases using inhibitors, and some very elegant cell biology indicates that VEGFR2 relocalizes to actin patches upon stimulation.</p><p>Overall the data is rigorous and uses both in vitro and in vivo approaches.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for their positive comments. Below we have addressed point by point their general concerns.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>It is known that VEGF-A signaling is important in neuronal development. The major novelty here is that the neuronal loss of VEGFR2 leads to excess branching of a subset of hippocampal neurons that does not appear to lead to productive synapse formation, while VEGF-A stimulation in primary neurons also leads to excess branching. The authors speculate that the lack of synapses may lead to a feedback loop with more short axon branches. It would strengthen the work to test some other ideas – for example perhaps VEGF-A is not the relevant ligand in vivo since VEGF-C and VEGF-D also bind to VEGFR2. What are the effects of alternate ligands on the parameters in primary neuron culture?</p></disp-quote><p>To address this question, we performed a thorough literature research on the expression and role of VEGF-C and VEGF-D ligands in the developing hippocampus. We also analyzed expression of VEGF-C and VEGF-D in the developing hippocampus ourselves and tested their effect on axon branching of isolated hippocampal neurons.</p><p>VEGF-C</p><p>VEGF-C binds primarily to VEGFR3 but it can also bind VEGFR2 after proper proteolytic cleavage (Joukov et al., 1996), leading to the formation and activation of VEGFR2/VEGFR3 heterodimers (Tammela and Alitalo, 2010; Koch and Claesson-Welsh, 2012; Thomas et al., 2013). Ward et al. described VEGF-C expression during embryonic and postnatal development in various brain regions (Ward and Cunningham, 2015). In the hippocampus, VEGF-C expression appears to be higher in embryonic stage E16 and declines in the maturing hippocampus, where it becomes restricted to the hilus and the granule cell layer (GCL) of the dentate gyrus (DG) (Ward and Cunningham, 2015).</p><p>To confirm that VEGF-C is expressed in the developing hippocampus, as indicated by Ward and Cunningham (2015), we micro-dissected the hippocampus from the developing mouse brain at P4 and P8 and performed an ELISA for VEGF-C. As positive controls we used the adult mouse heart and lung as VEGF-C is expressed in those tissues (Kukk et al., 1996). In contrast to Ward et al., we did not detect VEGF-C in the developing hippocampus at any of the analyzed stages, while its expression was positive in heart and lung (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig3">Author response image 3A</xref>). The difference between our results and Ward et al. could be potentially explained by the sensitivity of the different approaches used to detect VEGF-C protein.</p><p>Nevertheless, to not exclude the possibility that VEGF-C is expressed in low (undetected by ELISA) levels and thus could exert an effect in developing hippocampal neurons, we cultured primary hippocampal neurons and stimulated them with 100 ng/ml VEGF-C at 1 DIV over the course of 48 hours. Analysis of axonal morphology in response to VEGF-C stimulation from three independent experiments showed no significant increase of axon branch number or length when compared to control or VEGF (VEGF-A) stimulated neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig3">Author response image 3C and 3D</xref>).</p><fig id="respfig3"><label>Author response image 3.</label><caption><title>VEGF-C and VEGF-D do not show the same growth promoting effect on hippocampal axon branches as VEGF-A.</title><p>(<bold>A, B</bold>) Hippocampal tissue was collected from mice at P4 and P8 stages.

VEGF-D expression has been described in the hippocampus in early postnatal and adult stages where its expression is regulated by neuronal activity and nuclear calcium signaling (Mauceri et al., 2011). Mauceri et al. showed that VEGF-D promotes dendritic maintenance, both in cultured hippocampal neurons as well as in the adult mouse hippocampus (Mauceri et al., 2011). Indeed, our own analysis of VEGF-D expression via ELISA also confirmed those previous results. As VEGF-D and its receptors VEGFR2 and VEGFR3 are expressed in the hippocampus, we set out to investigate a possible effect of VEGF-D on axonal development. We cultured primary hippocampal neurons and stimulated them with 100 ng/ml VEGF-D at 1 DIV over the course of 48hours (neurons from three independent experiments) and analyzed the axonal morphology. VEGF-D stimulation of primary hippocampal neurons did not lead to an increase in the branch number when compared to control and VEGF (VEGF-A) stimulated neurons. VEGF-D however induced a significant increase in the length of axon branches.</p><p>Altogether, our new results point to a potential effect of VEGF-D in regulating the length of hippocampal axon branches. Still, VEGF-A seems to be the main factor that, acting via VEGFR2, leads to an increase number of axon branches. We believe that describing the entire mechanism of how VEGF-D regulates axon branch growth, and whether it does so via VEGFR2 activation, would require substantially more detailed experiments, which could be performed in a follow up study. For this reason, we prefer to answer this part of the reviewer’s comment just in the response letter and not include the data in the current manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The other aspect of the novelty is the idea that VEGFR2 relocalizes upon VEGF-A stimulation to actin patches, where it supposedly promotes neurite outgrowth. It would strengthen the work to move the kymographs to the main figures and label better to highlight these novel findings, and if possible, to include the movies from which the kymographs were derived (the co-labeling of actin and VEGFR2).</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for their suggestion. We have now moved the kymographs to the main figure (Figure 4 of revised manuscript) and included also the movies from which the kymographs were derived (Video 5, Video 6, Video 7 and Video 8).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Also, would strengthen to show spatial changes by a different approach – is it possible to use Proximity Ligation Assay or pull down to investigate VEGFR2 association with something localized to the actin patches and/or filopodia?</p></disp-quote><p>In the submitted manuscript we indeed investigated the specific localization and dynamics of VEGFR2 along the axon, as well as its potential association with actin patches and filopodia (Figure 4—figure supplement 1B-D of revised manuscript). For this aim, the approach we chose to follow was co-transfection of primary hippocampal neurons with a VEGFR2-GFP and a mCherry-UtrCH plasmid. This decision was based on the fact that (i) Utrophin is frequently used as a marker for stable and dynamic F-actin, both in fixed and living cells (Burkel, von Dassow and Bement, 2007; Melak, Plessner and Grosse, 2007); and that (ii) the calponin homology domains of utrophin interacts with adjacent actin subunits, thus further confirming that utrophin is a reliable marker for actin filaments/patches (Lin at al., 2007).</p><p>Our analysis confirmed the co-localization of VEGFR2 with utrophin in primary hippocampal neurons in vitro, suggesting an association between VEGFR2 and the actin cytoskeleton and a role of VEGFR2 in actin remodeling (Figure 4A). We therefore believe that the approach chosen is appropriate to show VEGFR2 localization in actin patches/filopodia.</p><p>In support of such an association, the direct effect of VEGFR2 on the actin cytoskeleton has been previously described in the context of angiogenesis, where VEGFR2 signaling leads to actin remodeling by phosphorylation of profilin-1 (Pfn-1), a small actin-binding protein, either directly or through Src tyrosine kinases (Fan et al., 2012). Actin remodeling mediated via VEGF/VEGFR2 signaling has also been described in the neuronal growth cones of chicken dorsal root ganglia (Olbrich et al., 2007).</p><p>Taken together, these data support a role of VEGFR2 in regulating actin dynamics and strengthen our results on a direct implication of VEGF/VEGFR2 signaling on actin remodeling in the axons hippocampal neurons.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Also, as described in review of co-submitted paper, it would be useful to better integrate the findings from the co-submitted paper in the Discussion section – it appears that endocytosis is important for dendrite biology, is it also important for the axon branching effects of VEGF/VEGFR2?</p></disp-quote><p>In the revised version of the manuscript, we have better integrated the findings from the co-submitted paper in the Discussion section.</p><p>We also checked whether internationalization of VEGFR2 is required for axon branching. For this, we followed a similar approach as in the accompanying manuscript (Harde et al.). We inhibited VEGFR2 internalization with dynasore, a dynamin inhibitor that blocks both clathrin-dependent and clathrin-independent endocytic pathways, and analyzed the VEGF-mediated effect on axonal branching.

In the accompanying paper, Harde et al. show that VEGF stimulation of 14 DIV hippocampal neurons induces SFKs activation (Figure 3C, accompanying manuscript). As SFKs activity is required for EphrinB2 mediated spine morphogenesis (Segura et al., 2007), and as EphrinB2 is also required for VEGF/VEGFR2-mediated regulation of dendritogenesis and spine morphogenesis in hippocampal neurons, we assume that indeed SFK activity is also required in the context of VEGF/VEGFR2induced dendritogenesis and spinogenesis.</p></body></sub-article></article>
