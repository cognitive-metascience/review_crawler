Motor contagions are believed to be induced simply by action observation and cause an observer's action to become similar to the action observed. In contrast, here we report a new motor contagion that is induced only when the observation is accompanied by prediction errors - differences between actions one observes and those he/she predicts or expects. In two experiments, one on whole-body baseball pitching and another on simple arm reaching, we show that the observation of the same action induces distinct motor contagions, depending on whether prediction errors are present or not. In the absence of prediction errors, as in previous reports, participants' actions changed to become similar to the observed action, while in the presence of prediction errors, their actions changed to diverge away from it, suggesting distinct effects of action observation and action prediction on human actions.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.33392.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Watching sports sometimes causes people to unintentionally move in the same way as the athlete they are observing. This type of unconscious mimicry is called a motor contagion. Observing everyday actions can also trigger motor contagion, and plays an important role in social interactions.</p><p>So far, studies have focused on understanding how observing an action leads to motor contagion. They have not factored in the fact that in everyday life individuals consciously or unconsciously predict observed actions by others. Sometimes these predictions are wrong, leading to so called ‘prediction errors’. It was not clear whether motor contagion occurs when the viewer has made an incorrect prediction, or if prediction errors change the behavior of the viewer.</p><p>Now, Ikegami, Ganesh et al. show that prediction errors influence motor contagion. In one experiment, baseball players were asked to watch a video of an actor pitching a ball toward a target and predict where on the target the ball would hit. Some of the players were given misleading information intended to increase the likelihood they would incorrectly predict where the actor would throw. The players then pitched the ball towards a target themselves. When the players had just watched the actor’s throw, their throws became similar to it. When their predictions were wrong, their throws were very different from the actor’s throw. The players were not aware of the changes to their throw in either case.</p><p>Ikegami, Ganesh et al. also conducted a similar experiment in which other volunteers were asked to observe an actor reaching for a target and then reach for the target themselves. The results were similar: when the volunteers’ predictions were wrong, they reached in different ways to the actor.</p><p>This may be a new type of motor contagion. Learning more about this effect could help researchers to better understand the adjustments people make to their social behaviors and give new insights about the brain mechanisms that underlie normal human actions and social interactions. Sports trainers or physical therapists might also use this information to develop better strategies for maintaining athlete performances or helping people to recover movement after an injury or illness.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>motor contagion</kwd><kwd>action observation</kwd><kwd>action execution</kwd><kwd>prediction error</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001691</institution-id><institution>Japan Society for the Promotion of Science</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>#16H05916</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ikegami</surname><given-names>Tsuyoshi</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001691</institution-id><institution>Japan Society for the Promotion of Science</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>#26120003</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ikegami</surname><given-names>Tsuyoshi</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001691</institution-id><institution>Japan Society for the Promotion of Science</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>#15616710</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ganesh</surname><given-names>Gowrishankar</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001691</institution-id><institution>Japan Society for the Promotion of Science</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>#13380602</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ganesh</surname><given-names>Gowrishankar</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001691</institution-id><institution>Japan Society for the Promotion of Science</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>#16K12999</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Nakamoto</surname><given-names>Hiroki</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001691</institution-id><institution>Japan Society for the Promotion of Science</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>#26702025</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Nakamoto</surname><given-names>Hiroki</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>A new type of implicit effects on one's actions induced by prediction errors during action observation is discovered.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Our motor behaviors are shaped not just by physical interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Shergill et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Ganesh et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Takagi et al., 2017</xref>) but also by a variety of perceptual (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Heyes, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chartrand and Bargh, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Ikegami and Ganesh, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cook et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Ganesh and Ikegami, 2016</xref>) interactions with other individuals. <italic>Motor contagions</italic> are the result of such a perceptual interaction.

These motor contagions are induced simply by action observation and have a signature characteristic - they cause certain features of one’s action (such as kinematics [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Brass et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Heyes, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Kilner et al., 2003</xref>], goal [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Edwards et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Becchio et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Gleissner et al., 2000</xref>], or outcome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Gray and Beilock, 2011</xref>]) to become similar to that of the observed action. In contrast, here we report a new motor contagion that is induced not simply by action observation, but when the observation is accompanied by <italic>prediction errors -</italic> differences between actions one observes and those he/she predicts or expects. Furthermore, this contagion may not lead to similarities between observed actions and one’s own actions. Here we report results from two experiments to show that distinct motor contagions are induced by the observation of the same actions depending on whether prediction errors are present or not. We show that these contagions are present not only in high dimensional whole body movement tasks such as baseball pitching (Experiment-1) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Ikegami et al., 2017</xref>), but also simple day-to-day movement tasks such as arm reaching (Experiment-2).</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Experiment-1</title><p>Thirty varsity baseball players participated in our Experiment-1. The sample size was determined by a power analysis (see Materials and methods). The participants were randomly assigned to one of three groups (n = 10 in each): No prediction error (nPE) group, Prediction error (PE) group, and Control (CON) group. The participant’s baseball experience was balanced across the three groups (F(2,27)=1.431, p=0.257, η<sub>p</sub><sup>2</sup>=0.096). The participants in the nPE and PE groups performed five <italic>throwing</italic> sessions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>) that were interspersed with four <italic>observation</italic> sessions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B,C</xref>). The participants in the CON group performed only the throwing sessions. Instead of the observation sessions, they took a break in between the throwing sessions for a time period equivalent to the length of the observation sessions.</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.33392.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Experiment-1 consisted of two tasks.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) In the <italic>throwing task</italic>, the participants threw balls aimed for the center of a target while wearing ‘occlusion’ goggles, that turned opaque when the participant's arm crossed the infrared beam.

They made their throws while wearing ‘occlusion’ goggles that turned opaque when the participants released the ball from their hand (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). The participants could thus see the target for aiming, but could not see where their ball hit the target. Each throwing session included ten throws.</p><p>In the observation session, the participants in the nPE and PE groups watched a video of throws made by an unknown baseball pitcher. After each throw, a numbered grid (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>) appeared on the target (in the video) once the ball hit the target, and the participants were asked to report the grid number corresponding to where they saw the ball hit the target. The purpose of this reporting task was to ensure that the participants maintained their attention on the target in the video. To cancel out any spatial bias with respect to the observed actions, half the participants in each group (called upper-right observing participants) were shown throws that predominantly hit the upper-right corner of the target (most frequent at #3, see yellow gradient <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref> and Materials and methods for observed throw distribution). The other five participants (called lower-left observing participants) were shown a video of throws predominantly hitting the lower-left corner of the target (most frequent at #7, see Materials and methods). Each observation session included 20 observed throws.</p><fig id="fig2" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.33392.004</object-id><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Throw hit locations of participants in Experiment-1.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) The across participant average (and s.e.) of hit locations in the CON group shown in gradients of gray, with a darker color representing a later throwing session.

The colored arrows indicate the linear fit of the participant-averaged hit locations across the throwing sessions.</p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="x-tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-33392-fig2-v1"/></fig><p>Different instructions were provided to the nPE and PE groups to manipulate the prediction errors induced in them. The participants in the nPE group were told that ‘the pitcher in the video is aiming for different grid numbers on the target across trials. These numbers were provided by the experimenter and we display only those trials in which he was successful in hitting the number he aimed for’. On the other hand, participants in the PE group were instructed that ‘the pitcher in the video is aiming for the center of the target’.</p><p>The two different instructions were designed to lead to greater prediction errors in the PE group compared with the nPE group. The instruction to the nPE group prevents the participants from having any prior expectation of the outcome of an observed throw, and was thus expected to attenuate any prediction error. In contrast, the instruction to the PE group makes the participants expect the observed throws to hit near the target center. Similar to previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Ikegami and Ganesh, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Ondobaka et al., 2015</xref>), this instruction was thus expected to induce a difference between the throw outcome expected by the participants and the actual outcome observed by them. Specifically, we expected the upper-right and lower-left observation participants in the PE group to experience prediction errors, directed towards the upper-right and lower-left, respectively.</p><p>The participants’ task performance in the throwing session was evaluated as a change in the throw hit location. The position of the hit locations was measured along the ‘parallel’ and ‘orthogonal’ diagonals (see green arrows in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). The diagonal joining the upper-right and lower-left corners, that were the predominant locations of the pitcher’s throws in the observed video, was named the ‘parallel’ diagonal. Data from the upper-right and lower-left observing participants were analyzed together by flipping the coordinate of the data from the lower-left observing participants (see Materials and methods).</p><p>First, in the observation session, the accuracy (% correct) of the report was comparable between the two groups (nPE: 96.25 ± 1.48 (mean ± s.d.) %, PE: 95.63 ± 3.32 %; two sample t-test, t(18)=0.516, p=0.612). This ensures that the level of attention to the video was similar between the two groups.</p><p>The performance in the throwing session, however, dramatically differed between the two groups. The throws by the nPE group progressively drifted towards where the pitcher in the video predominantly threw the ball (blue data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). This pattern is similar to the motor contagion reported previously as outcome mimicry (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Gray and Beilock, 2011</xref>). In contrast, the throws by the PE group progressively drifted <italic>away</italic> from where the pitcher in the video predominantly threw the ball (red data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). The hit locations along the parallel diagonal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>) showed a significant interaction between the sessions and groups (F(8,108)=5.124, p=2 × 10<sup>−5</sup>, η<sub>p</sub><sup>2</sup>=0.275). Across the sessions, the throws in the nPE group (blue data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">3</xref>) significantly drifted towards the direction of observed pitcher’s throws (F(4,36)=2.910, p=0.035, η<sub>p</sub><sup>2</sup>=0.244; first vs fifth sessions by Tukey’s test: p=0.034) while the throws in the PE group (red data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">3</xref>) significantly drifted away from the observed pitcher’s throws (F(4,36)=5.170, p=2 × 10<sup>−3</sup>, η<sub>p</sub><sup>2</sup>=0.365; first vs fifth sessions by Tukey’s test: p=5 × 10<sup>−3</sup>). The throws in the CON group (black data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">3</xref>) did not show such a drift (F(4,36)=0.297, p=0.878, η<sub>p</sub><sup>2</sup>=0.032) along the parallel diagonal.</p><fig id="fig3" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.33392.005</object-id><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>Changes in the hit locations of the participants’ throws across the throwing sessions in Experiment-1.</title><p>The participant-averaged deviations from the target center along the parallel diagonal were plotted by flipping the data from the lower-left observing participants, such that the directions of pitcher’s throws observed by all participants in both the nPE and PE groups were in the positive ordinate (indicated by gray arrow). The data from the CON, nPE, and PE groups are plotted in black, blue, and red, respectively. The throws by the nPE group progressively deviated towards where the pitcher in the video threw the ball most frequently. In contrast, the throws by the nPE group progressively deviated away from where the pitcher in the video threw the ball most frequently. The throws by the CON group did not change across sessions. Error bars indicate standard error.</p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="x-tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-33392-fig3-v1"/></fig><p>On the other hand, the hit locations along the orthogonal diagonal in all the nPE, PE, and CON groups showed no significant differences across the throwing sessions (F(4,108)=1.762, p=0.142, η<sub>p</sub><sup>2</sup>=0.061) and between the groups (F(2,27)=1.150, p=0.332, η<sub>p</sub><sup>2</sup>=0.079). This result confirms that the drifts observed in the nPE and PE groups are not the result of possible cognitive fatigue induced by the extra observation task they performed (compared with the CON group), or cognitive biases induced by the validity of the instructions given to them. In either case, we would have expected their throws to also drift in directions other than along the parallel diagonal. The focused drifts along the parallel diagonal suggest that the drifts were induced by the bias in the observed pitcher’s throws (in the nPE group) and the prediction errors (in the PE group), both of which were present specifically along the parallel diagonal.</p><p>In addition, the effects of observed actions on the participants’ actions emerged as an increase in spatial bias but not in spatial variability in their action outcome.

Half the participants in each group watched a video showing the actor predominantly touching the right area (called right observing participants), and the other half watched a video showing the actor predominantly touching the left area (called left observing participants), respectively (see Materials and methods). Each observation session included 20 observed reaches.</p><p>To manipulate the prediction errors, we again provided different instructions to the nPE and PE groups. For the nPE group, the right and left observing participants were told that ‘the actor in the video is aiming for the right area’ and ‘the actor in the video is aiming for the left area’, respectively. This instruction was expected to minimize the difference between the actor’s touch location expected by the participants, and the actual location observed by them, thus leading to suppression in prediction errors. On the other hand, participants in the PE group were instructed that ‘the actor in the video is aiming for the center line’. This instruction was expected to induce substantial prediction errors as in Experiment-1.</p><p>To evaluate the participants’ reaching performance in the reaching session, the touch locations were measured along the x-axis on the screen. Similar to the main experiment, data from the right and left observing participants were analyzed together by flipping the coordinate of the data from the left observing participants (see Materials and methods).</p><p>First, in the observation session, we confirmed that the accuracy (% correct) of the report was comparable between the two groups (nPE: 93.20 ± 3.94 (mean ± s.d.) %, PE: 93.00 ± 5.10 %; two sample t-test, t(18)=0.098, p=0.923). Next, in the reaching session, we observed similar results to Experiment-1; the touch locations by the participants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>) showed significant interaction between the sessions and groups (F(8,108)=2.568, p=0.013, η<sub>p</sub><sup>2</sup>=0.160). Across the sessions, the touch locations by the nPE group (blue data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>) drifted towards the direction of observed actor’s touch locations (F(4,36)=2.307, p=0.077, η<sub>p</sub><sup>2</sup>=0.204), although it marginally missed statistical significance. More importantly for this study, the touch locations by the PE group (red data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>) significantly drifted away from the direction of the observed actor’s touch locations (F(4,36)=2.683, p=0.047, η<sub>p</sub><sup>2</sup>=0.230). The touch locations in the CON group (black data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>) did not show any substantial change (F(4,36)=0.639, p=0.638, η<sub>p</sub><sup>2</sup>=0.066). In addition, the within-participant variability in their touch locations showed no significant differences across the reaching sessions (nPE: χ<sup>2</sup>(4)=5.04, p=0.283; PE χ<sup>2</sup>(4)=4.80, p=0.308; CON: χ<sup>2</sup>(4)=9.44, p=0.051).</p><p>Thus, Experiment-2 successfully reproduced the Experiment-1 results, which suggests that the two distinct motor contagions can affect even basic everyday movements like arm reaching. Crucially, the clear motor performance changes in the PE groups observed in the two experiments validate the presence of a new motor contagion which is induced by prediction errors during action observation.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Previous motor contagion studies have extensively examined how observation of the actions of others affects action production (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Heyes, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chartrand and Bargh, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Becchio et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Brass et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Edwards et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Gray and Beilock, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Kilner et al., 2003</xref>). On the other hand, while previous action prediction studies have examined how action production (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Mulligan et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Hamilton et al., 2004</xref>), or the ability to produce an action (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Knoblich and Flach, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Urgesi et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Kanakogi and Itakura, 2011</xref>) affects prediction of observed actions, the converse, the effect of action prediction on one’s actions, has rarely been examined. One exception is our previous study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Ikegami and Ganesh, 2014</xref>), which reported that an improvement in the ability to predict observed actions affects the observer's ability to produce the same action. The observations from this previous study are likely to be a prediction error induced motor contagion, but as the direction of the observed actions and the corresponding prediction errors were not controlled in the study, it was difficult to conclude this cause. Overall, the effects of action prediction and action observation on action production have never been compared. This study compares the two effects for the first time by modulating the prediction errors perceived by participants, when they observe throws or reaches by another individual. We show that, while in the absence of prediction errors (nPE group), the action observation makes the participants’ actions (throws and reaches) become similar to the observed actions (as in previous reports [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Heyes, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Gray and Beilock, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Blakemore and Frith, 2005</xref>]), in the presence of prediction errors (PE group), the same action observation makes the participants' actions diverge away from the observed actions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">4B</xref>). Our results thus suggest the presence of a distinct, prediction error induced motor contagion in human behaviors.</p><p>The previously reported motor contagions are believed to be caused by the presence of ‘long-term’ sensorimotor associations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Heyes, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Cook et al., 2014</xref>), in which an observed action automatically activates an individual’s sensorimotor representations of the same action, making his/her actions similar to the observed actions. While further studies are required to understand the mechanisms underlying the prediction error induced motor contagion, it is still interesting to note the parallel between this motor contagion and behavioral characteristic of motor learning. When learning a new motor task, individuals are believed to utilize prediction errors from self-generated actions to change their sensorimotor associations, and correct their actions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Shadmehr et al., 2010</xref>). The motor contagion in the PE group seems to cause participants to make similar action corrections to compensate for their prediction errors, strangely even though the prediction errors are from actions made by another (observed) individual, rather than from self-generated actions. Therefore, while the previously reported motor contagions may be explained as a facilitation/interference in action production by the sensorimotor associations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Heyes, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Cook et al., 2014</xref>) activated by observed actions, the new contagion we present here is probably a result of erroneous changes in the sensorimotor associations, caused by the observed prediction errors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Ikegami and Ganesh, 2017</xref>).</p><p>The prediction error induced contagions presented here seem similar to the phenomena of observational motor learning, in which the observation of an action is reported to aid subsequent motor learning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Adams, 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Schmidt and Lee, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Mattar and Gribble, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Buckingham et al., 2014</xref>). It has been suggested that observational motor learning is possible because of an observation induced adaptation of the <italic>inverse model</italic> (or controller) that determines motor commands for a given task (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Brown et al., 2010</xref>). On the other hand, in a recent study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Ikegami and Ganesh, 2017</xref>), we showed that the behavioral changes resulting from prediction error induced contagions can be explained only by an influence in an individual’s <italic>forward model,</italic> that uses the motor commands to estimate one’s movement outcomes. This difference in effects could result from two factors. First, unlike observational motor learning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Maslovat et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Ong et al., 2012</xref>), our previous (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Ikegami and Ganesh, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Ikegami and Ganesh, 2017</xref>) and present studies did not require the participants to learn a new motor task, and in fact included participants who were arguably over-trained in the task. This strongly suggests that the contagion effects in these studies are implicit (not willed by the participants). And second, unlike the observational motor learning studies, this study systematically manipulates the participants’ belief regarding the observed actions to control the direction of prediction errors. The lack of an explicitly required learning and the effect of belief are probably key to whether and to what extent, observed actions affect the inverse, or forward modeling process, or both. However, further studies are required to address this question concretely. Finally, further studies are also needed to examine whether the prediction error induced motor contagions play a functional role in our motor actions. If the contagions are proved to contribute to motor skill acquisition or motor adaptation to a new environment, we may need to re-define the phenomenon as a new learning process rather than a new motor contagion.</p><p>In conclusion, our results clearly show that action observation and action prediction can induce distinct effects on an observer’s actions. Understanding the interactions between these distinct effects is arguably critical for the complete understanding of human skill learning. For example, it can enable a better understanding of the link between the mechanisms of motor contagions and motor learning, and help develop better procedures to improve motor performances in sports and rehabilitation.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Participants</title><sec id="s4-1-1"><title>Experiment-1</title><p>Thirty right-handed male varsity baseball players (20.33 ± 1.62 (mean ± s.d.) years old) with normal or corrected vision, took part in Experiment-1.

The hit locations of each throw were first measured in the x-y coordinates where the center of the target was taken as the origin. The throwing task performance in each session was evaluated as the distance of hit location from the target center, averaged over the ten throws for each participant. This value was then averaged across the participants and plotted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A,B</xref>. For statistical analysis, the hit locations by all three groups were analyzed along the diagonals (green arrows in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>), parallel and orthogonal to the line joining the corners of the target where the observed throws predominantly hit (#3 or #7). To pool the participants in one group, the hit locations of the throws by the participants who viewed the pitcher aiming for the lower left corner of the target were flipped along the parallel and orthogonal diagonals about the data in the first throwing session. Note that the hit locations in the first throwing session need not be corrected because these represent the default performance by the participant, before the first observation session. To examine spatial biases in the hit location, we separately performed two-way ANOVAs (three groups × five throwing sessions) on the hit locations of the participants’ throws along each of the parallel and orthogonal diagonal. Post hoc pairwise comparisons were performed using Tukey’s method. To examine within-participant variability changes in the hit location across the five throwing sessions, we separately performed Friedman’s test on variances of the hit locations within each session (non-normal data) along each of the parallel and orthogonal diagonals for each group. Post hoc pairwise comparisons were performed using the Wilcoxon signed rank test.</p></sec><sec id="s4-3-2"><title>Observation performance analysis in Experiment-1</title><p>In the observation session, participants in the nPE and PE groups were required to answer where the balls thrown by the pitchers hit the target by orally reporting one of nine possible areas in each trial. The percentage of correct answers in each observation session was calculated for each participant.</p></sec><sec id="s4-3-3"><title>Touch location analysis in Experiment-2</title><p>The touch locations of each reach were first measured in the x-y coordinates with the center of the screen as the origin. The reaching task performance in each session was evaluated as the distance of the touch location from the center vertical line along the x-axis, averaged over the ten reaches by each participant. This value was then averaged across the participants and plotted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>. For statistical analysis, to pool the participants in one group, the touch locations of the reaches by the participants who viewed the actor aiming for the left area were flipped along the x-axis about the data in the first reaching session, similar to Experiment-1. We separately performed two-way ANOVAs (three groups × five throwing sessions) on the touch locations of the participants’ reaches. We separately performed Friedman’s test on variances of the touch locations within each session (non-normal data) for each group.</p></sec><sec id="s4-3-4"><title>Observation performance analysis in Experiment-2</title><p>In the observation session, participants in the nPE and PE groups were required to answer where the actor touched the screen by writing down one of three possible answers in each trial.

A lightly edited version of the letter sent to the authors after peer review is shown, indicating the most substantive concerns; minor comments are not usually included.</p></boxed-text><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Prediction error induced motor contagions in human behaviors&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Senior Editor and a Reviewing Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal his identity: Kyle Dunovan (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>We all found the paper very interesting. The experiment was straightforward and the results support the conclusions. However, we have several concerns that will need to be addressed regarding the generality of the findings, presentation of the data, and better highlighting of the novelty of the findings. These points are outlined in detail below.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>First, whereas we appreciate the ecological approach taken in the study, we are concerned that the findings may only be applicable to experts in particular context (varsity-level baseball players engaging in a pitching task). If this study is revealing a general principle about how prediction errors can be defined through instructions or interpretation of another person's intent, then the findings should replicate in non-experts in a different task. Indeed, previous studies – including your own – have found significant differences between experts and non-experts in perception. A potential worry here is that the varsity-level baseball players have become experts in learning from observation and that these findings will not extend to the general population.</p><p>To address this concern, we would like you to conduct a similar study in a group of non-experts in a computerized variant of the task. While we will leave the specific details of this task up to you, one suggestion would be to have two groups of non-experts make reaching or shooting movements to bring a cursor to a target zone after observing errors. One group would be instructed that the intention of the observed behavior was to hit the center of the target (PE group), while another group would be instructed that the intention was to hit a different zone near the target (nPE group). The prediction here is that the PE group will move in a direction to counteract the errors and the nPE group will move in the direction of the error, consistent with your current findings. This follow-up study would go a long way in showing that your findings reveal a general principle about how prediction errors are interpreted.</p><p>Second, a peculiar finding in the current study is that both the nPE and PE groups' baseline behavior – prior to observing the errors – are already in the direction of the final result. While we suspect that this just reflects noise in the sample, it might be clearer to understand the results if there were not so heavily binned. We suggest that you re-create Figure 3, but showing all the trials rather than binning each block (including 95% confidence intervals of the mean). Presenting data from individual subjects may also be illuminating. We acknowledge that these results may be messy to look at and, ultimately, may not be the best format for the paper; nonetheless, we would like you to at least include them in the response to the reviewers.</p><p>Third, we would like you to analyze the within-subject variability of the data following the observation block. One possibility is that within-subject variance increases due to prolonged absence of visual feedback and that these increases are equal for all three groups (CON, nPE, and PE). An alternative outcome is that the nPE and PE groups are affected by both the direction of the observed throws and the variability of these throws. Here, an interesting outcome is that the variability of the nPE and PE groups in the last session would be similar to the variability in the videos. We think this outcome would strengthen conclusions regarding motor contagion as a direct result of observation.</p><p>Finally, previous work by Gribble and colleagues has found that subjects display enhanced adaptation after observing force field learning. The findings from your PE group are consistent with the findings of Gribble et al. To better differentiate your current findings from this prior work, it may be worth discussing how belief regarding the intention of actor, during observation, can result in either motor contagion or internal model adaptation. Further, we think the paper could have a broader impact if you included a section (in the Discussion) about potential neural and/or computational differences between motor contagions and prediction-error-based internal models.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.33392.016</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>First, whereas we appreciate the ecological approach taken in the study, we are concerned that the findings may only be applicable to experts in particular context (varsity-level baseball players engaging in a pitching task).

The participants in this ‘Experiment-2’ were asked to make arm reaching movements towards a target line on a computer screen with their right index finger (see Figure 4A). Similar to our throwing experiment (Experiment-1), we used occlusion goggles to prevent feedback of their final finger position, and showed them the video of another individual whose finger pointing was biased in one of two directions, left or right. We then show that, similar to our throwing experiment, the participant’s movements again deviate in opposite directions depending on whether prediction errors were present or not (See Figure 4B). We again observed a significant interaction in the participants’ motor performance changes between nPE, PE, and CON groups. The reproduction of the same effect in such a simple task was pleasantly surprising, and very exciting for us, and hence we thank the reviewers for the suggestion. The details of this Experiment-2 have been explained in the subsections “2) Experiment-2”, “2) Task and apparatus in Experiment-2”, and” Touch location analysis in Experiment-2” in Materials and methods and in the subsection “Experiment 2” in Results.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Second, a peculiar finding in the current study is that both the nPE and PE groups' baseline behavior – prior to observing the errors – are already in the direction of the final result.

Though the one-way ANOVA on the hit locations in the first session showed no significant effect of groups (F(2,27)=3.110, p=0.061), the p-value was marginal. However, looking at the raw data we could see that this marginal p value was probably coincidental. As requested by the reviewers, we show below the data from each individual participant across the sessions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig1">Author response image 1</xref>), and the individual 10 throws from each participant in the first session (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig2">Author response image 2</xref>). As can be observed, the within-participant variability was quite high in each session and there is no visible difference between the groups in the first session. Moreover, the first session in the new reaching experiment (Experiment-2) showed no significant main effect between groups (F(2,27)=0.35, p=0.7032) as observed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig3">Author response image 3</xref>.</p><fig id="respfig1"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.33392.010</object-id><label>Author response image 1.</label><caption><title>All trial data from all participants in Experiment-1.</title><p>Different colors and shapes indicate different groups and participants, respectively.

We had checked and found that there was no substantial change in the variability, but we seem to have missed to report this result in the manuscript, for which we are sorry.</p><p>In Experiment-1, the within-participant variability along both the parallel and orthogonal direction does not show any significant change either across the throwing sessions (parallel: F(4,108)=1.934, P=0.109; orthogonal: F(4,108)=0.861, P=0.490) and between the groups (parallel: F(2,27)=0.465, P=0.633; orthogonal: F(2,27)=1.030, P=0.371). In Experiment-2, the within-participant variability along the x axis does not show any significant change across the throwing sessions (F(4,108)=1.155, P=0.335) and between the groups (parallel: F(2,27)=1.090, P=0.351).</p><p>This result suggests that the two distinct motor contagions observed in our study, both emerge as an increase in spatial bias rather than variability in the participants’ action outcome. We have added this detail now in the tenth paragraph of the subsection “Experiment-1” and in the last paragraph of the subsection “Experiment 2”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Finally, previous work by Gribble and colleagues has found that subjects display enhanced adaptation after observing force field learning. The findings from your PE group are consistent with the findings of Gribble et al. To better differentiate your current findings from this prior work, it may be worth discussing how belief regarding the intention of actor, during observation, can result in either motor contagion or internal model adaptation. Further, we think the paper could have a broader impact if you included a section (in the Discussion) about potential neural and/or computational differences between motor contagions and prediction-error-based internal models.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewers for this suggestion. We agree with the reviewers that further discussions on the differences between our motor contagions and the observational motor learning by Gribble et al., and the corresponding computational mechanisms would improve the Discussion.</p><p>We believe that the major difference between the results of Gribble et al., and the contagions we observe here are in the part of the motor system affected by the action observation. We believe that the results by Gribble et al. are a consequence of changes in a participant’s ‘inverse model’ or controller, required for learning of a new motor task (arm reaching in a novel force field), as the authors themselves suggest in Brown et al. (2010). On the other hand, we believe the contagions we report here affect an individual’s forward estimation of his own action outcomes, or his ‘forward model’. This belief is based on our recent studies, where we found that the action changes caused by prediction errors during action observation (Ikegami and Ganesh, 2014) are explained by an effect in an individual’s forward model rather than inverse model or controller (Ikegami and Ganesh, 2017).</p><p>It therefore seems that observation can affect both the inverse and the forward modelling processes in the brain. However, observation learning studies, unlike our study here, have traditionally utilized tasks where subjects are explicitly required to learn a new force field. Furthermore, unlike the observational motor learning studies, this study systematically manipulates the participants’ belief regarding the observed actions in order to control the direction of prediction errors. The lack of an explicitly required learning and the effect of belief are probably key to whether and to what extent, observed actions affect the inverse, or forward modeling process, or both. However, further studies are required to address this question concretely.</p><p>We have added these points to the Discussion (third paragraph).</p></body></sub-article></article>
