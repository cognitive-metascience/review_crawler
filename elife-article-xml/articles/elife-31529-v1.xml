pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.31529.001</object-id><p>Ribonucleotide reductases (RNRs) are key enzymes in DNA metabolism, with allosteric mechanisms controlling substrate specificity and overall activity. In RNRs, the activity master-switch, the ATP-cone, has been found exclusively in the catalytic subunit. In two class I RNR subclasses whose catalytic subunit lacks the ATP-cone, we discovered ATP-cones in the radical-generating subunit. The ATP-cone in the <italic>Leeuwenhoekiella blandensis</italic> radical-generating subunit regulates activity via quaternary structure induced by binding of nucleotides. ATP induces enzymatically competent dimers, whereas dATP induces non-productive tetramers, resulting in different holoenzymes. The tetramer forms by interactions between ATP-cones, shown by a 2.45 Å crystal structure. We also present evidence for an Mn<sup>III</sup>Mn<sup>IV</sup> metal center. In summary, lack of an ATP-cone domain in the catalytic subunit was compensated by transfer of the domain to the radical-generating subunit. To our knowledge, this represents the first observation of transfer of an allosteric domain between components of the same enzyme complex.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.31529.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>When a cell copies its DNA, it uses four different building blocks called deoxyribonucleotides (dNTPs). These consist of one of the four ‘bases’ (A, T, C and G), which pair up to link the two strands of DNA in the double helix, bound to a sugar and a phosphate group. If the cell contains too little or too much of one of these building blocks, an incorrect base may be inserted into the DNA. This results in a mutation, which in bacteria can cause death, and in animals may lead to cancer.</p><p>The enzyme that fabricates and carefully controls the amount of each dNTP building block inside a cell is called ribonucleotide reductase. Once there are enough building blocks in a cell the enzyme is turned off. A part of the enzyme called the ATP-cone acts as an on/off switch to control this activity.</p><p>The ribonucleotide reductase consists of a large component and a small component. Until now, studies of the ATP-cone have found it only in the large component of the enzyme. However, when looking through a public database of sequence data, Rozman Grinberg et al. noticed that ribonucleotide reductases in some bacteria have their ATP-cone joined to the small component. Does this ATP-cone also control the amounts of dNTP building blocks inside cells and, if so, how?</p><p>Rozman Grinberg et al. studied one such ATP-cone in a ribonucleotide reductase from a bacterium (named <italic>Leeuwenhoekiella blandensis</italic>) found in the Mediterranean Sea. This revealed that when the amount of dNTP building blocks reaches a certain limit, the ATP-cone turns off the enzyme. Examining the three-dimensional structure of the enzyme using a technique called X-ray crystallography revealed that when turned off, the enzyme’s small components are glued together in pairs. This prevents them from working. Rozman Grinberg et al. also discovered that this enzyme contains a new type of metal center with two manganese ions suggesting that a new reaction mechanism may operate in this class of ribonucleotide reductase.</p><p>These findings support a theory that biological on/off switches can evolve rapidly. In addition to its evolutionary and biomedical interest, understanding how the ATP-cone works might help to improve the enzymes used in industrial processes.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>Leewenhoekiella blandensis</kwd><kwd>ribonucleotide reductase</kwd><kwd>allosteric regulation</kwd><kwd>dATP inhibition</kwd><kwd>ATP-cone</kwd><kwd>oligomerization</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Other</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100002794</institution-id><institution>Cancerfonden</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>CAN 721 2016/670</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Sjöberg</surname><given-names>Britt-Marie</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004359</institution-id><institution>Vetenskapsrådet</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>2016-01920,2016-04855,621-2014-5670</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Berggren</surname><given-names>Gustav</given-names></name><name><surname>Logan</surname><given-names>Derek</given-names></name><name><surname>Sjöberg</surname><given-names>Britt-Marie</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100001388</institution-id><institution>Wenner-Gren Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Sjöberg</surname><given-names>Britt-Marie</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100002805</institution-id><institution>Carl Tryggers Stiftelse för Vetenskaplig Forskning</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Hofer</surname><given-names>Anders</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001862</institution-id><institution>Svenska Forskningsrådet Formas</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>213-2014-880</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Berggren</surname><given-names>Gustav</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100010663</institution-id><institution>H2020 European Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>714102</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Berggren</surname><given-names>Gustav</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Structural and functional characterization of an unanticipated mode of allosteric activity regulation in ribonucleotide reductases controlled by an ATP-cone in the radical-generating subunit.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Allosteric regulation of an enzyme is defined as regulation of activity by binding of an effector molecule to a different location of the enzyme than the active site. The effector influences the distribution of tertiary or quaternary conformations of an enzyme, alone or in combination, modulating its activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Swain and Gierasch, 2006</xref>). Allostery is an intrinsic property of many, if not all, dynamic proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Gunasekaran et al., 2004</xref>) and an important factor in disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Nussinov and Tsai, 2013</xref>), and has hence attracted considerable scientific interest. A substantial part of this interest has been focused on ribonucleotide reductase (RNR), which has been termed a ‘paradigm for allosteric regulation of enzymes’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Aravind et al., 2000</xref>).</p><p>RNRs are essential enzymes in all free-living cells, providing the only known de novo pathway for the biosynthesis of deoxyribonucleotides (dNTPs), the immediate precursors for DNA synthesis and repair (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Hofer et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Nordlund and Reichard, 2006</xref>). To avoid imbalanced levels of dNTPs and the increased mutation rates that are the inevitable consequences of this (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Kumar et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Mathews, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Watt et al., 2016</xref>), RNRs are tightly controlled through transcriptional and allosteric regulation, subcellular compartmentalization and small protein inhibitors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Pai and Kearsey, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Torrents, 2014</xref>). Allosteric regulation of RNRs affects both substrate specificity and overall activity. The specificity regulation has been intensively studied and described for all three classes of RNRs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Andersson et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Hofer et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Larsson et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Reichard, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Torrents et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Zimanyi et al., 2016</xref>). The s-site binds dNTPs and determines which nucleotide will be reduced at the active site to ensure balanced levels of the four dNTPs in the cell. Additionally, many RNRs possess an overall activity regulation site (a-site) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Brown and Reichard, 1969</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Thelander and Reichard, 1979</xref>) positioned in an N-terminal domain of ~85–100 amino acid residues called the ATP-cone (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Aravind et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Eriksson et al., 1997</xref>). Acting as a regulatory master switch, the a-site senses intracellular nucleotide concentrations by competitive binding of ATP and dATP. In the presence of ATP the enzyme is active, and when concentrations of dNTPs rise, binding of dATP switches the enzyme off. This mechanism ensures sufficient but not excessive amounts of nucleotides that may also cause increased mutation rates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Mathews, 2006</xref>).</p><p>The ATP-cone is an example of allosteric regulation controlled by a domain that acts relatively independent of the catalytic core of proteins. This type of allosteric regulation has been shown to provide an evolutionarily dynamic process by which allosteric regulation can be lost or gained both in RNRs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Lundin et al., 2015</xref>) and other enzymes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Aravind and Koonin, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Lang et al., 2014</xref>). Although regulation has been lost and gained repeatedly in RNRs through evolutionary time, to date, the ATP-cone domain has been observed exclusively at the N-terminus of the catalytic subunit NrdA (class I), NrdJ (class II) and NrdD (class III). Class I RNRs consist of a large, catalytic subunit (α or NrdA), and a smaller, radical-generating subunit (β or NrdB) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Huang et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Nordlund and Reichard, 2006</xref>). NrdA and NrdB interact to form the active complex, in which the two proteins need to be precisely positioned such that the radical can be transferred from NrdB, where it is generated and stored, to NrdA, where it starts the substrate reduction. In class I, it has long been noted that ATP-cones are absent from subclass Ib (NrdE) but present in several, but not all, NrdAs. A recent phylogenetic subclassification of RNRs reveals that three phylogenetically well-supported subclasses of class I never have ATP-cones (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Jonna et al., 2015</xref>) (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://rnrdb.pfitmap.org">http://rnrdb.pfitmap.org</ext-link>): NrdE, NrdAi and NrdAk. In two of these subclasses we instead discovered ATP-cones attached to their corresponding radical-generating subunit: NrdF (the Ib subclass) and NrdBi. It hence appears as if the lack of activity regulation through an ATP-cone in the catalytic subunit is compensated by the presence of this domain in the non-homologous radical-generating subunit of some RNRs.</p><p>Three distinct types of class I complexes have been mechanistically characterized and found to operate via nucleotide-induced regulation of quaternary structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Johansson et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Jonna et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Kashlan et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Rofougaran et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Rofougaran et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Torrents et al., 2006</xref>). Crystal structures, cryo-electron microscopy reconstructions and small-angle X-ray scattering studies of inhibited complexes have revealed that when dATP is bound at the a-site, high molecular mass oligomers are formed, in which the radical transfer pathway is distorted (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Ando et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Ando et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Fairman et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Johansson et al., 2016</xref>). Conversely, when ATP is bound, an active enzyme complex is formed. Interestingly, the structure and organization of subunits in active and inactive complexes varies considerably between species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Ahmad and Dealwis, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Hofer et al., 2012</xref>). In <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> RNR, the active NrdAB complex is α<sub>2</sub>β<sub>2</sub>, whereas the inactive form is an α<sub>4</sub>β<sub>4</sub> ring-shaped octamer where the ATP-cones in the α subunits sequester the β subunits in a non-productive conformation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Ando et al., 2011</xref>). In the eukaryotic class I RNR, the inactive complex differs from the one in <italic>E. coli</italic> in that it has an α<sub>6</sub> stoichiometry. This hexamer can only bind one β<sub>2</sub> subunit in an unproductive manner without a properly aligned electron transport chain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Fairman et al., 2011</xref>). Activation by ATP creates a different type of α<sub>6</sub> complex that binds one or more β<sub>2</sub> complexes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Ando et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Aye and Stubbe, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Crona et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Fairman et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Rofougaran et al., 2006</xref>). The different complexes are formed by subtle changes at the a-site induced by binding of the different nucleotides (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Fairman et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Xu et al., 2006</xref>). Another oligomerization mechanism has been recently found in <italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic> class I RNR, which possesses two consecutive ATP-cones, of which only the N-terminal one binds nucleotides. The active complex is once again α<sub>2</sub>β<sub>2</sub>, but the inactive <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> RNR complex is a dATP-induced α<sub>4</sub> complex consisting of a ring of four α subunits interacting via their outer ATP-cones (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Johansson et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Jonna et al., 2015</xref>). A single β<sub>2</sub> can bind to this ring, but the complex is inactive. Oligomerization of RNRs may be a useful character to explore biomedically. RNRs have long attracted interest as potential targets for novel antibiotics as well as for cancer therapy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Aye et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Julián et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Tholander and Sjöberg, 2012</xref>). Several RNR drugs are directed towards the radical-containing subunit and the active site of the catalytic subunit. Recently, some nucleoside analogs used in cancer treatments and known to inhibit RNRs in vitro in their phosphorylated forms were shown to induce hexameric complexes in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Aye et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Aye and Stubbe, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Wisitpitthaya et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>The unexpected finding of an ATP-cone fused to the radical-generating subunits poses questions regarding how it might regulate activity. Here we describe the mechanism of activity regulation by the ATP-cone N-terminally fused to the radical-generating NrdBi from <italic>Leeuwenhoekiella blandensis</italic> sp. nov. strain MED217. <italic>L. blandensis</italic> was isolated from Mediterranean surface seawater and belongs to Flavobacteriaceae, the major family of marine Bacteroidetes, with important roles in carbon flow and nutrient turnover in the sea during and following algal blooms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Fernández-Gómez et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Pinhassi et al., 2006</xref>). <italic>L. blandensis</italic> possesses two RNRs: a class II without ATP-cone, and the class I NrdAi/NrdBi, which lacks an ATP-cone in NrdA and instead contains an ATP-cone positioned at the N-terminus of NrdB. Superficially, the allosteric mechanism of <italic>L. blandensis</italic> NrdAi/NrdBi holoenzyme is similar to when the ATP-cone is contained in the catalytic subunit. At high dATP concentrations, inhibited higher oligomeric complexes of the holoenzyme are favoured. However, in the <italic>L. blandensis</italic> class I RNR, the oligomerization is driven by a shift towards tetramers of the radical-generating subunit. This illustrates how allosteric regulation controlled by ATP-cones can evolve in a highly dynamic way, requiring few adaptations to the core of the enzyme. The relative ease by which ATP-cone-driven activity regulation appears to evolve, provides a potential route to regulate engineered enzymes by dATP-inhibition for enzymes in which activity is affected by oligomerization. Addition of an ATP-cone to the protein could be used to induce higher oligomers controlled by dATP addition.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>The activity allosteric regulatory ATP-cone is linked to the radical-containing subunit in some class I RNRs</title><p>We detected ATP-cones in the radical-generating subunits of RNRs from two distinct phylogenetic RNR subclasses: NrdBi and NrdF (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref>).

In the absence of allosteric effectors, NrdB (β) is mainly monomeric (theoretically 51.8 kDa) and, in contrast to most studied NrdB proteins, it does not readily form dimers at the low protein concentration range suitable for GEMMA analyses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4a</xref>). Addition of dATP (50 μM) dramatically shifted the equilibrium towards tetramers β<sub>4</sub>, which became the major form under these conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4a</xref>). Titration of increasing concentrations of dATP to NrdB showed that the tetramers reached their half-maximum mass concentration at around 10 µM dATP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>). Addition of 50 μM dADP also induced formation of NrdB tetramers, although less efficiently than with dATP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4a</xref>).

The root-mean-square deviation for 92 equivalent Cα atoms is 1.2 Å. The electron density unambiguously confirms the <italic>L. blandensis</italic> ATP-cone’s ability to bind two molecules of dATP, which it shares with <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> NrdA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6c</xref>). Despite a local sequence identity of only 31% to <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> NrdA, all amino acids involved in binding both dATP molecules are conserved (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6c</xref>). The two dATP molecules bind in a ‘tail-to-tail’ arrangement that orients the base of the ‘non-canonical’ dATP towards the fourth, most C-terminal helix, an arrangement made possible by the binding of a Mg<sup>2+</sup> ion between the triphosphate moieties.</p><p>Remarkably, the interactions between the ATP-cones in <italic>L. blandensis</italic> NrdB are also very similar to those seen in <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> NrdA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Johansson et al., 2016</xref>), despite the fact that the ATP-cone is attached to a structurally completely different core domain. The main interactions occur between the last two helices α3 and α4 in respective ATP-cones (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6d</xref>). A hydrophobic core in <italic>L. blandensis</italic> NrdB involving residues Met80, Ile92 and Ile93 in both monomers is reinforced by salt bridges between residues Asp73, Asp76 in one monomer and Lys89 in the other. The two domains bury ~510 Å<sup>2</sup> of solvent accessible area. This is slightly less than the ~640 Å<sup>2</sup> buried in the equivalent interaction involving the ATP-cones of <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> NrdA. Within each ATP cone, helices α3 and α4 have the same relative orientation, partly determined by an internal salt bridge between the conserved Asp73 and Arg95, but the helix pair in <italic>L. blandensis</italic> NrdB is rotated relative to its counterpart in the other ATP cone by about 15° compared to <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> NrdA, which reduces the number of possible interactions between them. Interestingly, the dATP-induced tetramer leaves free the surfaces of both dimers of <italic>L. blandensis</italic> NrdB that are thought to interact with the NrdA subunit in productive RNR complexes, which implies that one or two dimers of <italic>L. blandensis</italic> NrdA could attach to these surfaces in a near-productive fashion in α<sub>2</sub>β<sub>4</sub> or α<sub>4</sub>β<sub>4</sub> complexes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6a</xref>).</p><p>Two metal ions are found to bind to each of the monomers of <italic>L. blandensis</italic> NrdB. Comparison of their B-factors with those of surrounding atoms suggest that they are fourth row elements with close to full occupancy, but does not enable us to distinguish between Mn, Fe or Ca. No metal ions were added to the protein preparation, but crystals were obtained in 0.2 M CaCl<sub>2</sub>. The distance between metal ions varies between 3.4–3.8 Å in the four monomers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>), but the metal coordination is very similar. The coordination distances are long for an RNR metal center, with the shortest distances being 2.3–2.4 Å, in contrast to the more typical 1.9–2.1 Å seen in other NrdB proteins containing Mn or Fe. Anomalous diffraction at three wavelengths was used to determine the nature of the metal. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig6sdata1">Figure 6—source data 1</xref> shows that there is little difference in the peak heights at the metal ion positions in anomalous difference maps irrespective of wavelength, which strongly suggests that the metal site is occupied by Ca<sup>2+</sup> from the crystallization medium. Furthermore, the peaks were only about twice the height of those from well-ordered sulfur atoms in the structure. At these wavelengths, S has an anomalous f’ component of about 0.5 electrons. For Mn or Fe one would expect an anomalous signal around eight times that of S (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig6sdata2">Figure 6—source data 2</xref>). The presence of Ca<sup>2+</sup> is also consistent with the long coordination distances. Furthermore, an X-ray fluorescence spectrum of the crystal (not shown) revealed only traces of Mn or Fe.</p><p>Interestingly, Tyr207 is found near the metal site at the position expected for a radical-carrying Tyr, but it is not hydrogen-bonded to the metal site, its hydroxyl group being at around 6 Å from the side chain of Glu170. Tyr207 is H-bonded to the side chain of Thr294, but the latter is not H-bonded to a metal center ligand. On the other side of the metal site, Trp177 is H-bonded to the side chain of Glu263. This tryptophan is completely conserved in the NrdBi subclass (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2</xref>). It makes the same interaction as Trp111 from <italic>E. coli</italic> NrdB, despite the fact that it is projected from the first helix of the 4-helix bundle containing the metal center ligands, rather than the second helix. The first helix of the bundle has a very unusual distortion in the middle (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s3">Figure 6—figure supplement 3</xref>). Normally this is an undistorted α-helix, but in <italic>L. blandensis</italic> NrdB, residues 171–175 form a loop that bulges away from the metal site, with the exception of Lys174, whose side chain is projected towards the metal site and is H-bonded to Glu170 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6e</xref>). The significance of this distortion is at present not clear. However we are certain that the distortion is not caused by the coordination of Ca<sup>2+</sup> instead of the native metal, as the structure is the same in crystals of the N-terminally truncated form grown in the presence of Mn<sup>2+</sup>, which will be presented elsewhere.</p><p>The nature of the native metallo-cofactor was addressed by X-band EPR spectroscopy and catalytically active samples were analyzed at 5–32 K. The spectra revealed a mixture of signals from low and high-valent manganese species (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7a</xref>). In particular, at 5 K a 6-line signal attributable to low valent Mn (Mn<sup>II</sup>) was clearly visible, overlaid with a complex multiline signal with a width of approximately 1250G. Increasing the temperature to 32 K resulted in a significant decrease of the latter signal, while the 6-line feature remained relatively intense (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7a</xref>, top and middle). The shape, width and temperature dependence of the multiline signal are all highly reminiscent of the signal reported for super-oxidized manganese catalase as well as the 16-line signal observed during the assembly of the dimanganese/tyrosyl radical cofactor in NrdF RNR, and are attributable to a strongly coupled Mn<sup>III</sup>Mn<sup>IV</sup> dimer (S<sub>Total</sub> = ½) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7a</xref>, bottom) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Cotruvo et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Zheng et al., 1994</xref>). The low valent species appeared to be weakly bound to the protein, while the Mn<sup>III</sup>Mn<sup>IV</sup> dimer was retained in the protein following desalting (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1</xref>). The observation of a high-valent Mn cofactor is consistent with the Mn-dependent increase in catalytic activity of the enzyme and its inhibition by the addition of Fe<sup>2+</sup>(<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7b–c</xref>), and is suggestive of a novel high-valent homodimeric Mn-cofactor. Indeed, earlier calculations have shown that high-valent Mn-dimers have reduction potentials similar to that of the tyrosyl radical in standard class I RNRs, but are hitherto not observed in RNRs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Roos and Siegbahn, 2011</xref>).

Binding curves for dATP, ATP and dADP to NrdB, including a reverse titration of NrdB to dATP, were all consistent with a single set of binding sites except for the ATP-cone deletion mutant (NrdBΔ99), which did not bind nucleotides at all (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>). In all other titrations the fitted apparent N value was significantly above one, but to be meaningful the N value needs to be an integer. Using information available from the 3D structure, a fixed stoichiometry of 2 was used to fit dATP binding to NrdB. The fit indicated 59% active (i.e. nucleotide binding) protein. A fixed stoichiometry of 1 would result in higher than 100% active protein concentration, which is impossible. Fitting dADP and ATP with a 59% proportion of active protein taken from the dATP experiment, we could calculate stoichiometries of 2.2 and 2.1 for ATP and dADP respectively, indicating that each NrdB monomer can bind two molecules of adenosine nucleotides (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8f</xref>). <italic>K<sub>d</sub></italic> for the three different nucleotides (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8f</xref>) indicated a 38-fold and 15-fold lower affinity for ATP and dADP compared to dATP.

This has also been shown experimentally by grafting an allosteric domain to an enzyme that was previously not allosterically regulated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Cross et al., 2013</xref>). The presence of an ATP-cone in the radical-generating subunit of <italic>L. blandensis</italic> RNR, provides, to our knowledge, the first example of another degree of evolutionary dynamics by the transfer of a domain conferring allosteric regulation to a non-homologous component of an enzyme complex.</p><p>It is critically important for an organism to control the supply of dNTPs to allow fidelity in DNA replication and repair (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Mathews, 2006</xref>). Specificity regulation of RNR makes sure relative concentrations of dNTPs fit the organism’s DNA composition. On the other hand, activity regulation assures that absolute concentrations of dNTPs follow the different requirements through the cell cycle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Hofer et al., 2012</xref>). Specificity regulation of RNRs is ubiquitous, integrated in the catalytic subunit of the enzyme, and works via the classical homooligomeric model of allosteric regulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Andersson et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Hofer et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Larsson et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Reichard, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Swain and Gierasch, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Torrents et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Zimanyi et al., 2016</xref>). In contrast, the activity regulation is controlled by an accessory domain, the ATP-cone, and works by affecting the distribution of the holoenzyme heteromeric complexes. Moreover, the ATP-cone is only found in some RNRs, and appears to be gained by domain shuffling when evolutionary selection favours it and lost when selection decreases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Lundin et al., 2015</xref>). These dynamics are further evidenced by the differences in mechanisms recently discovered in class I RNRs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Ando et al., 2011</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Fairman et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Johansson et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Jonna et al., 2015</xref>). The current study was prompted by the interesting observation that several radical-generating subunits of the NrdBi subclass possess an N-terminal ATP-cone and that a few radical-generating subunits of the NrdF subclass possess a C-terminal ATP-cone. Our discovery evokes several pertinent questions: does the ATP-cone fused to a radical-generating subunit function as an allosteric on/off switch; how does it affect the distribution of holoenzyme complexes under active and inhibited conditions; is its structural mode of action similar to that of ATP-cones fused to the catalytic subunit?</p><p>We have delineated the function of the ATP-cone that is N-terminally fused to the <italic>L. blandensis</italic> NrdBi protein. In the presence of the positive effector ATP, <italic>L. blandensis</italic> NrdBi was a dimer, which by interaction with the <italic>L. blandensis</italic> catalytic subunit NrdAi formed the common active α<sub>2</sub>β<sub>2</sub> complex, also found in e.g. <italic>E. coli</italic>, <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> and eukaryotic class I RNRs. Binding of dATP to the ATP-cone instead promoted oligomerization of <italic>L. blandensis</italic> NrdBi to an inactive β<sub>4</sub> complex, with a novel tetrameric structure revealed by crystallography. This oligomerization is reminiscent of the ‘ring-shaped’ α<sub>4</sub> and α<sub>6</sub> complexes formed by dATP binding to the NrdA-linked ATP-cones in <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> and eukaryotic RNRs. When <italic>L. blandensis</italic> NrdAi was added to the dATP-loaded NrdBi tetramer, higher molecular mass complexes of α<sub>2</sub>β<sub>4</sub> and α<sub>4</sub>β<sub>4</sub> appeared. The NrdA dimers seem to bind to the NrdB tetramers in a ‘nonproductive’ orientation, and in other studied RNRs it usually means that the structure of the complexes does not allow efficient electron transfer between NrdA and NrdB. The crystal structure shows that the tetramerization of <italic>L. blandensis</italic> NrdBi leaves the putative interaction surface for NrdAi free, which is consistent with the possibility to form both α<sub>2</sub>β<sub>4</sub> and α<sub>4</sub>β<sub>4</sub> oligomers. However the structure does not suggest the structural basis for a disruption of the cysteinyl radical generation pathway in these non-productive complexes.</p><p>The structure of the dATP-loaded <italic>L. blandensis</italic> NrdB shows that it binds two dATP molecules per ATP-cone. Both molecules bind to the same site and interact with each other through a Mg<sup>2+</sup> ion. Most allosterically regulated RNRs characterized so far bind only one dATP molecule per ATP-cone. However, a novel class of ATP-cones that binds two dATP molecules was recently characterized in <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> NrdA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Johansson et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Jonna et al., 2015</xref>). The NrdB-linked ATP-cone of <italic>L. blandensis</italic> has sequence motifs characteristic of this kind of ATP-cone. The structure confirms that both dATP molecules bind essentially identically as in <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> NrdA and that the ATP-cones make similar interactions to each other, distinct from those made in the eukaryotic α<sub>6</sub> complexes. It has also been shown in the RNR transcriptional regulator NrdR, that ATP and dATP bind with positive cooperativity to its ATP-cone (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">McKethan and Spiro, 2013</xref>), implying binding of more than one nucleotide molecule.</p><p>The ATP-cone in <italic>L. blandensis</italic> NrdBi offers a unique possibility to measure its binding capacity for (deoxy)adenosine nucleotides. This has not been possible in earlier studied RNRs, where the ATP-cone is bound to the α subunit that also possesses a binding site for allosteric regulation of substrate specificity. ITC ligand binding studies confirmed that the <italic>L. blandensis</italic> ATP-cone bound two dATP molecules, and showed that it also can bind two molecules of ATP or two molecules of dADP. Structurally, binding of dADP is not surprising, since the γ-phosphates of the dATP molecules make only one interaction with the protein, through Arg102, and they only contribute 2 of the 6 coordinating atoms of the intervening Mg<sup>2+</sup> ion. Nonetheless, this is the first observation of dADP binding to the ATP-cone of an RNR enzyme. dADP inhibits enzyme activity in a similar manner to dATP, but higher concentrations are required. In vivo, deoxyribonucleoside diphosphates are rapidly converted to triphosphates and cellular dADP concentrations are very low (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Mathews, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Traut, 1994</xref>). Nevertheless, dADP is one of the products of <italic>L. blandensis</italic> RNR, and perhaps local concentrations are higher. The ability of dADP to regulate the activity of <italic>L. blandensis</italic> RNR may enable it to react more rapidly to changes in (deoxy)adenosine nucleotide concentrations and provide the cell with a fitness advantage. It can therefore not be excluded that dADP has a physiological role, although we think that the 15 times stronger affinity for dATP suggests that it is the major inhibitory nucleotide effector. Binding of deoxyadenosine di- and monophosphates has been described for the ATP-cone in NrdR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Grinberg et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">McKethan and Spiro, 2013</xref>).</p><p>Based on the variable occurrence of the ATP-cone in RNR catalytic subunits, we have earlier hypothesized that its presence in RNRs is part of a dynamic process of gains and losses on a relatively short evolutionary time scale (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Lundin et al., 2015</xref>). This suggests that the ATP-cone, contrary to what might be expected for a domain involved in allostery, does not require a long evolutionary period of integration with a protein to contribute to regulation and that it hence lends itself to a highly dynamic evolution of allosteric activity control (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Lundin et al., 2015</xref>). This hypothesis is nicely supported by the N-terminally positioned ATP-cone, in the radical-generating subunit, NrdB, of <italic>L. blandensis</italic> RNR described here. No RNR in the phylogenetic subclass NrdAi/Bi contains an ATP-cone in the catalytic subunit, and only a minority – mostly encoded by Flavobacteriia, a marine class of Bacteroidetes – have an NrdB with an ATP-cone, suggesting the relatively recent acquisition of the ATP-cone to an RNR subclass that is otherwise not activity regulated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). Moreover, in the Ib subclass, which also lacks ATP-cones in the catalytic subunit, we detected a C-terminally positioned ATP-cone in the radical-generating subunit. This was found in only two sequences from closely related organisms and might hence be an example of an even more recent evolutionary event.</p><p>The evidence we have presented here for an ATP/dATP-sensing master switch of the <italic>L. blandensis</italic> NrdAi/NrdBi class I RNR, suggests a potential for the use of ATP-cones to control the activity of engineered proteins.

The active center of the radical generating subunit of class I RNRs have earlier been found to consist either of an Fe<sup>III</sup>Fe<sup>III</sup> or Mn<sup>III</sup>Mn<sup>III</sup> pair coupled to a tyrosine residue acting as long-term storage for the catalytically essential radical (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Berggren et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Cotruvo and Stubbe, 2012</xref>), or a Fe<sup>III</sup>Mn<sup>IV</sup> center not coupled to an amino acid radical (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Griese et al., 2014</xref>). Although further analyses are required to fully characterize the <italic>L. blandensis</italic> NrdBi active center, it appears to present a fourth type, a high-valent Mn<sup>III</sup>Mn<sup>IV</sup> center that lacks a suitably positioned radical storage amino acid. The evolutionary flexibility displayed by the ATP-cone appears hence all but equaled by the evolutionary tuning possibilities of the metal centers in the radical generating subunit of class I RNR.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th>Reagent type (species) <break/>or resource</th><th>Designation</th><th>Source or reference</th><th>Identifiers</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Gene (<italic>Leeuwenhoekiella blandensis</italic> sp. nov.

Geometry was validated using the MolProbity server (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Chen et al., 2010</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-12"><title>Metal characterization using anomalous diffraction</title><p>To establish the nature of the metal ions in the crystal, an anomalous diffraction experiment was conducted at three wavelengths, one on the near-high-energy side of the Fe K edge (1.72 Å), where both Mn and Fe should have a strong anomalous signal, one near the Mn K edge (1.87 Å), where only Mn should have a strong signal, and one on the low energy side of the Mn edge (1.92 Å), where neither Mn nor Fe should have a strong signal but Ca<sup>2+</sup> will have a small residual signal (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig6sdata1">Figure 6—source data 1</xref>). These data were collected at EMBL station P14 of the PETRA-III synchrotron in Hamburg, Germany. The data at different wavelengths were collected in non-overlapping stripes on the crystal to avoid radiation damage that might affect the relative anomalous signals, which were found to be weak at all wavelengths. The structure was refined against all three datasets to a common resolution of 2.5 Å and the relative heights of peaks in the anomalous difference maps at were used to identify the metal. These are presented in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig6sdata2">Figure 6—source data 2</xref>. The refinement was done and anomalous difference maps calculated and analyzed using Buster (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Bricogne et al., 2016</xref>).</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We want to thank Jarone Pinhassi and Sabina Arnautovic, Linneaus University, Kalmar, Sweden, for the kind gift of <italic>Leeuwenhoekiella blandensis</italic> DNA, Yuliya Leontyeva, Jan-Olov Persson and Rolf Sundberg, Department of Mathematics, Stockholm University, Sweden, for excellent statistical analysis of ligand binding, Eva Muñoz and Angel Piñeiro, AFFINImeter, Santiago de Compostela, Spain for valuable assistance with analysis of ITC titrations, Hanna Jankevics Jones and John Stenson, Malvern Instruments Ltd, Malvern, UK for highly appreciated help with protein biophysical characterization and Fredrik Tholander, Karolinska Institute, Stockholm, Sweden, for generously providing his HPLC instrument for the enzyme assays.

Your article has been reviewed by two peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Michael Marletta as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal his identity: Christopher K Mathews (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>In the present work, Grinberg et al. describe the structure and function of a ribonucleotide reductase (RNR) from the bacterium, L. blandensis. RNR is an essential enzyme that plays a key role in DNA synthesis and repair, and is a textbook exemplar for allosteric regulation in enzymes. The current paper is well-written and relies on multiple techniques and contributions from several groups in the RNR field. The most significant finding is that a well-studied region of RNRs called the ATP cone, which comprises the regulatory site for controlling RNR activity and is usually located on the large subunit of the heteromeric complex, is unexpectedly found to reside in the small subunit, which generates the free radical required for enzyme catalysis. This observation represents a substantial paradigm shift in the RNR world.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) In the present work, dADP is shown for the first time to act as an allosteric inhibitor. dADP appears to have half the affinity for the activity site compared to the canonical allosteric inhibitor, dATP. Does this finding imply that dADP has a physiological role in regulation? What is the effect of dADP on oligomerization compared to dATP? The k<sub>on</sub> for dADP should be compared between L. blandensis RNR and the triphosphate-forming kinases that convert dADP to dATP to see whether such a role is feasible. In light of this unusual finding concerning dADP regulation, it is important to carry out a comparison of the binding sites between the L. blandensis structure and the ligand-bound ATP cones from <italic>E. coli</italic> and/or human RNR. Such an analysis may reveal why dADP is not an allosteric inhibitor in <italic>E. coli</italic> or human RNR when it is in L. blandensis. A comparative ITC experiment would be useful to shed light on dADP binding between species, while an anomalous scattering experiment would help solidify the identity of the metal ions observed in the L. blandensis RNR metal cluster and activity site.</p><p>2) Two ATP molecules are found to be bound in the activity site of L. blandensis RNR. What is the role of the second one? Based on early work with the eukaryotic RNRs, it was shown that oligomerization is induced by ATP or dATP binding – what is the driving force for oligomerization here? Please address whether the oligomerization phenomena be validated in this system using site-directed mutants.</p><p>3) Some additional explanation is required with the GEMMA analysis. In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>, the NrdBΔ99 mutant appears to form monomers, dimers, and trimers without any effector present. Please explain how this is possible. Is it due to error in the dimer and trimer molecular weights, or is there a problem with the approach? <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref> shows NrdA is able to form monomers and dimers in the absence of an effector. Please explain why this is – is dimerization due to mass action? In the second trace, where 50 μM of dATP is added, monomers and dimers both appear; however, the monomer is slightly more populated than the dimer. Please explain. Is there any reason, as with other RNR's (such as eukaryotic or <italic>E. coli</italic>), why the dimer population is not dominant?</p><p>4) Several assumptions have been made based on the structure in interpreting the ITC data. For example, the number of dATP binding sites is assumed to be two because that is what is seen crystallographically. This stoichiometry should be dealt in an unbiased way by fitting the data to different numbers of sites and using the fit with least error to select the correct model.</p><p>5) Comparison of the ΔH values between the different ligands gives a rather surprising value for dADP, which is at least 24 kJ/mol higher than the dATP. This difference implies that several additional hydrogen bonds, ion-pairs, and/or van der Waals interactions are made by dADP compared to dATP. Yet the structure indicates that dATP makes only a single an additional hydrogen bond compared to the dADP. This discordance between the ITC and structural data should be explained.</p><p>6) The significance of the work should be better clarified for a general (non-RNR) audience. Given the wealth of important enzyme systems in biology, why are the current findings important for advancing our understanding of broad issues, such as allosteric regulations, the appropriate control of nucleotide levels to avoid disease states, etc. Along these lines, the discussion of the potential applications of the findings is brief and unsatisfying.

Please elaborate on this concept and how it might work.</p><p>Reviewer #2:</p><p>Grinberg et al. describe the structure and function of L. blandensis this is a well-written paper that have contributions of many groups from Sweden that work on Rnr. The major finding in this work is that the ATP cone where lies the activity site, usually located on the large subunit is now found in the small subunit housing the essential free radical. This was totally unexpected and is an important finding that furthers our understanding of Rnr. However, there are some important questions that are prompted by this work, which requires some answers. For example, dADP for the first time shown to act as an allosteric inhibitor. The dADP has half the affinity for the activity site compared to the allosteric inhibitor dATP. Therefore, does this dADP have a physiological role in regulation? For example, what is its efficiency on oligomerization compared to dATP? An experiment with dNTP pool analysis will be required to show if the ADP has a physiological role to play. One would have to compare the k<sub>on</sub> for the dADP between Rnr and the triphosphate converting kinases that convert the dADP to dATP to see if this is feasible. In the light of this unusual finding, it is important to do a comparison of the binding sites between the L. blandensis structure and the <italic>E. coli</italic>. or human ligand bound ATP cones. This may reveal why ADP is not an allosteric inhibitor in <italic>E. coli</italic>. or human while it is in L. blandensis. Perhaps a comparative ITC experiment might shed light between species. In anomalous scattering experiment would shed light on the identity of the metal ions both on the metal cluster and activity site.</p><p>Two ATP molecules are bound in the activity site. What is the role of the second one? Based on the early work with the eukaryotic RNR's it was shown that the oligomerization is induced by ATP or dATP binding what is the force driving the oligomerization here? Can you validate the oligomerization phenomena in the system using site – directed mutants?</p><p>Reviewer #3:</p><p>This is a major paper, using multiple benchmark techniques, that explores an unexpected finding-that a newly characterized form of ribonucleotide reductase contains its &quot;activity site,&quot; AKA ATP-cone, on the small (radical-containing) subunit. A substantial paradigm shift in the RNR world. I have just three suggestions for improving this outstanding paper.</p><p>1) Change &quot;Unique&quot; to &quot;Novel&quot; in the title, inasmuch as several different bacteria have been found to share this unexpected property, not just the species chosen for study in this paper.</p><p>2) Define the criteria, either amino acid sequence or 3D structure, by which an amino acid sequence of about 100 residues is identified as an &quot;ATP-cone.&quot;</p><p>3) Either delete the last sentence in the Abstract or (preferably) modify the discussion appropriately, because the discussion of potential applications of the findings in this paper is brief and unsatisfying.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.31529.023</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) In the present work, dADP is shown for the first time to act as an allosteric inhibitor. dADP appears to have half the affinity for the activity site compared to the canonical allosteric inhibitor, dATP. Does this finding imply that dADP has a physiological role in regulation?</p></disp-quote><p>Actually, dADP has an affinity which is only a fifteenth of the dATP affinity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8F</xref>) and because of that we believe that dATP is the main physiological allosteric effector. However, the relative affinity for dADP compared to dATP is still higher than in most other RNRs and we cannot exclude the possibility that local concentrations around the enzyme might be high enough to actually have a physiological effect. Nevertheless, we have modified the text to make it clear that we believe that dATP is the main physiological effector of the two.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>What is the effect of dADP on oligomerization compared to dATP? The k<sub>on</sub> for dADP should be compared between L. blandensis RNR and the triphosphate-forming kinases that convert dADP to dATP to see whether such a role is feasible.</p></disp-quote><p>The main message of our current study is the transfer of an ATP-cone domain from the catalytic subunit of an RNR to its corresponding radical-containing subunit, and that the ATP-cone confers similar effects of dATP and ATP to the oligomeric status of the NrdB subunit. We would therefore prefer not to focus the current study on the binding of dADP to the ATP-cone, as we have shown that the binding of dADP is only a fifteenth compared to binding of dATP. Both dADP and dATP induce the formation of NrdB tetramers but the effect of dADP is weaker. We have replaced the dADP experiment in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">A</xref> with a more representative one. The main conclusion, that both nucleotides induce the formation of NrdB tetramers, is the same. The isotherms for calculating k<sub>on</sub> values for dADP association with <italic>L. blandensis</italic> NrdB have a subtle shoulder relating to the fact that the two sites are probably not totally equivalent and the rough estimates are 3x10<sup>3</sup> s<sup>-1</sup>M<sup>-1</sup>s<sup>-1</sup>, compared to human nucleoside diphosphate kinase with k<sub>on</sub> values for dADP in the order of 4.5x10<sup>6</sup> s<sup>-1</sup>M<sup>-1</sup>s<sup>-1</sup> (Schaertl &amp; al, J Biol Chem 1998, 273: 5662). Kinetic parameters derived from the ITC isotherm were obtained using the AFFINImeter software assuming a 1:1 interaction model, according to the method described in J. Am. Chem. Soc., 2012, 134(1), 559-565 (see eq. 4 in Suppl. Information) and Dumas et al. (2016), Methods in Enzymology, Vol. 567, Chap. 7, A.Feig Ed.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In light of this unusual finding concerning dADP regulation, it is important to carry out a comparison of the binding sites between the L. blandensis structure and the ligand-bound ATP cones from E. coli and/or human RNR. Such an analysis may reveal why dADP is not an allosteric inhibitor in E. coli or human RNR when it is in L. blandensis.</p></disp-quote><p>The <italic>L. blandensis</italic> ATP cone belongs to the recently-identified family of ATP cones that bind two molecules of dATP rather than only one, as in the human and <italic>E. coli</italic> enzymes. A detailed comparison of the two types of ATP cone was already made for its occurrence in the NrdA protein from <italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic> in Johansson et al., 2016. The ability to bind a second dATP molecule is due to the presence of a unique sequence motif in the C-terminal helix of the ATP cone domain that is not present in human or <italic>E. coli</italic> RNR. The interactions are essentially identical in the <italic>L. blandensis</italic> ATP cone, thus such a comparison would be superfluous in this paper. Nevertheless, one can speculate that, since the two dATP molecules bind with their triphosphate tails coordinating a Mg<sup>2+</sup> ion, the loss of the γ phosphate group in dADP would have a relatively minor effect on affinity, as this group makes only one polar interaction with the protein in one of the two dATP molecules. On the other hand, this appears to be the case for the <italic>E. coli</italic> and human ATP cones as well. We hypothesize that the effect of loss of this single interaction is less when two dATP molecules are bound than when there is only one.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>A comparative ITC experiment would be useful to shed light on dADP binding between species, while an anomalous scattering experiment would help solidify the identity of the metal ions observed in the L. blandensis RNR metal cluster and activity site.</p></disp-quote><p>Anomalous diffraction experiments have been done at three wavelengths (1.72 Å, 1.87 Å and 1.92 Å) that should help discriminate between Fe, Mn and Ca. The results suggest that the metal centre is filled with Ca<sup>2+</sup> ions from the crystallization medium. This data was added to the main text. ITC studies on dADP binding to other species are beyond the scope of our current study, as we have determined dADP binding to be more than an order of magnitude worse than dATP binding and in vivo concentrations of dNDP in general are known to be low compared to dNTP concentrations.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Two ATP molecules are found to be bound in the activity site of L. blandensis RNR. What is the role of the second one? Based on early work with the eukaryotic RNRs, it was shown that oligomerization is induced by ATP or dATP binding – what is the driving force for oligomerization here? Please address whether the oligomerization phenomena be validated in this system using site-directed mutants.</p></disp-quote><p>For the new type of ATP cone observed in this enzyme, this question was already addressed quite extensively from a structural point of view in Johansson et al., 2016, where the structure of such a domain was seen for the first time in NrdA from <italic>P. aeruginosa.</italic> The domain was characterized biochemically in a previous paper from the Hofer lab (Jonna et al., 2015). Site-directed mutants were made in the <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> NrdA interaction surface that abolished tetramerization. Since the interface residues are conserved in <italic>L. blandensis</italic> NrdB and the interactions between ATP cones are almost identical, we do not think it necessary to re-make these mutations.</p><p>Regarding the role of the second dATP molecule, this was also covered in Johansson et al., 2016. Inhibition is driven by dATP binding to both kinds of ATP cones (binding one or two dATPs). This induces conformational changes in the domain that leads them to associate, either with each other (as in yeast, human, <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> and <italic>L. blandensis</italic>) or with NrdB (as in <italic>E. coli)</italic>. The ATP-induced oligomerization is unique to eukaryotic RNRs and has not been characterized structurally. The <italic>L. blandensis</italic> type of ATP cone domain uses a different surface to oligomerize (building tetramers) than what eukaryotes or <italic>E. coli</italic> do, and interestingly this is the surface closest to the second dATP molecule.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Some additional explanation is required with the GEMMA analysis. In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>, the NrdBΔ99 mutant appears to form monomers, dimers, and trimers without any effector present. Please explain how this is possible. Is it due to error in the dimer and trimer molecular weights, or is there a problem with the approach? <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref> shows NrdA is able to form monomers and dimers in the absence of an effector. Please explain why this is – is dimerization due to mass action? In the second trace, where 50 μM of dATP is added, monomers and dimers both appear; however, the monomer is slightly more populated than the dimer. Please explain. Is there any reason, as with other RNR's (such as eukaryotic or E. coli), why the dimer population is not dominant?</p></disp-quote><p>The NrdBΔ99 mutant is mainly a monomer but with a slight tendency to aggregate non-specifically in the ammonium acetate buffer. A typical pattern of aggregation is a ladder of dimers, trimers, tetramers etc, which you also see in the figure. Another possibility could also be false interactions, but by comparing the analysis at many different flow-rates (different pressures), we found that this is less likely. Generally, the role of tiny peaks (now shown in brackets) should not be overemphasized in GEMMA (the trimers, tetramers etc can be regarded minor in this sense whereas the monomers and dimers are much higher). It is not surprising that the NrdA protein is in a monomer-dimer equilibrium already without effector, since there is a great variation between species. For example, the mammalian protein is a monomer and the <italic>E. coli</italic> protein is in a monomer-dimer equilibrium. The relative amounts of monomers and dimers are dependent on the protein concentration. As the reviewer has pointed out, it is a bit surprising that nucleotide effectors do not have as strong effect on dimerization as in most other species studied. All these points are now explained in the text.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) Several assumptions have been made based on the structure in interpreting the ITC data. For example, the number of dATP binding sites is assumed to be two because that is what is seen crystallographically. This stoichiometry should be dealt in an unbiased way by fitting the data to different numbers of sites and using the fit with least error to select the correct model.</p></disp-quote><p>N values in ITC fits are strongly affected by the content of <italic>active</italic> protein material as opposed to total protein concentration. In all the nucleotide titrations the fitted apparent N value was significantly above 1 when total protein concentration was used. However, for the N value to be meaningful in terms of stoichiometry it has to be an integer. Using N=1 for dATP binding the active protein concentration becomes more than 100% of the total concentration, whereas using N=2 gives an active protein concentration of 60%, in our experience a typical fraction of active RNR (the error of the fit will not change whether the N value or the active protein concentration is fixed). The proportion of inactive protein can be explained by e.g. aggregation as observed by SEC-MALS and DLS. Moreover, our X-ray crystallography shows a stoichiometry of 2 bound dATP molecules. For meaningful results, we therefore used the active protein concentration for calculation of ATP and dADP binding stoichiometries.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) Comparison of the ΔH values between the different ligands gives a rather surprising value for dADP, which is at least 24 kJ/mol higher than the dATP. This difference implies that several additional hydrogen bonds, ion-pairs, and/or van der Waals interactions are made by dADP compared to dATP. Yet the structure indicates that dATP makes only a single an additional hydrogen bond compared to the dADP. This discordance between the ITC and structural data should be explained.</p></disp-quote><p>The overall enthalpy of the reaction, measured by calorimetry, is affected not only by direct protein interaction with the ligand, but also by water molecules in the binding pocket (Klebe, Nature Rev Drug Discovery 2015, 14: 95). Since calorimetry measures the overall effect of all changes in the binding pocket, it is hard to correlate and compare enthalpies without structural data for the dADP bound complex.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) The significance of the work should be better clarified for a general (non-RNR) audience. Given the wealth of important enzyme systems in biology, why are the current findings important for advancing our understanding of broad issues, such as allosteric regulations, the appropriate control of nucleotide levels to avoid disease states, etc. Along these lines, the discussion of the potential applications of the findings is brief and unsatisfying. It is claimed that the new observations offer a possible route to regulate engineered enzymes by dATP inhibition. Please elaborate on this concept and how it might work.</p></disp-quote><p>We have added a sentence to the Abstract, a paragraph to the Discussion, plus a few references in the Introduction, describing the degree of novelty of our finding. That allosteric regulation controlled by modular domains is evolutionarily dynamic has been shown before (by us and others), but we are not aware of other enzyme complexes in which a domain has transferred to a non-homologous component. We would like to argue that this, in addition to the general importance of ribonucleotide reduction and its control in all organisms, makes our finding interesting to a broad audience of biologists interested in evolution of proteins, nucleotide metabolism and enzyme structure and function. In addition, we have added a few sentences at the end of the fourth paragraph in the Introduction describing briefly that RNRs are potential targets both for antibacterial and antitumor therapies. We have also added a sentence to the Introduction describing in some more detail how we foresee that ATP-cones could be used to confer regulation of engineered enzymes by control of nucleotide concentrations, at least for enzymes that are sensitive to oligomerization states. Since this is not within our direct area of expertise, we fear that further detail would become too speculative.</p></body></sub-article></article>
