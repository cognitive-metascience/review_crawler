How neurons acquire features distinct to each synapse remains unknown. We show that the transcription factor Mafb drives the formation of auditory ribbon synapses, which are specialized for rapid transmission from hair cells to spiral ganglion neurons (SGNs). Mafb acts in SGNs to drive differentiation of the large postsynaptic density (PSD) characteristic of the ribbon synapse. In <italic>Mafb</italic> mutant mice, SGNs fail to develop normal PSDs, leading to reduced synapse number and impaired auditory responses. Conversely, increased Mafb accelerates synaptogenesis. Moreover, Mafb is responsible for executing one branch of the SGN differentiation program orchestrated by the Gata3 transcriptional network. Remarkably, restoration of Mafb rescues the synapse defect in <italic>Gata3</italic> mutants. Hence, Mafb is a powerful regulator of cell-type specific features of auditory synaptogenesis that offers a new entry point for treating hearing loss.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.01341.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.01341.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.01341.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Different types of neurons in the nervous system communicate with each other through different types of synapses. In the auditory system, for example, it is essential for the timing of signals to be preserved as they are sent from the ear to the brain, and this places special demands on the synapses in this part of the nervous system. In particular, the ribbon synapses that are found between the inner hair cells of the ear, which convert sound waves into neural signals, and the neurons of the spiral ganglion in the cochlea, which carry information about the frequency, intensity and timing of sounds to the brain, can transmit signals with remarkable fidelity.</p><p>Little is known about the mechanisms by which synapses become specialized for particular functions. Previous work has suggested that a protein called Gata3 is important for the development of the neurons and synapses in the spiral ganglion, including ribbon synapses. Gata3 is a transcription factor that controls the expression of a wide range of genes that are involved in the auditory systems, including genes that are expressed as other transcription factors.</p><p>Yu et al. used transgenic mice to explore what happened when one of these transcription factors, Mafb, was missing from neurons in the spiral ganglion. The results showed that ribbon synapses did not form when Mafb was absent, which meant that they were unable to respond normally to sounds. Yu et al. also studied mice in which Gata3 was absent: normally Mafb would not be present in these mice, but when genetic techniques were used to force the expression of the gene for Mafb, ribbon synapses were formed. As well as revealing a molecular pathway by which synapses become specialized for rapid and accurate transmission of auditory information, these findings might lead to new approaches to treating hearing loss in humans.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.01341.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.01341.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author keywords</title><kwd>auditory</kwd><kwd>spiral ganglion neuron</kwd><kwd>ribbon synapse</kwd><kwd>Mafb</kwd><kwd>Gata3</kwd><kwd>synaptogenesi</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01 DC009223</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Goodrich</surname><given-names>Lisa V</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>March of Dimes</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Goodrich</surname><given-names>Lisa V</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Hellman Family Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Goodrich</surname><given-names>Lisa V</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>The Bertarelli Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Goodrich</surname><given-names>Lisa V</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>F32 DC012695</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Yu</surname><given-names>Wei-Ming</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Alice and Joseph Brooks Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Yu</surname><given-names>Wei-Ming</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-7"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Harvard Mahoney Neuroscience Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Yu</surname><given-names>Wei-Ming</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-8"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Stuart H.Q. and Victoria Quan Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Appler</surname><given-names>Jessica M</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-9"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Lefler Family Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Nishitani</surname><given-names>Allison M</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-10"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01 DC005439</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Holt</surname><given-names>Jeffrey R</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-11"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Action on Hearing Loss</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R58</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Goodrich</surname><given-names>Lisa V</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Genetic studies in mice identify the transcription factor MafB as a potent regulator of specific features of the synapses underlying hearing.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Synapses are the basic building blocks for the diverse types of neural circuits that mediate perception and behavior. How information is processed and transmitted is determined both by the identity of the neurons in the circuit and the nature of their synaptic connections. Indeed, synapses exhibit a range of morphologies and functions, varying both the nature of the signal and its strength. Recent efforts to unravel the molecular basis of synaptic specificity have begun to define the mechanisms that match pre- and post-synaptic partners and thereby establish the overall wiring pattern. These studies suggest that the fate of each partner is determined by cell-type specific transcription factors, which activate expression of a unique combination of cell-surface receptors to permit adhesion only between appropriate partners (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Polleux et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Sanes and Yamagata, 2009</xref>). In contrast, we still know very little about how each partner is subsequently instructed to develop the appropriate type of pre- or post-synaptic specialization required at that synapse. Although several broadly acting transcription factors have been shown to control synapse number, the identity of the transcription factors that might direct cell-type specific features of synaptic development remains elusive.</p><p>Among the most specialized synapses in the nervous system are those of the auditory system that transmit sound information from inner hair cells (IHCs) to spiral ganglion neurons (SGNs). As the sole link between IHCs and the brain, SGNs encode the frequency, intensity, and timing of all acoustic stimuli and communicate this information rapidly and faithfully to the brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Appler and Goodrich, 2011</xref>). To achieve the necessary speed, SGNs receive information from IHCs via ribbon synapses that are specialized for signaling with high temporal precision (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Khimich et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Glowatzki et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Buran et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Safieddine et al., 2012</xref>). Unlike conventional synapses, ribbon synapses contain an electron-dense multi-protein ribbon structure, which tethers a large pool of readily releasable vesicles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Sterling and Matthews, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Goutman and Glowatzki, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Frank et al., 2010</xref>), thereby enabling fast and sustained release of glutamate from the IHCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Glowatzki and Fuchs, 2002</xref>). Likewise, SGNs respond with remarkable speed due to a large postsynaptic density (PSD) containing abundant clusters of AMPA-type receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Matsubara et al., 1996</xref>). Since the features of all sound stimuli are captured by the pattern of synaptic transmission between IHCs and SGNs, developing the correct number and types of synapses is critical for hearing. Indeed, auditory synaptopathies underlie several forms of hearing loss (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Moser et al., 2013</xref>), and ribbon synapses are particularly vulnerable to acoustic overexposure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Kujawa and Liberman, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Lin et al., 2011</xref>).</p><p>Despite the importance of ribbon synapses to the sense of hearing, we have only a rudimentary understanding of how this synapse acquires its specialized structures and properties during development. In mice, ribbon synapses begin to develop perinatally (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Sobkowicz et al., 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Nemzou et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Sendin et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Marrs and Spirou, 2012</xref>). Presynaptic ribbons are initially distributed throughout the IHC cytoplasm and then gradually localize to the basolateral surface to form an immature synapse, with clustered ribbons in large active zones (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Sobkowicz et al., 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Sendin et al., 2007</xref>). In parallel, SGN neurites reach IHCs and begin to elaborate post-synaptic terminals, characterized by increased clustering of GluR2/R3 AMPA receptors in the nascent PSD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Huang et al., 2012</xref>). Ribbon number peaks at the end of the first postnatal week, followed by a period of pruning and refinement. By the onset of hearing (postnatal day 12 [P12] in mice), ribbon number has declined to adult levels and each ribbon is anchored opposite a specialized large, well-defined PSD in the SGN terminal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Sobkowicz et al., 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Nemzou et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Sendin et al., 2007</xref>). In mature animals, the size of the PSD correlates with the size and position of the ribbon (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Liberman et al., 2011</xref>), indicating that pre- and post-synaptic development must be tightly coordinated. Indeed, without SGN afferent terminals, ribbon development in IHCs is impaired (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Sobkowicz et al., 1986</xref>), and conversely, afferent terminals are not stabilized in mutants lacking normal ribbons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Sheets et al., 2011</xref>). However, the molecular mechanisms that allow SGNs to form these unusual connections with IHCs remain a mystery.</p><p>Efforts to understand how SGNs acquire their auditory-specific features have established an important role for the Gata3 transcription factor, which is expressed in SGNs as soon as they can be identified (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Lawoko-Kerali et al., 2004</xref>) and then maintained throughout differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Appler et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Duncan and Fritzsch, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Luo et al., 2013</xref>). Upon deletion of <italic>Gata3</italic>, cochlear wiring is severely disrupted and SGNs fail to express a cohort of auditory-specific genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Appler et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Duncan and Fritzsch, 2013</xref>), including additional transcription factors that may work downstream of Gata3 to direct specific features of SGN differentiation. One particularly intriguing putative downstream effector is the basic leucine-zipper transcription factor Mafb. Mafb belongs to the family of large Maf factors, which activate cell-type specific programs of gene expression essential for terminal differentiation of a wide variety of cell types, including pancreatic β cells, kidney podocytes, and macrophages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Moriguchi et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kataoka, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Hang and Stein, 2011</xref>). <italic>Mafb</italic> was first identified as the genetic cause of the <italic>kreisler</italic> mutation (<italic>kr</italic>) in mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Cordes and Barsh, 1994</xref>). In <italic>kr</italic> mutants, rhombomeres 5 and 6 are not properly specified, and the otic vesicle, which develops adjacent to these structures, fails to acquire its normal morphology. Although its function in the nervous system remains unclear, <italic>Mafb</italic> is also required in the pre-Bötzinger complex in the hindbrain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Blanchi et al., 2003</xref>): respiratory circuits are unable to mediate normal breathing in <italic>Mafb</italic> mutants, which die from central apnea at birth. Unfortunately, the early lethality and inner ear defects in null mutants have prevented analysis of Mafb’s role in the assembly and function of auditory circuits.</p><p>In this study, through genetic analysis in mice, we demonstrate that Mafb is critical for the ability of SGNs to form the specialized contacts necessary for the sense of hearing. Mafb is enriched in SGNs during synaptogenesis. Further, deletion of Mafb from SGNs disrupts post-synaptic differentiation, leading to an overall reduction in ribbon synapse number and hence impaired auditory responses. Conversely, restoration of Mafb is sufficient to rescue the synaptic defect seen in <italic>Gata3</italic> mutant mice. These studies establish Mafb as a lineage-specific intrinsic regulator in SGNs for post-synaptic specification of ribbon synapses and a powerful effector within a broader Gata3 network during auditory circuit assembly.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Mafb expression peaks during synaptogenesis in the cochlea</title><p>The first clue that Mafb might serve as a lineage-specific regulator of SGN terminal differentiation came from microarray comparisons of SGNs and the closely related vestibular ganglion neurons (VGNs), which revealed a dramatic SGN-specific increase in <italic>Mafb</italic> expression during late embryogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Lu et al., 2011</xref>). SGN neurogenesis occurs along a base to apex gradient, with most SGNs exiting the cell cycle by E12.5 and extending projections to reach the organ of Corti by E15.5 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Matei et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Koundakjian et al., 2007</xref>). In situ hybridization confirmed that <italic>Mafb</italic> transcription initiates in parallel with the end of neurogenesis, with expression evident in the basal to middle regions of the cochlea by E13.5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). Protein was not yet present at this stage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C,C′</xref>). Two days later, Mafb protein could be detected in SGNs in the basal and middle turns (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>) and by E16.5, Mafb protein was localized to SGN nuclei along the entire length of the cochlea (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). High levels of Mafb persisted during early postnatal stages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F,J</xref>) and peaked at P6 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G,J</xref>). Afterward, Mafb was gradually translocated from the nucleus to the cytoplasm, and only a few SGNs maintained strong nuclear expression by P10 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1H</xref>, arrows). After the onset of hearing, Mafb was still present at low levels in the SGN cytoplasm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1I,J</xref>). At all stages, Mafb expression was limited to SGNs, with no protein detected in VGNs (data not shown) or other cell types of the inner ear. Hence, Mafb defines the SGN subset of inner ear neurons and is expressed throughout auditory synaptogenesis, which begins around perinatal stages and lasts for the first two postnatal weeks, peaking around P6 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Sobkowicz et al., 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Huang et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Safieddine et al., 2012</xref>).<fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.01341.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Mafb is expressed in SGNs during synaptogenesis.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Schematic representation of a mouse inner ear indicates the levels of section planes in (<bold>B</bold>–<bold>F</bold>).

Ultrastructural analysis revealed that mutant SGNs still contact IHCs, indicating normal targeting (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1A,B</xref>). We therefore asked whether these contacts were able to develop into synapses. Ribbon synapses were assessed by staining for the postsynaptic marker GluR2, labeling a subunit of the AMPA receptor, and the presynaptic marker CtBP2, labeling the B domain of the RIBEYE scaffolding protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Schmitz et al., 2000</xref>). The use of anti-GluR2 antibodies ensured that we only analyzed contacts between SGNs and IHCs, as other post-synaptic markers are also present in other types of synapses in the cochlea (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Khimich et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Nemzou et al., 2006</xref>). Hence, ribbon synapses were reliably identified as juxtaposed pairs of immunofluorescent puncta of postsynaptic GluR2 and presynaptic CtBP2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Khimich et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Liberman et al., 2011</xref>). Because the number of IHC ribbon synapses differs along the tonotopic axis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Meyer et al., 2009</xref>), we were careful to compare the same region between cochleae (around 16 kHz, see ‘Materials and Methods’).</p><p>The analysis of GluR2 expression revealed an obvious failure in post-synaptic differentiation in <italic>Mafb</italic><sup><italic>CKO</italic></sup> animals. In control animals, diffuse patches of GluR2 immunofluorescence were present near the basolateral pole of the IHCs by P6 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>, arrowhead).

This loss of postsynaptic clustering of GluR2 appears to reflect an overall failure in PSD development, as ultrastructural studies revealed a clear disruption in PSD morphology at P6. During this period of active synapse development and refinement in the mouse cochlea, IHCs contain both anchored ribbons, which are localized to the cell surface, and floating ribbons, which are initially free in the cytoplasm and can become anchored as the cochlea matures. In control mice, anchored ribbons faced a large, well-defined PSD in the apposing SGN terminal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C,D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1E,F</xref>).

The loss of GluR2 and CtBP2 puncta was observed along the entire length of the mutant cochlea (data not shown). Additionally, close examination of individual pre- and post-synaptic puncta showed that many CtBP2-positive ribbons were not paired with a corresponding GluR2 spot (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4I,J</xref>). This stands in contrast to control animals, where an individual ribbon is reliably juxtaposed to a single GluR2-positive terminal by this stage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Khimich et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Nemzou et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Sendin et al., 2007</xref>).

To determine how auditory function is altered when synapse development is disrupted, we measured Auditory Brainstem Responses (ABRs) in <italic>Mafb</italic><sup><italic>CKO</italic></sup> animals. ABRs reflect the electrical responses of neurons in the cochlea and auditory brainstem to sound stimuli. Acoustic sensitivity is determined by identifying the lowest sound pressure level (SPL) (the threshold) that is able to elicit a response. ABRs were recorded in response to pure tone bursts of 5.6, 8, 11.3, 16, 22.6, 32, and 45.2 kHz.

At P6, ribbons are gradually relocating from the cytoplasm to the membrane, where individual ribbons are anchored opposite an afferent terminal. In <italic>Mafb</italic><sup><italic>CE</italic></sup> mice, this process occurred earlier and CtBP2-positive spots were noticeably more confined to the basal pole of the IHCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D′,E′</xref>). To assess the distribution of ribbons independent of the angle at which each IHC was imaged, we measured the distance from each ribbon to its nearest neighbor; this distance is predicted to be shorter when ribbons are more tightly localized (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7H</xref>). Indeed, the nearest-neighbor distance of ribbons in P6 <italic>Mafb</italic><sup><italic>CE</italic></sup> mice was significantly shorter (1.83 ± 0.03 µm, n = 428 ribbons) than in controls (2.06 ± 0.04 µm, n = 407 ribbons) (<italic>p</italic>&lt;0.0001) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7I</xref>).

Our results indicate that Mafb plays a highly specific role, with dramatic effects on post-synaptic differentiation in the absence of any other obvious changes in SGN function. Indeed, Mafb was capable of restoring synapses even in the <italic>Gata3</italic> mutant background, where SGN development is severely disrupted. These findings establish Mafb as a potent regulator of SGN terminal differentiation that functions within a broader Gata3 transcriptional network, offering a potent molecular entry point for designing new treatments for age-related and noise-induced hearing loss.</p><p>Efforts to elucidate the molecular basis of neuronal differentiation have highlighted the importance of transcriptional networks that progressively specify neuronal fates and direct the proper execution of these fates during terminal differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Hobert, 2011</xref>). The earliest acting transcription factors are master regulators, which induce multiple parallel changes in gene expression that reinforce cell fate and promote differentiation. The endpoint of the cascade is the activation of so-called terminal selectors, which induce batteries of genes essential for that neuron’s functional properties. Terminal selectors work combinatorially, with multiple transcription factors cooperating to regulate sets of terminal effector genes that are necessary for each neuron’s mature identity, such as neurotransmitters, channels, and synaptic adhesion molecules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Hobert, 2011</xref>). For example, the ETS-factor Ast-1 activates expression of genes essential for dopamine synthesis and transport in dopaminergic neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Hobert, 2011</xref>), acting together with Dlx and Pbx-family transcription factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Doitsidou et al., 2013</xref>). Identifying analogous terminal selectors in vertebrates has been more challenging, due to the increased complexity of neuronal phenotypes, as well as the difficulty in defining discrete regulatory elements. Hence, the only established examples are for easily recognized features of mature neurons, such as the control of serotonin production by the transcription factor Pet1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Liu et al., 2010</xref>).</p><p>Our results place Mafb at the bottom of a transcriptional network that controls the differentiation of neurons dedicated to the sense of hearing. At the top of this hierarchy are <italic>Neurogenin1</italic> and <italic>NeuroD1</italic> that control the generation of all inner ear neurons. Subsequently, <italic>Gata3</italic> expression is selectively enriched in SGNs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Lawoko-Kerali et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Lu et al., 2011</xref>) and acts both to promote the auditory fate and to coordinate multiple aspects of SGN differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Appler et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Duncan and Fritzsch, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Luo et al., 2013</xref>).

Hence, Mafb provides a new example of a transcription factor that can direct post-synaptic differentiation, apparently in a cell-type specific manner.</p><p>Mafb’s restricted effects contrast with those of Gata3, which is necessary for multiple aspects of SGN development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Appler et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Duncan and Fritzsch, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Luo et al., 2013</xref>). This raises the important question of what other transcription factors might act downstream of Gata3. One attractive possibility is that combinatorial activity with other large Maf factors contributes to SGN differentiation. MafA and c-Maf are also highly expressed in SGNs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Lu et al., 2011</xref> and W-MY and LVG, unpublished observation), and both have been shown to play important roles in the terminal differentiation of neurons in the dorsal root ganglia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bourane et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Wende et al., 2012</xref>). Thus, there may be a Maf code for SGN terminal differentiation, with each factor directing a different feature required for mature function.</p><p>Mafb’s potent effects on the late stages of SGN differentiation raise the intriguing possibility that Mafb may serve as a terminal selector in the vertebrate nervous system. Terminal selectors are typically recognized by two consistent characteristics: the ability to activate cell-type appropriate gene expression during terminal differentiation and an ongoing role in the maintenance of critical genes in the mature neuron (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Hobert, 2011</xref>). Consistent with this definition, Mafb is not expressed until late in differentiation, just a day before functional synapses can first be detected (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Marrs and Spirou, 2012</xref>), suggesting that Mafb may activate expression of terminal effectors that drive synapse formation. Additionally, Mafb is both necessary and sufficient for the acquisition of a key feature of mature SGN function, that is the ability to receive information from IHCs. Whether Mafb plays an ongoing role in SGNs remains to be determined, but its persistent expression in adults fulfills another important criterion. Notably, the output of any one terminal selector is strongly influenced by cellular context, so individual terminal selectors can also be expressed in other subtypes of neurons and not all neurons of the same subtype depend on the same set of terminal selectors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Doitsidou et al., 2013</xref>). Similarly, the absence of Mafb from vestibular ganglion neurons, which also form ribbon synapses, suggests that different sets of transcription factors may act in SGNs and VGNs to control post-synaptic differentiation. Additional support for a terminal selector function for Mafb awaits identification of direct target genes, studies that may ultimately reveal effects on other auditory-specific features of SGN function.</p><p>Our findings raise the possibility that Mafb’s effects might extend to other neuronal populations. Indeed, Mafb is expressed by a handful of other neuronal subtypes and could play a similar role in the emergence of their cell-type specific properties, including but not limited to synaptic differentiation. For instance, in addition to being expressed in SGNs, Mafb is also expressed in cochlear nucleus bushy cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Saul et al., 2008</xref>), which receive synaptic input from SGNs. Similarly, Mafb defines subsets of cortical interneurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Wang et al., 2010</xref>) and a subpopulation of rhythmogenic neurons within the pre-Bötzinger complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Blanchi et al., 2003</xref>). Currently, the specific function of Mafb in other neuronal populations remains obscure, due both to the lethality of null mutants and the lack of tools for detecting subtle synaptic defects in other regions of the nervous system. With the availability of the new conditional alleles reported here, it will be important to investigate Mafb’s activities in other regions of the nervous system in the future. In addition, our results suggest that similar late acting transcription factors may play analogous roles in other subtypes of neurons, functioning after synaptic targeting to ensure that each neuron elaborates the correct type of synapse necessary for proper circuit function.</p><p>Mafb’s ability to direct auditory synaptogenesis even in pathological situations opens up the exciting possibility of harnessing this power to repair the damaged cochlea. One of the earliest effects of acoustic overexposure is the loss of synapses followed by withdrawal of SGN terminals. The SGNs subsequently undergo a long slow degeneration, ultimately resulting in significant hearing loss long after the original injury (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Kujawa and Liberman, 2009</xref>). Our results suggest that stimulation of Mafb might be sufficient to encourage damaged neurons to re-establish connections with IHCs. Moreover, the specificity of Mafb’s effects implies that synapses could be restored without inadvertently interfering with other aspects of SGN function. Importantly, we find that Mafb is still present in the adult cochlea (data not shown), largely sequestered in the cytoplasm. This observation emphasizes the need for further characterization of the post-translational modifications that affect the localization and transactivation activity of Mafb. Ultimately, drugs that enhance translocation of Mafb into the nucleus might offer a new treatment for deafness. Similarly, understanding how the Gata3–Mafb cascade is deployed will be critical for the development of stem cell-based replacement therapies. Indeed, recent studies have shown that functional dopaminergic and spinal motor neurons can be directly generated from somatic cells by ectopic expression of lineage specific transcription factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Caiazzo et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Son et al., 2011</xref>), thereby avoiding the need for surgical implantation of stem cells. With the discovery of transcription factors such as Neurogenin1, NeuroD1, Gata3, and Mafb, such an approach may eventually be possible in the cochlea.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Generation of <italic>Mafb</italic><sup><italic>flox</italic></sup> and <italic>Gt(ROSA)26Sor</italic><sup><italic>CAG-lsl-Mafb</italic></sup> (<italic>Mafb</italic><sup><italic>CE</italic></sup>) mice</title><p>A linker sequence containing a <italic>loxP</italic> sequence and a SwaI restriction site for Southern blot genotyping was inserted into the middle of a 5.98 kB Mafb genomic fragment (corresponding to the sequence of 2260–8240 bp in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>) to create the Mafb 5′ targeting arm.

Your article has been favorably evaluated by a Senior editor and 3 reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors.</p><p>The Reviewing editor and the other reviewers discussed their comments before we reached this decision, and the Reviewing editor has assembled the following comments to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Yu et al. generated conditional knock-out and conditional knock-in mice and demonstrated that transcription factor Mafb, downstream of GATA3, is required for proper postsynaptic differentiation of spiral ganglion neurons (SGNs). In a <italic>Mafb</italic> conditional mutant, SGNs have smaller PSD and reduced GluR2 clustering (puncta), and these defects in turn lead to reduced presynaptic ribbons in hair cells. Expressing Mafb earlier in SGN development caused earlier clustering of GluR2, but did not affect the mature patterns of hair cell-SGN synapses. Electrophysiology recording confirmed that defects in synapse formation caused abnormal auditory responses.</p><p>The experiments were all performed carefully and the data are convincing. Given that very little is known about the transcriptional control of synapse formation in general, and in auditory development in particular, we are enthusiastic in receiving a revised manuscript from the authors that will address the following three critiques. The first two are related to interpretations of the data and the third requires additional experiments.</p><p>1) We are not convinced by the authors’ interpretation that Mafb drives cell-type specific features of terminal differentiation, i.e., it is a terminal selector.</p><p>Specifically, the authors described the specific features as the ribbon synapses: the large PSD and the presynaptic ribbons. However, these ribbon synapses are also present in the vestibular hair cell-neuron synapses, and Mafb is not expressed in the vestibular ganglion neurons. Thus, one does not need Mafb to make ribbon synapses. Moreover, overexpression of Mafb did not give rise to more ribbon synapses; it only had a transient effect on GluR2 clustering. Thus, Mafb could not “drive” ectopic specialized synapse formation, and therefore it is unlikely to be a terminal selector.</p><p>One could imagine a scenario that transcriptional targets of Mafb are synaptogenetic adhesion molecules required to bring pre- and post- synaptic membrane together; while the hair cells have intrinsic capacity to form ribbons, once the pre- and the post- synaptic membranes are opposed to each other, the hair cells can drive the postsynaptic differentiation in SGN neurons. In this scenario, the “driver” of terminal differentiation and ribbon synapse formation is the hair cells, not genes in SGN neurons.</p><p>In fact, the phenotype shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4J</xref>, the mis-alignment (or mis-match) of pre- and post synaptic puncta is consistent with the idea that some synaptogenic adhesion process was abnormal in <italic>Mafb</italic> mutant, and as a consequence synapses fail to further develop/differentiate.</p><p>2) We are not entirely convinced by the conclusion “Precocious expression of Mafb accelerates afferent synapse development.” The genetic strategy enables the authors to express Mafb at E12.5, as opposed to the normal onset between E13.5-E15.5. However, the “precocious” postsynaptic development was examined at P6, or nearly two weeks after the normal onset of expression. This effect could well be caused by overexpression of Mafb, rather than precocious expression of Mafb.</p><p>3) The reviewers all agree that identifying the transcriptional targets of Mafb to get at the mechanisms underlying the defects of hair cell-SGN synapse formation is an important next step for subsequent studies. However, since Mafb is a transcription factor, and the authors did show reduced GluR2 protein puncta and reduced PSD size in the Mafb mutant, the authors should at least do a few in situ hybridization analyses to examine whether the mRNA of GluR2 and PSD components are reduced.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.01341.020</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>1) We are not convinced by the authors’ interpretation that Mafb drives cell-type specific features of terminal differentiation, i.e., it is a terminal selector</italic>.</p><p><italic>Specifically, the authors described the specific features as the ribbon synapses: the large PSD and the presynaptic ribbons.

However, we feel that this is an attractive idea to consider, since Mafb is activated during terminal differentiation, is required for a key step in SGN differentiation, and continues to be expressed in adult SGNs. The fact that Mafb is absent from a different population of neurons that also makes ribbon synapses does not rule out a terminal selector function. In fact, terminal selectors work combinatorially and cooperatively. Hence, an individual terminal selector may be present in a variety of cell types but can only activate a particular set of effector genes when other transcription factors are also present. Moreover, the same set of effector genes can be regulated by different combinations of transcription factors, as shown recently for regulation of dopamine pathway genes in different subtypes of dopaminergic neurons in <italic>C. elegans</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Doitsidou et al., 2013</xref>). Similarly, vestibular ganglion neurons may employ different combinations of transcription factors for regulation of post-synaptic differentiation, possibly including other Maf factors. Along the same lines, Mafb may require the presence of additional factors in order to alter synapse number permanently when misexpressed. Alternatively, pruning mechanisms may overcome the synapse-promoting effects of Mafb.</p><p>Clearly, more work is needed to determine whether Mafb is indeed a terminal selector, beginning with identification of target genes in SGNs. With regards to the scenario presented, it is certainly possible that Mafb induces expression of a synaptogenic adhesion molecule, but this alone would not be sufficient to reject the terminal selector possibility, particularly if ongoing expression of that molecule is necessary for maintenance of the mature synapse. We hesitate to make any conclusions for or against the proposed model based on the data shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>, as there are also other interpretations. We have rewritten the Discussion to make these points clearer without overstating a possible role for Mafb as a terminal selector.</p><p><italic>2) We are not entirely convinced by the conclusion “Precocious expression of Mafb accelerates afferent synapse development.” The genetic strategy enables the authors to express Mafb at E12.5, as opposed to the normal onset between E13.5-E15.5. However, the “precocious” postsynaptic development was examined at P6, or nearly two weeks after the normal onset of expression. This effect could well be caused by overexpression of Mafb, rather than precocious expression of Mafb</italic>.</p><p>This point is well taken. We had focused on the change in timing because Western blot analysis did not reveal an obvious increase in the amount of Mafb at postnatal stages, when Mafb is already present in abundance (data not shown). Unfortunately, we were not able to measure Mafb levels earlier, as it is technically challenging to collect sufficient spiral ganglia from mice with different genotypes at embryonic stages for Western Blots. However, as one would predict given the earlier onset of expression, immunostaining between E12.5 to E16.5 indicated that the level of Mafb proteins is higher in <italic>Mafb<sup>CE</sup></italic> SGNs when compared to control SGNs at the same stage. The cumulative effects of increased levels of Mafb over this long period of time could indeed explain the accelerated changes in synapse development we see at P6. We have made changes in the text accordingly.</p><p><italic>3) The reviewers all agree that identifying the transcriptional targets of Mafb to get at the mechanisms underlying the defects of hair cell-SGN synapse formation is an important next step for subsequent studies. However, since Mafb is a transcription factor, and the authors did show reduced GluR2 protein puncta and reduced PSD size in the Mafb mutant, the authors should at least do a few</italic> in situ <italic>hybridization analyses to examine whether the mRNA of GluR2 and PSD components are reduced</italic>.</p><p>While identification of the complete set of Mafb target genes remains an important goal for the future, we agree it is important to address whether the mRNA levels of GluR2 and PSD components are reduced in <italic>Mafb<sup>CKO</sup></italic> mutant neurons. We have performed the in situ hybridization of GluR2 and PSD95 in P6 control and <italic>Mafb<sup>CKO</sup></italic> SGNs as suggested. We found that <italic>Mafb<sup>CKO</sup></italic> SGNs show a similar level GluR2 and PSD95 mRNAs when compared to control SGNs. This indicates that the reduced number of GluR2 puncta and formation of smaller PSDs in mutant animals cannot be explained by decreased expression of GluR2 or other PSD components.
