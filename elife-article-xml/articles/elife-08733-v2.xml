pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.08733.001</object-id><p>Although pain is a common symptom of various diseases and disorders, its contribution to disease pathogenesis is not well understood. Here we show using murine experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), a model for multiple sclerosis (MS), that pain induces EAE relapse. Mechanistic analysis showed that pain induction activates a sensory-sympathetic signal followed by a chemokine-mediated accumulation of MHC class II+CD11b+ cells that showed antigen-presentation activity at specific ventral vessels in the fifth lumbar cord of EAE-recovered mice. Following this accumulation, various immune cells including pathogenic CD4+ T cells recruited in the spinal cord in a manner dependent on a local chemokine inducer in endothelial cells, resulting in EAE relapse. Our results demonstrate that a pain-mediated neural signal can be transformed into an inflammation reaction at specific vessels to induce disease relapse, thus making this signal a potential therapeutic target.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.08733.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.08733.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.08733.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Multiple sclerosis (or MS for short) is a disease in which the insulating covers of nerve cells in the brain and spinal cord become inflamed and damaged. Depending on which nerves are affected, this disease can cause a wide range of symptoms, ranging from numbness and muscle spasms to visual disturbances and chronic pain. Many other diseases and disorders also have pain as a symptom, but it is not well understood if pain itself can directly contribute to the development of disease.</p><p>Most people with MS will, initially, experience periods when their symptoms get worse (called ‘relapses’), which are then followed by periods of improvement. Arima, Kamimura et al. investigated whether the sensation of pain itself could trigger a relapse in a mouse model of MS. The experiments showed that a painful sensation could trigger a relapse in the mice via the so-called ‘gateway reflex’. This reflex describes the phenomenon whereby nerve impulses lead to the release of signaling molecules that cause the walls of nearby blood vessels to open and allow immune cells to move from the bloodstream to the central nervous system. This in turn stimulates the development of inflammation, which causes an imbalance in the affected sites of the central nervous system.</p><p>These findings demonstrate that pain itself triggers a signal—sent via nerve impulses followed by the release of signaling molecules—that can lead to a relapse; and suggest that interfering with this signal could potentially help to treat to protect against relapses in MS. Following on from this work, it will be important to confirm if the gateway reflex exists in humans, and whether it is linked to other diseases that don't involve the central nervous system.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.08733.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.08733.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group

(CD4+ T cell)-mediated autoimmune disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">International Multiple Sclerosis Genetics Consortium et al., 2011</xref>) that is characterized by chronic inflammation in the central nervous system (CNS) and relapse in over two thirds of patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Steinman, 2009</xref>). Such relapse is marked by inflammatory lesions consisting of various immune cells including CD4+ T cells, CD8+ T cells, B cells, and macrophages followed by a loss of neurological function in various regions of the CNS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Steinman, 2014</xref>). To understand the molecular mechanisms involved in the relapse, disease model animals including experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) mice have been designed to study the corresponding molecular mechanism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Miller et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Steinman, 2009</xref>). However, a detailed explanation for the relapse is still lacking.</p><p>Pain induction is a symptom of MS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Thompson et al., 2010</xref>) and sometimes a determinant of MS activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Ehde et al., 2003</xref>). Pain induction is commonly interpreted as a biomarker of inflammation, although inflammation can sometimes occur in the CNS without it (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Watson et al., 1991</xref>). Yet a correlation between pain intensity and the pathogenesis of inflammation is poorly established and still debated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Beiske et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Kalia and O'Connor, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Solaro et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Ehde et al., 2006</xref>). More specifically, it has not been demonstrated whether pain induction is involved in MS relapse.</p><p>One critical machinery for inflammation development is a local chemokine inducer in non-immune cells termed the inflammation amplifier (formerly IL-6 amplifier), which we originally discovered in several disease models including EAE (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Ogura et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Hirano, 2010</xref>). In this system, massive chemokine expression caused by the simultaneous stimulation of NFkB and STAT3 is followed by disruption of local homeostasis due to the local accumulation of various immune cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Murakami and Hirano, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Murakami et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Lee et al., 2012</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">2013</xref>).

Soleus muscle-mediated sensory-sympathetic neural signals enhance inflammation amplifier activation in L5 dorsal vessels via local norepinephrine expression derived from sympathetic neurons to create gates through which immune cells reach the CNS and cause inflammation there (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Arima et al., 2012</xref>). These gates can be artificially manipulated via the activation of local neural signals by electrically stimulating muscles, resulting in an accumulation of immune cells in the intended regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Arima et al., 2012</xref>). Gating blood vessels by regional neural stimulations, a phenomenon termed the gateway reflex, is an example of the neural signaling-mediated regulation of inflammation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Tracey, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Sabharwal et al., 2014</xref>) and has potential therapeutic value not only in preventing autoimmunity, but also in augmenting the effects of immunotherapies against infections and cancers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Ogura et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Atsumi et al., 2014</xref>). Because it is known that neural activations are induced by various situations including pain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Delmas et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Palazzo et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">LaMotte et al., 2014</xref>), we considered whether neural signals mediated by pain induction plays a role in the pathogenesis of EAE relapse via the gating of certain blood vessels.</p><p>In the present paper, we induced a pain stimulus in EAE-recovered mice that had minimal EAE symptoms. The result was EAE relapse. Mechanistic analysis demonstrated that a neural signal via sensory-mediated sympathetic activation leads to an accumulation of MHC class II+CD11b+ cells at ventral vessels of the L5 cord (L5 ventral vessels) in a manner dependent on CX3CL1 chemokine expression followed by an accumulation of various immune cells including pathogenic CD4+ T cells. These results demonstrate that pain-mediated neural signals risk reactivating inflammation via the accumulation of immune cells at specific sites and therefore may offer a new therapeutic target for relapse in chronic inflammatory diseases like MS.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Pain induction develops the relapse of EAE</title><p>We have previously employed a passive transfer method for EAE induction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Ogura et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Arima et al., 2012</xref>).

Although this pain induction did not accelerate disease development, particularly during the onset period (until 10 days after the pathogenic T cell transfer), the pain persisted and maintained symptoms at a high level from 15 days post T cell transfer compared with sham mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). We found that pain induction itself (without pathogenic T cell transfer) did not induce the development of EAE (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>) and that pain induced in mice with pathogenic T cells gradually caused a low clinical score over 20 days after the transfer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). We found negligible cfos expression in neurons of the somatosensory area, which is a key area involved in pain sensation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Li et al., 2010</xref>), in the brain of EAE-recovered mice and negligible pain sensation according to the von Frey test of the extremity, trunk of the body, face, head (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref> and data not shown), suggesting that remittent mice have minimal pain. Then we investigated whether pain induction was involved in the relapse of EAE. We induced pain in EAE-recovered mice that had developed transient EAE.

On the other hand, capsaicin, a painful agent, injected into the whiskers or forefeet caused EAE relapse (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>). A relapsing-remittent model of SJL/PLP mice was also suppressed by pain medicines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>).

Activated neurons, as defined by NeuN and cfos expressions, expressed the sensory markers TRPV1 and/or Nav1.8 in trigeminal ganglions. We found negligible cfos expression, however, in the subtypes of these markers in the absence of ligation in the remittent phase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). Immunohistochemical experiments using serial sections showed that cfos+-activated neurons also expressed TRPV1 and/or Nav1.8 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). Treatment with a Nav1.8 blocker, A803467, suppressed the development of the EAE relapse (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>), and TRPV1-deficient hosts showed suppressed relapse (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>).

We first investigated blood flow speed, which is controlled by autonomic neurons including sympathetic ones, in the dorsal vessels of L5 and L1, the bottoms of the forefeet, the hindlimb, femoral vessels, and brain surface vessels in pain-induced mice. Blood flow speed was faster in pain-induced than sham-operated mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). These results suggested that sympathetic activation affects blood vessels in the CNS after pain induction. Consistent with these results, neurons of the somatosensory area, particularly the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), where sensory nerves are localized with autonomic nerves including sympathetic ones (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Ikemoto et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Critchley, 2005</xref>), were activated according to cfos expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). Moreover, sympathetic ganglions were activated after pain induction, with the activation status in L5 being higher than in other cords (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). Furthermore, treatment with atenolol, an inhibitor of the norepinephrine β1 receptor, significantly suppressed the relapse development (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>), and treatment with 6-OHDA, which induces sympathectomy, suppressed the EAE relapse (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>), while mice treated with atenolol and 6-OHDA did not suppress cfos expression in neurons of the somatosensory area after pain induction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>). Moreover, EAE mice under immobilization stress or forced swimming did not show EAE relapse, although these conditions did increase serum corticosterone, norepinephrine, and epinephrine similarly to pain induction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E,F</xref>).

We found similar percentages of CD45.1+ cells and peripheral derived CD45.2+ cells in MHC class II+CD11b+ cells in the L5 cord of EAE remittent parabiosis hosts, while MHC class II+CD11b+ cells in the L5 cord of wild type parabiosis mice had only a low number of CD45.1+ cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). These results suggested that the majority of MHC class II+CD11b+ cells in the L5 cord of EAE remittent hosts originated from peripheral monocytes but not resident microglial cells.</p><p>Pain induction resulted in a strong accumulation of MHC class II+CD11b+ cells in the L5 cord, particularly at the ventral vessels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>, ligation). We measured MFI and the number of MHC class II+ cells in the dotted circles. Moreover, depletion of MHC class II+CD11b+ cells in the cisterna magna but not in the peritoneal cavity suppressed the accumulation of MHC class II+CD11b+ cells at L5 ventral vessels and the relapse development after pain induction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C,D</xref>). These results demonstrated that the accumulation of MHC class II+CD11b+ cells, which were likely derived from the CNS side, at the L5 ventral vessels is important for EAE relapse.</p><p>We next investigated the connection between the sensory and sympathetic pathways, which is critical for the accumulation of MHC class II+CD11b+ cells at the L5 ventral vessels. Specific sensory afferents begin at the brainstem and travel via sympathetic efferent pathways through ACC. Neurons in the ACC are activated by NMDA receptors. We found an antagonist of NMDA receptors, MK801, injected to the ACC not only suppressed the expression of cfos but also the accumulation of MHC class II+CD11b+ cells at the ventral vessels in the L5 cord after pain induction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>), while an agonist of NMDA receptors, L-Homocysteic acid, injected to the ACC enhanced the expression of cfos and the accumulation of MHC class II+CD11b+ cells at the ventral vessels in the L5 cord without ligation of the trigeminal nerves (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref>). These results suggested that the pain-mediated neural activation was at least in part dependent on the ACC.

Immunohistochemistry experiments confirmed that CX3CL1 molecules were found around the L5 ventral vessels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>). Norepinephrine treatment increased CX3CL1 expression in primary CD11b+ cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5H</xref>), while norepinephrine-mediated CX3CL1 expression was suppressed in CD11b+ cells derived from β1 and β2 receptor-deficient mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>). Indeed, blockade of CX3CL1 by a neutralizing antibody in the CNS significantly suppressed the L5 accumulation of MHC class II+CD11b+ cells as well as the relapse development after pain induction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5I,J</xref>).

We then investigated the relationship between MHC class II+CD11b+ cells and pathogenic CD4+ T cells in EAE relapse after pain induction. Anti-CD4 antibody treatment significantly suppressed the development of the EAE relapse (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>) despite the accumulation of MHC class II+CD11b+ cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>).

To induce pain, we mainly used nerve injury via the trigeminal nerves and painful agents including capsaicin injected into the whiskers or forefeet. To clarify if the relapse responses were due to neural signals and not pain-mediated systemic hormonal responses or stress-mediated events, we first investigated sensory and sympathetic pathways, finding that sensory neurons expressing TRPV1 and/or Nav1.8, sensory-sympathetic connections in the ACC, and sympathetic neurons were involved in the response. On the other hand, EAE mice under stress conditions did not develop EAE relapse, although the stress inductions did increase serum corticosterone, norepinephrine, and epinephrine similarly to pain induction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E,F</xref>). These data suggest specific sensory-sympathetic signals triggered by pain induction plays a role in the development of EAE relapse.</p><p>We could divide the relapse responses into at least four steps. The first step is pain-mediated sensory activation followed by sympathetic activation. We found various sensory neurons are activated after pain induction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). TRPV1 deficiency or treatment with a Nav1.8 blocker, A803467, suppressed the development of the EAE relapse and its related events including the accumulation of MHC class II+CD11b+ cells around L5 ventral vessels and cfos expression at the neurons of the somatosensory area after pain induction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C,D</xref>, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). Consistent with these results, we showed that the injections of a TRPV1 agonist, capsaicin in EAE-recovered mice induced the development of EAE relapse and related events, phenotypes that are consistent with those induced by pain in the trigeminal nerves (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>).</p><p>The second step is pain-mediated sympathetic activation. This activation triggers the regional expression of the chemokine CX3CL1 followed by the accumulation of MHC class II+CD11b+ cells at the L5 ventral vessels. Because Creb was activated around the L5 ventral vessels and atenolol and 6-OHDA-mediated sympathectomy suppressed the accumulation of MHC class II+CD11b+ cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B,D,E</xref>), we further concluded that the norepinephrine pathway plays a role. CD11b+ cells in the CNS are likely to express CX3CL1, because these cells induced CX3CL1 after norepinephrine stimulation, at least in vitro (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5H</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>). The number of MHC class II+CD11b+ cells was higher in the L5 cord than other cords, particularly in EAE-recovered mice, even without pain induction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). The L5 specificity of the relapse development may be because the L5 cord is the site of initial inflammation and is the tissue most damaged during the primary development of EAE. Moreover, it is known that a certain level of the sympathetic pathway is activated by anti-gravity responses even at steady state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Arima et al., 2012</xref>). Therefore, we hypothesized that a low but sufficient level of sympathetic activation may maintain a low level of the inflammation state in the L5 cord to accumulate MHC class II+CD11b+ cells in the L5 cord of EAE-recovered mice and develop EAE relapse after pain induction.</p><p>The third step for EAE relapse is the accumulation of pathogenic CD4+ T cells at the L5 ventral vessels. This step is most likely dependent on self-antigen presentation via MHC class II+CD11b+ cells, because these cells stimulated MOG-specific pathogenic CD4+ T cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>).</p><p>The fourth and final step is mediated by excessive chemokine expressions and is most likely triggered by the activation of the accumulated pathogenic CD4+ T cells in the third step. Pathogenic CD4+ T cells transferred into mice include Th17 and Th1 cells and express various cytokines beyond IL-17 and IFNγ, including IL-6, TNFα, etc., all of which are stimulators of NFkB and STATs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Ogura et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Lee et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Murakami et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Atsumi et al., 2014</xref>). Moreover, we have previously shown that endothelial cells express IL-6 after norepinephrine stimulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Arima et al., 2012</xref>) and MHC class II+CD11b+ cells in the CNS of EAE-recovered mice expressed various cytokines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>). Therefore, we suggest that the local chemokine expression at L5 ventral vessels via various cytokines subsequently enhances an accumulation of immune cells, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>. Indeed, we found blockades of IL-6, IL-17A, or CCL20 signals suppressed EAE relapse (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6H,I</xref>, and data not shown). The excessive chemokine induction results in excess immune cell migration, which compromises local homeostasis and can trigger inflammatory diseases. Thus, accumulation of both MHC class II+CD11b+ cells and pathogenic CD4+ T cells at the ventral vessels of the L5 cord stimulate the excessive expression of chemokines in non-immune cells to trigger the EAE relapse.</p><p>Although the flow cytometry data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref> showed that all cell types were recruited at similar rates and did not accumulate in distinct waves, it should be pointed out that the sensitivity of the FACS analysis is low with regards to the MHC class II+CD11b+ cells and CD4+ T cells found in the immunohistochemistry. Therefore, FACS analysis will not reveal sequential steps. The results of the blocking experiments, however, do show obvious four steps: Regarding the first step, blockades of sensory pathways by using A803467, TRPV1-deficient hosts, and MK801 at the ACC region suppressed somatosensory activations, sympathetic activations, and MHC class II+CD11b+ cell accumulation in the ventral vessels, and EAE-relapse. Regarding the second step, we used atenolol and 6-OHDA to suppress sympathetic activation and MHC class II+CD11b+ cell accumulation in the ventral vessels and/or EAE-relapse. However, this treatment did not affect sensory-mediated somatosensory activations, suggesting that sympathetic activation is a downstream event after sensory activation. Also regarding the second step, blockade of CX3CL1 did suppress MHC class II+CD11b+ cell accumulation in the ventral vessels and EAE-relapse but not somatosensory activations and sympathetic activations, suggesting that CX3CL1 expression is a downstream event after sensory and sympathetic activation. Regarding the third step, anti-CD4 antibody application suppressed CD4+ T cell accumulation in the ventral vessels and EAE-relapse but not somatosensory activations, sympathetic activations, or MHC class II+CD11b+ cell accumulation in the ventral vessels, suggesting that CD4+ T cell accumulation is a downstream event of sensory and sympathetic activation and of MHC class II+CD11b+ cell accumulation in the ventral vessels. MHC class II+CD11b+ cell accumulation in the ventral vessels as observed within 8 hr. Regarding the fourth step, blockades of IL-17 and IL-6 signal by neutralizing antibodies suppressed EAE-relapse but not somatosensory activations, sympathetic activations, MHC class II+CD11b+ cell accumulation in the ventral vessels, or CD4+ T cell accumulation, suggesting that the inflammation amplifier activation by cytokines including IL-17 and IL-6 is a downstream event after sensory and sympathetic activation, MHC class II+CD11b+ cell accumulation in the ventral vessels, and pathogenic Th17 cell accumulation in the ventral vessels. These results clearly suggested there are the four-steps that occur sequentially and are critical for the development of pain-mediated EAE relapse in our EAE models.</p><p>Regarding the induction of different chemokine-mediated axes by different sympathetic neurons (pain in this paper vs anti-gravity in the previous paper [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Arima et al., 2012</xref>]), we should point out that we used different hosts in these two cases. We used normal mice for anti-gravity experiments, but EAE-recovered mice for pain-mediated ones. In other words, the numbers of MHC class II+CD11b+ cells are completely different: normal mice have almost no MHC class II+CD11b+ cells in the CNS, while EAE-recovered mice have many MHC class II+CD11b+ cells in the CNS particularly in the L5 cord. In EAE-recovered mice, a regional norepinephrine output via pain inductions functions on MHC class II+CD11b+ cells as well as endothelial cells around the ventral vessels of the spinal cords, causing the expression of CX3CL1 and accumulation of MHC class II+CD11b+CX3CR1+ cells in a manner dependent on the CX3CL1-CX3CR1 axis. These accumulated MHC class II+CD11b+CX3CR1+ cells present autoantigens to pathogenic Th17 cells located in the blood stream. On the other hand, in normal mice, a regional norepinephrine output via anti-gravity responses functions just on endothelial cells because of there are almost no MHC class II+CD11b+ cells in the CNS. This case results in CCL20 expression, which causes the accumulation pathogenic Th17 cells that express the CCR6 receptor, IL-17 and IL-6.</p><p>We hypothesized pain-mediated sympathetic signaling acts via a high concentration of norepinephrine at the sympathetic neurovascular connection, but not through the systemic induction of hormones such as epinephrine and norepinephrine, which play a major role in the development of EAE relapse, because neither an accumulation of MHC class II+CD11b+ cells at L5 ventral vessels nor EAE relapse in remittent mice that had immobilization stress or forced swimming were observed, even though serum norepinephrine and epinephrine increased just like in the pain-induction condition, which did induce MHC class II+CD11b+ cell accumulation as well as EAE relapse. However, epinephrine and norepinephrine induced CX3CL1 expression dose-dependently in MHC class II+CD11b+ cells, which are also present in spleen and lymphonodes, and endothelial cells and fibroblasts induced various chemokines, including CCL20, after stimulation by epinephrine and norepinephrine, particularly in the presence of NFkB and STAT3 activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Arima et al., 2012</xref>). Therefore, we hypothesized that systemic epinephrine/norepinephrine molecules induced a systemic pro-inflammatory state via chemokine expression.</p><p>MS GWAS analysis in 2011 showed a clear link between MS patients and the MHC class II-CD4+ T cell axis, but also suppressive effects on the MHC class I-CD8+ T cell axis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Consortium, 2011</xref>), suggesting that MS is a CD4 genetic disease but not CD8 one. On the other hand, it is known that MS active lesions contain many CD8+ T cells sometimes having features of local antigen reactivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Tsuchida et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Dressel et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Crawford et al., 2004</xref>). We therefore hypothesized that CD8+ T cell accumulation is mediated by inflammation responses primarily induced by autoreactive CD4+ T cells. Consistently, our results from transfer EAE also showed the accumulations of various immune cells including CD8+ T cells in L5 cord.</p><p>It is well known that many patients with MS experience pain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Thompson et al., 2010</xref>). Kalia and O'Connor found that the proportion of patients with a progressive course of MS trend higher among patients with chronic types of pain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Kalia and O'Connor, 2005</xref>). It was also reported that central pain is the first and sole symptom of MS relapse in some patients (1.6% of all patients, 6% of patients with central pain) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Osterberg et al., 2005</xref>). At the same time, several reports have failed to show a clear relationship between pain and disease duration and/or course (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Beiske et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Kalia and O'Connor, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Michalski et al., 2011</xref>). Thus, there does not seem to be a direct correlation clinically between pain intensity and MS disability or lesional load. We hypothesize that there are several reasons why we did not observe a clear relationship between pain and MS progression, which we explain in view of the above four steps. In the first step, differences in pain sensitivity and sensory activation among individuals complicate the investigation. It is known that loss of pain sensitivity may vary with the region or size of the affected site between patients, such that a bigger affected site correlates with less sensitivity in MS patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Huber et al., 1988</xref>). In addition, depression occurs with high frequency in MS patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Chwastiak et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Siegert and Abernethy, 2005</xref>), and this might also affect sensation. In the second step, the degree of sympathetic activation should vary among individual patients following the first step, as too might the connection between the sensory and sympathetic pathways. Moreover, depression in MS patients also affects the sympathetic pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Guinjoan et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Rumsfeld and Ho, 2005</xref>). In the third and fourth steps, which are mediated by autoreactive CD4+ T cell-mediated inflammation amplifier activation following MHC class II+CD11b+ cell accumulation, different affected regions in quantity and/or quality between MS patients due to differences in the autoantigen distribution recognized by autoreactive CD4+ T cells and different neural activations in each patient should disrupt the relationship between pain and MS progression. Neural activations, which are critical for the establishment of autoreactive CD4+ T cell gateways in the vessels, might also be affected by various factors in each patient. These reasons might explain the disrupted relationship between pain sensation and MS progression. In our experiments, however, we managed to control the majority of these variations in MS mouse models. Thus, based on our analysis, we concluded that pain-mediated neural signal induces EAE relapse.</p><p>We propose at least three factors as important for determining the sites of relapse in MS patients: (1) the existence of excess MHC class II+CD11b+ cells at a particular site, (2) activation of a sympathetic pathway that accumulates MHC class II+CD11b+ cells in certain blood vessels, and (3) the presence of organ-specific autoreactive CD4+ T cells in the periphery. Even when MHC class II+CD11b+ cells are accumulated in a specific vessels, the inflammation is not induced without autoreactive CD4+ T cells, which recognized some autoantigens on the accumulated MHC class II+CD11b+ cells. We assume the sites of excess MHC class II+CD11b+ cells and sympathetic activations vary among patients as too the antigens recognized by autoreactive T cells, which would explain the variation in MS relapse regions. In other words, if we correctly detect the site of MHC class II+CD11b+ cell accumulation, the sites of sympathetic activation, and the presence of autoreactive CD4+ T cells in the periphery, we might be able to discern where the MS relapse begins and how to regulate it.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Mouse strains</title><p>C57BL/6 mice were purchased from Japan SLC (Tokyo, Japan), Adrb1-deficient mice, Adrb2-deficient mice and TRPV1-deficient mice were purchased from The Jackson Laboratory (Bar Harbor, ME), C57BL/6-SJL mice were purchased from Taconic (Germantown, NY), and SJL/J mice were purchased from Charles River (Yokohama, Japan).

Your submission has been favorably evaluated by Tadatsugu Taniguchi (Senior editor) and three reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>This is an interesting manuscript with an intriguing plot. Its specific novelty is a connection between pain perception via activation of TRPV1 sensory neurons to activation in the anterior cingulate cortex on the one hand, and a local epinephrine/norepinephrine-dependent induction of CX3CL1/CX3CR1 in the L5 spinal cord on the other. Findings downstream of that event in the L5 region, leading to accumulation of macrophages, CD4 and CD8 T cells, providing inflammatory cytokines and causing a paralytic relapse, then follow expectations from the authors' earlier work (Arima et al., Cell, 2012).</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>While this is a very interesting demonstration of connectivity between pain perception and inflammation modulation, it would be useful to have some major concerns addressed.</p><p>1) Some of the immunohistochemistry shows fairly minimal staining with a high background. For example changes in MHC class II and CD4 expression are not convincing, making quantification uncertain. It would be useful to have cell counts and cell-surface protein expression profiles of the cells at L5 quantified as in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref> for the major points being made.</p><p>2) The temporal aspects of the four-step sequential model proposed need clarification. In the Discussion, the 4-step model is laid out as sequential steps in a process. However, the present data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>) are consistent all of the cell types, being recruited at a similar rates and not in distinct waves. It is possible that there are positive feedback loops that produce this effect, or that all of the cell types are recruit due to a similar set of chemokines/cytokines. These issues (as for example in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5I</xref>) need to be clarified further, and with robust methodology as in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>.</p><p>3) It would be useful to have some explanation of how pain perception in any anatomical locality leads, via the anterior cingulate cortex, to local epinephrine/norepinephrine-dependent induction of CX3CL1/CX3CR1 specifically in the L5 spinal cord, which cannot be mimicked by systemic epinephrine/norepinephrine.</p><p>4) Some explanation of how pain-induced epinephrine/norepinephrine leads to activation of a CX3CL1-CX3CR1 axis leading to inflammation, while soleus sensory input-induced epinephrine/norepinephrine leads to activation of an IL6-CCL20-CCR6 axis (Arima et al., Cell, 2012), both in L5, would be very helpful.</p><p>5) The caveat that clinically there does not seem to be a direct correlation between pain intensity and MS disability or lesional load should be noted, as also the lack of natural relapses in the C57BL/6 mouse strain.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.08733.017</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>1) Some of the immunohistochemistry shows fairly minimal staining with a high background.

These values were determined by using serial sections with Hoechst nucleus staining. The ratio of MFI to cell number of the accumulated cells around the L5 ventral vessels before and after pain induction were similar. Indeed, the number of MHC class II+CD11b+ cells in each spinal cord, including L5, were basically unchanged before and after overnight pain induction (8 hours). However these cells accumulated around the two ventral blood vessels after pain induction. Therefore, it was difficult to evaluate their accumulation around the vessels by FACS. These data are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4 fig5 fig6">Figures 4C, 4E, 4F, 5D, 5E, 5I, 6D, 6E</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1–figure supplement 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2–figure supplement 1</xref>, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2–figure supplement 2</xref> and described in the third paragraph of subsection “A pain-mediated neural pathway accumulates MHC class II+CD11b+ cells at L5 ventral vessels via sympathetic-mediated chemokine expression in EAE-recovered mice” and in their Figure legends.</p><p><italic>2) The temporal aspects of the four-step sequential model proposed need clarification. In the Discussion, the 4-step model is laid out as sequential steps in a process. However, the present data (</italic><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4"><italic>Figure 4A</italic></xref><italic>) are consistent all of the cell types, being recruited at a similar rates and not in distinct waves. It is possible that there are positive feedback loops that produce this effect, or that all of the cell types are recruit due to a similar set of chemokines/cytokines. These issues (as for example in</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5"><italic>Figure 5I</italic></xref><italic>) need to be clarified further, and with robust methodology as in</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4"><italic>Figure 4A</italic></xref>.</p><p>As suggested by the reviewers, the flow cytometry data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref> showed that all cell types were recruited at similar rates and did not accumulate in distinct waves. It should be pointed out that the sensitivity of the FACS analysis is low with regards to the MHC class II+CD11b+ cells and CD4+ T cells found in the immunohistochemistry. Therefore, FACS analysis will not reveal sequential steps. The results of the blocking experiments, however, do show four steps: Regarding the 1<sup>st</sup> step, blockades of sensory pathways by using A803467, TRPV1-deficient hosts, and MK801 at the ACC region suppressed somatosensory activations, sympathetic activations, and MHC class II+CD11b+ cell accumulation in the ventral vessels, and EAE-relapse. Regarding the 2<sup>nd</sup> step, we used atenolol and 6-OHDA to suppress sympathetic pathway and MHC class II+CD11b+ cell accumulation in the ventral vessels and/or EAE-relapse. However, this treatment did not affect sensory-mediated somatosensory activations, suggesting that sympathetic activation is a downstream event after sensory activation. Also regarding the 2<sup>nd</sup> step, blockade of CX3CL1 did suppress MHC class II+CD11b+ cell accumulation in the ventral vessels and EAE-relapse but not somatosensory activations and sympathetic activations, suggesting that CX3CL1 expression is a downstream event after sensory and sympathetic activation. Regarding the 3<sup>rd</sup> step, anti-CD4 antibody application suppressed CD4+ T cell accumulation and EAE-relapse but not somatosensory activations, sympathetic activations, or MHC class II+CD11b+ cell accumulation in the ventral vessels, suggesting that CD4+ T cell accumulation is a downstream event of sensory and sympathetic activation and of MHC class II+CD11b+ cell accumulation in the ventral vessels. MHC class II+CD11b+ cell accumulation in the ventral vessels as observed within 8 hours (overnight). Regarding the 4<sup>th</sup> step, blockades of IL-17 and IL-6 signal by neutralizing antibodies suppressed EAE-relapse but not somatosensory activations, sympathetic activations, MHC class II+CD11b+ cell accumulation in the ventral vessels, or CD4+ T cell accumulation, suggesting that the inflammation amplifier activation by cytokines including IL-17 and IL-6 is a downstream event after sensory and sympathetic activation, MHC class II+CD11b+ cell accumulation in the ventral vessels, and pathogenic Th17 cell accumulation in the ventral vessels. These results clearly suggested there are the four-steps that occur sequentially and are critical for the development of pain-mediated EAE relapse in our EAE models. We described these matters in the sixth paragraph of the Discussion and a detailed methodology in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>.</p><p><italic>3) It would be useful to have some explanation of how pain perception in any anatomical locality leads, via the anterior cingulate cortex, to local epinephrine/norepinephrine-dependent induction of CX3CL1/CX3CR1 specifically in the L5 spinal cord, which cannot be mimicked by systemic epinephrine/norepinephrine</italic>.</p><p>We hypothesized pain-mediated sympathetic signaling acts via a high concentration of norepinephrine at the sympathetic neurovascular connection, but not through the systemic induction of hormones such as epinephrine and norepinephrine, which play a major role in the development of EAE relapse, because neither an accumulation of MHC class II+CD11b+ cells at L5 ventral vessels nor EAE relapse in remittent mice that had immobilization stress or forced swimming were observed, even though serum norepinephrine and epinephrine increased just like in the pain-induction condition, which did induce MHC class II+CD11b+ cell accumulation as well as EAE relapse. However, epinephrine and norepinephrine induced CX3CL1 expression dose-dependently in MHC class II+CD11b+ cells, which are also present in spleen and lymphonodes, and endothelial cells and fibroblasts induced various chemokines, including CCL20, after stimulation by epinephrine and norepinephrine, particularly in the presence of NFkB and STAT3 activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Arima et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Atsumi et al., 2014</xref>). Therefore, we hypothesized that systemic epinephrine/norepinephrine molecules induced a systemic pro-inflammatory state via chemokine expression. We described these matters in the eighth paragraph of the Discussion.</p><p><italic>4) Some explanation of how pain-induced epinephrine/norepinephrine leads to activation of a CX3CL1-CX3CR1 axis leading to inflammation, while soleus sensory input-induced epinephrine/norepinephrine leads to activation of an IL6-CCL20-CCR6 axis (Arima et al., Cell, 2012), both in L5, would be very helpful</italic>.</p><p>Regarding the induction of different chemokine-mediated axes by different sympathetic neurons (pain vs. anti-gravity), we should point out that we used different hosts in these two cases. We used normal mice for anti-gravity experiments, but EAE-recovered mice for pain-mediated ones. In other words, the numbers of MHC class II+CD11b+ cells are completely different: normal mice have almost no MHC class II+CD11b+ cells in the CNS, while EAE-recovered mice have many MHC class II+CD11b+ cells in the CNS particularly in the L5 cord. In EAE-recovered mice, a regional norepinephrine output via pain inductions functions on MHC class II+CD11b+ cells as well as endothelial cells around the ventral vessels of the spinal cords, causing the expression of CX3CL1 and accumulation of MHC class II+CD11b+CX3CR1+ cells in a manner dependent on the CX3CL1-CX3CR1 axis. These accumulated MHC class II+CD11b+CX3CR1+ cells present autoantigens to pathogenic Th17 cells located in the blood stream. On the other hand, in normal mice, a regional norepinephrine output via anti-gravity responses functions just on endothelial cells because of there are almost no MHC class II+CD11b+ cells in the CNS. This case results in CCL20 expression, which causes the accumulation pathogenic Th17 cells that express the CCR6 receptor, IL-17 and IL-6. We have described these matters in the Discussion.</p><p><italic>5) The caveat that clinically there does not seem to be a direct correlation between pain intensity and MS disability or lesional load should be noted, as also the lack of natural relapses in the C57BL/6 mouse strain</italic>.</p><p>As suggested, we note these matters in the revised text in Results:</p><p>“Consistent with these results, it is known that the lack of natural relapses in the C57BL/6 mouse strain”, and Discussion:</p><p>“Thus, there does not seem to be a direct correlation clinically between pain intensity and MS disability or lesional load.”</p></body></sub-article></article>
