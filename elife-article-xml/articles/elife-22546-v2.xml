<italic>Drosophila</italic> wing precursors. In this tissue, Dpp expressed along the anterior-posterior boundary forms a concentration gradient that controls the expression domains of target genes, which in turn specify the position of wing veins. Dpp also promotes growth in this tissue. The relationship between the spatio-temporal profile of Dpp signalling and growth has been the subject of debate, which has intensified recently with the suggestion that the stripe of Dpp is dispensable for growth. With two independent conditional alleles of <italic>dpp,</italic> we find that the stripe of Dpp is essential for wing growth. We then show that this requirement, but not patterning, can be fulfilled by uniform, low level, Dpp expression. Thus, the stripe of Dpp ensures that signalling remains above a pro-growth threshold, while at the same time generating a gradient that patterns cell fates.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.22546.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.22546.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.22546.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>From the wings of a butterfly to the fingers of a human hand, living tissues often have complex and intricate patterns. Developmental biologists have long been fascinated by the signals – called morphogens – that guide how these kinds of pattern develop. Morphogens are substances that are produced by groups of cells and spread to the rest of the tissue to form a gradient. Depending on where they sit along this gradient, cells in the tissue activate different sets of genes, and the resulting pattern of gene activity ultimately defines the position of the different parts of the tissue.</p><p>Decades worth of studies into how limbs develop in animals from mice to fruit flies have revealed common principles of morphogen gradients that regulate the development of tissue patterns. Morphogens have been shown to help regulate the growth of tissues in a number of different animals as well. However, how the morphogens regulate tissue size and what role their gradients play in this process remain topics of intense debate in the field of developmental biology.</p><p>In the developing wing of a fruit fly, a morphogen called Dpp is expressed in a thin stripe located in the centre and spreads to the rest of the tissue to form a gradient. Bosch, Ziukaite, Alexandre et al. have now characterised where and when the Dpp morphogen must be produced to regulate both the final size of the fly’s wing and the number of cells the wing eventually contains. The experiments involved preventing the production of Dpp in the developing wing in specific cells and at specific stages of development. This approach confirmed that Dpp must be produced in the central stripe for the wing to grow. Matsuda and Affolter and, independently, Barrio and Milán report the same findings in two related studies. Moreover, Bosch et al. and Barrio and Milán also conclude that the gradient of Dpp throughout the wing is not required for growth.</p><p>Further work will be needed to explain how the Dpp signal regulates the growth of the wing. The answer to this question will contribute to a better understanding of the role of morphogens in regulating the size of human organs and how a failure to do so might cause developmental disorders.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.22546.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.22546.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>morphogen</kwd><kwd>growth</kwd><kwd>BMP</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd><italic>D. melanogaster</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000265</institution-id><institution>Medical Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>FC001204</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Vincent</surname><given-names>Jean-Paul</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000781</institution-id><institution>European Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>WNTEXPORT 294523</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Vincent</surname><given-names>Jean-Paul</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001711</institution-id><institution>Schweizerischer Nationalfonds zur Förderung der Wissenschaftlichen Forschung</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Basler</surname><given-names>Konrad</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100010269</institution-id><institution>Wellcome</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>PhD Studentship 105382/Z/14/Z</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ziukaite</surname><given-names>Ruta</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100010269</institution-id><institution>Wellcome</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>FC001204</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Vincent</surname><given-names>Jean-Paul</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000289</institution-id><institution>Cancer Research UK</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>FC001204</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Vincent</surname><given-names>Jean-Paul</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Striped expression of Dpp in <italic>Drosophila</italic> wing precursors leads to graded signalling activity that positions wing veins and, in parallel, promotes growth in a gradient-independent manner by supplying signalling activity above a threshold.</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>eLife Digest</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>During development, tissue growth must be precisely coupled with patterning to ensure that the right number of cells can contribute to the various substructures within each organ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Restrepo et al., 2014</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Baena-Lopez et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bryant and Gardiner, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Hariharan, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Irvine and Harvey, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Johnston and Gallant, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Wartlick et al., 2011a</xref>).

This has been particularly well demonstrated in <italic>Drosophila</italic> wing imaginal discs, epithelial pockets that grow during larval stages and eventually give rise to the wing proper, the wing hinge and a part of the thorax called the notum (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Segregation of wing imaginal discs into the territories that give rise to these three structures is controlled by a series of signalling events involving EGFR, JAK/STAT, Notch, and Hedgehog signalling, culminating in sustained expression of Wingless and Dpp in orthogonal stripes until the end of the third instar (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Blackman et al., 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Neumann and Cohen, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Zecca et al., 1995</xref>). Both Wingless and Dpp are essential for growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Baena-Lopez et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Burke and Basler, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Restrepo et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Spencer et al., 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Wartlick et al., 2011b</xref>). Here, we focus on the role of Dpp, which is expressed along the anterior-posterior (A/P) compartment boundary in a pattern that cuts across the prospective notum, hinge and wing proper (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). We look specifically at the prospective wing, which forms from a central region of the disc called the pouch. A wide range of evidence suggests that, in this region, Dpp acts as a morphogen. Graded distribution of the endogenous protein has not been directly visualized for lack of a suitable antibody against the mature secreted protein. However, the nested pattern of expression of target genes and the patterning activity of ectopic Dpp are strongly indicative of graded signalling activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Lecuit et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Nellen et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Schwank and Basler, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Zecca et al., 1995</xref>) which is high around the A/P boundary, low further away, and undetectable at the lateral edges of the disc. High signalling activity, within and around the stripe of Dpp expression, is marked by immunoreactivity against phosphorylated Mad (P-Mad) and the expression of <italic>spalt-major</italic> (<italic>salm</italic>) while low signalling activity suffices to activate <italic>optomotor blind</italic> (<italic>omb</italic>) expression over a wider area of the prospective wing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Burke and Basler, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Lecuit et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Nellen et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Tanimoto et al., 2000</xref>). In wing imaginal discs, Dpp signalling controls gene expression indirectly, through repression of a transcriptional repressor encoded by the <italic>brinker</italic> gene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Martín et al., 2004</xref>). Thus, the inverse gradient of Brinker expression provides yet another means of detecting Dpp signaling activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Schwank et al., 2008</xref>).<fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.22546.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Growth of the prospective wing requires Dpp expression within the pouch.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Diagram highlighting the three domains of wing imaginal discs and the stripe of Dpp expression.

For example, graded Dpp signalling determines the position of wing veins, particularly veins 2 and 5, through regulation of <italic>salm</italic> and <italic>omb</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Campbell and Tomlinson, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Jaźwińska et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Minami et al., 1999</xref>). Dpp also clearly contributes to growth. Indeed, in the absence of Dpp signalling, wings (and other appendages) fail to grow (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bangi and Wharton, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Restrepo et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Spencer et al., 1982</xref>). The pro-growth role of Dpp is in part mediated through regulation of Myc (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Doumpas et al., 2013</xref>), although a comprehensive understanding of growth regulation by Dpp signalling remains lacking. In wild-type imaginal discs, proliferation is approximately uniform while Dpp signalling is graded. Therefore, there is no apparent correlation between the level of Dpp signalling and the growth rate. How does a graded signal trigger a uniform response? Experiments involving the creation of abrupt differences in signalling suggested that local differences in Dpp signalling activity, that is, the spatial gradient of signalling, could be the trigger of growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Rogulja and Irvine, 2005</xref>). This would provide an elegant mechanism for growth termination as the gradient would be expected to become shallower during growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Day and Lawrence, 2000</xref>). However, there is no evidence that smooth differences in signalling activity associated with the endogenous gradient control growth. An alternative model is that the temporal gradient (the local relative increase in signalling activity) could be the trigger of proliferation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Wartlick et al., 2011b</xref>), a model that has also been questioned (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Harmansa et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Schwank et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>In agreement with the notion that Dpp controls growth through repression of <italic>brinker</italic>, imaginal discs lacking both Dpp and Brinker proliferate extensively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Martín et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Schwank et al., 2008</xref>). Importantly, only the lateral region of the pouch (as well as the prospective hinge) overproliferates, while the medial area proliferate normally. Thus, depending on the distance from the stripe of Dpp, the cells of the pouch have a different propensity to proliferate. The main role of the Dpp/Brinker system would be to equalize this difference (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Schwank et al., 2008</xref>). Thus, the inherent tendency of lateral cells to proliferate is slowed down by Brinker, while in medial cells Dpp emanating from its central stripe prevents Brinker-mediated suppression of growth.</p><p>Despite strong evidence in support of the above model, Akiyama and Gibson recently suggested that the central stripe of Dpp expression is dispensable for wing growth, and that the prospective pouch requires a source of Dpp in the anterior compartment to achieve growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Akiyama and Gibson, 2015</xref>). To control Dpp activity, these authors created a conditional <italic>dpp</italic> allele (here referred to as <italic>dpp<sup>FRT-TA</sup></italic>) by deleting an essential exon and replacing it with a rescuing fragment flanked by Flp Recombination Targets (FRTs). They found that inactivation of this allele at the A/P compartmental boundary in the center of the medial region, had no adverse effect on growth. Inactivation was deemed effective within the pouch because no immunoreactivity against pro-Dpp was detectable there. This led the authors to conclude that the central stripe of Dpp, from where the Dpp gradient originates, is not required for growth. To account for the continued growth observed in the absence of the Dpp stripe, they suggest that perhaps low level Dpp originating from the anterior compartment could suffice to promote growth in the pouch. Here we show, with two new validated conditional alleles, that deletion of the central stripe of Dpp is deleterious to growth. We then investigate and compare the requirements of Dpp within the pouch for growth versus patterning.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Wing growth requires Dpp expression in the prospective wing</title><p>To generate means of reliably controlling Dpp activity, we devised two conditional <italic>dpp</italic> alleles, <italic>dpp<sup>FRT-CA</sup></italic> and <italic>dpp<sup>FRT-PSB</sup></italic>, that can be inactivated by Flp (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). In both cases, hemaglutinin (HA) tags were included to enable detection of endogenously produced mature Dpp. Flp was then expressed in various patterns to trigger excision of the essential exon. First, Dpp production was inactivated throughout the prospective wing either with <italic>rotund-gal4</italic> and <italic>UAS-Flp</italic> in homozygous <italic>dpp<sup>FRT-CA</sup></italic> or with <italic>nubbin</italic>-Gal4 and <italic>UAS-Flp</italic> in homozygous <italic>dpp<sup>FRT-PSB</sup></italic>. No HA immunoreactivity (HA-Dpp) could be detected in the pouch from 96 hr after egg laying (AEL) onward (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>), indicating efficient gene inactivation. HA (i.e. Dpp) was still detectable in the prospective hinge and notum, as expected since Gal4 activity was mostly confined to the pouch. Immunostaining with anti-Brinker showed that <italic>brinker</italic> expression was derepressed throughout the pouch (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C–F</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>), confirming that Dpp signalling was eliminated there. Note that the down-regulation of Brinker around residual Dpp expression in the hinge did not extend into the pouch (arrowhead in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1D</xref>), suggesting that Dpp produced in the hinge has little effect on gene expression in the pouch. In both experiments, growth was markedly impaired, an effect that was quantified for <italic>dpp<sup>FRT-CA</sup></italic> by marking the edge of the pouch with anti-Homothorax (anti-Hth) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Azpiazu and Morata, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Casares and Mann, 2000</xref>) and measuring the enclosed area at 96 and 120 hr AEL (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G–H</xref>). The pouch of experimental discs (<italic>dpp<sup>FRT-CA</sup>; rotund-Gal4, UAS-Flp</italic>) was significantly smaller than that of their wild-type siblings at equivalent stages. It was, however, not completely eradicated, perhaps because of delayed <italic>dpp</italic> inactivation or residual BMP signalling by <italic>glass bottom boat</italic> (<italic>gbb</italic>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Ray and Wharton, 2001</xref>). Since the <italic>dpp<sup>FRT-CA</sup>; rotund-Gal4, UAS-Flp</italic> genotype is viable, the growth deficiency was also readily apparent in the adults that emerged (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1I,J</xref>). These results confirm that production of mature Dpp within the pouch is required for this tissue to grow and that Dpp originating from outside the pouch does not compensate.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Temporal requirement of dpp for wing growth</title><p>To assess whether Dpp is continuously required for wing growth, we first inactivated <italic>dpp<sup>FRT-PSB</sup></italic> at different times by Flp expressed from a <italic>hsp70-Flp</italic> transgene. Larvae were heat shocked at 48, 72 and 96 hr AEL and wing imaginal discs were fixed at 120 hr AEL. Staining with anti-HA confirmed the efficiency of gene inactivation although occasional spots of residual HA-Dpp expressing cells could be detected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). Inactivation of <italic>dpp</italic> at 48 and 72 hr AEL resulted in widespread derepression of <italic>brinker</italic>, confirming the impairment in Dpp signalling. Heat shocking at 48 and 72 hr AEL resulted in markedly reduced growth, while later excision (96 hr AEL) had a milder effect. The relatively weak impact of heat shocks at 96 hr could be due to perdurance of Dpp or downstream events. Alternatively, any effect on growth might be hard to detect beyond this time because the growth rate of imaginal discs decreases with age (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Johnston and Sanders, 2003</xref>). We conclude that the results of timed inactivation experiments show that Dpp must be continuously produced at least up to 96 hr, perhaps beyond, for the prospective wing to grow.<fig id="fig2" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.22546.006</object-id><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Temporal requirement of Dpp for growth.</title><p>(<bold>A–D</bold>) Imaginal discs at 120 hr AEL following inactivation of <italic>dpp<sup>FRT-PSB</sup></italic> by induction of <italic>hsp70-Flp</italic> at the indicated times.

In this region, the major expression domain of Dpp is in a stripe along the A/P boundary (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Masucci et al., 1990</xref>). It is therefore expected that, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>, inactivation of Dpp specifically in this stripe would eradicate Dpp expression in the pouch and lead to growth impairment. Surprisingly, inactivation of <italic>dpp<sup>FRT-TA</sup></italic> with Flp expressed under the control of <italic>dpp-Gal4</italic> (<italic>dpp<sup>FRT-TA</sup> dpp<sup>BLK</sup>-Gal4 UAS-Flp</italic>) was reported to have no adverse effect on growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Akiyama and Gibson, 2015</xref>). In this genetic background, expression of <italic>salm</italic> and <italic>omb</italic> was disrupted, indicating that Dpp production was indeed impaired. It was therefore suggested that the stripe of Dpp expression may not be needed for growth because of the existence of another source of Dpp outside the stripe (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Akiyama and Gibson, 2015</xref>). Indeed, long-term lineage tracing by G-TRACE suggests that progenitors of cells located anterior to the stripe could express Dpp (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Evans et al., 2009</xref>), at least at some point during development. To gain further information on the pattern of <italic>dpp</italic> expression in the wing pouch, we created a reporter line (<italic>dpp<sup>FRT-REP</sup></italic>) expressing the readily detectable marker CD8-GFP from the endogenous <italic>dpp</italic> locus. An excisable cassette expressing Dpp was included upstream of the CD8-GFP coding sequences (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1A</xref>) to allow expression of functional Dpp during embryogenesis, which requires two functional alleles. Thus, during embryogenesis, CD8-GFP is not expressed and the two alleles produce wild-type Dpp. Only after expression of Flp does this allele act as a reporter, in the domain of Flp expression. Cassette excision was induced after embryogenesis with <italic>rotund-Gal4</italic> and <italic>UAS</italic>-Flp, making CD8-GFP a reporter of <italic>dpp</italic> transcription in the pouch. At 72, 96 and 120 hr AEL, GFP was only detectable along the A/P boundary (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1B–D</xref>). Thus, anterior to the stripe, the activity of the <italic>dpp</italic> promoter must either be very low or take place before 72 hr AEL. Therefore, it is unlikely to promote growth, at least after this time period. This conclusion spurred us to re-assess the role of the Dpp stripe in growth.<fig-group><fig id="fig3" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.22546.008</object-id><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>Growth of the prospective wing requires the endogenous stripe of Dpp expression.</title><p>(<bold>A–F</bold>) Inactivation of <italic>dpp<sup>FRT-CA</sup></italic> in the normal domain of Dpp expression (with <italic>dpp<sup>BLK</sup>-Gal4 UAS-Flp</italic>) leads to depression of <italic>brinker</italic> and reduced growth (shown here in discs fixed at 96 and 120 hr AEL).

To enable comparison with the results of Akiyama and Gibson (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Akiyama and Gibson, 2015</xref>), we chose the same <italic>dpp<sup>BLK</sup>-Gal4</italic> transgene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Staehling-Hampton et al., 1995</xref>). This strain was generated many years ago and kept separately in our respective laboratories. We therefore characterised the different <italic>dpp<sup>BLK</sup>-Gal4</italic> lines by splinkerette PCR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Potter and Luo, 2010</xref>). Although the three stocks displayed sequence polymorphisms, they all carried the <italic>dpp<sup>BLK</sup>-Gal4</italic> transgene at the same location, confirming that they all originated from the same initial stock and could be used interchangeably (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>). The <italic>dpp<sup>BLK</sup>-Gal4 UAS-Flp</italic> combination was introduced in <italic>dpp<sup>FRT-CA</sup></italic> and <italic>dpp<sup>FRT-PSB</sup></italic> homozygotes to inactivate <italic>dpp</italic> within the stripe. In both cases, efficiency of excision was assessed by staining imaginal discs with anti-HA, which marks functional, mature Dpp in the unexcised alleles. At 96 hr AEL, HA immunoreactivity was eliminated from the whole disc, except in a previously characterised zone located outside of the pouch, in the posterior prospective hinge (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Foronda et al., 2009</xref>) (arrowhead in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B,D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3C,D</xref>). Such residual expression is reproducible and likely represents an area where <italic>dpp<sup>BLK</sup>-Gal4</italic> does not recapitulate the endogenous Dpp expression domain, as noted previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Akiyama and Gibson, 2015</xref>). However, in the rest of the disc, including the whole pouch, the <italic>dpp<sup>BLK</sup>-Gal4 UAS-Flp</italic> combination appeared to trigger efficient recombination and hence inactivation of <italic>dpp</italic>. Importantly, this was associated with derepression of <italic>brinker</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B,D</xref>) and a marked reduction (84%) of pouch size at the end of the growth period (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3G</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3E</xref>).</p><p>The lack of growth noted above is in contrast with the report that <italic>dpp<sup>FRT-TA</sup> dpp<sup>BLK</sup>-Gal4 UAS-Flp</italic> imaginal discs attain a normal size and express Brinker throughout the pouch at 120 hr AEL (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Akiyama and Gibson, 2015</xref>). This is in stark contradiction with the model that Dpp stimulates growth through repression of Brinker and that Brinker expression in the pouch is incompatible with growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Schwank et al., 2008</xref>). To investigate this apparent inconsistency, we re-examined <italic>dpp<sup>FRT-TA</sup> dpp<sup>BLK</sup>-Gal4 UAS-Flp</italic> imaginal discs, not only at 120 hr AEL but also at earlier stages. We confirmed that the discs attain a normal size and express Brinker at 120 hr AEL (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3J</xref>). However, at 90 and 96 hr AEL, during the growth phase, Brinker was repressed within the pouch (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3H,I</xref>), a clear indication that Dpp signalling is still active at these stages. We suggest that, in this genotype, Dpp signalling is eradicated but only after most growth has taken place. These results suggest that the TA allele may not be as readily inactivated by <italic>dpp<sup>BLK</sup>-Gal4 UAS-Flp</italic> as the PSB and CA alleles.</p><p>The efficacy of gene inactivation was assessed for all three alleles by expressing Flp from a <italic>hs-Flp</italic> transgene under identical heat-shock conditions and measuring <italic>brinker</italic> expression by qRT-PCR. The results show that <italic>brinker</italic> expression was derepressed in all cases but less so with <italic>dpp<sup>FRT-TA</sup></italic> than with <italic>dpp<sup>FRT-PSB</sup></italic> and <italic>dpp<sup>FRT-CA</sup></italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). These results indicate that <italic>dpp<sup>FRT-TA</sup></italic> is less readily excised than the other two alleles. Allele ‘excisability’ was also assessed functionally by measuring imaginal disc size following heat-shock-induced expression of Flp at different times (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B–K</xref>). Growth was impaired in a more pronounced manner with <italic>dpp<sup>FRT-PSB</sup></italic> and <italic>dpp<sup>FRT-CA</sup></italic> than with <italic>dpp<sup>FRT-TA</sup></italic>, especially with a heat shock at 72 hr AEL, a time when inactivation of Dpp signalling has a strong effect on growth (see quantification in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4K</xref>). Therefore, molecular and functional assays suggest that the <italic>dpp<sup>FRT-TA</sup></italic> allele may not be as readily inactivated as our alleles, perhaps because of differences of sequence context around the FRT sites. We note that one of the FRTs of <italic>dpp<sup>FRT-TA</sup></italic> is flanked by a LoxP site, which could conceivably impair recombination. In any case, our results show that precluding striped expression of Dpp along the A/P boundary does interfere with wing growth.<fig id="fig4" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.22546.013</object-id><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><title>Inactivation efficiency for three conditional alleles of <italic>dpp</italic>.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Efficiency of inactivation for <italic>dpp<sup>FRT-PSB</sup></italic>, <italic>dpp<sup>FRT-CA</sup></italic> and <italic>dpp<sup>FRT-TA</sup></italic> by Flp expressed from <italic>hsp70-Flp</italic> induced at 102 hr AEL.

The <italic>rotund-Gal4</italic> and <italic>UAS-Flp</italic> combination was used to simultaneously excise the FRT cassettes of <italic>dpp<sup>FRT-CA</sup></italic> and <italic>Tubα1-FRT-f<sup>+</sup>-FRT-dpp</italic>, a transgene previously shown to trigger intermediate signalling activity, sufficient to activate <italic>omb</italic> but not <italic>salm</italic> expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Zecca et al., 1995</xref>). As expected, in the resulting ‘rescued’ discs, Omb was expressed uniformly, although at a reduced level and Brinker was repressed. (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A–D</xref>). However, pMad immunoreactivity was at the low level normally seen in the lateral region (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E,F</xref>), suggesting that the level of signalling achieved by <italic>Tubα1-dpp</italic> is similar to that present far from the normal stripe of Dpp. About half the discs of this genotype reached an approximately normal size at the end of the third instar while the other half overgrew slightly (as is the case for the disc shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>). Sustained growth was confirmed by assessing proliferation rates with anti-pH3 staining of discs dissected from late larvae crawling in the food. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5I–L</xref>, ‘rescued’ and wild-type discs proliferated at approximately the same rate while discs lacking <italic>dpp</italic> proliferated at a lower rate in the pouch area.

The five longitudinal veins are distinctly specified by various signalling pathways (reviewed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Blair, 2007</xref>]). Most relevant for this paper, the positioning of veins 2 and 5 is dependent on Dpp signalling. Prospective veins can be recognised in late imaginal discs as zones of <italic>DSRF</italic> (<italic>Drosophila</italic> serum response factor) repression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Montagne et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Nussbaumer et al., 2000</xref>). Staining with anti-DSRF showed that the prospective vein pattern was markedly disrupted in ‘rescued’ discs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5G,H</xref>), with only two zones of repressed <italic>DSRF</italic> remaining, one around the D/V boundary, where vein 1 normally forms under the control of Wingless (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Couso et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Rulifson and Blair, 1995</xref>), and one around pro-veins 3 and 4, which are specified by Hedgehog in the wild type (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Blair, 2007</xref>). The areas of DSRF repression corresponding to veins 2 and 5 were conspicuously missing. Because some of the ‘rescued’ larvae survived to adulthood, we were able to further assess, in adult wings, the extent of growth and patterning that uniform Dpp promotes. A majority of these wings appeared to be made entirely of crumpled vein material (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5O</xref>), which made it difficult to assess size. This phenotype can be explained by the vein-specifying role of Dpp in pupal wings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Sotillos and de Celis, 2006</xref>). Nevertheless, a minority of ‘rescued wings’ were remarkably well formed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5N</xref>), perhaps because they experienced lower Dpp signalling at the pupal stage, below the threshold for vein specification. In these wings, vein patterning was disrupted, but reproducibly so, with a broad swath of vein tissue forming near the A/P boundary. Crucially, these wings reached a remarkably large size (compare <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5M and N</xref>). This result suggests that uniform, low level Dpp signalling promotes near-normal growth although this is not adequate for patterning.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Dpp behaves as a classic morphogen in wing imaginal discs of <italic>Drosophila</italic>. It is produced from a stripe of cells along the A/P boundary and spreads from there to activate the nested expression of target genes, which in turn position longitudinal veins. In addition to providing patterning information in the prospective wing, Dpp also promotes growth via repression of <italic>brinker</italic>. How graded Dpp signalling leads to homogenous proliferation has been the subject of discussion but until recently, there has been general agreement that the stripe of Dpp is required for growth. This basic tenet was recently challenged with a conditional <italic>dpp</italic> allele that can be inactivated in time and space by Flp (here referred to as <italic>dpp<sup>FRT-TA</sup></italic>). Inactivation in the normal domain of Dpp expression, with Flp driven by a disc-specific <italic>dpp</italic> regulatory element, was reported to have minimal impact on growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Akiyama and Gibson, 2015</xref>). The authors suggested that Dpp expressed from a source in the anterior half of the pouch could suffice to sustain growth. Consistent with this suggestion, inactivation of <italic>dpp</italic> throughout the pouch with <italic>nubbin-Gal4 UAS-flp</italic> led to strong growth reduction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Akiyama and Gibson, 2015</xref>), an observation that we confirmed with our conditional alleles (<italic>dpp<sup>FRT-CA</sup></italic> and <italic>dpp<sup>FRT-PSB</sup></italic>) and two pouch-specific sources of Flp. However, inactivation of our alleles with <italic>dpp<sup>BLK</sup>-Gal4 UAS-Flp</italic> (the same source of Flp used by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Akiyama and Gibson, 2015</xref>) led to a severe impairment in growth (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3</xref>), in contrast to the finding with <italic>dpp<sup>FRT-TA</sup></italic>. Our analysis of <italic>brinker</italic> expression during the growth period in the various mutant backgrounds allows us to reconcile the apparent discrepancy between our data and those of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Akiyama and Gibson (2015)</xref>. We suggest that our alleles (<italic>dpp<sup>FRT-CA</sup></italic> and <italic>dpp<sup>FRT-PSB</sup></italic>) are more readily inactivated than the one generated by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Akiyama and Gibson (2015)</xref> (<italic>dpp<sup>FRT-TA</sup></italic>). Thus, in the <italic>dpp<sup>FRT-TA</sup>; dpp-Gal4 UAS-Flp</italic> genotype, cells expressing Dpp within the stripe would linger long enough to provide sufficient signalling activity for <italic>brinker</italic> repression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3H,I</xref>) and hence growth. As time goes on, these lingering cells would progressively undergo excision so that at the end of third instar, no signalling would remain, explaining the widespread derepression of <italic>brinker</italic> seen at the late 120 hr AEL stage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Akiyama and Gibson, 2015</xref>). Since, with our conditional allele, inactivation of Dpp in the endogenous stripe leads to growth impairment, we conclude that, during normal development, this source of Dpp is needed for growth, although as discussed below, this can be overcome with low-level exogenously expressed Dpp.</p><p>How does the Dpp gradient emanating from the Dpp stripe promote growth? Our finding that uniformly expressed Dpp is sufficient for growth suggests that a spatial gradient of signalling is not required. Moreover, the <italic>tubulin</italic> promoter, which was used to drive uniform expression, is expected to be constant over time. Therefore, our result could be taken as evidence against the model that growth depends on continuously rising signalling activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Wartlick et al., 2011b</xref>), although it could be argued that even under a condition of uniform expression, signalling could rise if Dpp became more stable over time. Nevertheless, we prefer the simple model whereby, in the prospective wing, Dpp signalling over a threshold would be permissive for growth. The level of this threshold is still to be precisely measured. In the experiment illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>, growth rescue by uniform Dpp in the pouch correlates with repression of <italic>brinker</italic>, consistent with the growth equalization model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Schwank et al., 2008</xref>). Although Akiyama and Gibson showed that <italic>dpp<sup>FRT-TA</sup> dpp<sup>BLK</sup>-Gal4 UAS-Flp</italic> discs express <italic>brinker</italic> uniformly at 120 hr AEL (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Akiyama and Gibson, 2015</xref>), as we have shown (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3H,I</xref>), <italic>brinker</italic> only becomes derepressed in this genotype after growth has occurred. The observations that Dpp expression from the <italic>Tubα1-dpp</italic> transgene (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>) or residual Dpp from a few cells within the stripe (as we propose is occurring in the <italic>dpp<sup>FRT-TA</sup> dpp<sup>BLK</sup>-Gal4 UAS-Flp</italic> background), stimulate growth suggest that relatively low level signalling suffices for growth throughout the pouch (i.e. the prospective wing). As we have shown, this level of signalling is below that needed to produce substantial pMad immunoreactivity but higher than that needed to repress <italic>brinker</italic>. Better tools to tune the level of Dpp signalling will be needed to assess the relationship between signalling activity and growth at all stages.</p><p>Our results have significantly clarified the spatial requirement of Dpp. As we have shown, Dpp must originate from the pouch for this tissue to grow: in several experimental conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B,D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C–F</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3C–D</xref>), Dpp produced outside the pouch could not overcome the absence of Dpp within the pouch. We cannot discriminate at this point whether the boundary between these tissues acts as a barrier to the spread of Dpp or whether these sources of Dpp are too weak to have an impact in the pouch. In any case, these observations confirm our assertion that growth is normally sustained by Dpp produced at the A/P boundary. Dpp signalling above a relatively low threshold is permissive for growth within the pouch throughout wing development. For this activity, the signalling gradient is irrelevant. By contrast, the signalling gradient is essential for patterning as it specifies the domains of <italic>salm</italic> and <italic>omb</italic> expression and thus the positions of veins. Thus, the dual role of Dpp in growth and patterning requires that it is expressed in a stripe. Late inactivation of Dpp impairs patterning, suggesting that the gradient information could be read at the end of the growth period. It remains to be determined how the two processes - growth and patterning - are coordinated to ensure the reproducible formation of the adult wing.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Drosophila strains</title><p>Two conditional <italic>dpp</italic> alleles, illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>, were created for this study.

Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and K VijayRaghavan as the Senior Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>A contentious item that continues to raise interest concerns the relationship between the gradient of the BMP4-like signaling protein Dpp produced in <italic>Drosophila</italic> wing discs and cell proliferation in the disc. Dpp is both necessary and sufficient for disc growth, and the problem basically boils down to why regions with different levels of Dpp and BMP signaling do not cause different amounts of growth. Evidence and arguments on this point remain of high current interest.</p><p>The present manuscript is a partial rebuttal to the 2015 Nature paper from Akiyama and Gibson, which used various types of <italic>dpp</italic> loss-of-function clones to argue that the BMP Dpp produced by the stripe of cells anterior to the A/P boundary in wing discs was not necessary for the growth of the disc. This argued that models based on reading a gradient of Dpp were likely wrong, and that levels could be greatly reduced without greatly affecting growth, and thus models based on a temporal gradient of increasing BMP signaling were probably wrong as well. Nonetheless, that study showed that the Dpp produced by the entire anterior compartment was necessary for growth, at least up until 36 hours before wandering third instar, presumably this was supplied by low-level Dpp produced outside the normal stripe of high level Dpp expression.</p><p>The present manuscript argue<italic>s</italic> that stripe Dpp is necessary for growth, using the same conditional <italic>dpp-gal4</italic> used by Akiyama to limit Dpp loss to the stripe, but different conditional <italic>dpp</italic> alleles that the authors suspect are more sensitive to recombinase. Thus, they argue that Akiyama got the wrong result because they did not remove <italic>dpp</italic> from the entire stripe at early enough stages. They also add some nice data that growth can be rescued by moderate levels of uniformly-expressed Dpp, which argues that a gradient it not needed for growth, even in the pouch where an endogenous gradient is found.</p><p>The authors have intelligently designed a conditional knock-out allele of Dpp wherein the FRT sites flank the final exon of Dpp and HA tag is inserted in the mature Dpp sequence to specifically label only mature Dpp. Upon expressing Flp using pouch specific GAL4s like rotund and nubbin, they observe that loss of Dpp in the pouch affects growth and that Dpp is continuously required throughout development. Unlike the results observed by Akiyama and Gibson, 2015, upon expressing FLP using the same <italic>dpp-GAL4</italic> driver, they indeed observe loss of Dpp and defects in growth. They show that the transgene generated by the Gibson group (dppTA) is not as efficiently excisable as an alternative transgene that they generate themselves (dppCA). They see a growth defect when this transgene is excised from the stripe at the same time as <italic>brinker</italic> is over expressed post-excision. The likely explanation is a positional effect of the FRT inserts and thus resulting in varying degrees of activity of FLP. This hypothesis has also been tested by expressing FLP using hs-FLP individually for the two conditional knockdowns and measuring the effect on phenotype (i.e. reduction in pouch size), consistent with Dpp emanating from the compartmental boundary is essential for growth. They provide important evidence using the Gal80/Gal4 system in the tub-driven <italic>dpp</italic> transgene in the back ground of the excised dppCA, that uniform tubulin promoter driven <italic>dpp</italic> is sufficient to promote growth, and repress <italic>brinker</italic>, but not to support patterning. Upon eliminating the endogenous stripe pattern of Dpp and introducing uniform low level expression of Dpp using <italic>Tubα1/FRT/f+/FRT/dpp</italic> transgene (Zecca et al., 1995) the authors provide evidence against a requirement of Dpp gradient for growth.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p><italic>Reviewer 1:</italic></p><p>1) One difficulty is that Akiyama show that their <italic>dpp-gal4</italic> technique removes most or all stripe Dpp from the dorsal wing pouch and hinge, and also greatly reduces pMad there, as early as 72 hours AEL (their <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). Nonetheless, the dorsal pouch reaches a pretty normal-looking size by late third (although they did not measure pouch size alone, so it is possible there was a slight defect). If this is correct, then loss of the gradient and stripe do not affect growth from 72 hours on.</p><p>Either the authors need to disprove this, or they have to incorporate it into their Discussion. Does the Akiyama allele version of the experiment lead to loss of Dpp and the pMad gradient in parts of the disc at 72 hours, and is growth in those regions affected or unaffected?</p><p>If Akiyama is correct, this should be mentioned. One possible explanation is that the authors might investigate is that the early pMad loss was not enough to increase <italic>brinker</italic> expression at early time points, as Akiyama only examined <italic>brinker</italic> at late third. Since the authors have Akiyama's allele, could they look? My thinking here is that the different results might not be due to whether stripe Dpp is lost, per se, but how much residual Dpp signaling is left from Dpp elsewhere in the disc, and whether that residual signaling is enough to suppress <italic>brinker</italic> expression during the growth phase.</p><p>2) If dppCA works because it is more efficient, an important question is whether that removes stripe <italic>dpp</italic> at an earlier stage that dppTA, or whether it removes <italic>dpp</italic> over a broader region of the wing pouch. The authors seem to be suggesting the former, but the second raises the possibility that dppCA works because it is removing low-level Dpp from the far anterior of the wing disc. Both studies agree that widespread removal of Dpp reduces growth. <italic>dpp-gal4</italic> appears to have residual expression that can extend well into the anterior of at least the dorsal wing pouch (see the Evans G-TRACE paper, for instance). Unfortunately, none of the alleles have a way of checking where excision occurred, and comparison with some other FLPout construct would just lead to guesswork about which was more sensitive to FLPase. This is, for me, a critical question, and I have to hear some cogent counterargument to accept the authors' interpretation.</p><p>3) &quot;This was confirmed by comparing side-by-side the impact of Flp expressed from a hsp70-flp transgene on dppFRT-TA and dppFRT-PSB&quot;. Since the <italic>dpp</italic> stripe experiment was done with dppCA, the critical issue is whether CA is more efficiently excised than TA. So why are the authors comparing TA with PSB? Do they also have the <italic>dpp-gal4</italic> data with PSB?</p><p>4) The graph in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref> shows only a slight reduction PH3 after growth rescue compared with wild type, and the claim is that this shows rescue. But for this to be meaningful, there has to be a comparison with un-rescued, and data showing that PH3 is lower in un-rescued. That would also make a cleaner statistical comparison. Not significant is not the same as saying the numbers are the same, and cannot rule out a type II error, without a calculation of statistical power.</p><p><italic>Reviewer 2:</italic></p><p>1) Source of Dpp: As shown in Evan et al., 2009 using GTRACE, the cell lineage of <italic>dpp</italic> GAL4 not only marks the cells along the A/P boundary but also marks a portion of the anterior compartment. Although the results clearly demonstrate a that FLP under <italic>dpp</italic> GAL4 results in loss of mature form of <italic>dpp</italic> in the wing pouch and thus affects growth, the results do not rule out that a role for Dpp emanating from the compartmental boundary may also be necessary for growth.</p><p>2) Levels of Dpp: Although, using <italic>Tubα1/FRT/f+/FRT/dpp</italic> transgene (Zecca et al., 1995), the authors look at downstream effects of Dpp, it would be informative to know the levels and pattern of expression of Dpp in rescue and control discs. It would be useful to address when the de-repression of <italic>brinker</italic> in the context of the removal of dppTA takes place, compared to that when dppCA is excised. This will completely explain the discrepancy between the results obtained by the authors, here and the results of Akiyama and Gibson.</p><p>3) Anterior Dpp/Posterior Dpp: The above system could be used in conjunction with hhGAL4 or ciGAL4 driven FLP to remove endogenous Dpp within a compartment while still expressing uniform low levels of Dpp in the same compartment and verifying if growth/patterning is perturbed (related to Extended Data 6 of Akhiyama &amp; Gibson et al., 2015). This will lay to rest an interesting proposition and provide a cautionary tale of (over) interpretation of the power of <italic>Drosophila</italic> genetic jugglery.</p><p><italic>Reviewer 3:</italic> </p><p>1) At the beginning of results, it would be helpful for the reader to explain better the difference between the CA and PSB alleles (which remains a bit mysterious). Is the same cassette simply integrated in two different locations?</p><p>2) In the subsection “Temporal requirement of Dpp for wing growth” the authors note the local repression of <italic>brinker</italic> around the residual spots of Dpp expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>', B'), however it is difficult to see this as currently displayed. It would be helpful to show the Brk channel alone.</p><p>3) In the subsection “Wing growth requires the endogenous stripe of Dpp expression” the authors conclude &quot;Our findings so far indicate that Dpp must be produced in the pouch (prospective wing) during the 48-96h AEL period in order for the wing to grow.&quot; The fact that heat shock at 96h also gives reduced wing disc area (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>) means that <italic>dpp</italic> is required for growth also after 96h at least for some time (although admittedly for how long post 96h AEL is not clear). But perhaps this conclusion could be rephrased slightly more strongly. (Since the cell cycle is roughly 12 hours at this point in development, and the reduction in size is almost 50%, does this imply Dpp is required for growth for at least another 12 hours – i.e. up to 108h AEL?)</p><p>4) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3H-N</xref> simply shows in a different way that the effect of the PSB allele on growth is stronger than the effect of the TA allele, but it does not show it is due to &quot;allele excisability”, or that it is more readily inactivated. This could be done, for instance, by performing Q-RT-PCR for Dpp transcript on the two alleles with mild heat shocks. Otherwise, the conclusion &quot;that, the <italic>dpp<sup>FRT-TA</sup></italic> allele may not be as readily inactivated as our alleles&quot; should be rephrased.</p><p>The experiment removing endogenous Dpp and replacing it with a constitutively expressed Dpp under control of the tubulin promoter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>) is beautiful. It not only shows the requirement for Dpp for growth, but also further debunks the another publication (Wartlick et al. 2011) asserting that ever-increasing levels of Dpp are required for growth.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.22546.021</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>Essential revisions:</italic></p><p><italic>Reviewer 1:</italic></p><p><italic>1) One difficulty is that Akiyama show that their dpp-gal4 technique removes most or all stripe Dpp from the dorsal wing pouch and hinge, and also greatly reduces pMad there, as early as 72 hours AEL (their <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>).

Does the Akiyama allele version of the experiment lead to loss of Dpp and the pMad gradient in parts of the disc at 72 hours, and is growth in those regions affected or unaffected?</italic></p><p>The genetic manipulation of Akiyama (with <italic>dpp-gal4 UAS-Flp</italic> and <italic>dpp<sup>FRT-TA</sup></italic>) leads to loss of pMad from 72 h AEL (as shown in their paper). However, these authors did not assess Brinker expression at these early stages (only at the end of growth). We found that, in their genotype, Brinker is repressed at 90 h and 96 h AEL, a clear indication of residual Dpp signaling activity (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2H-J</xref>). We suggest that, in their setup, <italic>dpp</italic> excision is incomplete, leaving a few cells in the stripe that produce Dpp at a level that is sufficient to inhibit Brinker, but not to activate pMad detectably (see more extensive discussion below). Since growth is relatively normal under these conditions, we conclude that Brinker repression, but not detectable pMad immunoreactivity, is needed for growth.</p><p><italic>If Akiyama is correct, this should be mentioned. One possible explanation is that the authors might investigate is that the early pMad loss was not enough to increase brinker expression at early time points, as Akiyama only examined brinker at late third. Since the authors have Akiyama's allele, could they look? My thinking here is that the different results might not be due to whether stripe Dpp is lost, per se, but how much residual Dpp signaling is left from Dpp elsewhere in the disc, and whether that residual signaling is enough to suppress brinker expression during the growth phase.</italic></p><p>We propose that the Akiyama allele is partially inactivated by <italic>dpp-gal4 UAS-Flp</italic>, leaving enough Dpp-expressing cells <italic>within</italic> the stripe for repression of Brinker during the growth period (but not enough to activate detectable pMad). Residual Dpp signalling is suggested by our observation that in <italic>dpp-gal4 UAS-Flp dpp<sup>FRT-TA</sup></italic> discs, Brinker is repressed in the pouch at 90 and 96h AEL (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2H-J</xref>). We confirmed the observation of Akiyama that, at 120h AEL, Brinker is derepressed in this genotype (they only showed this time point). However, by that time, Dpp signalling is irrelevant for growth and therefore this observation erroneously suggests that growth can take place in the presence of Brinker. We suggest that, with the Akiyama allele, there is residual expression although there is no need to invoke another source of Dpp outside the stripe since inactivation of our alleles with <italic>dpp-gal4 UAS-flp</italic> does prevent growth. It is worth noting that low-level, uniform Dpp, which represses Brinker but fails to trigger detectable pMad, is sufficient for growth (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). Therefore, absence of detectable pMad immunoreactivity does not necessarily indicate complete loss of signaling activity.</p><p><italic>2) If dppCA works because it is more efficient, an important question is whether that removes stripe dpp at an earlier stage that dppTA, or whether it removes dpp over a broader region of the wing pouch. The authors seem to be suggesting the former, but the second raises the possibility that dppCA works because it is removing low-level Dpp from the far anterior of the wing disc. Both studies agree that widespread removal of Dpp reduces growth. dpp-gal4 appears to have residual expression that can extend well into the anterior of at least the dorsal wing pouch (see the Evans G-TRACE paper, for instance).

This is, for me, a critical question, and I have to hear some cogent counterargument to accept the authors' interpretation.</italic></p><p>It is true that, as G-Trace shows, <italic>dpp-Gal4</italic> must have been active at some point during disc development far into the anterior compartment. It is reasonable to consider the possibility that such expression could inactivate the CA allele, but not the more ‘resistant’ TA allele in non-stripe anterior cells. Thus, remaining non-stripe Dpp expression from the TA allele (but not the CA or PSB alleles) would sustain growth in the presence of <italic>dpp-Gal4 and UAS-Flp</italic>. G-Trace integrates historical transcription activity, making it very sensitive but preventing an assessment of the level or timing of such activity in anterior cells. As an alternative, to determine the activity of the Dpp promoter, we have designed an allele (<italic>dpp<sup>FRT-REP</sup></italic>) that carries FRTs in the same location as our original CA allele but in addition has sequences encoding CD8-GFP downstream of the FRT cassette such that, following excision, it expresses CD8-GFP under the control of the native <italic>dpp</italic> promoter. We have used this allele to map the transcriptional activity of <italic>dpp</italic> in the pouch by crossing it to <italic>rotund-gal4 UAS-Flp</italic> and staining the discs at 72, 96, and 120 h AEL. At all three stages, CD8-GFP was confined to the stripe (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>). Since CD8-GFP is a sensitive reporter gene, we conclude that during the 72-120h period, the activity of the <italic>dpp</italic> promoter in the pouch is confined to the stripe. We suggest that the G-trace signal in anterior non-stripe cells could be due to earlier or very low promoter activity.</p><p><italic>3) &quot;This was confirmed by comparing side-by-side the impact of Flp expressed from a hsp70-flp transgene on dppFRT-TA and dppFRT-PSB&quot;. Since the dpp stripe experiment was done with dppCA, the critical issue is whether CA is more efficiently excised than TA. So why are the authors comparing TA with PSB? Do they also have the dpp-gal4 data with PSB?</italic></p><p>In response to the reviewer’s comment, we have systematically compared the excisability of all three alleles by qRT-PCR. For each allele, excision was induced with the same <italic>hs-Flp</italic> transgene under identical heat shock conditions and the level of brinker expression in dissected discs was measured by qRT-PCR.</p><p>The results are consistent with the TA allele being less readily excised than the CA and PSB (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). As an additional test, we compared disc size at 120 h AEL for all three alleles following heat shocks at 72 or 96 h AEL. Following the 72 h heat shock, the PSB and CA discs were significantly smaller than the TA discs, showing that <italic>dpp</italic> was more thoroughly inactivated with our alleles than with TA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>).</p><p><italic>4) The graph in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref> shows only a slight reduction PH3 after growth rescue compared with wild type, and the claim is that this shows rescue.

Not significant is not the same as saying the numbers are the same, and cannot rule out a type II error, without a calculation of statistical power.</italic></p><p>As suggested, we have added data from un-rescued discs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4K</xref>). Quantification shows that uniform expression of Dpp significantly restores proliferation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4L</xref>).</p><p><italic>Reviewer 2:</italic></p><p><italic>1) Source of Dpp: As shown in Evan et al., 2009 using GTRACE, the cell lineage of dpp GAL4 not only marks the cells along the A/P boundary but also marks a portion of the anterior compartment. Although the results clearly demonstrate a that FLP under dpp GAL4 results in loss of mature form of dpp in the wing pouch and thus affects growth, the results do not rule out that a role for Dpp emanating from the compartmental boundary may also be necessary for growth.</italic></p><p>We assume that there is a typo in the reviewer’s comment and that he/she meant “a role for Dpp emanating <italic>far</italic> from the compartmental boundary may also be necessary for growth”. In our response to comment 2 of reviewer 1 (who also pointed out the G-Trace study), we describe results with a sensitive (but not permanent) reporter of <italic>dpp</italic> transcription that we created. They show that during the 72-120 h period, the sole domain of <italic>dpp</italic> expression in the pouch is the stripe along the A/P boundary (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>).</p><p><italic>2) Levels of Dpp: Although, using Tubα1/FRT/f+/FRT/dpp transgene (Zecca et al., 1995), the authors look at downstream effects of Dpp, it would be informative to know the levels and pattern of expression of Dpp in rescue and control discs. It would be useful to address when the de-repression of brinker in the context of the removal of dppTA takes place, compared to that when dppCA is excised. This will completely explain the discrepancy between the results obtained by the authors, here and the results of Akiyama and Gibson.</italic></p><p>This is a two-part question, one about the level of Dpp expression from the <italic>Tubα1/FRT/f+/FRT/dpp</italic> transgene and the other about Brinker derepression in the context of the removal of <italic>dpp<sup>FRT-TA</sup></italic>.</p><p>1) Unfortunately, Dpp produced from the <italic>Tubα1/FRT/f+/FRT/dpp</italic> transgene is not tagged and there is no suitable antibody to detect mature Dpp (the Akiyama antibody only recognizes the pro-domain). We have therefore assessed signaling activity in the rescue (and control) context with anti-P-Mad, anti-Omb, and anti-Brinker (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). The results show that <italic>dpp</italic> expressed from <italic>Tubα1/FRT/f+/FRT/dpp</italic> is too low to trigger detectable pMad, but sufficient to activate weak Omb expression and to repress Brinker. This is why we conclude that weak, low-level Dpp signaling is sufficient to promote growth.</p><p>2) As suggested by the reviewer we have compared the extent of Brinker derepression following inactivation of the various alleles. For all three alleles, qRT-PCR analysis shows that Brinker is derepressed following Flp expression from a <italic>hs-Flp</italic> transgene. Importantly however, this is less pronounced for TA than for CA or PSB (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). This was confirmed by immunofluorescence, comparing the three alleles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). We conclude therefore that the TA allele is less readily inactivated. We also assessed the pattern of Brinker expression at 90, 96, and 120 h AEL in <italic>dpp<sup>FRT-TA</sup> dpp-Gal4 UAS-Flp</italic> imaginal discs. The same assay was performed by Akiyama and Gibson but only at 120 h AEL. We confirmed their finding that Brinker is derepressed at 120 h, but found Brinker to be repressed at the earlier stages, when growth is taking place (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). By contrast, with the CA allele, expression of FLP from <italic>dpp-Gal4 UAS-Flp</italic> leads to early Brinker derepression and growth impairment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>) These observations are consistent with the previously accepted notion that Brinker must be repressed for the pouch to grow. As the reviewer recognizes, they also explain the discrepancy between our results and those of Akiyama and Gibson.</p><p><italic>3) Anterior Dpp/Posterior Dpp: The above system could be used in conjunction with hhGAL4 or ciGAL4 driven FLP to remove endogenous Dpp within a compartment while still expressing uniform low levels of Dpp in the same compartment and verifying if growth/patterning is perturbed (related to Extended Data 6 of Akhiyama &amp; Gibson et al., 2015). This will lay to rest an interesting proposition and provide a cautionary tale of (over) interpretation of the power of Drosophila genetic jugglery.</italic></p><p>These are interesting suggestions but we wonder whether these experiments are necessary. All the evidence so far suggests that posterior deletion of Dpp (with <italic>hh-Gal4 UAS-Flp</italic>) will have no effect. With <italic>ci-Gal4 and UAS-Flp</italic>, it is very likely growth will be impaired since this is the case with the TA allele (which is less excisable than our allele). It would be fun to do a rescue experiment with <italic>ci-Gal4</italic> to test if flat expression in the A compartment is sufficient to promote growth. However, this experiment, which requires many generations, would significantly delay our paper.</p><p><italic>Reviewer 3:</italic></p><p><italic>1) At the beginning of results, it would be helpful for the reader to explain better the difference between the CA and PSB alleles (which remains a bit mysterious).

We cannot be sure for two reasons. One is that the growth rate decreases with age (as shown for example by Johnston and Sanders, NCB 2003), making any effect on growth harder to detect at later times. Second, we cannot exclude the possibility that perdurance of Dpp or downstream events might contribute to growth after excision. In light of these points, we have modified this section to indicate that Dpp signaling could very well contribute to growth until the end of larval stages.</p><p><italic>4) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3H-N</xref> simply shows in a different way that the effect of the PSB allele on growth is stronger than the effect of the TA allele, but it does not show it is due to &quot;allele excisability”, or that it is more readily inactivated.
