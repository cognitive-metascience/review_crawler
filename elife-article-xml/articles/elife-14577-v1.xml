Here, we uncover its role in phosphate nutrition by targeted cellular inactivation or phosphate transport complementation in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>, using a transactivation strategy with an innovative high-resolution real-time <sup>33</sup>P imaging technique. Remarkably, the diminutive size of the root cap cells at the root-to-soil exchange surface accounts for a significant amount of the total seedling phosphate uptake (approximately 20%). This level of Pi absorption is sufficient for shoot biomass production (up to a 180% gain in soil), as well as repression of Pi starvation-induced genes. These results extend our understanding of this important tissue from its previously described roles in environmental perception to novel functions in mineral nutrition and homeostasis control.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.14577.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.14577.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.14577.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>All plants need phosphate to grow because it is a major component of DNA and many other biological molecules. Most of the Earth’s soil is poor in phosphate, and so farmland is routinely supplemented with fertilizers to provide crops with this essential nutrient. However, phosphate fertilizers are becoming scarce and their quality is expected to decline in the near future. Plant biologists must therefore determine how to adapt plants to a restricted supply of this resource, in order to sustain high crop yields for the growing world population.</p><p>Plants are known to absorb phosphate through specific protein-based transporters located in the cells that make up the outer layer of roots. These proteins are highly concentrated at the root tip, and while this specialized tissue is well-known for perceiving gravity and light, it had not been shown to play a role in phosphate absorption.</p><p>Kanno, Arrighi et al. have now used genetically modified Arabidopsis plants to demonstrate that phosphate can be taken up via the small cells that surround the root tip. The experiments showed that the absorbed phosphate rapidly reaches the leaves within minutes, helps the plant grow and modifies its metabolism. As the root tip can accumulate high amounts of phosphate in order to sustain its own activity, it was important to distinguish uptake of phosphate from the environment from redistribution of phosphate already within the plant. Kanno, Arrighi et al. tackled this issue through the development of a new radioactive micro-imaging technique.</p><p>Phosphate transporters are also present within the cell layers within the root, but their purpose and activity are not well described. Further studies are needed to analyze the role of other root cell layers in phosphate uptake and transport, and the newly developed techniques will help decipher the mechanisms involved.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.14577.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.14577.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>root cap</kwd><kwd>mineral nutrition</kwd><kwd>phosphate homeostasis</kwd><kwd>arabidopsis</kwd><kwd>33P imaging</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd>&lt;i&gt;A. thaliana&lt;/i&gt;</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>CEA-TRANSRAD 2012</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Transrad 2012</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kanno</surname><given-names>Satomi</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001691</institution-id><institution>Japan Society for the Promotion of Science</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>22880009</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kanno</surname><given-names>Satomi</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Marie Curie Reintegration</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>PIGR05GA2009 249173</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Javot</surname><given-names>Hélène</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Real-time <sup>33</sup>P imaging combined with specific complementation of inorganic phosphate transport in the root cap reveals this tissue’s contribution to phosphate uptake.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Mineral nutrition has an essential function in plant roots and its spatial localization has been a subject of controversy for a long time. Following the invention of the compound microscope, pioneering descriptions of plant tissues in the seventeenth century by Marcello Malpighi (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Malpighi, 1675</xref>) and Nehemiah Grew (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Grew, 1682</xref>) established the bases of plant anatomy. Although both authors drew a connection between plant nutrition and distinct anatomical location, Malpighi proposed the root hairs whereas Grew proposed the root cap, at the distal end of the root tip. Our understanding of the spatial localization of plant nutrition has undergone great advances in the past twenty-five years. Combined efforts in molecular biology, genetics, biochemistry and electrophysiology have identified several key aspects to ion uptake, with a central role for plasma membrane (PM) ion transporters in this process. These transporters often belong to broad multigenic families (a likely consequence of their vital role) with overlapping expression patterns (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Nussaume et al., 2011</xref>). However, this high redundancy has held back their genetic study to some degree, preventing analysis of ion uptake contribution at specific root localities.</p><p>The uptake of phosphate (Pi), an essential plant macronutrient, relies on a family of nine high-affinity transporters, identified as PHT1 in the plant model <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Nussaume et al., 2011</xref>). Mineral nutrition is classically associated with the root epidermis, and the various PHT1 members were identified within this cell layer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Mudge et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Karthikeyan et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Misson et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Nussaume et al., 2011</xref>). These transporters are particularly abundant where hair cells develop (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Daram et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Brady et al., 2007</xref>), as this increases the surface area in contact with the environment and improves nutrient uptake (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Peret et al., 2011</xref>). Transcriptomic analyses of specific root cell layers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Birnbaum et al., 2003</xref>) and analysis of the PHT1 expression pattern has revealed the accumulation of these transporters in the root tip (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Mudge et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Karthikeyan et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Misson et al., 2004</xref>). Nevertheless, determining how PHT1 proteins contribute to Pi uptake at the root tip is difficult, particularly since this area contains the primary root meristem. This tissue, which is essential for root growth, generates new cells that require Pi and its accumulation to build essential components including nucleic acids, ATP, and phospholipids. Consequently, this complicates differentiating Pi uptake from the Pi translocation (from epidermis) necessary to sustain active cell division in the root tip. Our approach to overcome this problem employs a recently developed high-resolution live radioisotope micro-imaging system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Kanno et al., 2012</xref>) combined with targeted cell ablation or complementation by genetic manipulation. These findings establish the importance of the root cap in phosphate uptake and homeostasis.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Functional elements of Pi uptake are localized within the root cap</title><p>PHT1;1 and PHT1;4, the two most important high-affinity phosphate transporters required for up to 75% of Pi uptake in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>, are localized to the distal part of the root tip (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Shin et al., 2004</xref>). Both transporters are observed in the root tip (primarily in the root cap), where they are expressed at the transcriptional and protein levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>) with PHF1, a crucial component facilitating PHT1 post-translational regulation and its targeting to the PM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Gonzalez et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bayle et al., 2011</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>).

Consequently, we chose genetic approaches to decipher the role of the root tip in Pi uptake, since the small size of this tissue prevented application of <sup>33</sup>Pi at the root tip in a precise or exclusive manner.</p><p>To bypass the functional redundancy of Pi transporters (comprising 9 distinct loci in Arabidopsis) and their overlapping expression at the tissue and cell levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Nussaume et al., 2011</xref>), we produced lines in which elimination of the root cap was activated. Previously, this was achieved by introducing a diphtheria toxin A-chain gene driven by a root cap promoter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Tsugeki and Fedoroff, 1999</xref>). However, due to the essential functions of the root cap in several physiological processes, these plants exhibited roots with abnormal differentiation and very poor growth rate. Therefore, we employed a conditional approach using the negative marker <italic>FCY</italic> (cytosine deaminase; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Stougaard, 1993</xref>) coupled with uracil phosphoribosyltransferase (<italic>UPP</italic>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Tiraby et al., 1998</xref>). These enzymes convert the innocuous 5-fluorocytosine (5FC) to cytotoxic 5-fluorouracil and 5-fluoroUMP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2A</xref>), which stop cellular activities. Genes encoding a <italic>FCY-UPP</italic> fusion were specifically expressed in root cap cells using the Arabidopsis GAL4/UAS binary expression system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Laplaze et al., 2005</xref>). The <italic>FCY-UPP</italic> construct under control of a UAS promoter was introduced in a GAL4 line (Q0171) selected for its specific root cap expression. This line also expresses GFP under the control of a UAS promoter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>), for visualizing tissues in which the transactivation took place (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>). As expected, a five-day treatment with 5FC drastically reduced the expression of GFP in the root cap (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>); the low GFP signal may result from high GFP protein stability or low residual expression. Root tip cell viability was not affected, as revealed by propidium iodide staining (PI; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>). In living cells, PI staining is restricted to the cell wall (as in the non-control plants), whereas it is localized to nuclei in dead tissues, as in the heat-shocked WT control (see inserts in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>).</p><p>Pi absorption was visualized using a real-time radioisotope imaging system developed for plant nutrient uptake studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Kanno et al., 2012</xref>). Roots were treated with short pulses of <sup>33</sup>Pi radiotracer and examined by live radioisotope microimaging. The ability of the root cap to promote Pi uptake is illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>. Expression of <italic>FCY-UPP</italic> in the root cap combined with 5FC treatment clearly abolished the <sup>33</sup>Pi accumulation observed in either the WT or the transgenic line not treated with 5FC. Treating the WT line with 5FC had no effect on either plant growth (results not shown) or Pi accumulation, demonstrating its innocuous nature when <italic>FCY-UPP</italic> is not expressed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). This result establishes the existence of an unexpected active Pi uptake process at the root cap level.</p><p>Nevertheless, this <italic>FCY-UPP</italic>-based system cannot be used to quantify the physiological effect of root cap ablation on Pi status, since arrested root growth was observed within 2 days of 5FC treatment. This alters the root architecture and prevents any precise quantitative comparison with the WT control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Quantification of Pi uptake by the root cap</title><p>As stated above, the high redundancy of Pi transporters poses technical difficulties to investigating their roles in a selected tissue. We used a PHF1 mutant (<italic>phf1-1</italic>) to circumvent this obstacle, as this mutation strongly reduces PHT1 accumulation in the PM, resulting in a 70–80% reduction in Pi uptake (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bayle et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Gonzalez et al., 2005</xref>). Consequently, the <italic>phf1-1</italic> mutant exhibits phosphate starvation traits in Pi-rich medium, although its growth is only slightly reduced. This offers an appropriate genetic tool for targeted PHF1 complementation to restore Pi uptake in specific tissues. Using the same GAL4/UAS system described above, we back-crossed the GAL4 enhancer trap driving expression in the root cap (line Q0171) in a <italic>phf1-1</italic> background. The specific complementation of the root cap was obtained by introducing the UAS-PHF1 construct, producing the <italic>phf1</italic> Q0171&gt;&gt;PHF1 line. The proper targeting of Pi transporters to the PM in the root tip of resulting plants was confirmed by introducing the fluorescent marker mCherry fused to the <italic>PHT1;4</italic> gene driven by the constitutive 35S promoter. This produced a strong fluorescent signal in the columella and lateral root cap, where the GFP marker driven by GAL4/UAS was also observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). The proper targeting of the PHT1;4-mCherry fusion protein was validated by its colocalization with the PM-specific FM4-64 dye (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A,B</xref>). This confirms that an effective restoration of PHT1 targeting in the root cap PM has taken place in the <italic>phf1</italic> Q0171&gt;&gt;<italic>P</italic>HF1 line (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A,C</xref>).

Our results indicate that the root cap contributes approximately 20% of the total amount of Pi absorbed from the medium by the roots. This Pi contributes to the plant’s total Pi pool, significantly sustaining the overall development of the plant. This is demonstrated by the 80 to 180% increase in biomass production observed in root cap-complemented lines as compared to the <italic>phf1-1</italic> mutant, during the vegetative growth of plants in soil.</p><p>The <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> root cap therefore appears to be a “hot spot” for Pi absorption, despite its small surface area. Interestingly, this confirms the hypothesis of the 17<sup>th</sup> century plant anatomist Nehemiah Grew, who drew a connection between plant nutrition and the distal end of the root tip (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Grew, 1682</xref>).</p><p>At the root tip, only the cap seems to play an important role in Pi acquisition. Indeed, the elongation zone (distal to the cap) displays poor Pi absorption despite its essential metabolic activity. Various factors can be proposed to explain this observation. For instance, the fast rate of root growth reduces the period spent by cells in this area by 6 to 7 hr (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Beemster and Baskin, 1998</xref>), limiting the time allocated to protein production. Additionally, the cell elongation process in this region could contribute to diluting the activity of the produced PHT1 transporters. These features do not affect the root cap, which is located below the elongation and meristematic zones of the root and is composed of cells that are 10 to 20 times smaller than mature epidermis cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Beemster and Baskin, 1998</xref>) and that have low turn-over (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Dolan et al., 1993</xref>). This likely contributes to the high cellular concentration of PHT1 proteins in the membrane of this tissue.</p><p>The root cap structure of <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>, composed of 180–260 cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Dolan et al., 1993</xref>), can appear simple in comparison to other plant species. For example, there are as many as 4,000–21,000 cells in the maize root cap (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Clowes, 1976</xref>). This disparity can be explained by the presence of additional cell layers in the columella, with 20 in maize (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Iijima et al., 2008</xref>) and 16 in rice plantlets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Wang et al., 2014a</xref>), in comparison to only 5 in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Dolan et al., 1993</xref>). Although this promotes the formation of a slightly larger cap (see <italic>Lotus japonicus</italic> in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>) with more cell layers, it does not significantly increase the external surface in contact with the medium. Despite these species-specific features, the root cap has also been observed to absorb Pi in rice and <italic>Lotus</italic>.</p><p>The high concentration of Pi transporters in the root cap could be due to the physicochemical properties of phosphate. Pi interacts strongly with many cations and exhibits a very weak diffusion coefficient in soil (from 10<sup>−12</sup> to 10<sup>−15</sup> m<sup>2</sup> s<sup>−1</sup>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Schachtman et al., 1998</xref>). Pi mobility is consequently very low, which promotes a Pi-depleted zone around the root as a result of its absorption by plants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Kanno et al., 2012</xref>). This suggests that the root cap may provide a temporal advantage to the plant (« first come, first served »), as the Pi stock available to the growing root becomes limited. This feature could therefore be beneficial in natural soil with low Pi availability and high Pi heterogeneity, which may explain the higher biomass gain observed in our soil experiments as compared to hydroponic conditions.</p><p>Other micro- or macronutrients may also be absorbed by the root cap, although their identification will require further analyses. Nevertheless, an absence of tools to monitor the presence and movements of specific ions could pose technical challenges. Real-time isotope imaging is one practical approach to circumvent this issue. However, the limited detectable range of elements such as conventional ß-ray and some gamma-ray or X-ray emitters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Kanno et al., 2012</xref>) prevents studying the dynamics of many important plant nutrients at the microscopic level.</p><p>Plant nutrient carriers are known to be highly redundant, which poses a bottleneck for genetic studies. For many nutrients, redundancy is not only linked to gene duplications, since different transporter families have been described for some nutrients (<italic>e.g.</italic> nitrate), reinforcing the difficulty in finding common regulators. Genetic tools that can impair the activity of a complete family of transporters remain very rare, and are currently restricted to Pi nutrition, such as the <italic>phf1-1</italic> mutant used here. Previous spatial gene expression studies have investigated the presence of ion transporters in the root cap for iron (IRT1; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Vert et al., 2002</xref>), potassium (ATkT3/KUP4/TRH1; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Vicente-Agullo et al., 2004</xref>), nitrate (NRT1-1; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Remans et al., 2006</xref>) and boron (BOR1; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Takano et al., 2010</xref>). For boron, accumulation of this element around the quiescent center was predicted using a model based on the distribution of several boron transporters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Takano et al., 2010</xref>) and confirmed by chemical analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Shimotohno et al., 2015</xref>), thereby indicating a role for the root tip in boron uptake.</p><p>Defects in the nitrate NRT1-1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Krouk et al., 2010</xref>) or potassium TRH1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Vicente-Agullo et al., 2004</xref>) carriers affect root morphology (gravitropism, modification of lateral root development, <italic>etc.</italic>). This is related to the ability of these proteins to competitively transport auxin. To date, their presence in the root cap appears to be linked to a developmental role in the adaptation of root morphology to the presence of nitrate or potassium in the environment. Nevertheless, the role of these proteins in nutrition remains to be elucidated.</p><p>In the case of Pi, it is well documented that the primary root growth is disconnected from Pi import and Pi internal status (for review see: <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Svistoonoff et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Thibaud et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Peret et al., 2011</xref>). The present study confirms this view, as Pi absorption by the root cap has not been found to modify root architecture, although it significantly affects plant Pi nutrition.</p><p>As we have shown, plant growth varies according to the medium used (in vitro, hydropony, soil) but in all cases restoring Pi absorption in the root cap promoted a significant gain in biomass. Indeed for plantlets grown in vitro, a 20% increase in Pi uptake generated a 40% gain in biomass for the root tip-complemented line within 4 days. For mature plants grown for a longer period, this gain increased and could even reach 180% as observed with soil experiments.</p><p>The level of Pi derived from root cap absorption (with regard to the size of this tissue) contributed also significantly to the modification of Pi homeostasis and to regulation of gene expression, as revealed by changes in the expression of several transcriptomic markers regulated by internal Pi status (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Thibaud et al., 2010</xref>). This observation is in agreement with previous reports that internal Pi may be involved in Pi homeostasis regulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Liu et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Lv et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Wang et al., 2014b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Puga et al., 2014</xref>). The transcriptional response was not linearly connected to Pi uptake, since absorption in the root cap of the complemented line restored half of the regulation of Pi starvation systemic markers. As previously shown, this confirms that a small amount of Pi absorbed by the root (at the root tip level, as shown in this study) can regulate gene expression in the whole plant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Thibaud et al., 2010</xref>).</p><p>Charles Darwin characterized the root tip as a plant brain, based on its role in environmental perception and gravitropism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Darwin and Darwin, 1880</xref>). Numerous studies since then have revealed how the root cap responds to various abiotic stresses including: light, modulation of root architecture in response to phosphate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Svistoonoff et al., 2007</xref>), and potassium or nitrate supply (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Arnaud et al., 2010</xref>). The present study establishes essential roles for this tissue in Pi nutrition, as well as Pi homeostasis adaptation. Finally, this study demonstrates that the root cap contributes to the plant’s adaptation to soil Pi presence in a disproportionate way, considering its diminutive size.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Plant growth</title><p>Surface-sterilized seeds were sown in vitro on square Petri plates containing modified Murashige and Skoog medium diluted 10x (MS/10) (from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Arnaud et al., 2014</xref>), supplemented with 2 μM iron and phosphate (0 or 500 μM NaH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub> for low-Pi (-P) orhigh-Pi (+P) respectively).

Q0171&gt;&gt;FCY-UPP plantlets were grown for 7 days in +P and then treated with 3.87 mM 5-fluorocytosine (5FC) or DMSO (5FC solvent) for 5 days, or by heat shock at 95°C for 5 min in water. Plants were then treated with PI. Images were acquired with a macroscope equipped with structured illumination (Axiozoom V16, + ApoTome2, Zeiss; Germany). Fluorophores were excited using a mercury lamp (GFP: Ex filter 470 nm BP40, Em 525 nm BP50; PI: Ex filter 572 nm BP25, Em 629 nm BP62). Images are composed of maximum intensity z-series projections of 26 to 33 images at 2-μm intervals (software: Zen 2012, version 1.1.2.0, Zeiss).</p><p>Localization of the PHT1;4-mCherry fusion protein to the PM was analyzed in the <italic>phf1</italic> QO171&gt;&gt;<italic>PHF1</italic> background with 1 μg/mL FM4-64 for 5 min at room temperature (Interchim; France). Co-imaging of FM4-64 and mCherry was performed on a LSM780 confocal microscope in spectral mode (Ex: 561 nm, Em range: 563 – 696 nm). Linear unmixing was applied to separate mCherry and FM4-64 components, using reference spectra acquired separately and the Zen software (Zen 2012 SP1, version 8.1, Zeiss). Fluorescence intensity profiles were subsequently calculated (software: Zen 2012, version 1.1.2.0, Zeiss).</p></sec><sec id="s4-10"><title>Statictical analysis</title><p>All statistical analyses were performed with GraphPad prism 6 software (version 6.0f). Values were tested for normality (D’Agostino-Pearson omnibus normality test) and variance homogeneity (Brown-Forsythe and Bartlett’s tests). Unpaired t-test (Student’s test) was run to compare treatments.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We thank Drs.

Your full submission has been evaluated by Detlef Weigel as Senior editor and three peer reviewers, and the decision was reached after discussions between the reviewers.</p><p>We had a lengthy discussion among the reviewers and the Senior editor, and based on the discussion and the individual reviews below, we regret to inform you that your work in its current form cannot be considered for publication in <italic>eLife</italic>. However, there was substantial enthusiasm for the topic and the approach, and we would be very interested in a substantially revised manuscript that would demonstrate the importance of the root cap in older soil-grown plants. This is in line with <italic>eLife</italic> policy to invite outright revision only in cases where it appears likely that a revision can be submitted within two months or so. Because performing experiments with mature plants will likely take longer, we are declining the manuscript in its current form. Please feel free to reach out to Detlef Weigel if clarification of the decision is needed.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic> </p><p>It has long been noticed that promoters of nutrient transporter genes are active in the root tip and that nutrient transporter proteins localize to the membrane of columella cells, suggesting that the root cap might be involved in nutrient uptake. This great manuscript finally shows that the root cap is indeed involved in phosphate uptake, can account for 20% of the phosphate absorbed by the root and can contribute to biomass production.

The authors use elegant conditional Ablation and Pi uptake imaging systems for their studies.

There are a number of points that could be address to make this report more solid and with higher impact.</p><p>1) To really demonstrate that the root cap has an important role in Pi uptake and homeostasis, the authors should analyze the impact of root cap ablation in mature plants grown in soils amended with different levels of Pi or in soil with different levels of Pi availability. The data on Pi accumulation and biomass accumulation was done only with small plants grown under in vitro conditions, which significantly different from the conditions and physiology of mature plants grown in soil.</p><p>2) The authors assign an important function in Pi uptake to the root cap because mutants impaired in Pi uptake, except in the root cap, can still import a significant amount of Pi an sustain growth. However, the role of the root cap could be overestimated when it becomes the only site of Pi uptake. Therefore, it would have been better to complement <italic>phf1-1</italic> with PHF1 in all root except the root cap; in other words the exact opposite experiment than that reported in the paper. In this case if the root cap is indeed important, Pi uptake and plant growth should be reduced in lines which have Pi impaired only in the root cap. This would definitely demonstrate the importance of Pi uptake in the root cap. This could be done using a GAL4 enhancer trap driving expression in all epidermal layers of the root except on the root cap or by expressing and RNAi for PHF1 in the root cap using the Q0171 enhancer trap line.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic></p><p>In the present manuscript Kanno et al. use a combinatorial approach (genetic conditional ablation and specific complementation of Pi transport together with radioisotope imaging) to show remarkable active Pi uptake in the primary root cap of <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> (as well as rice and <italic>Lotus japonicus</italic>). The important contribution (~20%) of the root cap to Pi uptake is not well acknowledged in the literature, although this uptake corresponds to the previously determined, high expression of PHT1 genes in the root cap, and confirms a hypothesis from the 17th century. The tools used in this study are elegant and innovative, although the biological message in the end is limited.</p><p>The fact that the Pi taken up via the root cap alters plant growth is as expected as the result that Pi taken up via the root cap reverts high expression of (systemically regulated) P-starvation induced (PSI) gene transcripts.

This would be different with the demonstration that the root cap itself (as opposed to other root areas) is the predominant or only place where root P-status is sensed and changes in physiological or molecular phenotypes are initiated.
