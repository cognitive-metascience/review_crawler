It is thought that these are formed by cohesin complexes <italic>via</italic> extrusion, either until loop expansion is arrested by CTCF or until cohesin is removed from DNA by WAPL. Although WAPL limits cohesin’s chromatin residence time to minutes, it has been reported that some loops exist for hours. How these loops can persist is unknown. We show that during G1-phase, mammalian cells contain acetylated cohesin<sup>STAG1</sup> which binds chromatin for hours, whereas cohesin<sup>STAG2</sup> binds chromatin for minutes. Our results indicate that CTCF and the acetyltransferase ESCO1 protect a subset of cohesin<sup>STAG1</sup> complexes from WAPL, thereby enable formation of long and presumably long-lived loops, and that ESCO1, like CTCF, contributes to boundary formation in chromatin looping. Our data are consistent with a model of nested loop extrusion, in which acetylated cohesin<sup>STAG1</sup> forms stable loops between CTCF sites, demarcating the boundaries of more transient cohesin<sup>STAG2</sup> extrusion activity.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>chromatin structure</kwd><kwd>genome

Hi-C experiments have revealed that chromatin interactions are either enriched in genomic regions called topologically associating domains (TADs) or appear as more pronounced localized interactions which in Hi-C maps are visible as ‘dots’ or on the edge of TADs as ‘corner peaks’. In Hi-C maps only these dots and corner peaks are referred to as loops, even though TADs are also thought to be formed by looping of chromatin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Dixon et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Nora et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Rao et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>Most chromatin interactions that are mediated by cohesin are anchored at genomic sites that are bound by the insulator protein CTCF (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Dixon et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Nora et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Rao et al., 2014</xref>) with which cohesin co-localizes genome-wide (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Parelho et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Wendt et al., 2008</xref>). Even though the sites at which long-range interactions are anchored can be hundreds of kilobases or even Mega-base pairs (Mb) apart in the linear genome, the CTCF consensus motifs that are found at these sites are typically oriented towards each other, a phenomenon known as ‘the CTCF convergence rule’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">de Wit et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Rao et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Vietri Rudan et al., 2015</xref>). How cohesin and CTCF generate chromatin interactions in cells is unknown, but an attractive hypothesis posits that cohesin acts by extruding loops of genomic DNA until it encounters convergently oriented CTCF sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Fudenberg et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Sanborn et al., 2015</xref>). This hypothesis is supported by recent single-molecule experiments which have shown that in vitro cohesin forms DNA loops by extrusion in a manner that depends on NIPBL-MAU2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Davidson et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Kim et al., 2019</xref>). NIPBL-MAU2’s main function was so far thought to be the loading of cohesin onto DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Ciosk et al., 2000</xref>) but the experiments by Davidson et al. indicate that NIPBL-MAU2 is also part of the active cohesin holo-enzyme that mediates loop extrusion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Davidson et al., 2019</xref>). Loops of DNA can also be extruded by condensin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Ganji et al., 2018</xref>), which like cohesin belongs to the family of ‘structural maintenance of chromosomes’ (SMC) family of complexes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Strunnikov et al., 1993</xref>), and which forms DNA loops in mitosis.</p><p>Cohesin is a protein complex composed of multiple subunits. Three of these, SMC1, SMC3 and SCC1 (also known as RAD21 and Mcd1) form tri-partite rings, which in replicating cells are thought to entrap newly synthesised DNA molecules to mediate sister chromatid cohesion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Haering et al., 2008</xref>). During quiescence (G0) and G1, cohesin is dynamically released from chromatin via the activity of the protein WAPL and has a mean chromatin residence time of 8–25 min (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Gerlich et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Kueng et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Tedeschi et al., 2013</xref>). Despite cohesin’s dynamic interaction with chromatin, recent experiments suggest that some chromatin loops can persist over a significantly longer timescale of several hours (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Vian et al., 2018</xref>). How this can occur is not understood. It is possible that chromatin interactions are maintained after cohesin has been unloaded, but the observation that experimentally induced degradation of cohesin’s SCC1 subunit leads to disappearance of most TADs and loops within 15 min argues against this possibility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Wutz et al., 2017</xref>). More plausible scenarios are that long-lived chromatin interactions are maintained by multiple short-lived cohesin complexes, or that cohesin can be protected from WAPL so that it can persist on chromatin for longer periods of time.</p><p>Precedence for the regulatability of cohesin’s residence times on chromatin comes from studies of proliferating somatic cells and from meiotic cells. During S phase of somatic mammalian cells, around half of all cohesin complexes become protected from WAPL via an incompletely understood mechanism that depends on acetylation of cohesin’s SMC3 subunit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Rolef Ben-Shahar et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Unal et al., 2008</xref>) by the acetyltransferases ESCO1 and ESCO2 and on the subsequent recruitment to cohesin of the protein sororin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Ladurner et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Lafont et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Nishiyama et al., 2010</xref>). This protection from WAPL increases cohesin’s chromatin residence time to many hours and enables cohesive cohesin complexes to maintain sister chromatid cohesion from S phase until the subsequent mitosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Gerlich et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Schmitz et al., 2007</xref>). An even more dramatic prolongation of cohesin’s residence time is thought to exist in mammalian oocytes. In these cells, a meiotic form of cohesin, cohesin<sup>REC8</sup>, establishes cohesion during pre-meiotic S phase already before birth and then maintains it, depending on the species, for months or years until meiosis is completed during oocyte maturation cycles after puberty (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Burkhardt et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Tachibana-Konwalski et al., 2010</xref>).</p><p>Long residence times of cohesin on chromatin can also be experimentally induced by depletion of WAPL. This leads to re-localisation of cohesin from a diffuse nuclear pattern into axial chromosomal domains termed vermicelli, which are thought to represent the base of chromatin interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Tedeschi et al., 2013</xref>). This is accompanied by an increase in the number of long DNA loops and by chromatin compaction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Gassler et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Haarhuis et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Wutz et al., 2017</xref>). These findings imply that the residence time of cohesin on chromatin can be regulated in post-replicative cells in order to maintain cohesion over long periods of time, and they show that prolonging cohesin’s residence time experimentally can have major effects on genome organization (but it is important to note that the stabilization of cohesive cohesin on chromatin during S and G2 phase does not detectably alter genome architecture, which implies that cohesion and chromatin looping are mediated by distinct populations of cohesin; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Holzmann et al., 2019</xref> and references therein). However, to date, a cohesin population with long chromatin residence times has not been identified in G1 phase, where some chromatin interactions have been reported to exist for hours (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Vian et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>In mammalian somatic cells, SCC1 associates with the subunits STAG1 or STAG2 to form two distinct tetrameric cohesin core complexes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Losada et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Sumara et al., 2000</xref>). Although a recent study reported differences in the chromatin localization patterns for STAG1 and STAG2 and their contributions to chromatin organization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Kojic et al., 2018</xref>), it is unclear if these two forms of cohesin exhibit different residence times and incompletely understood whether they play distinct roles in loop formation. Here, we show that cohesin<sup>STAG1</sup> and cohesin<sup>STAG2</sup> do indeed display functional differences, both with respect to their residence times and in their ability to structure chromatin. We find that cohesin<sup>STAG1</sup> complexes are more highly acetylated, interact more stably with CTCF, form larger chromatin loops, and have a longer residence time on chromatin than cohesin<sup>STAG2</sup> complexes, consistent with the proposed existence of long-lived chromatin loops. This stabilization of cohesin<sup>STAG1</sup> depends on CTCF and ESCO1. Depletion of ESCO1 also decreases the insulation between TADs, in a manner like that observed following CTCF depletion. Furthermore, we find that both proteins are important for cohesin acetylation in G1. These results indicate that ESCO1 and CTCF function together to regulate cohesin’s chromatin organization activity. Our results underline that precise regulation of cohesin’s residence time is key to how cells organize their genomes. They may also be of relevance for understanding the aetiology of human cancers, in which STAG2 expression is often lost (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Lawrence et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Leiserson et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Solomon et al., 2011</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>ESCO1 preferentially acetylates cohesin<sup>STAG1</sup> during G1 phase</title><p>Acetylation of cohesin’s SMC3 subunit during S phase is known to stabilize cohesive cohesin complexes on chromatin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Ladurner et al., 2016</xref>), but acetylated SMC3 (SMC3ac) can also be detected in quiescent (G0) cells and in cells in G1 phase, where no cohesive cohesin exists (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Alomer et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Busslinger et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Minamino et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Rahman et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Whelan et al., 2012</xref>). To address possible functions of SMC3 acetylation in G1 phase we first analyzed which cohesin complexes are modified during the cell cycle by ESCO1 and ESCO2. In this and subsequent experiments we detected acetylated SMC3 by using monoclonal antibodies that specifically recognize SMC3 which is acetylated either singly on K106 or doubly on K105 and K106 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Nishiyama et al., 2010</xref>). Immunoblot analyses of chromatin fractions isolated from synchronized HeLa cells confirmed that SMC3 acetylation is detectable throughout the cell cycle, as is ESCO1, whereas ESCO2 expression is confined to S phase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>; <italic>lanes 2–5</italic>). As predicted from these results, depletion of ESCO1 by RNA interference (RNAi) reduced SMC3 acetylation in G1, whereas depletion of ESCO2 had little effect in this cell cycle phase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref>; note that contrary to the situation in G1, in G2 both ESCO1 and ESCO2 contribute to SMC3 acetylation; see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Nishiyama et al. (2010)</xref>. As reported by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Minamino et al.

These samples had been normalized to SMC3 to account for the three-fold higher abundance of cohesin<sup>STAG2</sup> relative to cohesin<sup>STAG1</sup> on chromatin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Holzmann et al., 2019</xref>) but similar results were also obtained when STAG1 and STAG2 immunoprecipitates from the same number of cells were analyzed without SMC3 normalization.

To analyze the chromatin binding dynamics of cohesin<sup>STAG1</sup>, we performed inverse fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (iFRAP) in STAG2-depleted G1 cells that expressed a GFP-tagged version of SMC3 (SMC3-LAP; for depletion efficiency, see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1B</xref>). Since STAG proteins are required for cohesin’s association with chromatin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Roig et al., 2014</xref>), the behavior of SMC3-LAP in these cells should predominantly reflect the behavior of cohesin<sup>STAG1</sup>. Conversely, to analyze cohesin<sup>STAG2</sup> we analyzed SMC3-LAP in cells depleted of STAG1. These experiments confirmed previous observations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Gerlich et al., 2006</xref>) that in control cells most cohesin interacts with chromatin dynamically with a residence of 13 min (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A,B and E</xref>). Similar results were obtained in cells depleted of STAG1, implying that in G1 most cohesin<sup>STAG2</sup> interacts with chromatin dynamically (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A,B and E</xref>). In contrast, in cells depleted of STAG2, the SMC3-LAP signal equilibrated much more slowly between bleached and unbleached regions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A and B</xref>) and the resulting iFRAP curve could only be fitted to a biexponential function (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1C</xref>).

As predicted from our STAG2 depletion experiments in SMC3-LAP cells, the EGFP-STAG1 iFRAP curve could only be fitted to a biexponential function. A subpopulation (33%) of EGFP-STAG1 was bound to chromatin stably (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2I</xref>) with a residence time of 5 hr (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2J</xref>). The remaining 67% of EGFP-STAG1 bound dynamically to chromatin with a residence time of 15 min (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2K</xref>). In contrast, the STAG2-EGFP iFRAP curve could be fitted to a single exponential function, with a dynamic residence time of five minutes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2L</xref>). A stably bound fraction of EGFP-STAG1 but not of STAG2-EGFP could also be detected in FRAP experiments, in which, compared to iFRAP, much smaller nuclear volumes are photobleached and therefore fluorescence recovery occurs on shorter time scales, resulting in higher temporal resolution (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>). Importantly, these differences between STAG1 and STAG2 were not caused by N-terminal tagging of STAG1 since we obtained similar results in an independent cell line, in which STAG1 was C-terminally tagged with EGFP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>; for technical reasons we were able to generate this cell line only late during this study, which is why earlier experiments were performed with a version of STAG1 which is tagged on its N-terminus, that is, different to the C-terminally tagged STAG2). These results indicate that a small subpopulation of cohesin<sup>STAG1</sup> stably associates with chromatin in G1 in HeLa cells. We suspect that previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Gerlich et al., 2006</xref>) failed to detect these complexes because they only represent about 9% of all cohesin complexes (37% of cohesin<sup>STAG1</sup>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>, which represents 25% of all cohesin; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Holzmann et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>Since this stable population of G1 cohesin has not previously been described, we tested whether such a population also exists in mammalian cells other than HeLa.

We observed that approximately 20% of Scc1-LAP and 12% of Smc1-LAP were stably bound to chromatin in G1 in these cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3D and J</xref>) with a residence time of 3 hr (Scc1-LAP; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3F</xref>) and 5 hr (Smc1-LAP; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3L</xref>).

Importantly, the number of acetyl-SMC3 peaks was reduced by ESCO1 depletion from 15,229 to 8,850, indicating that this antibody preferentially recognizes the acetylated form of SMC3 and not just unmodified SMC3 with reduced affinity (for a representative example, see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>).</p><p>We then used Hi-C to generate high resolution genome architecture maps in wild type HeLa cells (Hi-C map 1 in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>; 916 million unique read pairs).

We suspect that this difference is an underestimate of the specific enrichment of acetyl-SMC3 at loop anchors, as the pan-SMC3 profile presumably represents the sum of unmodified and acetylated SMC3, and because due to the resolution of our Hi-C maps, the loop anchors were on average 9 kb long and contained on average three SMC3 peaks and one acetyl-SMC3 peak.

In all six test loops, but not in the control genomic region, the inter-probe distance increased following depletion of SCC1 or following depletion of STAG1 in combination with STAG2. Depletion of CTCF also led to an increase in inter-probe distance in five out of six test loops, consistent with CTCF’s proposed function as a boundary for loop formation. This indicates that this experimental setup can detect cohesin and CTCF-specific changes in chromatin architecture in single cells. Importantly, in five out of six test loops, depletion of STAG1 alone led to a greater increase in inter-probe distance than depletion of STAG2.

These results indicate that cohesin<sup>STAG1</sup> forms long-range chromatin interactions that are anchored at convergent CTCF sites and raises the interesting possibility that WAPL is required for the CTCF convergence rule (see Discussion). Second, the genomic distance with highest contact probability was similar in STAG2-depleted cells (800 kb) and in WAPL depleted cells (900 kb), i.e., much longer than in control cells (200 kb) and in STAG1 depleted cells (300 kb; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F</xref>). Third, more loops &gt; 500 kb could be detected in STAG2-depleted cells by hiccups than in control cells, similar to the situation in WAPL depleted cells where an even higher number of loops &gt; 500 kb could be detected.

As concluded previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Nora et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Wutz et al., 2017</xref>), these results suggest that CTCF is not required for long-range chromatin interactions per se but for specifying the loop anchors which mediate these, possibly by functioning as a boundary for loop extruding cohesin complexes.

This raises the interesting possibility that ESCO1, like CTCF, is important for restricting cohesin’s loop formation activity (see Discussion).</p><p>However, a comparison of Hi-C phenotypes between ESCO1-depleted and CTCF-depleted cells did not only reveal similarities but also differences. First, compared to both CTCF-depleted and control cells, contact frequencies were reduced in the 0–50 kb range following ESCO1 depletion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7F</xref>). Second, ESCO1 depletion also resulted in an increase in contact probability around 20 Mb, the genomic distance associated with compartmentalization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7F</xref>). Consistently, the analysis of whole chromosome Hi-C maps revealed that depletion of ESCO1, either alone or in combination with STAG2 depletion, enhanced the ‘checkerboard’ pattern indicative of compartmentalization and led to a strong increase in interactions around 10 Mb (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>). Genome-wide aggregate analysis of 50 compartment categories ranging from strong B to strong A compartments confirmed this, showing increasing contact enrichment between similar compartment categories and a decreasing contact enrichment between dissimilar (e.g., strong A and strong B) compartment bins in both long <italic>cis</italic> (&gt;2 Mb) and <italic>trans</italic> interactions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1G</xref>).

Little is known about the lifetime of these loops and how their formation and maintenance is controlled. It has generally been assumed that loops are short-lived dynamic structures because the cohesin complexes that form them interact with DNA only briefly, in mammalian cells on average for 8–25 min during G0 and G1 phase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Gerlich et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Tedeschi et al., 2013</xref>), after which they are released by WAPL (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Kueng et al., 2006</xref>).

It is not known whether these stable structures are maintained by dynamically exchanging cohesin complexes or by an unknown mechanism that would protect cohesin from release by WAPL. Precedence for the latter scenario comes from the observation that cohesin complexes that mediate cohesion in proliferating cells are protected from WAPL by acetylation of their SMC3 subunit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Rolef Ben-Shahar et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Unal et al., 2008</xref>), by subsequent recruitment of sororin and at mitotic centromeres also by shugoshin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Hara et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Nishiyama et al., 2010</xref>).

It has therefore remained unknown whether loop forming cohesin complexes can be protected from WAPL to extend the lifetime of chromatin loops.</p><p>Here we provide evidence that such a regulatory mechanism exists in human cells, since our FRAP and Hi-C experiments have identified a small subpopulation of cohesin<sup>STAG1</sup> complexes that persist on chromatin for hours and contribute to the formation of long chromatin loops. Our results indicate that the stabilization of these cohesin<sup>STAG1</sup> complexes on chromatin depends on SMC3 acetylation, as does the stabilization of cohesive cohesin in S and G2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Ladurner et al., 2016</xref>). But in contrast to cohesive cohesin, loop forming cohesin<sup>STAG1</sup> complexes can persist on chromatin for hours in the absence of sororin, as one might have predicted since sororin is only present in proliferating cells, and in these almost exclusively from S phase until mitosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Nishiyama et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Rankin et al., 2005</xref>). Likewise, we suspect that shugoshin is dispensable for the long chromatin residence time of acetylated cohesin<sup>STAG1</sup>, since shugoshin specifically protects cohesive cohesin from WAPL at centromeres in mitosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Hara et al., 2014</xref>). Unexpectedly, however, we found that CTCF is essential for the long residence time of cohesin<sup>STAG1</sup> on chromatin, indicating that CTCF, like sororin and shugoshin, is a WAPL antagonist that can prevent cohesin from being released from DNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8A</xref>).</p><fig id="fig8" position="float"><label>Figure 8.</label><caption><title>Schematic model.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) ESCO1 and CTCF stabilize cohesin<sup>STAG1</sup> by inhibiting WAPL.

Interestingly, however, the extended loops formed by cohesin<sup>STAG1</sup> differ in one important aspect from the loops that are formed by cohesin in the absence of WAPL, in that the former are typically anchored at convergent CTCF sites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1G</xref>) whereas the latter are often anchored at tandemly oriented CTCF sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Haarhuis et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Wutz et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1G</xref>). This difference implies that WAPL may contribute to the CTCF convergence rule, that is may have a role in ensuring that loops are only anchored at convergent CTCF sites.</p><p>Our photobleaching experiments also revealed that most if not all cohesin<sup>STAG2</sup> complexes, which are three fold more abundant in HeLa cells than cohesin<sup>STAG1</sup> complexes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Holzmann et al., 2019</xref>), have short chromatin residence times in the range of minutes, implying that they are dynamically released from chromatin by WAPL. Accordingly, CTCF depletion only had a small effect on their chromatin residence time. However, this does not exclude the possibility that CTCF would also be able to protect cohesin<sup>STAG2</sup> from WAPL under conditions where these complexes become stabilized on chromatin.</p><p>The existence of two different forms of cohesin with different chromatin residence times is reminiscent of the situation in mitotic chromosomes. Their structural organization is thought to depend on the sequential action of first condensin II to form large loops and then condensin I to form smaller, nested loops (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Gibcus et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Walther et al., 2018</xref>). It is unknown how interphase chromatin architecture is established upon exit from mitosis, but recent fluorescence correlation spectroscopy experiments indicate that STAG1 is recruited to chromatin earlier than STAG2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Cai et al., 2018</xref>). Given our finding that cohesin<sup>STAG1</sup> generates longer loops than cohesin<sup>STAG2</sup>, it is tempting to speculate that cohesin<sup>STAG1</sup> and cohesin<sup>STAG2</sup> function analogously to condensin II and condensin I in mitosis, respectively, by forming loops within loops on interphase chromatin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8B</xref>).</p><p>Consistent with our findings, it has recently been reported that cohesin<sup>STAG1</sup> and cohesin<sup>STAG2</sup> contribute to chromatin differently (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Casa et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Viny et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Cuadrado et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Kojic et al., 2018</xref>), with cohesin<sup>STAG1</sup> contributing more to TAD organization than cohesin<sup>STAG2</sup>. Cohesin<sup>STAG1</sup> has also been shown to be more resistant to biochemical salt extraction from chromatin than cohesin<sup>STAG2</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Kojic et al., 2018</xref>), but whether this property is related to the long chromatin residence time of acetylated cohesin<sup>STAG1</sup> reported here is unknown. Both our study and that of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Kojic et al. (2018)</xref> provide evidence that STAG1 and STAG2 are enriched at CTCF sites and enhancers, respectively. This raises the possibility that cohesin<sup>STAG2</sup> might regulate promoter–enhancer interactions. STAG2 is one of only twelve genes known to be mutated in more than four major human cancer types (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Lawrence et al., 2014</xref>). It is therefore possible that changes in gene expression following STAG2 mutation might be a common early event in human carcinogenesis.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>ESCO1 is needed to constrict cohesin at CTCF sites</title><p>The acetylation that protects cohesive cohesin from WAPL from S phase until mitosis is thought to depend on both ESCO1 and ESCO2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Ladurner et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Nishiyama et al., 2010</xref>). In contrast, acetylation of cohesin during G1 is only mediated by ESCO1, since ESCO2 is absent during this phase of the cell cycle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Alomer et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Minamino et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Rahman et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Whelan et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>). Our finding that ESCO1 is needed for a long chromatin residence time of a subpopulation of cohesin complexes and for their ability to form extended chromatin loops reveals for the first time a function of SMC3 acetylation in G0 and G1, and at the same time indicates that ESCO1 has a certain degree of substrate specificity, at least during G1 phase, by preferentially acetylating cohesin<sup>STAG1</sup>.</p><p>Interestingly, our results revealed that ESCO1 might also have another function in chromatin organization. ESCO1 depletion reduced the Hi-C dots and corner peaks specifically detected after STAG2 depletion, that is long chromatin loops formed by cohesin<sup>STAG1</sup>, as one would have predicted given that ESCO1 is required for the long residence time of a subpopulation of cohesin<sup>STAG1</sup>. However, in addition, ESCO1 also decreased TAD insulation, to an extent as seen after CTCF depletion. This implies that ESCO1 might have two functions in chromatin organization: protection of cohesin<sup>STAG1</sup> from WAPL, and a boundary function in loop extrusion. If ESCO1 has such a boundary function, this could help to explain why co-depletion of ESCO1 and ESCO2 with WAPL resulted in the formation of vermicelli in chicken DT40 cells, whereas in these cells WAPL depletion alone did not cause this phenotype (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Kawasumi et al., 2017</xref>). It is possible that in these experiments WAPL depletion increased the residence time of cohesin on chromatin, whereas depletion of ESCO1 compromised the function of CTCF boundaries, so that extruding cohesin complexes could form longer loops and ultimately accumulate in vermicelli domains.</p><p>The hypothesis that ESCO1 contributes to boundary function could also explain why PDS5A and PDS5B are required for boundary function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Wutz et al., 2017</xref>) because SMC3 acetylation by ESCO1 and ESCO2 has been shown to depend on PDS5A and PDS5B (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Minamino et al., 2015</xref>; for a similar dependency in yeast see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chan et al., 2013</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Vaur et al., 2012</xref>). It is therefore possible that one function of PDS5 proteins in chromatin architecture is to facilitate SMC3 acetylation by ESCO1. In addition, PDS5 proteins might influence chromatin architecture by other mechanisms as they are also required for WAPL-mediated release of cohesin from chromatin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chan et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Ouyang et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Shintomi and Hirano, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Wutz et al., 2017</xref>). Interestingly, we also observed a reduction in SMC3 acetylation following depletion of CTCF, indicating that SMC3 acetylation also depends on CTCF, and that the functions of ESCO1 and CTCF at chromatin boundaries might be interdependent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Busslinger et al., 2017</xref>; this study).</p><p>Consistent with our results, a role for the yeast ortholog of ESCO1 and ESCO2 (Eco1) in constraining cohesin’s ability to form mid-range chromatin interactions, together with a dual role for the PDS5A and PDS5B ortholog Pds5 in regulating Eco1 and Wapl was reported during preparation of this manuscript (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Dauban et al., 2020</xref>). The molecular mechanisms through which STAG1 and STAG2 alter the properties of cohesin remain to be understood, but our results suggest that cohesin<sup>STAG1</sup> is more frequently stabilized at CTCF sites via PDS5A, PDS5B and ESCO1 than cohesin<sup>STAG2</sup>. The regulation of chromatin boundaries by cohesin acetyltransferases and PDS5 proteins may therefore be an evolutionarily conserved mechanism, which might be spatially controlled in mammalian cells by CTCF.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table

Recovery of fluorescence was recorded over 10 min and 300 frames at 2 s intervals and normalized to 10 pre-bleach frames and background and cellular fluorescence measured with Fiji (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Schindelin et al., 2012</xref>). Recovery curves were analyzed using Berkeley Madonna (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.berkeleymadonna.com">www.berkeleymadonna.com</ext-link>). Curves were fitted by an exponential function with variables for free and transiently chromatin associated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Ladurner et al., 2014</xref>), dynamically and stably chromatin bound cohesin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Gerlich et al., 2006</xref>). Relative fractions and their residence times (reciprocal of the dissociation constant) were averaged and plotted using Prism software (GraphPad).</p><p>Inverse FRAP was used to specifically measure dynamics of cohesin bound to chromatin over several hours. To this end for SMC3-LAP (which is present in the nucleus and cytoplasm), an area covering the cell body was bleached except for a semicircle corresponding to approximately half of the nucleus, and cells were imaged intermittently using a motorized stage. Recovery was recorded over 2–4 hr at 3 min intervals and normalized as above. Curve fitting with single and bi-exponential function was used to deduce relative fractions and residence times of dynamic and stable cohesin on chromatin and plotted as above (see <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/rladurner/STAG1/blob/master/curvefit.ipynb">https://github.com/rladurner/STAG1/blob/master/curvefit.ipynb</ext-link>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Ladurner, 2020</xref>; copy archived at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/elifesciences-publications/STAG1">https://github.com/elifesciences-publications/STAG1</ext-link>). For STAG1-EGFP and EGFP-STAG2 (which show only nuclear GFP signal), iFRAP photobleaching was performed in half of nuclear regions with 2 iterations of 488 nm laser at max intensity after acquisition of two images. Fluorescence was measured in bleached- and unbleached regions followed by background subtraction with 1 min interval. iFRAP curves were normalized to the mean of the pre-bleach fluorescent intensity and to the first image after photobleaching. Curve fitting was performed with single exponential functions f(t)=EXP(-kOff1*t) or double exponential functions f(t)=a*EXP(-kOff1*t) +(1-a) *EXP(-kOff2*t) in R using the minpack.lm package (version 1.2.1). Dynamic and stable residence times were calculated from 1/kOff1 and 1/kOff2 respectively. Double exponential curve fitting was performed under constraint that 1/kOff1 and 1/kOff2 are in range between 1 min-40 min and 1.5 hr-15 hr respectively. Soluble fractions were estimated by the reduction of fluorescence signals in unbleached area after photobleaching.</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>Chromatin fractionation</title><p>Cells were extracted in a buffer consisting of 20 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 100 mM NaCl, 5 mM MgCl, 2 mM NaF, 10% glycerol, 0.2% NP40, 20 mM β-glycerophosphate, 0.5 mM DTT and protease inhibitor cocktail (Complete EDTA-free, Roche).

Probes were labelled by nick translation using 1–2 µg DNA per 50 µL reaction (Sigma Aldrich). Probes were fluorescently labelled using Alexa dyes (Alexa-488, Alexa-568). Every 5 µL of nick-translated probe was ethanol precipitated together with 1 µL of salmon sperm DNA, 3 µL human Cot-1, 0.5 µL 3M sodium acetate and 60 µL ethanol 100%. Probes were then snap frozen in liquid nitrogen and centrifuged at 13000 rpm for 10 min at four degrees. The supernatant was carefully removed and replaced with 200 µL of ethanol 70%, and the probe mixture was centrifuged at 13000 rpm for 10 min at four degrees. The supernatant was carefully removed and the pellet air dried protected from light. The pellet was resuspended in 5 µL hybridization buffer (2xSSC, 20% w/v dextran sulfate, 50% formamide pH7) at 37 degrees for 10 min then denatured for 7 min at 80 degrees and incubated at 37 degrees for 30 min before use. HeLa cells were cultured, siRNA treated and synchronized on coverslips. Cells were quickly rinsed with PBS three times and fixed in a solution of PBS with 4% paraformaldehyde for 10 min at room temperature. Cells were then washed twice in PBS for 5 min each. Permeabilization of cells was performed in freshly made PBS, 0.5 Triton X-100 for 7 min on ice. Cells were washed twice with a solution of ethanol 70% for 5 min and dehydrated in 80%, 95% and 100% ethanol for 3 min each. Cells were then air dried and denatured in 50% formamide, 2xSSC adjusted at pH 7.2 for 30 min at 80 degrees. Cells were washed three times in cold 2xSSC. The coverslip was placed cell-side down onto the prepared fluorescently labelled probes on a slide and sealed with glue. Hybridization was performed overnight at 42 degrees in a dark and humid chamber. The glue was then removed carefully, and coverslips were placed cell-side up and washed protected from light three times in warm 50% formamide, 2xSSC pH 7.2 for 5 min each at 42 degrees and three times in 2xSSC for 5 min. Cells were briefly washed in 2xSSC at room temperature and counterstain in 0.2 mg/mL DAPI solution for 2 min at room temperature and washed twice in 2xSSC for 5 min each. Coverslips were dried and mounted in Vectashield and fixed with a minimal amount of nail varnish. Acquisitions were performed on LSM 880 and 780 confocal microscopes. After tile scan, hundreds of single nuclei positions were spotted using DAPI channel in X, Y and Z. Three-dimensional acquisitions were then made for each of these positions for all channels and saved for processing.</p><p>Batch Alleles Investigation Tool ‘BAIT’ was designed to run on Definiens software and measure FISH three-dimensional inter-probe distances automatically. Nucleus segmentation was performed in three-dimensions by use of the auto-threshold function of Definiens on DAPI staining. Nuclear boundaries were analyzed to detect and discard incomplete nuclei in X, Y and Z. Probes signals were determined as pixel intensity values within the nucleus. To comparison size and intensity of the signals, geometrical measurements were performed to set an object center ‘Seed’ and clusters of spots ‘Allele’ for and between each channel. Spot center distances were then calculated in three dimensions and exported as comma-separated values (.csv). Quality control was performed under Definiens to detect aberrations and artefacts. Statistics were performed using R. Violin distribution plots were made with Prism 8. Figures were made with Fiji standard deviation projection.</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>Comparison of FISH results with Hi-C maps</title><p>Numbers are given for the most densely populated square at highest resolution within the range of the loop coordinates targeted by our FISH probes. High-resolution Hi-C maps for control, STAG1-RNAi, and STAG2-RNAi at 5 Kb nominal resolution were generated using Juicebox Values indicate unique contact counts with KR (balanced) normalization, and no normalization applied.</p></sec><sec id="s4-10"><title>Length distribution, CTCF occupancy, and CTCF orientation of loops</title><p>The length of each loop was calculated as the distance between the midpoints of the loop anchors, and the length distributions of loops in each group were visualized with the empirical cumulative distribution function.</p><p>To determine CTCF occupancy, we expanded loop anchors smaller than 15 kb to 15 kb and counted the number of anchors that overlap with at least one CTCF ChIP-seq peak using bedtools. We calculated fold enrichment of CTCF occupancy by comparing the counts with the average overlap of ten random translational controls with the same length distribution as the loop anchors. Orientation of CTCF motifs at loop anchors was identified using MotifFinder in Juicer, and the proportion of inward oriented (following the convergent rule) CTCF motifs was reported.</p></sec><sec id="s4-11"><title>Aggregate peak analysis (APA) of loops</title><p>We performed aggregate peak analysis of <italic>hiccups</italic>-called loops using juicer_tools apa. The aggregate enrichment of our sets of looping peaks in contact matrices was visualized by plotting a cumulative stack of sub-matrices around detected loop coordinates. For a map with 10 Kb resolution we generated squares of 210 Kb x 210 Kb summing all putative loop peaks in a way that the resulting APA plot displays the total number of contacts which lie within the entire loop set at the center of the matrix within the aggregate pile-ups of their surroundings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Rao et al., 2014</xref>). All underlying matrices are KR-normalized.</p></sec><sec id="s4-12"><title>Aggregate analysis of TADs</title><p>For the analysis and visualization of average TAD pileups we generated size-sorted and -classified lists of TADs and calculated histogram matrices around the centers of those TAD areas within narrow predefined size ranges. That way several sub-matrices of interaction around similarly size-classified TADs were added up in order to generate a global profile of one size-range for every Hi-C matrix (10 Kb resolution, coverage-normalization).</p></sec><sec id="s4-13"><title>Hi-C insulation plots</title><p>Plots of the insulation scores were made based on insulation bedGraph files and TAD boundary coordinates generated by using the 'findTADsAndLoops.pl' script in the HOMER software package. This software scans relative contact matrices for locally dense regions of contacts or areas with an increased degree of intra-domain interactions relative to surrounding regions. Using a resolution of 3000, a window size of 15000, and the default maximum interaction distance (2 MB), we generated a coordinate set of sites with maximal transition in contact orientation, that is sites with highest insulation. Average plots of insulation profiles in all samples were made from regions cantered around the coordinates in the respective bedGraph files.</p></sec><sec id="s4-14"><title>Simulations</title><p>Molecular dynamic simulations were performed using HOOMD-blue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Anderson et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Glaser et al., 2015</xref>) using an approach similar to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Sanborn et al. (2015)</xref> with minor modifications. The region 17.65–19.25 mb on chromosome nine under wild type, STAG1-RNAi, and STAG2-RNAi conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>) was simulated as a polymer of length 2000, each monomer representing 1 kb of chromatin, for a total of 850000 times steps. A total of 480 replicated simulations were performed and aggregated into a single contact map. All simulations contained an average of three cohesin complexes actively extruding chromatin to form loops. The probability for one end of the extrusion complex to halt at a particular locus was derived from CTCF ChIP-seq data in HeLa cells (ENCODE phase 2, Broad Institute, file ENCFF000BAN), normalized to a probability between 0 and 1. Each halted end of an extrusion complex also had a 0.05% probability to continue sliding at each time step (halting lifetime of ~2000 time steps). In addition, extrusion complexes have had predefined average lifetime on chromatin, and changes in STAG1 and STAG2 levels were simulated by modulating the extrusion lifetime. Wild type extrusion complexes had an average lifetime of 5000 timesteps (0.02% chance of dissociating at each time step) while STAG1-RNAi had 5-fold higher lifetimes and STAG2-RNAi had 2-fold lower lifetimes.</p><p>Simplified simulations of short, medium, or long extrusion lifetimes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>) were performed similarly. Chromatin was represented as polymers of length 1000 containing an average of three extrusion complexes. The two outermost CTCF binding sites had halting probabilities of 0.9 while the inner four binding sites had halting probabilities of 0.4. Halted extrusion ends had a 0.01% probability to continue sliding. Short, medium, and long extrusion lifetimes were modeled as complexes with lifetimes of 312.5, 625, and 10000-time steps respectively.</p></sec><sec id="s4-15"><title>ChIP-seq peak calling and calculation of peak overlaps</title><p>Peaks were called by the MACS algorithm version 1.4.2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Zhang et al., 2008</xref>), using a P-value threshold of 1e-10 and by using sample and input read files.

In brief, the in situ Hi-C protocol involves crosslinking cells with formaldehyde, permeabilizing nuclei with detergent, digesting DNA overnight using a 4-cutter restriction enzyme, filling in 5’-overhangs while incorporating a biotinylated nucleotide, ligating newly blunted ends together, shearing DNA, capturing biotinylated ligation junctions with streptavidin beads, and analysing the resulting fragments with paired-end sequencing.

cohesin<sup>STAG1</sup> from WAPL&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by a Senior Editor, a Reviewing Editor, and two reviewers. The following individuals involved in review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Hongtao Yu (Reviewer #2).</p><p>We find your manuscript of interest and would like to invite you to prepare a revised submission. The reviewers have provided thoughtful comments and we would like to see some of their concerns addressed directly in a revised manuscript.</p><p>One main concern is that you may have overstated the conclusion that ESCO1 and CTCF promote the loop-forming ability of cohesin-STAG1 through antagonizing WAPL. Reviewer 2 suggests that this is more of an inference from what is currently known about WAPL. You may wish to address this concern by adding more epistasis analyses among ESCO1, CTCF, and WAPL. Or else you might consider toning down the conclusion.</p><p>We also agree that the dual use of TADs and loops will be confusing for the reader. They are not synonymous and should be treated differently. Please define their usage clearly and reference the terms as appropriate in the text.</p><p>Finally, we also agree that critical information in the supplement should be moved to the main figures where possible. <italic>eLife</italic> has a flexible format which allows you to present more data in the main figures.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic></p><p>The manuscript describes an analysis of the separate roles of STAG1, STAG2, CTCF, SCO1, and WAPL in the formation of strong point-to-point interactions manifested as loops in Hi-C experiments. Results suggest that the residence time of these various proteins and their acetylated forms explain their ability to form loops of different lengths and strengths by cohesin extrusion.</p><p>The results presented in the manuscript are significant because they offer mechanistic insights into how different forms of cohesin can form different types of interactions. Although not addressed in the manuscript, this may translate into different functional outcomes for various loop types in the regulation of enhancer-promoter interactions. The results are significant and of broad interest, and the manuscript is suitable for publication in <italic>eLife</italic>.</p><p>1) Too much important information is presented in the supplemental figures. I'm not sure what the restrictions for numbers of figures are in <italic>eLife</italic> but, if possible, authors should move some of the information from supplemental to main figures.</p><p>2) Simultaneous use of the terms &quot;TADs&quot; and &quot;loops&quot; is confusing. Are the two domains the same or different? Since authors are only talking about CTCF/cohesin-mediated structures, perhaps they should only use the term loop. If &quot;TAD&quot; is used to refer to a different type of domain, authors should explain how this domain is different from CTCF/cohesin loops.</p><p>3) In subsection “Long-range chromatin interactions mediated by cohesinSTAG1 are similar but not identical to those observed in WAPL depleted cells”, &quot;loop calling by &quot;Juicer tool&quot;. Do you mean HiCCUPS?</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>The ring-shaped cohesin complex organizes the genome into loops and topology associated domains (TADs), thereby regulating transcription and recombination. Cohesin also entraps sister chromatids to mediate genome segregation during cell division. One of the four core cohesin subunits has two paralogs, STAG1 and STAG2, in vertebrate cells. STAG1 and STAG2 have somewhat redundant functions for sister-chromatid cohesion during cell division, but have non-redundant functions during development. Whether and how the two forms of cohesin perform different functions during interphase are unclear. In the current study, Wutz et al. show that cohesin-STAG1 is preferentially acetylated on its SMC3 subunit, has longer resident times on chromatin, and mediates the formation of longer chromosome loops. By contrast, cohesin-STAG2 is more dynamic on chromatin and mediates the formation of smaller loops. They further show that the long loops formed by cohesin-STAG1 requires the acetyltransferase ESCO1 and the chromatin insulator CTCF, but not the cohesin-stabilization factor SORORIN. These data suggest that cohesin might organize the interphase genome through the formation of nested loops.</p><p>In addition to this main conclusion, the authors present evidence to suggest several other interesting points: (1) WAPL might directly contribute to the enrichment of cohesin at convergent CTCF sites; (2) CTCF promotes cohesin-STAG1 acetylation in G1; (3) ESCO1 counteracts compartmentalization of chromatin. These points, though not proven, can spur further investigations in the field.</p><p>Overall, I feel that the paper constitutes an important contribution to cohesin biology and should be published in <italic>eLife</italic>. The following major comments need to be addressed prior to publication.</p><p>Major comments:</p><p>1) The title suggests that ESCO1 and CTCF promote the loop-forming ability of cohesin-STAG1 through antagonizing WAPL. There are, however, not that many pieces of data in the manuscript that directly support this conclusion. It is more of an inference from current knowledge about WAPL regulation. The authors may wish to add more epistasis analyses among ESCO1, CTCF, and WAPL to bolster their claim. Alternatively, they can tone down their conclusion.</p><p>2) The HiC maps of STAG2 RNAi and STAG2/ESCO1 RNAi cells in Figure 6A are not that visibly different. Yet, the loop calling algorithms detect major changes. Can the authors comment on why this is? What is the key feature that the algorithms detect in the loops but is not apparent to the human eye?</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.52091.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1:</p><p>The manuscript describes an analysis of the separate roles of STAG1, STAG2, CTCF, SCO1, and WAPL in the formation of strong point-to-point interactions manifested as loops in Hi-C experiments.

We assume that at the molecular level TADs are composed of the same long-range interactions as loops and therefore agree that the term loop should be used as widely as possible. However, it is not possible to avoid the term TAD entirely as it represents a characteristic feature of Hi-C maps that needs to be analyzed and described.</p><p>To address these issues, we now amended the text by (i) explaining the terminology more explicitly in the first paragraph of the Introduction and (ii) by carefully using appropriate and specific wording throughout the text, i.e. we are only using the term TAD when describing characteristic pyramid-shaped structures in Hi-C maps.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) In subsection “Long-range chromatin interactions mediated by cohesinSTAG1 are similar but not identical to those observed in WAPL depleted cells”, &quot;loop calling by &quot;Juicer tool&quot;.

We have therefore now performed epistasis experiments in which we analyzed the effects of CTCF and WAPL depletion on the chromatin residence time of cohesin<sup>STAG1</sup>. These experiments revealed that the decrease in chromatin residence time that is caused by CTCF depletion is reverted by co-depletion of WAPL, as is shown in the new Figure 3F and G. These results support our hypothesis that CTCF protects cohesin<sup>STAG1</sup> from release by WAPL.</p><p>For technical reasons we have not yet been able to perform the equivalent epistasis experiments for ESCO1 and WAPL. Since these experiments would require significantly more time, we have decided to town down our conclusions in this case.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) The HiC maps of STAG2 RNAi and STAG2/ESCO1 RNAi cells in Figure 6A are not that visibly different.

We suspect that this impression is caused by the resolution of the compressed images in which the Hi-C maps are shown in the figure, which is much lower than the resolution of the Hi-C maps that are analyzed by HiCCUPs at the level of individual pixels which are being compared for intensity differences.</p></body></sub-article></article>
