aggregation. Little is known about sHSP structure beyond its structured α-crystallin domain (ACD), which is flanked by disordered regions. In the human sHSP HSPB1, the disordered N-terminal region (NTR) represents nearly 50% of the sequence. Here, we present a hybrid approach involving NMR, hydrogen-deuterium exchange mass spectrometry, and modeling to provide the first residue-level characterization of the NTR. The results support a model in which multiple grooves on the ACD interact with specific NTR regions, creating an ensemble of ‘quasi-ordered’ NTR states that can give rise to the known heterogeneity and plasticity of HSPB1. Phosphorylation-dependent interactions inform a mechanism by which HSPB1 is activated under stress conditions. Additionally, we examine the effects of disease-associated NTR mutations on HSPB1 structure and dynamics, leveraging our emerging structural insights.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>small heat shock protein</kwd><kwd>intrinsically disordered protein</kwd><kwd>HSPB1</kwd><kwd>HDXMS</kwd><kwd>NMR</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>None</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000053</institution-id><institution>National Eye Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01 EY017370</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Klevit</surname><given-names>Rachel E</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000057</institution-id><institution>National Institute of General Medical Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01 GM127579</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Guttman</surname><given-names>Miklos</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000057</institution-id><institution>National Institute of General Medical Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>NIH T32 GM008268</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Clouser</surname><given-names>Amanda F</given-names></name><name><surname>Baughman</surname><given-names>Hannah ER</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Multiple iso-energetic-specific interactions involving the intrinsically-disordered region of sHSP HSPB1 define a quasi-ordered state, providing insights into inherited disease-associated mutations within the region that are thought to be disordered.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Small heat shock proteins (sHSPs) are a class of molecular chaperones that help maintain cellular proteostasis. Like other heat shock proteins, sHSPs are believed to interact with exposed hydrophobic regions of partly unfolded or misfolded proteins to help prevent irreversible aggregation, but unlike other heat shock proteins, they perform their functions independent of ATP. sHSPs are implicated in numerous human diseases on the basis of inherited mutations in the protein sequence or upregulation in certain cancers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Datskevich et al., 2012</xref>). Cellular stressors such as oxidation and acidosis can influence their function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Clouser and Klevit, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Rajagopal et al., 2015a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chernik et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Alderson et al., 2019</xref>), and stress-induced phosphorylation of sHSPs typically increases their chaperone activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Rogalla et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Koteiche and McHaourab, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Ahmad et al., 2008</xref>). Despite their important roles in health and disease, relatively little is known about sHSP structure or structure-function relationships compared to other classes of chaperones.</p><p>Several properties make mammalian sHSPs particularly challenging for structural characterization. First and foremost, many sHSPs form large homo- and/or hetero-oligomers, and many of these exist as broad distributions of oligomeric species that contain different numbers of subunits. Furthermore, subunits exchange rapidly among oligomers, making it difficult to capture a single oligomeric state, or even a narrow distribution of states. Second, up to 50% of the sequence of sHSPs is believed to be intrinsically disordered and is unresolved in the few available structures of full-length sHSPs. Third, there is often local conformational heterogeneity even within ordered regions of the protein. Finally, the transient and promiscuous nature of interactions between sHSPs and client proteins makes it challenging to capture a sHSP/client complex of the sort that has fueled structural-mechanistic understanding of other chaperones. Our goal has been to develop hybrid strategies capable of providing structural/dynamical residue-level information on these challenging yet highly important systems.</p><p>sHSPs consist of three regions that also define different types of inter-subunit interactions in homo-oligomers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Most current structural information on human sHSPs is based on the structures of their defining feature, the central α-crystallin domain (ACD) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Rajagopal et al., 2015a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bagnéris et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Clark et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Baranova et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Rajagopal et al., 2015b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Hochberg et al., 2014</xref>). On their own, ACDs form dimers that are amenable to solution NMR and protein crystallography. Both sequentially and structurally conserved among the human paralogs, ACDs form an IgG-like β-sandwich fold of six or seven strands in truncated (ACD-only) structures and in the few oligomeric models and structures determined to date (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Jehle et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Braun et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Clark et al., 2018</xref>). ACDs dimerize by anti-parallel alignment of their β6+7 strands to form a long β-sheet dimer interface (ACD-ACD interaction). The flanking regions on either side of the ACD are far less conserved among paralogs and are predominantly disordered. The C-terminal region (CTR) is a relatively short extension that contains many charged residues and is highly flexible and disordered. CTRs are thought to serve as solubility tags for sHSPs. Most human sHSPs known to exist as large oligomers contain a three-residue motif of alternating Ile or Val residues known as the ‘IXI’ motif near the beginning of their CTR. IXI motifs can bind in a ‘knob-and-hole’ fashion into a groove formed between the top and bottom sheets of the ACD β-sandwich (the ‘β4/β8 groove’, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>), defining a second type of intermolecular interaction observed in sHSP oligomers (ACD-CTR interaction). Finally, the N-terminal region (NTR) is a relatively long extension (50–100 residues in vertebrates) that is presumed to be disordered based on secondary structure prediction and the lack of density in electron microscopy (EM) and X-ray crystallography-based structures of sHSPs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">McHaourab et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Kim et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">White et al., 2006</xref>). Relative to typical disordered regions, the NTR is enriched in hydrophobic and aromatic residues. Short regions of order have been observed in the NTR of HSPB5 by solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Jehle et al., 2011</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>), in a crystal structure of HSPB6 in complex with a client protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Sluchanko et al., 2017</xref>), and in a crystal structure of an HSPB2/HSPB3 heterotetramer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Clark et al., 2018</xref>). The lack of sequence conservation in the NTRs among paralogs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>) raises the question of whether there are similarities among structural features of NTRs of other sHSPs or whether each protein is idiosyncratic. As the NTR drives sHSP oligomerization and is thought to play a critical role in its chaperone activity, the paucity of structural insights has greatly slowed progress towards understanding these important proteostasis components.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.50259.002</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>sHSP domain architecture and sequence alignment.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) All sHSPs are defined by a conserved α-crystallin domain (ACD), that is flanked by N-terminal and C-terminal regions (NTR and CTR, respectively).

HSPB1 contains a single cysteine, located in the ACD, which was substituted with serine in NMR-PRE and HDXMS experiments across several constructs. Phosphorylation-mimicking mutations in the NTR along with mutation of the IXI motif in the CTR (to abrogate ACD-CTR interactions) yields a full-length dimer, used in HDXMS experiments here.

In addition to its canonical chaperone role, HSPB1 has been implicated in the apoptosis pathway and interacts with cytoskeleton proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Gusev et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Lanneau et al., 2008</xref>). Upregulation of HSPB1 has been observed in certain types of cancer and has therefore drawn attention as a potential therapeutic target (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Gibert et al., 2013</xref>). HSPB1 is phosphorylated within minutes after cells are subjected to stress by stress-related kinases at three NTR serine residues that are conserved among HSPB1 orthologs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A,C</xref>, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Larsen et al., 1997</xref>). Biochemical investigations have demonstrated that phosphorylated HSPB1 or phosphomimetic mutants form oligomers that are much smaller and more active than the distribution formed by unmodified HSPB1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Lambert et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Hayes et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Lelj-Garolla and Mauk, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">McDonald et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Jovcevski et al., 2015</xref>). Several inherited mutations in HSPB1 are reported to be associated with the severe neurological disorders Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease and distal hereditary motor neuropathy. Disease-associated mutations are harbored in all three regions of the protein, with overrepresentation in the NTR and in residues near the dimer interface of the ACD, and most appear to be autosomal dominant. Little is known about the structural mechanism for phosphorylation-dependent dispersion of HSPB1 into smaller oligomers or the structural effects of disease-associated mutations.</p><p>Here, we present the first residue-level structural analysis of full-length HSPB1, using a hybrid experimental approach of NMR spectroscopy and hydrogen-deuterium exchange mass spectrometry (HDXMS). Our study sheds light on the structural consequences of stress-induced phosphorylation and disease-associated mutations in HSPB1. We focus first on a dimeric species that represents a fully dissociated, stress-activated form of HSPB1 (‘HSPB1<sub>dimer</sub>’) that is as effective at delaying the aggregation of the client protein, tau, as oligomeric wild-type (WT) HSPB1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Baughman et al., 2018</xref>). The dimer is generated by three phosphorylation-mimicking substitutions in the NTR (S15D, S78D, and S82D) and substitution of the CTR IXI motif to ‘GXG’ (<sup>179</sup>ITIPV<sup>183</sup> to GTGPG) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Due to its monodisperse nature and relatively low molecular weight, the construct is amenable to residue-level analysis by solution-state NMR. Application of HDXMS to HSPB1<sub>dimer</sub> revealed regions of the NTR that are protected from exchange, consistent with the presence of transient order. We defined sub-regions of the NTR based in part on HDXMS behavior, as illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>, and performed two types of NMR experiments. NMR binding experiments using peptides containing the NTR sub-regions and PRE experiments in which spin labels were placed in each sub-region. Together, these approaches revealed that, although the NTR is predominantly disordered, there are nevertheless specific interactions between the NTR and ACD in the context of full-length HSPB1. HDXMS data obtained for WT-HSPB1 oligomers show remarkably similar patterns of protection, consistent with the interactions and order defined in the HSPB1<sub>dimer</sub> being conserved in the context of oligomeric HSPB1. Finally, HDXMS analysis of disease-associated mutations in HSPB1 reveals that the NTR is highly sensitive to single residue changes, resulting in non-local structural effects.</p><p>Altogether, our results show that even in a monodisperse form of HSPB1, there is substantial conformational heterogeneity, with multiple, specific contacts between regions of the NTR and the ACD. These contacts are altered in activation-mimicking and disease-associated mutated states, shedding light on the mechanisms by which perturbations such as phosphorylation or mutation can influence sHSP structure and function. The experimental approach presented here can be applied to other structurally heterogeneous systems that have proven difficult to study by traditional means, particularly those containing a mixture of ordered and disordered regions.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>The disordered NTR makes extensive contacts with the ACD</title><p>Atomic-level structural information for HSPB1 ACD and CTR regions is available from crystallographic and NMR studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Baranova et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Rajagopal et al., 2015b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Hochberg et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Alderson et al., 2017</xref>). Given the crucial yet enigmatic role of the disordered NTR in sHSP oligomerization and function, we sought to expand structural studies to include the NTR. Although oligomeric forms of HSPB1 are too large to analyze by traditional solution-state NMR and are too heterogeneous to crystallize, our previously reported HSPB1<sub>dimer</sub> is amenable to solution-state NMR approaches (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Baughman et al., 2018</xref>). A construct in which the CTR is truncated to the same position as the end of our B1-ACD construct (residue 176) is also dimeric in the phosphomimic context (termed ‘NTR-ACD’, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Thus, HSPB1<sub>dimer</sub> and its truncated form provide the first opportunity to obtain residue-level information of a sHSP with its NTR in solution. The simplest model for HSPB1<sub>dimer</sub> would be a structured ACD dimer with flexible, disordered NTRs and CTRs that behave independently of other domains. Such a species would give rise to an NMR spectrum that would resemble that of the isolated ACD plus resonances that correspond to ‘random coil’ positions. The NMR spectrum of an HSPB1 construct that lacks both its NTR and CTR (‘B1-ACD’, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>) and forms a well-structured dimer has been assigned (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Rajagopal et al., 2015b</xref>).

NTR-ACD was therefore used for subsequent NMR studies to limit spectral overlap of CTR peaks with NTR peaks in the central portion of the HSQC spectrum corresponding to disordered residues. Most peaks corresponding to ACD residues could be identified and assigned from standard heteronuclear triple resonance NMR spectra collected on NTR-ACD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>, assignments deposited in BMRB). Despite the lack of precise overlap between the spectra of NTR-ACD and B1-ACD, the majority of residues in both contexts give rise to similar chemical shifts (<sup>1</sup>H, <sup>15</sup>N, and <sup>13</sup>C). The similarities of the chemical shift ‘fingerprints’ indicate that the ACD structure is retained in the two contexts. Therefore, the widespread <sup>15</sup>NH chemical shift perturbations (CSPs) observed for ACD resonances indicate differences in environment due to proximity of the NTR.</p><p>The largest perturbations in ACD peaks are for residues in the β3, β4, and β8 strands and loop L3/4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). These structural elements compose two grooves on the ACD dimer, known as the β4/β8 groove and the β3/β3 or ‘dimer interface’ groove (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). In some cases, resonances appear to be absent in the NTR-ACD spectrum altogether: we were unable to identify peaks for several residues despite having assignments for these in the B1-ACD spectrum (gray squares in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). Analysis of 3D-heteronuclear spectra used to assign the NTR-ACD spectrum failed to identify peaks with similar <sup>13</sup>C<sub>α</sub>/<sup>13</sup>C<sub>β</sub> chemical shifts for these residues, implying that resonances for these residues are not observed and are likely undergoing intermediate exchange between different conformations and/or chemical environments. As there is no evidence of slow chemical exchange in the context of B1-ACD, the broadening is likely due to dynamics and/or heterogeneity arising from the NTR. Altogether, the large perturbations indicate that the NTR interacts with the β4/β8 grooves at either end of the ACD dimer and the dimer interface at the center of the ACD.</p><p>Some ACD residues have multiple peaks in the NTR-ACD spectrum, indicating that they populate different chemical environments that interconvert slowly. The smallest difference in frequencies observed between multiple peaks from a single residue is 2 Hz, indicating a lifetime greater than 500 milliseconds. Notably, no peak doubling is observed in the B1-ACD spectrum. We could assign multiple peaks for four residues: positions 110 and 114 (flanking the β4 strand), position 148 (in loop L7/8, preceding the β8 strand), and residue 123 (in loop L5/6 between β5 and β6+7 strands). These positions are all near regions that exhibit CSPs and/or exchange broadening described above.</p><p>To investigate sources of the perturbations in ACD peaks in the NTR-ACD context, we examined NMR spectra of a mixture of <sup>15</sup>N-B1-ACD and unlabeled NTR-ACD. Under reducing conditions (to inhibit disulfide bond formation at the dimer interface), mixed dimers composed of one <sup>15</sup>N-B1-ACD subunit and one NTR-ACD subunit can form. This allowed us to observe perturbations in an ACD due to the NTR of its dimeric binding partner. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>, new peaks are observed in the spectrum of the mixture (red spectrum) that align with peaks in the NTR-ACD spectrum (blue spectrum). Peaks that exhibit this behavior nearly all correspond to residues in the β4/β8 groove and its flanking loops, predominantly the same residues whose peaks exhibit the largest CSPs compared to their position in the ACD-only spectrum (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). The congruence of certain peaks in the mixed-dimer spectrum with those in the NTR-ACD spectrum provides unambiguous evidence that their resonance positions arise from an interaction involving the NTR of the other subunit within a dimer. The identity of these peaks reveals that a site of interaction is the β4/β8 groove and its flanking loops. Additionally, many other peaks in the mixed-dimer spectrum lose intensity, shift, and/or change shape as compared to the B1-ACD spectrum. Such behavior is indicative of increased heterogeneity caused by multiple processes. Peaks that undergo such changes correspond to residues in the β3 strand and preceding residues and at the end of the β9 strand and start of the CTR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>). Overall, the extent of perturbations observed in this mixing experiment reveals wide scale NTR-ACD contact and establishes that NTR/ACD interactions can occur between subunits within a dimer.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Distinct regions of the NTR bind different ACD interfaces</title><p>To ask whether specific NTR regions interact with the ACD, we subdivided the NTR sequence into six sub-regions, referred to here as the distal region, aromatic region, conserved motif, tryptophan-rich region, insertion, and boundary region (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). We used NMR to test the ability of peptides from each region to bind to B1-ACD. As described below, peptides from the distal, aromatic, conserved motif, and boundary regions all caused distinct changes (either chemical shift perturbations, loss of peak intensity, or both) in the <sup>15</sup>N-HSQC spectrum of B1-ACD, implying specific interactions of these regions with the ACD. No perturbations were observed for the Trp-rich peptide, providing confidence that the effects observed for other peptides are specific.</p><p>We also performed paramagnetic relaxation enhancement (PRE) experiments to detect interactions between the NTR and the ACD within the context of the NTR-ACD construct. PRE from a spin label broadens resonances of residues proximal to the label. The sole native cysteine at position 137 was substituted with serine and multiple constructs were created in which a single cysteine residue was introduced at NTR sites to which the spin label MTSL was conjugated. Spin label positions were selected to probe each NTR region, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>. Before performing NMR experiments, each Cys mutant was assessed for alterations in secondary structure and oligomeric properties (by CD and SEC, respectively, data not shown). Only variants that retain HSPB1<sub>dimer</sub>-like properties were investigated further. <sup>15</sup>N and spin label were incorporated into these species and HSQC spectra of labeled dimers were collected with the active spin label and with the MTSL quenched by ascorbate. Quenched spectra were compared to the NTR-ACD spectrum to confirm that MTSL conjugation did not significantly perturb the constructs. PREs were quantified as ratios of peak intensity in active vs. quenched MTSL spectra. A range of behaviors was observed, depending on the spin label position: 1) strong, discrete effects, 2) smaller but still localized effects, or 3) widespread general effects.</p><p>As summarized in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>, the results from the PRE experiments agree well with the peptide-binding studies, confirming that the interactions observed in the peptide-binding studies are recapitulated in the full-length protein.

Importantly, peaks shift along a trajectory between their positions in the spectra of B1-ACD and NTR-ACD (as indicated by the arrows in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). This is strong evidence that the large perturbations observed for these peaks in the NTR-ACD spectrum (relative to B1-ACD) are due to binding of the NTR distal region to the β4/β8 groove. The peptide binding was not saturated in the NMR experiments, thereby producing smaller CSPs relative to the NTR-ACD spectrum. The effective concentration of the peptide when attached to the ACD in its native form will be in the millimolar range, so the effects observed when the peptide is added in <italic>trans</italic> are relevant to the native state. The results add clarity to the <sup>15</sup>N-B1-ACD/NTR-ACD mixing experiment described above (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). The new peaks that appear in positions that correspond to those observed in the NTR-ACD spectrum are due to distal region binding to the β4/β8 groove of the other subunit of the dimer in a ‘domain swap’ relationship. We cannot rule out the possibility of a similar intra-chain interaction, but if it occurs it must be essentially identical to the inter-chain one observed in the mixed dimer.</p><p>The spectrum of NTR-ACD with MTSL at position two has strong peak intensity loss in two distinct sequence regions that correspond to loops L7/8 and L4/5, both of which lie near one entrance to the β4/β8 groove (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figures 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">5A</xref>). Other peaks in the spectrum are largely unaffected by the spin label (i.e., I<sub>para</sub>/I<sub>dia</sub> ~ 1.0). This remarkably discrete PRE effect from a spin label at the extreme N-terminus of HSPB1 indicates that when the region is near the ACD, it inhabits a highly localized position. Furthermore, the PREs are consistent with only one of the two possible orientations of distal region binding in the groove, namely aligned parallel to the β8 strand and antiparallel to the β4 strand such that position two only contacts residues near the beginning of β8 and the end of β4. This is the opposite orientation from that observed for the CTR IXI motif bound in the β4/β8 groove observed in a crystal structure of HSPB1-ACD (4MJH) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Hochberg et al., 2014</xref>). Distal region binding to the β4/β8 groove has been observed in crystals of HSPB6 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Sluchanko et al., 2017</xref>) and an HSPB2/3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Clark et al., 2018</xref>) complex, but those sHSPs contain canonical IXI motifs in their NTRs. HSPB1 does not contain such a motif in its distal region; we propose instead that alternating hydrophobic residues in the HSPB1 segment <sup>6</sup>VPFSLL<sup>11</sup> bind, supporting the idea that other hydrophobic amino acids can participate in β4/β8 binding. Our results thus identify a novel interaction and indicate that motifs from both the NTR and CTR of HSPB1 can bind in the β4/β8 groove but are oriented in opposite directions within the groove.</p><p>Peptide binding and PRE results indicate that the conserved motif binds at the ACD dimer interface groove (i.e. strands β3 and β6+7 from each subunit), and that the aromatic sub-region spans between the β4/β8 groove and the dimer interface, connecting the distal region to the conserved motif. The aromatic peptide (residues 12–27) caused distinct chemical shift perturbations in peaks corresponding to one side of the ACD, primarily loops L3/4 and L5/6, as well as some residues in β6+7 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figures 3</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">4C and D</xref>). This is consistent with the orientation inferred for the distal region, and shows that as the NTR exits the β4/β8 groove, it contacts the side of the ACD via loops L3/4 and L5/6 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). The aromatic region contains one of the three HSPB1 phosphorylation sites (Ser15, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>), so we also tested binding by a version of the aromatic peptide containing phospho-serine at position 15. For the most part, the CSPs are absent or markedly reduced (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1A</xref>), indicating that phosphorylation of Ser15 serves to release the aromatic region from the ACD. We note that both L3/4 and L5/6 are enriched in negatively-charged amino acids (<sup>100</sup><underline>D</underline>VNHFAP<underline>DE</underline> and <sup>124</sup>H<underline>EE</underline>RQD<underline>E</underline>HG, respectively), suggesting an electrostatic mechanism by which phosphorylation at Ser15 could regulate HSPB1 structure and activity.</p><p>Conserved motif binding at the ACD dimer interface is indicated by intensity loss in peaks of residues in β3, β6+7, and in loop L3/4 upon addition of the conserved peptide to <sup>15</sup>N-B1-ACD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figures 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">4E</xref>). A spin label at the aromatic region/conserved motif boundary (position 26) causes subtle peak intensity loss localized to loops L3/4 and L8/9 leading out of the interface groove, as would be expected if the conserved motif is bound in the groove and the aromatic region runs along one side of the ACD between the β4/β8 groove and the dimer interface groove (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>). Conserved motif binding at the dimer interface groove has been observed in HSPB6 and in HSPB2/3 hetero-tetramer crystals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Clark et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Sluchanko et al., 2017</xref>). Given the high conservation of this motif and of residues that compose the dimer interface, it is likely that a similar relationship exists in HSPB1.</p><p>Although the Trp-rich peptide showed no detectable interactions with B1-ACD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref>), we were able to obtain some insights regarding its behavior. While attempting to introduce spin labels, we found the Trp-rich region to be highly sensitive to mutagenesis and were unable to probe its interactions through PRE experiments. Cysteine substitutions of S43 and V55 within the NTR-ACD construct yielded species larger than dimers and not amenable to NMR. An S50C NTR-ACD construct was dimeric but conjugation of MTSL at this position produced larger species. While the altered oligomeric propensity rendered these mutants unsuitable for PRE experiments, the ability of changes in this region to override the dimer-promoting mutations implicates the Trp-rich region in maintaining the delicate balance among oligomeric species. This sub-region harbors the disease-associated mutation P39L, which also affects HSPB1 oligomeric properties (see later section).</p><p>The insertion region was probed by a spin label at position 65, near the center of the region. Intermediate intensity loss was observed in most B1-ACD peaks, with some stronger effects in β9. The widespread but modest PREs suggest that the insertion region does not make sustained contact with any specific region of the ACD but rather ‘hovers’ over all faces of the ACD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>). The region was omitted from peptide binding experiments due to its hydrophobicity and insolubility in aqueous buffer. Nevertheless, we were able to obtain backbone assignments for this region, which gave further insight into its behavior (discussed in next section).</p><p>Finally, the boundary region appears to interact at the dimer interface groove, as evidenced both by peptide binding and PRE results (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figures 3</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">4G</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">5D and E</xref>). Addition of the boundary region peptide (residues 74–91) to B1-ACD caused intensity loss and CSPs in peaks corresponding to residues near the dimer interface (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figures 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">4G</xref>). We were able to incorporate spin labels at two boundary region positions, 83 and 91, which flank the predicted β2 strand (residues 86–88 in PDB 4MJH). The spin label at position 91 (S91-SL) caused distinct intensity loss in peaks from loops L5/6 and L7/8 and from residues at the beginning of β3 and end of β9 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figures 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">5E</xref>). The highly localized PREs on one side of the ACD are congruent with residue 91 being near the beginning of the β3 strand. In contrast, the spin label at position 83 caused wide-spread intensity loss in peaks corresponding to the dimer interface and the opposite side of the ACD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figures 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">5D</xref>). In this case, the ACD residues that are <italic>not</italic> affected by the spin-label are more informative: the data clearly show that position 83 does not approach loops L4/5, L7/8, and L9/CTR, all of which are localized on one side of the ACD dimer (the side affected by S91-SL). The fact that spin labels at positions flanking the putative β2 strand hit opposite sides of the ACD provides strong evidence that the boundary region spans the dimer interface groove in an antiparallel direction to strand β3, consistent with formation of a β2 strand. Whether this interaction is mutually exclusive with binding of the conserved motif to the dimer interface or can occur simultaneously cannot be deciphered from these experiments.</p><p>A boundary-region peptide that contains phospho-serine residues at positions 78 and 82 caused nearly identical perturbations to the non-phosphorylated peptide (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1B</xref>), indicating that phosphorylation neither directly disrupts nor enhances the interaction between the boundary region and the dimer interface groove. However, the PRE results from S83-SL indicate that this region approaches residues that are perturbed by the aromatic peptide (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figures 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">5D</xref>), suggesting that the boundary region phosphorylation sites may be close in space to the S15 phosphorylation site, despite being over 60 residues apart in sequence.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Conformational heterogeneity is observed throughout the NTR</title><p>Peaks that are not assigned to ACD residues in the <sup>1</sup>H-<sup>15</sup>N HSQC spectrum of NTR-ACD presumably arise mainly from the NTR. Many of these peaks are weak (but reproducible across multiple protein preps) and were not observed in low-sensitivity 3D heteronuclear spectra despite high levels of deuteration and use of high field magnets equipped with cryoprobes. For resonances that were detected in heteronuclear spectra, there was considerable degeneracy in chemical shifts (<sup>13</sup>C<sub>α</sub>/<sup>13</sup>C<sub>β</sub>), likely due to intrinsic disorder and/or conformational heterogeneity. While these properties hampered unambiguous assignment of NTR peaks, the weak and/or poorly-resolved peaks indicate that a majority of residues in the NTR exist in multiple environments, leading to their peak broadening. There are two clear exceptions: we were able to assign a contiguous stretch of residues that span the insertion and boundary regions, and several residues in the Trp-rich region.</p><p>Peaks corresponding to residues 62–79 could be assigned (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>); these span most of the (non-proline) residues of the insertion region and the start of the boundary region (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). All peaks assigned for this stretch have high intensities (similar to CTR, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>) and chemical shifts consistent with random coil structure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>). Only the N-terminal part of the boundary region is assigned, while the latter part of the boundary region that is predicted to form β2 could not be assigned. Notably, residues 64–69 were each assigned to two distinct peak sets, indicating two conformational states that interconvert slowly, despite their both having ‘random coil’ chemical shifts. Based on the observed chemical shift differences and the slow exchange condition, we can estimate an upper limit for the exchange rate of ~25 s<sup>−1</sup>. The second conformation represents a substantial fraction of the population, as judged from relative peak intensities (&gt;20%). A short contiguous stretch at the C-terminal end of the Trp-rich region (residues 46–49) was assigned, with Ser49 having two peak sets. Thus, both regions exist in at least two distinct conformations and/or environments. The observed behavior may arise from <italic>cis</italic> and <italic>trans</italic> conformations of one or more of the numerous proline residues in the insertion and Trp-rich regions. However, <sup>13</sup>C chemical shifts needed to confirm proline isomerization could not be obtained from the data and we did not pursue mutational analysis to identify the source(s) of heterogeneity due to the abundant prolines in the regions.</p><fig id="fig6" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.50259.011</object-id><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><title>Assignment of NTR residues reveal disorder and heterogeneity.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) <sup>1</sup>H-<sup>15</sup>N HSQC-TROSY spectrum of NTR-ACD, highlighting strong peaks in the center of the spectrum that correspond to disordered regions of the protein (NTR and CTR).

The spin label at insertion region residue 65 yields strong PREs across the assigned NTR peaks, validating their assignments to this region of the sequence. The position two spin label did not yield PREs in assigned NTR residues or in weak unassigned peaks, indicating that the distal region’s locations do not overlap with those of the Trp-rich or insertion regions. A position 26 spin label at the beginning of the conserved region gives modest-to-strong PREs to the Trp-rich and boundary regions but weak PREs to the insertion region. The position 83 spin label gave strong PREs to the boundary and insertion regions, and the position 91 spin label gave moderate PREs to the same regions. Together, this provides evidence for extensive interactions between the sub-regions of the NTR. In particular, the conserved and Trp-rich regions seem to be in close contact with each other, as are the insertion and boundary regions. Only the distal region appears not to make extensive contact with other parts of the NTR. The data support a model in which the NTR exists in a compact state with extensive NTR/ACD and NTR/NTR contacts as well as some residual structure, rather than a more flexible, extended conformation seen for many intrinsically disordered regions.</p><p>To investigate the dynamics of assigned NTR residues, we measured transverse relaxation rates (R2) of peaks in the NTR-ACD spectrum (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>).

NTR insertion sub-region residues and the final (unstructured) residues in the ACD have lower R2 values (around 10 s<sup>−1</sup>), consistent with higher flexibility. The limited number of other assigned NTR resonances have R2 values that range from around 20 s<sup>−1</sup> to ~60 s<sup>−1</sup>, consistent with greater conformational restriction of these NTR regions and/or exchange between multiple states on the millisecond timescale.</p><p>We used HDXMS to compare NTR properties in dimeric and oligomeric forms of HSPB1. Backbone amide protons in structured and/or buried regions exchange with deuterons more slowly (i.e., are ‘protected’ from exchange) than those in unstructured or accessible regions. HDXMS can be performed on proteins of any size under a variety of solution conditions, providing an opportunity to obtain peptide-level information on the dynamics of HSPB1 oligomers. Time courses of deuterium exchange from three seconds to one hour were measured at room temperature for C137S-HSPB1 oligomers and C137S-HSPB1<sub>dimer</sub>. The sole Cys residue, C137, that resides at the dimer interface was substituted to abrogate the need for reducing agent to inhibit disulfide bond formation across the dimer interface that could confound the analysis. Pepsin digestion yielded peptides across the full length of the protein (peptide statistics are shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig7sdata2">Figure 7—source data 2</xref>).</p><p>Deuterium uptake levels differed most dramatically across regions of HSPB1 in the earliest (3 s) timepoint, shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref> (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig7sdata1">Figure 7—source data 1</xref> for full kinetic information). The profile for HSPB1<sub>dimer</sub> (middle panel, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>) is congruent with observations and conclusions drawn from NMR presented above. Residues 87–172, which span the ACD, show protection even at the latest time point, which is consistent with its β-sandwich structure. Peptides within the aromatic, insert, and boundary regions in the NTR, along with the far C-terminal region (residues 187–205) of the CTR are all highly deuterated within 3 seconds, consistent with their lacking stable secondary structure. Interestingly, peptides along the distal, conserved, and Trp-rich regions of the NTR showed moderate protection, indicating the presence of some local structure. All peptides covering the distal region displayed a bimodal isotopic mass envelope at the early time points indicating that there are two distinct populations of the distal region: one that exchanges readily with deuterium and one that is protected (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1</xref>). The bimodal distributions observed for these peptides may reflect the populations of the NTR that are either bound and sequestered or free and solvent-accessible. A substantial protected population is present through 15 seconds, implying that the lifetime of the bound state is on the order of at least several seconds. All the other peptides outside of the distal region displayed only unimodal spectra in the HSPB1<sub>dimer</sub> dataset.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig7" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.50259.012</object-id><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><title>HDXMS analysis of WT oligomers and HSPB1<sub>dimer</sub> reveals changes in protection and heterogeneity in the NTR.</title><p>Representative peptides are indicated as horizontal bars.

As in the dimer, the insertion region, boundary region, and CTR have the highest rate of deuterium uptake, indicating that they remain unstructured and accessible in oligomers. However, the aromatic region shows more protection in oligomers than in HSPB1<sub>dimer</sub>, indicating some involvement in the oligomerization. The most striking feature of the oligomeric HSPB1 HDX profile is the large number of bimodal peptides that are observed. The distal region showed similar bimodal spectra as seen with the HSPB1<sub>dimer</sub>, except the relative population of the more protected species was diminished (~40% vs. 80%). Beyond the distal peptides, another six peptides have two distinguishable populations in the context of HSPB1 oligomers. Peptides that arise from the conserved, Trp-rich, and boundary regions in the NTR display two populations. The conserved and boundary regions were observed to interact with the ACD in the dimer context from NMR results, so either these interactions are longer-lived within the confines of oligomers, or they may also be directly involved in oligomeric interactions. The presence of a substantial protected population at 4 minutes indicates a lifetime of interaction of several minutes in the oligomeric context. In the CTR, a peptide that contains the IXI motif (mutated to GXG in HSPB1<sub>dimer</sub> to inhibit its binding to the β4/β8 groove) has a population (~45%) that is protected from deuterium exchange and one that is completely exchanged. This behavior is consistent with the notion that IXI-containing CTRs exist in both free and β4/β8-bound states.</p><p>The populations observed for the bimodal spectra are not sufficiently resolved along multiple timepoints to determine precise rates of slow conformational exchange (‘EX1 kinetics’) or to make quantitative comparisons. Nevertheless, qualitative comparisons at the well-resolved 3 s timepoint can be made between regions or between protein constructs. The weighted average deuteration for each peptide with bimodal exchange in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref> provides a qualitative estimate of the relative populations of ‘bound’ and ‘free’ states. For example, both the distal and IXI-CTR peptides show a substantial proportion (~40–45%) of the region in a protected state. These two regions bind to the same ACD groove, creating a situation where there are twice as many potential β4/β8 groove-binding sequences as there are grooves. The HDX data indicate that enough groove-binding sequences are solvent-protected to imply that the majority of β4/β8 grooves are occupied in HSPB1 oligomers and that, on average, half the distal sub-regions and half the CTR-IXIs are bound.</p><p>To get a more complete overall picture of what else is different in the oligomeric form, we compared the deuteration levels for each identical peptide that could be identified between HSPB1<sub>dimer</sub> and HSPB1 oligomers, using the weighted average percent deuteration for bimodal peptides. In the bottom panel of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>, peptides that appear above the 0% line are more protected in oligomers and peptides that fall below the 0% lines are more protected in dimers. Overall, the ACD displays similar deuterium uptake regardless of whether it is in an isolated dimer or a large oligomer. This indicates that the extent of deuterium exchange at this timepoint is predominantly dictated by the β-sandwich structure. All peptides arising from the distal region show more protection in HSPB1<sub>dimer</sub>, with the weighted deuteration skewed to the more protected state (larger proportion) consistent with a larger fraction of the N-terminus bound in the dimer. This may be due to the CTR mutations introduced to generate the dimer, as the lack of IXI motif in the CTR removes it from competition for the β4/β8 groove. Two other contiguous peptides (33–41 and 42–62) that span conserved and Trp-rich regions show greater protection in the dimer. The overlapping 29–41 peptide is more protected in the oligomer, indicating that protection occurs in the first few residues of the peptide in oligomers, whereas protection occurs in later residues in the dimer, consistent with distinct interactions or structural features. The NMR results identified an interaction between the conserved region and the ACD dimer interface, but provided no evidence for an interaction involving the Trp-rich region and the ACD. According to secondary structure predictions, the Trp-rich region has the highest propensity of any NTR region to adopt secondary structure. Intriguingly, the CD spectrum of HSPB1<sub>dimer</sub>, but not HSPB1 oligomer, has an unusual positive peak at 230 nm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Baughman et al., 2018</xref>). Similar features have been attributed to exciton couplets that can arise from interactions between Trp rings. Together, the HDX and CD data suggest that the Trp-rich region adopts specific structure in dimeric species that is not populated to a detectable degree in the oligomer. The two regions that are less protected in HSPB1<sub>dimer</sub> are the aromatic and boundary regions, which contain the phosphorylation-mimicking mutations. The NMR data indicate that the conserved and boundary regions both interact with the dimer interface groove. The increased accessibility of the aromatic region is consistent with the reduced binding of the phosphorylated form of the aromatic peptide. It is possible that release of the aromatic region, which neighbors the conserved region, is coupled to decreased protection of the boundary region. Formation of a new structural feature involving the Trp-rich region might only be possible when neighboring regions are released from their ACD contacts.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>Modeling inter-region interactions in HSPB1<sub>dimer</sub></title><p>The results presented above indicate that the HSPB1 NTR contains distinct regions that reside in specific locations relative to the well-defined ACD dimer and that, in many cases, make direct contact with the ACD. We sought to combine the information garnered from the peptide-binding, PRE, and HDXMS experiments into a set of structural models. Our goals for this modeling process were two-fold. First, the models aid in visualization of the NTR-ACD interactions described above. Second, the modeling process allows us to determine which combinations of NTR-ACD interactions can generate physically realistic structural models, and thus whether any combination of NTR-ACD interactions may not be physically possible. These structures are intended neither as a complete sampling of HSPB1 conformational space nor as atomic-level models of specific interactions.</p><p>We produced a homology model by combining the crystal structure of the HSPB1 ACD (PDB 4MJH) with peptides from the crystal structure of the HSPB2/3 hetero-tetramer (PDB 6F2R) using the PyMOL Molecular Graphics System. The starting model included all of the possible NTR-ACD interactions identified above: two copies of the β2 strand, a distal motif bound in each β4/β8 groove, and a copy of the conserved motif bound in the dimer interface groove. Clashes between the HSPB1 ACD structure and the peptides from the HSPB2/3 crystal structure were eliminated and missing loops were modeled in using PyRosetta. In total, there are four possible ways to connect the fragments in the homology model: either copy of the distal motif in the β4/β8 grooves could be connected to the conserved motif at the dimer interface, and the conserved motif could be connected to either copy of the β2 strand (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8A</xref>). In total, we created four ensembles of 100 structural models, which each sampled a different way of connecting the NTR peptide fragments in our initial homology model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8B, C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s1">Figure 8—figure supplement 1</xref>). We found that it was possible to develop realistic structural models that contain all types of NTR-ACD interactions identified above, as well as all possible loop connectivities. The dimer interface groove is able to accommodate two copies of the β2 strand in addition to the conserved motif, and both β4/β8 grooves are able to bind a copy of the distal motif. These peptide fragments can be connected to each other in all four conceivable ways.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig8" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.50259.017</object-id><label>Figure 8.</label><caption><title>Modeling of NTR-ACD interactions.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Cartoon showing the starting structure of the ACD with two copies of the distal motif (red arrows), one copy of the conserved motif (orange arrow), and two copies of β2 (blue arrows).

Given our peptide-binding NMR results for the aromatic region, we believe that this configuration is favored, particularly in the non-phosphorylated state. Nevertheless, it is also physically possible for the aromatic region to connect the conserved motif to the distal region in the opposite groove, in which case it spans across the top of the ACD β-sandwich, contacting the β8, β9, and β3 strands (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s1">Figure 8—figure supplement 1</xref>). While we do not observe experimental evidence for this interaction, we cannot rule it out, particularly in the phosphorylated state in which the aromatic region has low affinity for the ACD. In either case, the conserved motif can then be connected to either one of the β2 strands, while the distal motif not connected to the bound conserved motif can be connected to the other. These connections consist of ~50–75 residues and contain part of the boundary region, the insertion region, the Trp-rich region, and (for the chain with an unbound conserved motif) the conserved and aromatic regions. Given their length, they can adopt multiple conformations and orientations relative to the ACD. We have omitted these regions from the models shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref> and its supplement for clarity and to avoid over-interpretation of the structural aspects of regions for which we have limited experimental data. Surface representations of these models show that the locations of the NTR sub-regions are in good agreement with the ACD surfaces perturbed in the peptide binding and PRE NMR experiments (comparing <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref> with <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8E</xref>).</p><p>Overall, the results from the modeling suggest that any combination of the NTR-ACD interactions defined in our study is physically feasible. While we only created models containing the maximum NTR-ACD interactions supported by our experimental data, any of the interacting motifs we have modeled could dissociate from the ACD and adopt a more disordered conformation. The results from our NMR and HDXMS experiments indicate that most of these NTR regions occupy both ACD-bound and ACD-unbound conformations, so it is likely that multiple combinations of NTR/ACD interactions occur in solution. Additionally, the similarity of protected regions in the HDXMS profiles of HSPB1 dimers and oligomers indicate that the interactions depicted in these models also occur within higher-order oligomers. The peptide fragments depicted in our dimeric models could conceivably be connected to other ACD dimers or monomers within an oligomer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8D</xref>). The array of possible interactions within sHSP oligomers is depicted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8F</xref>. Many regions can form intra-chain, intra-dimer, and inter-dimer interactions. The possibility for multiple combinations of interactions and connectivities contributes to the high degree of plasticity and heterogeneity observed for HSPB1 in NMR and HDXMS experiments.</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>Disease mutations in the NTR have differential effects on HSPB1 structure</title><p>To leverage new insights regarding local structure in the NTR and interactions with the ACD, we sought to assess how reported disease-associated mutations in the HSPB1 NTR affect structure and/or dynamics. We chose two NTR disease mutants whose effects on oligomer size (larger than WT) and chaperone function have been previously characterized: G34R and P39L mutants in the conserved and Trp-rich regions, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Muranova et al., 2015</xref>). To identify localized effects of the mutations, we performed peptide binding experiments with mutant peptides and B1-ACD. To detect potential global effects, we performed HDXMS analysis on mutant proteins. Glycine at position 34 is the final conserved residue in the ‘conserved motif’ found among orthologs and paralogs; its mutation to Arg is expected to reduce flexibility of the backbone and/or alter the region’s interactions. At the start of the Trp-rich region, Pro39 is conserved among orthologs but not among paralogs. Notably, Pro39 is two residues before a region that is predicted to have helical propensity (residues 41–46, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). Mutation of Pro39 to leucine might change the structural propensity of this region by increasing flexibility and/or favoring helical formation. As presented below, we found highly divergent local structural effects of the two mutations, despite their close proximity in sequence.</p><p>As presented above, the conserved motif peptide (residues 25–37) causes peak broadening in dimer interface groove residues (i.e., β3 and β6+7) in <sup>15</sup>N-B1-ACD spectra. An otherwise identical peptide that contains the G34R substitution yields greatly reduced perturbations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9B</xref>), indicating that the bulky, charged Arg sidechain disrupts the ability of the conserved region to interact with the dimer interface groove. Consistent with the notion that the environment of the mutated conserved region is altered, increased deuterium uptake for the fragment that contains the G34R substitution in otherwise wild-type HSPB1 (oligomer) is observed by HDXMS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9A</xref>, top and bottom panels). The increase in deuterium uptake was sufficiently large (as high as 25% in early time points), that it likely reflects a true increase in local flexibility, rather than a consequence of the G to R substitution altering the intrinsic exchange rate of this peptide (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Wales et al., 2016</xref>). Unexpectedly, the NTR boundary region also shows enhanced deuterium uptake in G34R-HSPB1 and, strikingly, no longer shows bimodal behavior. All other portions of oligomeric HSPB1 are not significantly changed in their exchange profiles.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig9" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.50259.019</object-id><label>Figure 9.</label><caption><title>Analysis of disease-associated HSPB1 NTR mutations G34R, G84R, and P39L.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) HDXMS analysis of each mutant.

We took advantage of another identified disease-associated mutation that similarly substitutes arginine for glycine, but in the boundary region (G84R) to test this hypothesis. Intriguingly, HDXMS data on the mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9A</xref>) revealed enhanced deuterium uptake in both the boundary region and in the conserved region, confirming that the dispositions of these two non-contiguous NTR regions are inter-dependent. The NMR data indicate that both regions interact with the ACD dimer interface-groove, and our modeling suggests that both interactions can occur simultaneously. While the NMR data do not address whether the binding of one influences the other, the HDXMS data provide some clarity on this question. The observed inter-dependence of protection from deuterium exchange implies that each region enhances the ability of the other to contact the groove and that the conformation that leads to protection in the HDXMS experiment has both a conserved region and a boundary region present in the groove. Whether the two bound sub-regions are on the same HSPB1 polypeptide or different ones within a dimer or oligomer cannot be ascertained from these experiments, but our modeling implies that both cases are likely to occur.</p><p>As mentioned above, we did not detect evidence of binding for the Trp-rich region peptide to <sup>15</sup>N-B1-ACD. We obtained similar results for a peptide that contains the P39L substitution, indicating that the mutation does not lead to a gain of binding function (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9C</xref>). Nevertheless, introduction of P39L into otherwise wild-type HSPB1 has a marked effect on the HDXMS profile (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9A</xref>). The first four NTR sub-regions are substantially more protected from deuteration in mutant oligomers, while the ACD is essentially unaffected. The largest increase in protection is observed in the fragment that contains the mutation (29-41). The comparison to WT is complicated by the addition of an extra amide from the P39L mutation, but the massive decrease in exchange (25%) is consistent with the predicted increased helical propensity in this region and an observed increase in helicity revealed in the CD spectrum (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9s1">Figure 9—figure supplement 1</xref>). Altogether, the observations suggest that the P39L mutation increases local secondary structure and/or promotes NTR-NTR contacts. In further support of this conclusion, the subunit exchange rate for P39L-HSPB1 is three-fold slower than for either wild-type or G34R oligomers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9s1">Figure 9—figure supplement 1</xref>).</p><p>Altogether, the results highlight a variety of alterations that occur in the HSPB1 NTR under situations such as phosphorylation or disease mutation.

As for all known examples, the central ACDs of two subunits of HSPB1 adopt a dimeric β-sandwich structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Rajagopal et al., 2015a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Baranova et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Rajagopal et al., 2015b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Hochberg et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Clark et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Sluchanko et al., 2017</xref>). However, there has been a complete lack of structural information for the remaining ~50% of HSPB1, most of which is represented by the enigmatic NTR. To overcome the challenges posed by high heterogeneity and polydispersity of large HSPB1 oligomers, we sought to obtain new structural information from a more tractable dimeric form of HSPB1 that retains its chaperone activity. Despite its monodispersity in solution, HSPB1<sub>dimer</sub> exhibits substantial heterogeneity as detected by both NMR and HDXMS. Exemplary of the heterogeneity and dynamics, a majority of the NMR resonances from NTR residues are either of low intensity or are broadened beyond detection even at high magnetic fields, signifying multiple environments for these residues. The disordered NTRs of sHSPs have remained enigmatic for decades, with very little structural information emerging. The hydrophobic NTRs are required for oligomerization of some sHSPs (HSPB1, HSPB4, HSPB5), although paradoxically others remain predominantly dimeric despite having similarly long and hydrophobic NTRs (HSPB6 and HSPB8). Our effort to generate a well-behaved dimer of HSPB1 and characterize its NTR both when tethered to its ACD and when presented as short peptides that represent NTR sub-regions was surprisingly revealing. Peptides representing sub-regions of the NTR display specific interactions with the ACD of HSPB1. Furthermore, PRE experiments revealed that the interactions have preferred orientations. In addition to the previously observed interaction of the IXI motif from the CTR with the β4/β8 groove, our results establish four distinct NTR/ACD interactions: 1) distal region with β4/β8 groove, 2) aromatic region with L3/4 and L5/6, 3) conserved region with dimer interface groove, and 4) boundary region with dimer interface groove (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8F</xref>). The fact that multiple HSPB1 regions can bind to a given groove or surface sets up a situation in which there are more potential binding elements than there are binding sites. This, in turn, creates a large combinatorial array of possible states within a dimer, and even more states within an oligomer. For example, each HSPB1 dimer contains two β4/β8 grooves and four interacting regions (two copies each of the distal region and the CTR IXI motif). Our data and modeling indicate that a given groove may be 1) empty, 2) bound by an inter-chain distal region, 3) bound by an intra-chain distal region, or 4) bound by a CTR IXI motif (usually from another dimer within an oligomer). A dimer may have zero, one, or two of its grooves filled, presumably with any combination of binders. The HDXMS results on HSPB1 oligomers indicate that a large proportion (roughly half) of the distal regions and the CTRs are bound, meaning the β4/β8 grooves must be predominantly occupied. Each HSPB1 dimer has a single dimer interface groove, but its potential interactions with two NTR regions creates a similarly complicated situation: a given dimer interface groove may be empty, bound by a single boundary region, a single conserved region, two boundary regions, one boundary plus one conserved, or two boundary regions plus a conserved region. Again, in the context of an oligomer, the combinatorial possibilities will be increased if the interactions can occur from neighboring dimer units.</p><p>While the NTR of sHSPs has long been known to be intrinsically disordered, it is clear from this work and recent crystal structures that further definition is required to accurately describe and define sHSP NTRs. Indeed, the only segment of the NTR that behaves like an ideal, well-solvated random coil is the insertion sub-region. In recent years, it has come to be appreciated that the term intrinsic disorder can encompass a broad variety of behaviors distinct from the random coil limit. Disordered proteins or regions that adopt compact conformations and that transiently sample secondary structure have been described as globule-like, and disordered regions that interact with binding partners in a dynamic manner have been described as fuzzy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Dyson and Wright, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">van der Lee et al., 2014</xref>). By definition, fuzzy protein-protein interactions cannot be described by a single conformational state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Tompa and Fuxreiter, 2008</xref>). However, given the high degree of orientational specificity of many NTR-ACD interactions, these interactions can be described neither as fuzzy in the canonical sense, nor as molten globule-like. The only region of the NTR that could be said to interact with the ACD in a fuzzy manner is the insertion region, as a spin label placed in this position causes non-specific PREs in many regions of the ACD, inconsistent with a single conformational or orientational state.</p><p>Notably, ordered interactions occur for several NTR sub-regions with the ACD with varying levels of affinity and some interactions appear to be interdependent. The high degree of heterogeneity in HSPB1 dimers and oligomers is generated not by multiple random or fuzzy states but rather by the large number of possible combinations of several specific and orientationally-defined states. Based on observation of multiple slowly exchanging peaks by NMR for certain residues, elevated transverse relaxation rates, and bimodal HDXMS at long time points, the lifetimes for these interactions range from a minimum of tens of milliseconds to several minutes. For this reason, we propose the term ‘quasi-ordered’ to describe the NTR of HSPB1, as it makes specific long-lived (on the timescale of seconds) contacts while remaining dynamic and heterogeneous. In our definition, quasi-ordered interactions sample an ensemble of well-defined, relatively long-lived, approximately isoenergetic states; they are more ordered than fuzzy complexes yet more heterogeneous than systems that display folding-upon-binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Dyson and Wright, 2005</xref>).</p><p>The structural information gleaned from the approaches presented here on HSPB1 add substantially to emergent structural insights on human sHSPs. First, knob-into-hole binding of CTR IXI motifs and β4/β8 grooves has been well established in numerous sHSPs. This type of interaction was recently reported for NTR IXI motifs as well (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Clark et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Sluchanko et al., 2017</xref>). Recognition of non-canonical hydrophobic motifs by the β4/β8 groove has been shown previously for the client proteins amyloid-β and α-synuclein and in crystal structures of artificially-truncated sHSP constructs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Collier et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Mainz et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Liu et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Weeks et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Weeks et al., 2014</xref>), but never within a full-length sHSP. Our results show that a motif of alternating hydrophobic residues in the HSPB1 distal region competes effectively with the canonical IXI motif in the protein’s CTR, expanding the repertoire of potential binding partners.</p><p>The eight-residue conserved motif is the only stretch of identifiable sequence conservation in the NTR of human sHSPs. Recently, conserved motifs bound at the dimer interface groove have been observed in HSPB6 and HSPB2/3 structures. In the HSPB6 structure, the conserved sequence occupies the dimer interface groove and no β2 strand is present (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Sluchanko et al., 2017</xref>). In the HSPB2/HSPB3 structure, the conserved motif of HSPB2 and one copy of a β2 strand from the same protomer occupy the groove. Our modeling shows that it is physically possible for two copies of β2 strand and a conserved motif to be bound simultaneously. The reciprocal effects observed in the HDXMS of disease-associated mutations in these two regions (G34R- and G84R-HSPB1) strongly suggest that disruption of one of the interactions destabilizes the other.</p><p>An interaction analogous to the one defined for the aromatic sub-region of HSPB1 has not been previously reported. Our results indicate that the interaction is favored in the absence of Ser15 phosphorylation, which disrupts the interaction. Only two other human sHSPs are enriched in aromatic residues in this region, namely HSPB4 and HSPB5. HSPB1, B4, and B5 are also the only human sHSPs known to form large oligomers, leading us to propose that the aromatic region/ACD interaction may be a driver of large oligomer formation. Notably, HSPB1 and HSPB5 are both phosphorylated in response to stress conditions on serine residues within their aromatic regions, yielding smaller oligomeric species, but the local mechanism by which this occurs had not been defined. Our results show clearly that serine phosphorylation disrupts the interaction in HSPB1, pointing to a shared structural mechanism by which stress-induced phosphorylation disrupts HSPB1 and HSPB5 oligomers, allowing them to form smaller, more dispersed, and more active species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Lambert et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Ito et al., 2001</xref>).</p><p>Intriguingly, PRE results place residue 83 in the same region where we observe aromatic peptide binding, indicating that the other two phosphorylation sites of HSPB1 (78 and 82) are in proximity to the aromatic region. Several sHSPs have phosphorylation sites in similar sub-regions, and it has been shown for HSPB1 that similar effects on quaternary structure and chaperone activity are obtained from mutation of any of these sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Jovcevski et al., 2015</xref>). A recent crystal structure of an HSPB1 construct containing part of the boundary region and the ACD in complex with a peptide containing residues 76–88 phosphorylated at position 82 contained density in this same region. While this density was attributed to the peptide, the identity of the residues could not be resolved (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Collier et al., 2019</xref>). Our results confirm that the two phosphorylation sites could reside near this location. Thus, all three sites of stress-induced modification are near each other and close to a conserved ACD surface that is highly enriched in negatively-charged amino acids (i.e., L3/4 and L5/6), providing an environment that can easily be disrupted by additional negative charge. Both regions were less protected as seen by HDXMS in the phosphorylation-mimicking dimer compared to WT oligomers, consistent with coupled behavior. It has been demonstrated that singly- and doubly-phosphorylated HSPB1 species adopt intermediate-sized oligomers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Jovcevski et al., 2015</xref>), consistent with the arrangement acting as a rheostat that tunes the distribution of oligomeric states in response to cellular stress. Our results placing sequentially distant phosphorylation sites in spatial proximity demonstrates a common mechanism for the global effects observed for mutation of different phosphorylation sites. While there is clear interplay among the three phosphorylation sites, additional studies will be required to determine the nature of the interactions between the sites in the boundary region and the aromatic region. In particular, the role of boundary region phosphorylation is unclear, as we did not detect a difference in binding by the phosphorylated and non-phosphorylated forms of this peptide. Recent NMR work showed that an elongated ACD construct containing the boundary region with phosphomimetic mutations at regions 78 and 82 formed a transient β2 strand in solution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Collier et al., 2019</xref>). However, without a direct comparison to a construct of the same length but without phosphomimetic mutations, the role of phosphorylation in this interaction remains unclear.</p><p>Our study also provides the first residue-level insights into the effects of known disease-associated mutations within the HSPB1 NTR. The three mutations investigated have previously been shown to alter the oligomeric distribution of HSPB1, in each case yielding larger oligomers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Muranova et al., 2015</xref>), but an understanding of the effects on a more detailed level are lacking. Remarkably, single mutations in the NTR have profound, widespread effects on dynamics, highlighting sHSP sensitivity to mutation and modification. We find that mutations at residues only five positions apart in the NTR have distinct, almost opposite effects (G34R and P39L) while two mutations that are 50 residues apart from each other (G34R and G84R) produce highly similar effects. In particular, G34R and G84R variants in the conserved and boundary regions respectively each exhibit a coupled increase in deuterium exchange in both the conserved and boundary regions. Furthermore, the mutant G34R conserved region peptide showed a lower affinity for the dimer interface groove. Altogether the results identify an interplay between two non-local regions of the NTR, in which the location of one region affects the other. Both regions can bind at the dimer interface groove, so another way to view the interdependence is that occupancy at a given interface groove by one sub-region favors occupancy by the other.</p><p>While the G34R and G84R substitutions are associated with the release of NTR sub-regions from their ACD interactions, P39L-HSPB1 shows markedly increased protection from exchange in the aromatic, conserved, and Trp-rich regions of the NTR. However, there is no large change for the boundary region, suggesting that the interdependence observed for the two glycine-to-arginine mutations is due to substitution of a bulky (and/or charged) amino acid in either the conserved or boundary regions per se. The increased helicity observed in the CD spectrum of P39L-HSPB1 oligomers is consistent with stabilization of helical structure in the Trp-rich region, likely a direct consequence of the helix-favoring proline-to-leucine substitution. Notably, no interactions were detected between the Trp-rich region and the ACD in either the WT- or mutant form, implying that the sub-region could be involved in NTR-NTR interactions. Our inability to make mutations in the Trp-rich sub-region that did not have an impact on oligomer size is further corroboration of the sub-region’s central role in driving HSPB1 oligomerization. Indeed, the decreased rate of subunit exchange from P39L-containing oligomers suggests that such NTR-NTR interactions play a rate-limiting role in the dissociation of subunits.</p><p>In sum, an approach using solution-state NMR, HDXMS, and modeling has succeeded in defining the heretofore intractable NTR of HSPB1. Rather than behaving as a random coil-like intrinsically disordered region, we find it to be quasi-ordered, with six sub-regions that display distinct properties and binding preferences. The results reveal that, contrary to expectation, the high degree of heterogeneity and polydispersity that is a defining feature of HSPB1 (and other human sHSPs) derives not from fuzzy disorder but rather from an array of combinatorial interactions that involve discrete NTR sub-regions and specific surfaces on the structured ACD. We expect other oligomeric sHSPs are similarly defined and that they can be parsed out using approaches similar to those described here. Finally, it is reasonable to think that there are other examples of quasi-order, with multiple interacting regions in a polypeptide chain, that can likewise be defined at a structural level by similar experimental approaches.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Protein expression and purification</title><p>Human HSPB1 (accession # P04792) had previously been cloned into pET23a and pET151d vectors (ampicillin resistant).

Fragment insertion using the BlueprintBDR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Huang et al., 2011</xref>) mover was then used to add the initial residues of the distal region and a segment of the 2/3 loop that was not resolved in the crystal structure. Two distinct connectivities involving the aromatic region were modeled. One structure was generated in which the aromatic region connected the distal region bound in the opposite orientation of the conserved region, such that it wrapped around the edge of the ACD and contacted loops 3/4, 5/6 and 8/9. Another was generated in which it connected the conserved region to the other distal region and crossed over strands β8, β9, and β3. An initial model for each of these two structures was generated using the BlueprintBDR mover, and then subject to 100 rounds of Generalized Kinematic Closure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bender et al., 2016</xref>) to generate two sets of 100 structures that sample the conformational flexibility of the aromatic region. Generalized Kinematic Closure was used to model this longer disordered segment because, unlike the BlueprintBDR mover, it does not explicitly bias structures toward a smaller radius of gyration or use stretches of PDB-derived torsion angles. The missing loops connecting the beginning of the NTR to the β2 strands were then modeled in using the BlueprintBDR mover. Again, there were two possible connectivities for each structure: the conserved motif could be connected to either β2 strand, while the distal region not connected to the conserved motif could be connected to the other β2 strand. For each model, both connectivities were sampled, producing four sets with unique topologies that each contained 100 structures. For each step in which additional residues were introduced in the model, FastRelax was used to relax the new segment and the residues adjacent to it.

Protein was buffer exchanged into 50 mM NaPi, 100 mM NaCl, 0.5 mM EDTA, pH 7.5 buffer with 2 mM tris-(2-carboxyethyl)-phosphine (TCEP). Protein was incubated with 3X molar excess of Alexa Fluor 488 maleimide and incubated at 37°C (to facilitate subunit exchange) for at least one hour. Protein was separated from free dye using gravity desalting columns. Fractions collected from desalting columns were analyzed for separation by comparing absorbances at 495 nm (fluorophore extinction coefficient of 73,000 M<sup>−1</sup>cm<sup>−1</sup>) and 280 nm, with an assumed A<sub>280</sub>/A<sub>495</sub> ratio of 0.11. The resulting pool of fractions was diluted to desired protein concentrations and fluorophore labeling percentages.</p><p>Samples were incubated at 37°C at 20 μM and several labeling percentages for at least one hour prior to measurement. For the experiments presented here, samples with 30% fluorophore labeling were mixed 1:2 with unlabeled protein. The resulting dequenching from homo-FRET among fluorophores in oligomers was measured as a function of time. Measurements were collected on a Horiba Fluorolog-3 with double excitation and emission monochromators and Peltier temperature control at 37°C. Excitation and emission wavelengths of 518 nm and 498 nm were used, respectively.</p><p>The resulting kinetic data were fitted to the following exponential equation using the R software package to obtain subunit exchange rates:<disp-formula id="equ2"><mml:math id="m2"><mml:mi>y</mml:mi><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mi>A</mml:mi><mml:mo>+</mml:mo><mml:mi>B</mml:mi><mml:mi>*</mml:mi><mml:msup><mml:mrow><mml:mi>e</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mo>-</mml:mo><mml:mi>k</mml:mi><mml:mi>t</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msup></mml:math></disp-formula></p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We thank P Rajagopal and L Tuttle for training and discussions of NMR experiments and J Kang for assistance with HPLC.

Your article has been reviewed by two peer reviewers, including Hannes Neuweiler as the Reviewing Editor and Reviewer #1, and the evaluation has been overseen by Cynthia Wolberger as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Kristaps Jaudzems (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Review:</p><p>The manuscript reports on the investigation of interactions, dynamics and conformation of the intrinsically disordered N-terminal domain (NTR) of the human small heat shock protein (sHSP) HSPB1 using a hybrid approach involving NMR spectroscopy, hydrogen-deuterium exchange mass spectrometry (HDXMS) and molecular modelling. The authors use mutated and truncated protein constructs engineered to form mono-disperse pseudo-wild-type proteins of the otherwise highly heterogeneous, oligomeric wild-type HSPB1. They further report binding studies using a set of peptides covering the sequence area of the NTR to study specific interactions with the folded α-crystallin domain (ACD) of HSPB1. The study involves spin labels and additional, complementary spectroscopy (circular dichroism and fluorescence). The authors conclude that they revealed an ensemble of &quot;quasi-ordered&quot; NTR states that deviate from a common intrinsically disordered protein (IDP), and that they provide new mechanistic insights into the effects of stress and disease related phosphorylation and mutation of the NTR.</p><p>IDPs represent a substantial fraction of the human proteome and fulfil critical functions within living cells. However, they are elusive to experimental investigation. Very little is known about their &quot;structure&quot;, dynamics and functional mechanisms compared to folded proteins. sHSPs, which are small chaperones that importantly participate in protein homeostasis, consist of a folded and an intrinsically disordered domain. The human sHSP HSPB1 fulfils various chaperoning activities and is involved in severe diseases like cancer. Structural and mechanistic studies of HSPB1 are complicated by intrinsic disorder and by the fact that the active wild-type protein forms a heterogeneous ensemble of oligomers.</p><p>The reviewers agree that the study by Clouser et al. provides important new residue-level insights into the disordered NTR and its interactions with the ACD. The authors conclusively show that the NTR, in the context of HSPB1, deviates from a random coil with extensive NTR/ACD and NTR/NTR contacts as well as some residual structure. This is evident from analysis of NMR chemical shifts, line broadening and the observation of multiple peaks for one and the same residue reflecting conformationally distinct, populated states. HDXMS experiments reveal changes in solvent-accessibility in the NTR and their response to phosphorylation and mutation. The comprehensive set of experiments is well designed, thoroughly conducted and analysed. The molecular models inferred from experimental results help to structurally visualize the results.</p><p>The manuscript is logically structured, well written and results are clearly presented and discussed. However, a major concern surrounds the nature and definition of the &quot;quasi-ordered&quot; states the authors claimed to have identified (highlighted in title and Abstract).</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The authors conclude that the nature of &quot;quasi-ordered&quot; states they revealed for the NTR would deviate from that of a common IDP and would thus represent new and previously unknown IDP characteristics. This conclusion appears to be an over-interpretation of data. If one would study the NTR in isolation the domain would probably show all the characteristics of a common IDP (can the NTR be expressed and studied in isolation?). In the second paragraph of the Discussion the authors state that given the NTR is an IDP, the specific interactions detected with the ACD were surprising. They further imply (Discussion, third paragraph) that according to their results the NTR cannot be classified as IDP. But the system investigated by the authors is not common in the sense that the NTR is covalently linked to its binding partner (ACD). Since one of the functions of the NTR is to oligomerize HSPB1 the NTR evolved to form inter-molecular interactions with ACDs of other HSPB1 proteins. Interactions of the NTR with the ACD are thus expected. Inter-molecular NTR-ACD interactions are likely the same or similar as intra-molecular NTR-ACD interactions revealed by the authors. The latter ones are of mono-molecular nature and thus entropically favoured compared to the inter-molecular ones. Fusing an IDP to its binding partner using recombinant methods may emerge as a new and interesting approach to study weak interactions of IDPs with binding partners.</p><p>2) A weakness of the study is that the dynamics of NTR sub-regions (assigned parts) and their effects on ACD dynamics is not evaluated. This makes it difficult to assess whether the identified states are really quasi-ordered, fuzzy or transient. In the second paragraph of the subsection “Conformational heterogeneity is observed throughout the NTR”, the authors state that the boundary sub-region has random-coil chemical shifts, which does not seem to fit with it being &quot;quasi-ordered&quot;. Furthermore, the authors write &quot;For this reason, we propose the term &quot;quasi-ordered&quot; to describe the NTR of HSPB1, as it makes highly-specific long-lived contacts while remaining dynamic and heterogeneous&quot;, but don't provide sufficient evidence for &quot;long-lived contacts while remaining dynamic&quot;. Therefore, the authors should additionally perform an NMR dynamics study or at least summarize (from their existing data) the exchange of each sub-region (both on NTR as well as ACD) with respect to NMR timescale.</p><p>3) On a similar note: the authors state: &quot;…two conformational states of random coil segments move slowly…&quot;: can the authors provide a rough estimate or lower limit of the interconversion time constant? This would be interesting information because backbone dynamics of random coil peptides are known to be ultrafast (nanosecond time scale).</p><p>4) In their peptide binding experiments the authors apply 1 mM peptide concentrations, which is excess over protein, and observe effects below saturation (Figure 4A, subsection “Distinct regions of the NTR bind different ACD interfaces”, fourth paragraph). This indicates non-specific, non-cooperative binding. If high mM concentrations are required for binding one can hardly argue for specific interactions. Binding equilibria with dissociation constants &gt;1 mM are commonly classified as non-specific. In contrast, the addition of NTR-ACD to B1-ACD (mixed dimer) yields overlapping spectra (Figure 2A).</p><p>5) Figure 4A: The changes of chemical shifts towards the NTR-ACD values, observed upon peptide binding, are not evident for all peaks indicated by arrows: Signals for residue 113 are unclear; signals for residue 155 move in another direction than indicated.</p><p>6) In the Abstract and Discussion section the authors claim that their results regarding phosphorylation-dependent interactions would inform a mechanism. But what precisely is the new mechanistic information their data provide over the already existing knowledge (Lambert et al., 1999; Ito et al., 2001)?</p><p>7) Discussion section: The effects induced by the remote mutations G34R and G84R are likely to be similar because in both cases a hydrogen is replaced by a bulky, positively charged side chain, which will induce steric and electrostatic repulsion (observed by release of NTR sub-regions). G34R and P39L show very different effects because the nature of these mutations is very different. Proline is known to be a helix breaker, which is removed by mutation P39L. This explains enhanced helix content and interaction.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.50259.026</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The authors conclude that the nature of &quot;quasi-ordered&quot; states they revealed for the NTR would deviate from that of a common IDP and would thus represent new and previously unknown IDP characteristics.

Fusing an IDP to its binding partner using recombinant methods may emerge as a new and interesting approach to study weak interactions of IDPs with binding partners.</p></disp-quote><p>We apologize for any lack of clarity – we agree that the NTR should still be classified as an intrinsically disordered region (IDR) and have updated the text in the Discussion to clarify this point. By introducing the term “quasi-order”, we are not attempting to de-classify the NTR of HSPB1 as an IDR but rather aim to further the conversation about IDPs/IDRs and expand the classification of their behaviors. Terms such as “fuzzy complex” and “folding-upon-binding” have been previously used to describe interactions between disordered proteins and their binding partners. However, the NTR-ACD interactions described here do not fit well into either category. They are orientationally specific (i.e. the segments of the NTR that interact with the ACD tend to adopt single structural states with a defined orientation in relation to their binding grooves) and thus cannot be described as fuzzy. Nevertheless, NTR-ACD interactions remain dynamic and do not form static structures and thus cannot be said to fold upon binding. We propose the term quasi-ordered to describe the interactions as they do not fit into the existing framework described in the IDP literature. It seems likely that other IDPs or IDRs may also fit into this category and that it is therefore useful to the field to define a term to describe this phenomenon.</p><p>We agree that the fact that the NTR interacts with the ACD is not itself surprising. The novelty (and our associated surprise) is in discovering a tractable, high resolution approach to characterize the IDR in a system where historically the IDR (NTR of sHSPs) has been truncated or described only in very coarse-grained terms. The NTR is enriched in hydrophobic amino acids relative to other disordered proteins and is highly susceptible to proteolytic degradation, rendering it difficult to generate and study in isolation. Furthermore, given the extensive interactions between the NTR and ACD our studies have uncovered, we question whether the behavior of the NTR in isolation would be physiologically relevant. Based on the properties of its sequence, we predict it to be collapsed or molten globule-like, but we have not tested this experimentally because we are doubtful that the experimental results outside its native molecular context will shed light on its biological function.</p><p>The extensive, specific, but variable-in-combination interactions between the NTR and ACD provide an essential view of how sHSPs regulate availability of their NTRs for oligomerization or client interactions. We have changed phrasing in the Discussion to reflect that the fact of NTR-ACD interactions itself is not surprising, but rather that the nature of these interactions is surprising and crucial to understanding how sHSPs function.</p><p>Changes to address these points are included in the first two paragraphs of the Discussion.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) A weakness of the study is that the dynamics of NTR sub-regions (assigned parts) and their effects on ACD dynamics is not evaluated. This makes it difficult to assess whether the identified states are really quasi-ordered, fuzzy or transient. In the second paragraph of the subsection “Conformational heterogeneity is observed throughout the NTR”, the authors state that the boundary sub-region has random-coil chemical shifts, which does not seem to fit with it being &quot;quasi-ordered&quot;. Furthermore, the authors write &quot;For this reason, we propose the term &quot;quasi-ordered&quot; to describe the NTR of HSPB1, as it makes highly-specific long-lived contacts while remaining dynamic and heterogeneous&quot;, but don't provide sufficient evidence for &quot;long-lived contacts while remaining dynamic&quot;. Therefore, the authors should additionally perform an NMR dynamics study or at least summarize (from their existing data) the exchange of each sub-region (both on NTR as well as ACD) with respect to NMR timescale.</p></disp-quote><p>Our existing data support the idea that many of the NTR-ACD interactions we describe are long-lived. For most observable exchange behavior, the timescale is very slow (several hundred milliseconds to several minutes). In the NMR studies, multiple peaks were observed for several residues in both the NTR and ACD. The doubled ACD peaks arise from residues that show contacts with the NTR. This “slow exchange” behavior places an upper limit on the exchange rate between states. In response to the reviewers’ request for more information regarding the timescale of the dynamics, we calculated the frequency differences for all pairs of NMR peaks that show doubling. The smallest difference is ~2 Hz, implying a lifetime greater than ~500 msec. We have clarified this point in the fourth paragraph of the subsection “The disordered NTR makes extensive contacts with the ACD” and in the second paragraph of the subsection “Conformational heterogeneity is observed throughout the NTR”.</p><p>Additionally, we collected <sup>15</sup>N R2 data on the NTR-ACD construct. The data reveal random-coil like dynamics for the NTR insertion sub-region and faster relaxation for Trp-rich and boundary NTR sub-regions, comparable to slower motions of the structured ACD. These data, presented as a new panel in Figure 6 (6D) and discussed in the fourth paragraph of the subsection “Conformational heterogeneity is observed throughout the NTR”,are congruent with the conclusions from the HDXMS results.</p><p>Although as mentioned (subsection “Conformational heterogeneity is observed throughout the NTR”, eighth paragraph), our HDXMS data do not allow us to extract precise rates of exchange, the bimodal behavior observed is still informative for estimating lifetimes. The distal and boundary regions show distinct populations at 1 minute and 4 minutes, respectively, indicating lifetimes on the order of minutes for states involving contact of these regions with the ACD in the oligomeric context.We added text clarifying this point to the sixth and seventh paragraphs of the subsection “Conformational heterogeneity is observed throughout the NTR” and in the third paragraph of the Discussion.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) On a similar note: the authors state: &quot;…two conformational states of random coil segments move slowly…&quot;: can the authors provide a rough estimate or lower limit of the interconversion time constant? This would be interesting information because backbone dynamics of random coil peptides are known to be ultrafast (nanosecond time scale).</p></disp-quote><p>Following from our response to comment 2, we can estimate the exchange between states of the insert region to be in the regime of tens of milliseconds or slower (smallest observed chemical shift difference is 24 Hz). The two states cannot be distinguished in the HDX data, as they are both highly solvent-exposed and have exchanged fully at the first timepoint. The changes we made in response to point 2 should address this comment as well.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) In their peptide binding experiments the authors apply 1 mM peptide concentrations, which is excess over protein, and observe effects below saturation (Figure 4A, subsection “Distinct regions of the NTR bind different ACD interfaces”, fourth paragraph). This indicates non-specific, non-cooperative binding. If high mM concentrations are required for binding one can hardly argue for specific interactions. Binding equilibria with dissociation constants &gt;1 mM are commonly classified as non-specific. In contrast, the addition of NTR-ACD to B1-ACD (mixed dimer) yields overlapping spectra (Figure 2A).</p></disp-quote><p>We respectfully disagree that the interactions observed in the peptide binding studies are non-specific. A distinguishing feature of IDPs is their ability to engage in specific yet low-affinity interactions. Each peptide perturbs specific localized regions of the ACD. These perturbed regions are in good agreement with the sites of contact observed in the PRE experiments in the context of the NTR-ACD construct. If the peptide binding results were non-specific, we would expect to see effects in regions of the ACD that are not in agreement with the PRE results, which does not occur. This fits our notion of a specific interaction.</p><p>Secondly, while the peptide-ACD interactions are low affinity in <italic>trans</italic>, the effective local concentration of the NTR when it is physically attached to the ACD will be fairly high, such that concentrations approaching 1mM are relevant. This contention is borne out in the mixed dimer experiment, where the effects of NTR/ACD contacts from a tethered NTR (in <italic>trans</italic>) recapitulate the chemical shifts observed in the full-length dimer. Similarly, the concordance of the PRE results involving the full, tethered NTR with those of the peptide binding experiments create a uniform set of observations.</p><p>We have added a comment regarding the effective local concentration of an attached NTR in the fourth paragraph of the subsection “Distinct regions of the NTR bind different ACD interfaces”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) Figure 4A: The changes of chemical shifts towards the NTR-ACD values, observed upon peptide binding, are not evident for all peaks indicated by arrows: Signals for residue 113 are unclear; signals for residue 155 move in another direction than indicated.</p></disp-quote><p>We have revised this figure for clarity. The peaks corresponding to the ACD and</p><p>NTR-ACD constructs are now labeled in black and grey, respectively. For residue 113, we labeled the two intermediate (peptide titration) peaks as well. Because this residue has the highest CSP, these peaks are relatively low in intensity and may have been easy to miss. The arrow for residue 155 was removed.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) In the Abstract and Discussion section the authors claim that their results regarding phosphorylation-dependent interactions would inform a mechanism. But what precisely is the new mechanistic information their data provide over the already existing knowledge (Lambert et al., 1999; Ito et al., 2001)?</p></disp-quote><p>Previous work (cited in our manuscript) has established that phosphomimetic mutations at each of the three sites in HSPB1 have similar global effects on oligomeric size and chaperone activity, despite the fact that these sites are not all close in sequence. Which site is modified seems to matter less than the total number of phosphorylated sites for the aforementioned effects. Our work provides a structural explanation for this phenomenon, by defining the first phosphorylation-dependent NTR/ACD interaction and showing that the phosphorylation site in the aromatic region (Ser 15) is close in space to the sequentially-distant sites Ser78 and Ser82. These sites all interact with the same region of the ACD, specifically the dimer interface groove and β5/6 loop, As we point out in the Discussion, the known phosphorylation sites in other human sHSPs reside within the same NTR sub-regions, suggesting a common mechanism.</p><p>We have added clarifying points in the sixth and seventh paragraphs of the Discussion.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7) Discussion section: The effects induced by the remote mutations G34R and G84R are likely to be similar because in both cases a hydrogen is replaced by a bulky, positively charged side chain, which will induce steric and electrostatic repulsion (observed by release of NTR sub-regions). G34R and P39L show very different effects because the nature of these mutations is very different. Proline is known to be a helix breaker, which is removed by mutation P39L. This explains enhanced helix content and interaction.</p></disp-quote><p>We are unsure of the action point the reviewers are requesting. We state the behavior of each type of mutation in both the Results and Discussion sections. While the G34R and G84R mutations may be expected to have similar effects within their immediate proximity, given their sequential distance it was not obvious that they would have similar global effects. The novel finding is that the same structural effects are observed for both mutations, which is explained by their similar contexts of placement in the dimer interface groove. We state explicitly in the Discussion that “The increased helicity observed in the CD spectrum of P39L-HSPB1 oligomers is consistent with stabilization of helical structure in the Trp-rich region, likely a direct consequence of the helix-favoring proline-to-leucine substitution,” which is in agreement with your final point.</p></body></sub-article></article>
