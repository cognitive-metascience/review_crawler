One way to achieve this is to vary connection structure. To investigate how structural variation among synaptic connections might affect neural computation, we examined primary afferent connections in the <italic>Drosophila</italic> olfactory system. We used large-scale serial section electron microscopy to reconstruct all the olfactory receptor neuron (ORN) axons that target a left-right pair of glomeruli, as well as all the projection neurons (PNs) postsynaptic to these ORNs. We found three variations in ORN→PN connectivity. First, we found a systematic co-variation in synapse number and PN dendrite size, suggesting total synaptic conductance is tuned to postsynaptic excitability. Second, we discovered that PNs receive more synapses from ipsilateral than contralateral ORNs, providing a structural basis for odor lateralization behavior. Finally, we found evidence of imprecision in ORN→PN connections that can diminish network performance.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.24838.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.24838.001</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>electron microscopy</kwd><kwd>olfaction</kwd><kwd>circuit variability</kwd><kwd>compensation</kwd><kwd>compartmental modeling</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd><italic>D. melanogaster</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R03 DC013622</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Lee</surname><given-names>Wei-Chung Allen</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Harvard Brain Initiative Collaborative Seed Grant</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Wilson</surname><given-names>Rachel I</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Bertarelli Program in Translational Neuroscience and Neuroengineering</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Lee</surname><given-names>Wei-Chung Allen</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Edward R. and Anne G.

In principle, each synaptic connection might have an optimal strength, as dictated by activity patterns passing through the synapses comprising that connection, as well as the computations that the connection ought to support. The strength of each connection will depend on many structural features, such as the number of presynaptic neurotransmitter release sites it contains, or the size of the postsynaptic dendrite.</p><p>For these reasons, it is important to understand how variations in the structure of synaptic connections will affect the computational properties of a network. The ability to create systematic variations in synapse structure ought to expand the potential computational performance of a network. Conversely, the performance of a network could be diminished if the structure of its synaptic connections is not specified precisely.</p><p>Even closely related synaptic connections can exhibit variations. For example, there can be anatomical differences in the connections made by an identifiable neuron in isogenic individuals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Goodman, 1978</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Ward et al., 1975</xref>). Within an individual brain, there can be differences in connectivity across multiple instances of the same network module (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Takemura et al., 2015</xref>). There can be anatomical differences in the connections made by right and left copies of an identifiable neuron in the same individual (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Lu et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Ryan et al., 2016</xref>). Finally, there can even be anatomical differences between the multiple synaptic contacts linking a presynaptic neuron with a single postsynaptic neuron (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bartol et al., 2015</xref>). Some of this observed variation is likely stochastic (‘noise’), reflecting the limited precision of synapse specification. Some variation may be ‘signal’ – e.g., variation in synapse structure due to homeostatic compensation or plasticity. In general, it has often been difficult to discriminate between ‘signal’ and ‘noise’ (in this sense) in the analysis of connectomics data. It has also often been difficult to quantify how neural computations could be affected by observed variations in synapse structure.</p><p>In this study, we illustrate a general approach to solving these problems. We use serial section electron microscopy (EM) to reconstruct all the copies of a single cell type in one individual brain, along with all the feedforward excitatory synapses that these cells receive. We then combine these EM data with electrophysiological data to create constrained compartmental models of the reconstructed cells that allows us to quantify the functional implications of the wiring variations in this network. We are able to directly translate anatomical differences between synaptic connections (the number of synapses per connection, as well as the location of those synapses on the dendritic tree) into physiological differences (variations in synaptic voltage). This tells us which anatomical variations are likely functionally most important, how different anatomical parameters can interact (and potentially compensate for each other), and how anatomical variations can affect the amount of information transmitted across the synapse.</p><p>As a test-bed for this approach, we focus on a well-characterized microcircuit – a single olfactory glomerulus in the adult <italic>Drosophila</italic> antennal lobe. Each of the 50 glomeruli in this brain region receives feedforward excitation from a dedicated population of olfactory receptor neurons (ORNs); signals from each glomerulus are then relayed to higher brain regions by a dedicated population of projection neurons (PNs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Su et al., 2009</xref>). All the ORNs presynaptic to each glomerulus express the same odorant receptor, and so have similar odor tuning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Vosshall et al., 2000</xref>). Each PN receives ORN input from all the ORNs whose axons enter its cognate glomerulus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kazama and Wilson, 2009</xref>). ORN→PN connections are a good test-bed for studying wiring variations because there are so many connections per glomerulus, each with the same ostensible function. Moreover, the physiological properties of these connections have been extensively studied in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Gaudry et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Gouwens and Wilson, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Kazama and Wilson, 2008</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Olsen and Wilson, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Root et al., 2008</xref>).</p><p>This study has three parts. In the first part, we show that the number of synapses per ORN→PN connection matches the size of the PN dendrite, and this matching precisely compensates for size-dependent differences in dendritic filtering properties. In the second part of the study, we show that there is a systematic variation in the structure of ORN connections onto ipsi- versus contralateral PNs, and this difference is precise enough to allow the brain to lateralize odor stimuli to the left or right side of the head. In the third part of the study, we demonstrate there is some degree of unsystematic structural variation in ORN→PN synaptic connections (‘noise’), and we show how this imprecision can constrain a PN’s ability to count ORN spikes.</p><p>Taken together, our results imply that certain structural parameters of these synaptic connections are systematically varied to enable specific neural computations, but the limited precision of synaptic structural control also represents a fundamental constraint on network performance. More generally, our study illustrates a principled approach to partitioning ‘signal’ and ‘noise’ in connectomics data – i.e., systematic and unsystematic variations in wiring – with the goal of linking these variations to network function.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>We used large-scale serial section transmission EM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bock et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Lee et al., 2016</xref>) to collect a volumetric data set comprising the anterior portion of one adult female <italic>Drosophila</italic> brain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A and B</xref>, and <xref ref-type="other" rid="media1">Video 1</xref>).

No Gal4 line has been identified which drives expression exclusively in DM6 PNs. However, the <italic>NP3481-Gal4</italic> line drives expression in DM6 PNs along with PNs in several other glomeruli (total count is 9.5 PNs on average [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Tanaka et al., 2012</xref>]). In order to limit a fluorescent marker to DM6 PNs alone, we used <italic>NP3481-Gal4</italic> to drive expression of photoactivatible GFP (<italic>UAS-SPA</italic>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Datta et al., 2008</xref>), and we used 2-photon excitation to specifically photoactivate GFP within the DM6 glomerulus. Because the dendritic arbor of each PN typically ramifies throughout the entire glomerulus, photoactivating within a large fraction of the glomerulus should label each Gal4+ PN. In five experiments, we photoactivated both the right and left copies of DM6. Images shown here are maximum-intensity projections of confocal stacks imaged in a coronal plane (dorsal is up; red asterisks denote dim somata that were not photoactivated and that are not associated with DM6, based on inspection of the 3D stack). Most frequently we found three PNs per glomerulus, but we also occasionally found four or two PNs. The number of PNs was often different on the two sides of the same brain, but there was no systematic difference between right and left. This result implies that the number of Gal4+ DM6 PNs can vary, consistent with variable counts in other glomeruli in the number of Gal4+ PNs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Tanaka et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Grabe et al., 2016</xref>). Our EM reconstruction implies that at least some of this variability is due to true variation in PN counts, and is not merely due to variations in Gal4 expression patterns.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.24838.004">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.24838.004</ext-link></p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="postscript" mimetype="application" xlink:href="elife-24838-fig1-figsupp2-v1"/></fig><fig id="fig1s3" position="float" specific-use="child-fig"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.24838.005</object-id><label>Figure 1—figure supplement 3.</label><caption><title>Images of representative synapses connecting different cell types.</title><p>Example electron micrographs of: (<bold>A–D</bold>) ORN→PN synapses, (<bold>E–H</bold>) PN→PN synapses, (<bold>I–L</bold>) PN→ORN synapses, (<bold>M–P</bold>) ORN→ORN synapses.

We confirmed ORN identity by tracing each axon to the antennal nerve. We confirmed that all reconstructed ORNs innervated DM6 and no other glomeruli.

However, we found that one right ORN and one left ORN projected only ipsilaterally. Therefore, each glomerulus contained the axons of 52 ORNs.

This is not an unusual occurrence: we found that the number of DM6 PNs is often different on the two sides of the brain, although with no consistent trend for left PNs to outnumber right PNs, or vice versa (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>). Thus, variations in neuron number appear to be general phenomenon. This is consistent with a previous finding that certain identifiable cells are sometimes missing from a particular column in the <italic>Drosophila</italic> optic lobe (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Takemura et al., 2015</xref>). In a later section, we will examine in detail the issue of cell number variation and its network correlates.</p><p>Profiles not identified as ORNs or PNs are referred to here as multiglomerular neurons. Most of these profiles are probably inhibitory local neurons, because this cell type is the most numerous and broadly-arborizing of the multiglomerular cell types in the antennal lobe (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chou et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Lin et al., 2012</xref>). In addition, some of these profiles may be multiglomerular projection neurons, or neurons that project into the antennal lobe from other regions.</p><p>To estimate our reconstruction error, we quantified the percentage of cellular profiles presynaptic to PNs that were ‘orphans’, i.e. fragments of reconstructed neurites that could not be connected to any neuron. Overall, the percentage of orphans was relatively small (6.8 ± 1.5%, mean ± SEM). This value was lower for the left glomerulus (4.4 ± 0.8%) than for the right glomerulus (10.4 ± 0.4%). Another study using a similar reconstruction strategy demonstrated that false continuations between fragments are easily detected and corrected during independent review, and are therefore very rare in the final reconstruction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Schneider-Mizell et al., 2016</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Relative abundance of connection types</title><p>In addition to reconstructing the morphology of every ORN and PN in glomerulus DM6, we also identified all their pre- and postsynaptic specializations. Images of representative synapses are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref>. We confirmed the existence of every connection type previously reported in the antennal lobe of the adult fly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Rybak et al., 2016</xref>). The full matrix of ORN-PN connectivity is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1—figure supplement 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Figure 1—figure supplement 4—source data 1</xref>.</p><p>Beginning with ORN output synapses, we found that ORNs delivered about one-third of their synaptic output to PNs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). Most of the remainder was delivered to multiglomerular neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). Because most multiglomerular neurons are likely inhibitory local neurons, this pattern emphasizes the important role of feedforward inhibition in the antennal lobe circuit.</p><p>ORN axon terminals are not just presynaptic elements – they are also postsynaptic to other neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Berck et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Rybak et al., 2016</xref>). We found that DM6 ORN axons received most of their synaptic input from multiglomerular neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). This is consistent with physiological studies showing that inhibitory local neurons exert potent control of neurotransmitter release from ORN axon terminals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Olsen and Wilson, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Root et al., 2008</xref>). About a third of synapses onto ORN axon terminals originated from PNs and ORNs. It is not known how PN and ORN inputs might affect ORN axon terminals; in principle, they might either facilitate or suppress neurotransmitter release.</p><p>Turning to the PN’s perspective, we found that PNs received most of their input (~75%) from ORNs, as expected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>). PNs also received a sizeable input (~20%) from multiglomerular neurons. This is also expected, as paired electrophysiological recordings have demonstrated the existence of functional inhibitory synapses from local neurons onto PN dendrites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Liu and Wilson, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Yaksi and Wilson, 2010</xref>).</p><p>PN dendrites are known to contain presynaptic elements as well as postsynaptic elements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Ng et al., 2002</xref>). In this regard, PNs are analogous to olfactory bulb mitral/tufted cells, which also release neurotransmitter from their dendrites onto other cells in the same glomerulus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Urban and Sakmann, 2002</xref>). Within the DM6 glomerulus, we observed that PNs devoted almost all of their output synapses (~90%) to multiglomerular neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>). PNs devoted a small part of their output to ORN axon terminals. Finally, every PN also made connections with all the other PNs in the same glomerulus, consistent with electrophysiological evidence for reciprocal synaptic interactions between sister DM6 PNs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kazama and Wilson, 2009</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>The structure of excitatory connections</title><p>We will use the term ‘unitary connection’ to refer to all the synapses between one presynaptic cell and one postsynaptic cell. Most of the unitary connections we detected were composed of multiple synapses – i.e., multiple contacts at distinct locations, each with its own presynaptic specialization. This is illustrated by the ORN-PN pairs shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>).</p><p>On average, unitary ORN→PN connections were composed of about 23 synapses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>). In principle, a connection composed of so many individual synapses should be both strong and reliable. Indeed, physiological studies have shown that each ORN axon makes a strong and reliable excitatory connection onto every PN in its target glomerulus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Gaudry et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Kazama and Wilson, 2008</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">2009</xref>). An isolated ORN spike typically depolarizes a PN by about 5 mV, and the size of this unitary excitatory postsynaptic potential (uEPSP) is highly reliable from trial to trial. The average number of synapses that we detected per unitary ORN→PN connection is similar to that predicted by quantal analysis in whole-cell recordings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Kazama and Wilson, 2008</xref>) and also by light microscopy methods (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Mosca and Luo, 2014</xref>).</p><p>Compared to ORN→PN connections, the other connections involving ORNs and PNs were weaker, as judged by the number of synapses they contained. Unitary PN→PN connections were composed of about 11 synapses, on average (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>). ORN→ORN connections and PN→ORN connections typically consisted of just one or two synapses. However, the influence of ORN→ORN connections in particular is likely to be non-negligible, because there are so many ORNs in total, and so ORNs collectively provide a major input to other ORNs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>).</p><p>For the remainder of this study, we will focus on ORN→PN synapses and connections. It should be noted that each ORN presynaptic element (i.e., each ‘T-bar’) is presynaptic to multiple postsynaptic profiles, often one PN profile and one or two non-PN profiles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s5">Figure 1—figure supplement 5</xref>). This sort of ‘sharing’ among postsynaptic elements is typical of <italic>Drosophila</italic> CNS synapses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Prokop and Meinertzhagen, 2006</xref>). The size of a T-bar was strongly correlated with the number of postsynaptic profiles; it was also significantly (though weakly) correlated with the surface area of the postsynaptic contacts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s6">Figure 1—figure supplement 6</xref>). These observations suggest that there are mechanisms that coordinate the overall scale of a T-bar and its associated postsynaptic structures, producing concerted pre- and postsynaptic growth. On a synapse-by-synapse basis, these synapse size variations are relatively large; however, because each ORN→PN connection comprises multiple synapses, and because the size variations across synapses tend to average out among the different synapses within each connection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s6">Figure 1—figure supplement 6</xref>), the overall functional impact of these synapse size variations is probably relatively small.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>Compensatory variations in dendrite size and synapse number</title><p>Because glomerulus DM6 exists on both the right and left sides of the brain, our data set provided an opportunity to examine two copies of the same microcircuit that developed under the same genetic program with almost identical sensory experiences (assuming no systematic differences between ORN activity in the right and left antennae). In the brain where we performed our EM reconstructions, we found two DM6 PNs on the right side and three on the left (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). This sort of right-left asymmetry is evidently common: in a larger set of brains, we found that the number of PNs in glomerulus DM6 varies between two and four, and PN counts are often different on the right and left (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>). Related to the left-right asymmetry in PN number, we found a number of differences between the left and right versions of DM6 that provide insight into compensatory mechanisms that circuits may employ to contend with variations in cell numbers.<fig id="fig2" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.24838.012</object-id><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Connectivity compensates for a missing cell.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Skeletonized 3-D renderings of reconstructed PNs.

Notably, the total number of ORN→PN synapses was similar in the left and right glomerulus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). However, because there were three left PNs but only two right PNs, the number of ORN synapses received by an individual PN was 53% higher on the right than on the left. Because PNs on the right also had larger dendrites, this resulted in a similar ORN→PN synapse density in left and right PNs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). Finally, the number of multiglomerular neuron synapses received by an individual PN was also higher on the right than on the left (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>), and individual PNs on the right formed more presynaptic contacts than did individual PNs on the left (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>).</p><p>From a PN’s perspective, which of these factors has the largest effect on the strength of synaptic connections? Is it synapse number, synapse density, or total dendrite size? Connection strength should grow with synapse number, and therefore ORN→PN connections might be stronger on the right. However, connection strength should diminish as the overall size of a dendritic arbor increases (because large arbors have lower input resistance). To deduce how these factors interact, we used compartmental modeling, an established analytical approach for deducing how synaptic conductances are translated into postsynaptic voltages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Rall, 1964</xref>). We divided each reconstructed PN into large numbers of very short segments (14,510–23,502 compartments per PN). Compartments were represented as passive isopotential units connected by resistors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). We took the specific membrane resistance and capacitance from a previous electrophysiological study which measured these values directly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Gouwens and Wilson, 2009</xref>). To simulate synaptic events, we opened conductances in the compartments where postsynaptic sites were identified in our reconstructions, and we analyzed the resulting voltage changes as they propagated throughout the dendritic tree and to the cell body. This allows us to see how measured anatomical variations in these cells can interact to shape PN voltage responses. The time course of the synaptic conductance was taken from a previous study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Gouwens and Wilson, 2009</xref>), and the peak of the synaptic conductance was set to a value which generated postsynaptic potentials with a realistic size (~5 mV, taken from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Kazama and Wilson, 2008</xref>). All synaptic conductance events had the same size and shape, as if a presynaptic spike always opened a fixed number of postsynaptic neurotransmitter receptors with fixed properties; this simplification is reasonable given that there are only small differences across connections in the overall scale of T-bars and postsynaptic contacts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s6">Figure 1—figure supplement 6</xref>). We will use our compartmental models as analytical tools for exploring the functional implications of 3-D ultrastructure data.<fig id="fig3" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.24838.013</object-id><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>Dendritic arbor size equalizes average unitary responses.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Volumetric 3-D rendering of an EM reconstructed PN dendrite. (The cell body is represented as a sphere for display purposes.) Compartmental models fit to ultrastructural and electrophysiological data were used to simulate the voltage responses of each PN to synaptic input from ORNs.

Each of the five reconstructed PNs was modeled in this way. (<bold>B</bold>) Example voltage responses recorded at the cell body of a model PN. A miniature EPSP (mEPSP) is the response to a quantum of neurotransmitter.

Shown here are the largest and smallest mEPSPs and uEPSPs in this PN. In the model, a spike always produces the same conductance at all synapses, and so variations in mEPSP amplitude must be due to variations in the position of synapses on the dendrite.

For each of the 260 ORN→PN connections in our reconstruction, we used the models to infer the corresponding unitary excitatory postsynaptic potential (uEPSP) in the PN cell body (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). Surprisingly, the simulated somatic uEPSP amplitudes were almost identical in right and left PNs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). In other words, the average strength of unitary connections was the same on the right and left. This is notable because of the substantial difference in the number of synapses per ORN→PN connection on the right and the left (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>).</p><p>To better understand this result, we decomposed uEPSPs into their elemental components – i.e., miniature excitatory postsynaptic potentials (mEPSPs). When we measured mEPSPs at the soma, they were much smaller in right PNs than in left PNs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>). The difference in mEPSP amplitude also appeared when we measured each mEPSP in the dendrite, at the site of the synapse itself (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>), reflecting a lower dendritic input resistance in right PNs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref>). Moreover, in right PNs, mEPSPs also decayed significantly more as they propagated from the dendrite to the cell body (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3G</xref>), reflecting a longer average path length from synapse to cell body (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). These differences highlight the important effect of the dendrite’s overall morphology.</p><p>In summary, we find that right and left PNs have uniform average voltage responses to ORN spikes, in spite of their marked differences in dendrite size and synapse number. In principle, synapse number might be altered to compensate for dendrite size, or vice versa.

Accordingly, our compartmental models predicted that ipsilateral uEPSPs are 27% stronger than contralateral uEPSPs, on average (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>). There was no systematic ipsi-contra difference in the placement of synapses onto the PN’s dendritic tree, as judged by the mean mEPSP amplitude at the PN soma (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>).

The ipsi-contra asymmetry is not perfectly precise at the level of single synaptic connections: some ipsi connections are weaker than contra connections onto the same PN (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1—figure supplement 4</xref>). However, as we will show below, this difference is sufficiently precise to permit PNs to prefer ipsilateral stimuli over contralateral stimuli, provided that the stimuli are sufficiently strong. Thus, this finding represents a case where a particular behavior (odor lateralization) can be traced to a systematic variation in structure of connections. It also raises the interesting developmental problem of how ORN axons distinguish ipsilateral from contralateral glomeruli and adjust synapse number accordingly.</p></sec><sec id="s2-6"><title>Inequalities among olfactory receptor neurons in the same antenna</title><p>Individual neurons can improve the signal-to-noise ratio of their spike trains by pooling many inputs carrying a common signal but independent noise. The olfactory system is often cited as one of the clearest examples of this strategy. By pooling across many ORNs that express the same odorant receptor, a postsynaptic neuron should be able to dramatically improve the trial-to-trial reliability of its odor responses. If we assume that all sister ORNs are equally reliable, then the optimal strategy is to weight them equally. Alternatively, if some sister ORNs are more reliable than others, then the optimal strategy is to weight these inputs more heavily. We therefore examined the structure of ORN→PN connections for clues as to how ORNs are weighted.</p><p>We focused first on connections made by ipsilateral ORN axons, so as to remove the factor of ipsi-contra differences (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>). Even among ipsilateral ORN axons, we found substantial structural variation among the connections that they formed with PN dendrites. The main source of variation was the number of synapses per connection. This number varied over a wide range: for example, a typical PN received only 10 synapses from one ipsilateral ORN, but 36 synapses from another ipsilateral ORN (left PN1, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>). The number of synapses per connection was correlated with the physical proximity of ORN axons and PN dendrites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>), suggesting the number of synapses connecting each ORN-PN pair simply scales with the amount of axon-dendrite contact.<fig-group><fig id="fig5" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.24838.016</object-id><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><title>Wiring inequalities among sister ORNs.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Schematic of ORNs connected to a PN with different numbers of synapses.

This value expresses the contribution of each ORN to a PN pool of ORN synapses. Across all connections, the coefficient of variation (CV) in this value was 0.31, consistent with previous estimates based on optical methods (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Mosca and Luo, 2014</xref>).</p><p>By comparison, there was little variability among connections in the mean amplitude of a simulated mEPSP at the soma of the compartmental models (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D and E</xref>). This is because each connection comprised many synapses, and there was little systematic variation across connections in the placement of the synapses on the dendrite. Summation efficacy was also relatively consistent across ORN→PN connections (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F and G</xref>). Summation efficacy is measured as the amplitude of the uEPSP, divided by the summed amplitudes of all the mEPSPs that contribute to that connection. Most connections had summation efficacies near 0.9, indicating weakly sublinear summation.</p><p>Why are average mEPSP amplitude and summation efficacy so consistent (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D–G</xref>)? We obtain a similar level of consistency if we randomly allocate synapses to ORN axons. Specifically, we allocate to each ORN axon the same number of synapses as before, but we draw synapses randomly (without replacement) from the pool of ORN→PN synapse locations. After shuffling, average mEPSP amplitude is still consistent across connections (CV<sub>real</sub> = 0.014, CV<sub>shuffled</sub> = 0.009), as is summation efficacy (CV<sub>real</sub> = 0.041, CV<sub>shuffled</sub> = 0.037; 1000 shuffles). Because each ORN axon makes synapses at many locations on the dendritic tree, the differences among an ORN’s many synapses tend to average out. This makes the qualitative properties of each connection quite similar (i.e., the properties that do not depend on synapse number).</p><p>In short, the major source of variation among ORN→PN connections is simply the number of synapses per connection. Our models indicate that this source of variation should produce a relatively large range in uEPSP amplitudes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5H</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). Different ORNs in the same antenna should have quite different effects on the PN membrane potential, with the strongest ORNs outweighing the weakest ORNs by almost 10-fold. Thus, it seems that PNs do not assign equal weight to ORNs from the same antenna. Rather, the PN response is likely to be dominated by only a fraction of the ORN population.</p></sec><sec id="s2-7"><title>Connection noise in olfactory receptor neuron projections</title><p>In principle, the variation in ORN→PN connections might be the result of developmental noise. Alternatively, it might represent a strategy to optimize PN signals by weighting the most reliable ORNs more heavily. We cannot know for certain because we cannot compare the spike trains of the ORNs in question. However, we can find a clue by comparing different connections made by the same ORN. Paired electrophysiological recordings from sister PNs show that ORN spikes virtually always produce synchronous synaptic events in all ipsi- and contralateral target PNs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kazama and Wilson, 2009</xref>). In essence, all sister PNs experience the same ORN spike trains, even if they are located on opposite sides of the brain. Therefore, if PNs weight ORNs according to their reliability, then those weights should be correlated across all five PNs in our sample. Our analyses thus far have indicated that synapse number is the main correlate of connection strength variability (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>), so we will focus on synapse number here.</p><p>Correlations across PNs are easiest to assess if we first normalize each ORN’s contribution by the total contribution from the antenna in question. For example, there are 26 ORNs in the right antenna, which collectively make 893 synapses onto PN1 on the right side. A typical ORN from the right antenna contributes 34 synapses, or 3.81% (34/893) of the total contribution from that antenna. By focusing on these percentages, we can make a fair comparison between all connections, because this normalization procedure controls for systematic right-left differences as well as ipsi-contra differences in synapse number.</p><p>Using this metric of connection strength (i.e., normalized synapse counts), we found positive correlations between the three PNs on the left side (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>), and also positive correlations between the two PNs on the right side (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>).

Specifically, we asked how accurately an observer can judge the number of ORN spikes fired during a particular time window, based on a model PN’s time-averaged voltage response (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>). It is important to note that all ORNs fire spontaneously even in the absence of odor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">de Bruyne et al., 2001</xref>).

Simulated Poisson spike trains were assigned to reconstructed ORN axons and fed into our PN models. Only ORNs ipsilateral to the PN were simulated. Over a 200 ms period, ORNs fired either 12 spikes (the average number of spikes during this time period that DM6 ORNs fire in the absence of an odor), or 13 spikes (representing a minimal odor stimulus). Based on the distribution of the time-averaged PN voltage (µ) in training trials, we classified each test trial as ‘non-odor’ or ‘odor’ (12 or 13 spikes). We repeated this many times for each of the five model PNs. The same procedure was used to measure accuracy when the ‘odor’ elicited increasing numbers of spikes (14 to 20 spikes).

We therefore first focused on small odor-evoked increases in ORN spiking. We chose a 200 ms window for counting ORN spikes because it can take roughly this amount of time for a fly to show a behavioral response to an odor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bhandawat et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Budick and Dickinson, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Gaudry et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">van Breugel and Dickinson, 2014</xref>). During this counting window, in one antenna, the entire DM6 ORN population fires an average of 12 spontaneous spikes in the absence of an odor (see Materials and methods). We want to estimate how connection noise can affect the ability to detect an increase in ORN spiking above this baseline.</p><p>We simulated ORNs as independent Poisson spike generators, each with the same average spike rate. Each ensemble ORN spike pattern was fed into a model PN, and we measured the time-averaged voltage response of the PN (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>). Even when ORN spike numbers are held constant, the time-averaged PN voltage responses vary from trial to trial, because the timing of ORN spikes varies. We repeated this procedure many times, and then trained a classifier to use the PN response to label trials as ‘no odor’ (12 ORN spikes per antenna) or ‘odor’ (13–20 spikes per antenna). We repeated this for all five PNs and their associated ipsilateral ORNs. Average performance was poor when the number of ‘odor-evoked’ spikes was small, and performance improved as the number of odor-evoked spikes was increased (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>, blue lines).</p><p>To estimate how much the natural variation in ORN→PN connection strengths degrades PN performance, we repeated this task, but now equalizing the number of synapses per ORN→PN connection. Specifically, we randomly reallocated ORN→PN synapses to presynaptic axons so that the number of synapses per axon was as equal as possible, but with each PN dendrite receiving synaptic input at all the same physical locations as before. Now performance was markedly improved (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>, green lines). This simulation shows that the normal variation in the structure of ORN→PN connections can impair the ability of PNs to transmit information about ORN spike counts.</p><p>We also considered an odor lateralization task (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref>). This time, the ORN spike count in one antenna was held at the ‘no odor’ level (12 spikes), and ORN spike counts in the other antenna were either held at the same level (12 spikes) or else driven up by a lateralized ‘odor’ (to 13–20 spikes). In this simulation, each PN received input from all its presynaptic ORNs (both ipsi- and contralateral ORNs). Based on the difference between the mean voltage in right PNs versus left PNs, we trained a classifier to detect when spike number was different in the left and right ORN pools. Interestingly, performance in this task was especially poor (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D</xref>, blue lines) because the classifier operates on the difference between two variables (right and left), which are contaminated by independent connection noise. Taking the difference between these variables amplifies the effect of connection noise. Averaging the activity of PNs on the same side of the brain confers only a limited benefit because wiring noise is correlated among these PNs. When we artificially equalized the number of synapses per connection by randomly reassigning synapses to ORNs so that the number of synapses per axon was as equal as possible, we found that performance increased dramatically, as expected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D</xref>, green lines). This simulation shows that the normal imprecision in the structure of ORN→PN connections can impair the ability of PNs to transmit information about right-left differences in ORN spike counts, particularly because connection noise is correlated within each half of the brain, but uncorrelated across the midline.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><sec id="s3-1"><title>Strengths and limitations of our data</title><p>An olfactory glomerulus represents a discrete neural network. The small spatial scale of this network allowed us to comprehensively reconstruct the connections between every excitatory principal cell (i.e., every ORN and PN). We also benefitted from existing <italic>in vivo</italic> electrophysiological measurements of these neurons. In particular, because we know the specific resistance and capacitance of the PN membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Gouwens and Wilson, 2009</xref>), as well as the amplitudes of uEPSPs and mEPSPs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Kazama and Wilson, 2008</xref>), we were able to construct highly-constrained compartmental models based on our EM reconstructions. These models served as analytical tools to examine the functional impact of structural variations among synaptic connections. Conclusions arising from these models were robust to measured variations in the model parameters derived from electrophysiological experiments (see Materials and methods).</p><p>The models we consider in this study have several limitations. One limitation is that our models include only ORN→PN synapses. ORNs contribute almost 75% of the synaptic input to PNs, with the remaining 25% arising mainly from local neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>). Local neuron synapses could change the integrative properties of PN dendrites, but this would be difficult to capture in a model at present, even if we had reconstructed all the local neurons in the circuit, because local neurons have diverse and complicated spiking patterns (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Nagel and Wilson, 2016</xref>), and it seems likely that only a subset of local neurons provide most of the input to PN dendrites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Berck et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>A second limitation we faced was our lack of knowledge about the active properties of PN dendrites, if any. In principle, voltage-gated conductances in PN dendrites might alter the integrative properties of PNs. However, active properties are unlikely to play an especially large role in PN synaptic integration, because the current-voltage relationships in PNs are fairly linear (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Gouwens and Wilson, 2009</xref>), whereas in other <italic>Drosophila</italic> neurons these relationships can be strongly nonlinear (A.W. Azevedo and R.I. Wilson, unpublished observations). Thus, our passive models are good first approximations in this case.</p><p>Yet another limitation is the inability to directly measure the conductance at individual synapses. Our models assume that conductance is identical at every ORN→PN synapse. This is a reasonable assumption, given that our candidate anatomical proxies for synaptic conductance (T-bar volume and postsynaptic contact area) turned out to be relatively uniform across connections (i.e., the CV of these measurements across connections was relatively low; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s6">Figure 1—figure supplement 6D</xref>). In the future, it will be interesting to investigate the anatomical correlates of synaptic conductance in more detail.</p><p>A final limitation is that PN dendrites may be distorted by sample preparation. EM fixation and preparation tends to reduce neuropil volume, but this effect is likely isotropic throughout the sample and mainly diminishes extracellular space (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Van Harreveld and Khattab, 1969</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Korogod et al., 2015</xref>). It is therefore likely that our estimated dendritic diameters are good first approximations.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Structural correlates of connection strength</title><p>We can think of connection strength as being determined by three major factors. The first is the conductance at each synapse within the connection. The second is the total number of synapses in the connection. The third is the filtering of those conductances by the postsynaptic dendrite. We cannot directly measure the conductance at each synapse, but our anatomical measurements suggest that synapse-averaged conductance is relatively uniform across connections (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s6">Figure 1—figure supplement 6</xref>). Our reconstruction provides direct information about the other two factors (synapse number and dendritic filtering), and our results imply that the first of these is particularly important.</p><p>Notably, we found that the number of synapses per connection was strongly correlated with the strength of ORN→PN connections. The comparison between ipsi- and contralateral synapses represents the clearest example of this correlation, because we know from prior electrophysiology experiments that ipsilateral connections are 30–40% stronger (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Gaudry et al., 2013</xref>). Here, we discovered that ipsilateral connections contain 35% more synapses per connection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>). This result argues that the difference in the number of synapses per connection is the main difference between ipsi and contra connections. By extension, we can infer that there is not a sizeable ipsi-contra difference in synaptic conductance. We also found no ipsi-contra difference in the way that synapses are filtered by the PN dendritic tree, as evidenced by the fact that there is no ipsi-contra difference in simulated mEPSP amplitudes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>). In short, the number of synapses per connection is the dominant mechanism underlying the systematic functional difference between ipsi- and contralateral connections.</p><p>Interestingly, from the perspective of an individual PN, there was little variation across ORN connections in the average strength of the synapses that comprised each connection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>). The efficacy of mEPSP summation at the level of uEPSPs was also notably consistent across these connections (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5G</xref>). Thus, insofar as our models accurately represent the structure of each PN dendrite, it predicts that dendritic filtering has an essentially uniform effect on all ORN→PN connections. This uniformity arises because each connection is composed of many synapses, and synapses made by a given ORN axon tend to be placed onto the dendrite in a relatively unbiased fashion. In essence, each connection is composed of many quasi-random ‘samples’ of dendritic filtering properties, and so the average effect of dendritic filtering is similar across connections.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Co-variation in cell number, dendrite size, and synapse number</title><p>Although <italic>Drosophila</italic> neural networks are sometimes regarded as highly stereotyped, the number of neurons in such a network is actually variable. In the optic lobe, a recent EM study analyzed 7 repetitions of a modular neural network that normally contains 23 uniquely identifiable cells. In 3 of the 7 networks, one cell that ought to be present was in fact missing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Takemura et al., 2015</xref>). In the case of one missing cell, a homologous cell in a neighboring column sent an extra branch into the vacated space, where it received synapses from the normal presynaptic partners of the missing cell. Thus, when a cell is missing, there can be compensatory changes in wiring.</p><p>Variations in antennal lobe PN numbers have been inferred previously based on Gal4 expression patterns (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Grabe et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Tanaka et al., 2004</xref>). Indeed, based on Gal4 expression, we find that there can be two, three, or four PNs in glomerulus DM6, with the ‘typical’ situation (three PNs) occurring only 67% of the time (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>). The brain selected for large-scale serial section EM turned out to contain three PNs on the left side and two PNs on the right side. In the glomerulus with fewer PNs, we found that PN dendrites were larger, perhaps because they had more space to fill. Moreover, there was also a compensatory increase in synapse numbers per PN, so that the total number of synapses per glomerulus was similar on the left and right.</p><p>Our compartmental models allowed us to infer the functional consequences of these concerted changes in PN dendrite morphology and ORN→PN synapse numbers. Remarkably, in the glomerulus with only two PNs, the up-regulation in synapse number was neatly balanced by the increased size of PN dendrites. As illustrated by classic work at the neuromuscular junction, increasing the size of a postsynaptic compartment produces a lower input resistance, and so each quantum of neurotransmitter produces a smaller depolarization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Katz and Thesleff, 1957</xref>). In each of the larger PNs, a presynaptic ORN spike should release more quanta than normal, but the postsynaptic voltage response to each quantum will be smaller. As a result, each PN has the same average response to an ORN spike.</p><p>Counterbalanced effects like this can result from homeostatic mechanisms. For example, in the larval ventral nerve cord, a decrease in presynaptic neurotransmitter release can elicit compensatory growth in postsynaptic dendrites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Tripodi et al., 2008</xref>). Of course, we cannot be sure that this is a case of homeostasis; perhaps there is just a fixed allocation of ORN synapses per glomerulus, and this is why the number of these synapses is equal on the left and the right (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). However, there is direct evidence that the electrical properties of the dendrites of antennal lobe PNs can instruct changes in ORN→PN connections. A previous study used cell-specific K<sup>+</sup> channel overexpression to decrease a PN’s input resistance, and found a compensatory increase in unitary excitatory synaptic currents at ORN connections onto that PN (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Kazama and Wilson, 2008</xref>). That result demonstrated that PN dendrites can up-regulate synaptic currents to compensate for reduced dendritic excitability.</p><p>Together, these findings suggest the following scenario. When one PN failed to develop, the remaining PNs grew larger dendrites, and then synapse number increased to compensate for increased dendrite size. This scenario is consistent with the well-described instructive role of PN dendrites in ORN axon development: PN dendrites form a glomerular map prior to the arrival of migrating ORN axon terminals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Jefferis et al., 2004</xref>).</p><p>This scenario is reminiscent of the ‘size matching’ principle that governs the development of vertebrate neuromuscular junctions, where the size of a muscle is matched to the size of the axon’s terminal arborization, thereby ensuring that large muscles (with low input resistance) receive a larger quantal content per presynaptic spike (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kuno et al., 1971</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Lichtman et al., 1987</xref>). At the developing vertebrate neuromuscular junction, the expansion of the postsynaptic cell seems to be primary, with the elaboration of the presynaptic arbor occurring in response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Balice-Gordon and Lichtman, 1990</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3-4"><title>Developmental noise in wiring</title><p>We found that the number of synapses per ORN→PN connection was quite variable. As a result, ORN→PN connections gave rise to simulated uEPSP amplitudes ranging from 1.6 to 10 mV (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5H</xref>). If all ORNs were functionally identical, this sort of variation would be non-optimal, because each PN’s response would be dominated by only a fraction of its presynaptic ORN axons. Indeed, our simulations showed that this sort of variation can substantially impair a PN’s ability to accurately transmit information about total ORN spike counts, as well as right-left differences in ORN spiking (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). Our simulations suggest that connection noise may be a factor limiting perceptual acuity.</p><p>The discovery of variability per se is not surprising: it was already clear that connections in the <italic>Drosophila</italic> brain can be variable. In the medulla of the optic lobe, the CV of synapse number per connection ranges from 0.08 to 0.87 (computed across all connections of a given type; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Takemura et al., 2015</xref>). In principle, variation across connections of a given type may be taken as evidence of developmental noise (imprecision), or else evidence of adaptive plasticity (precision). For example, systematic variations in upstream input (inherited from earlier layers of visual processing) might drive adaptive activity-dependent changes in the number of synapses per connection in the optic lobe. Here, we focused on primary afferent synapses rather than synapses deep in the circuit, so any systematic upstream variations are limited to variations in ORN spike trains. Moreover, we know that all DM6 PNs witness identical ORN spike trains, because ORN spikes travel faithfully across the midline to invade both ipsi- and contralateral glomeruli (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kazama and Wilson, 2009</xref>). This fact allowed us to test the hypothesis of adaptive plasticity by reconstructing all the synapses that each ORN axon made onto all PNs. We found that the variation in synapse numbers was not faithfully correlated across all PNs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>), and so some of this variation is likely random – that is, unrelated to ORN activity, and caused by a fundamental imprecision in the processes that specify the number of synapses per connection.</p><p>Intriguingly, we found that synapse number variations were correlated across sister PNs on the same side of the brain, even though they were uncorrelated on the opposite sides of the brain. In principle, this might be evidence of incomplete adaptive plasticity – plasticity that works at ipsilateral connections but somehow fails at contralateral connections. More likely is the scenario of correlated developmental noise – e.g., some ORN axons may simply arrive sooner at the ipsilateral glomerulus, and so may form more physical contact with ipsilateral PNs, and thus more synapses. This sort of correlated developmental noise may be one reason why sister PNs on the same side of the brain display such high levels of correlated electrical noise (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kazama and Wilson, 2009</xref>). As we show here, sister PNs on the same side of the brain are dominated by the same pool of ORNs. These ipsilateral sister PNs converge onto higher-order neurons, which are especially sensitive to correlations in sister PN spike times. As a result, sister PN spike timing correlations represent a functionally-relevant constraint on circuit function which can affect both the speed and accuracy of odor stimulus responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Jeanne and Wilson, 2015</xref>).</p><p>Previous studies have highlighted other examples of seemingly non-optimal neural wiring patterns. These have generally been examples of individual neurons following highly tortuous paths (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Lu et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Otopalik et al., 2017</xref>). Tortuosity is energetically costly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chklovskii et al., 2002</xref>), and it is difficult to see any functional benefit to tortuosity in these cases, suggesting that it may simply be the result of an imprecise developmental process. Our study extends this idea by providing evidence of imprecision at the level of synaptic connectivity, not just imprecision in the path that a neuron takes to find a synaptic target.</p></sec><sec id="s3-5"><title>Comparison between adult and juvenile networks</title><p>In the larval antennal lobe, there are 21 glomeruli, as compared to ~50 in the adult. Moreover, each glomerulus in the larva is relatively simple: it contains just one ORN axon and one uniglomerular PN dendrite. The larval antennal lobe connectome has just been reconstructed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Berck et al., 2016</xref>), and it is instructive to note the differences between the adult and the larval versions of the same circuit.</p><p>One difference concerns the structure of individual synaptic connections. In the larva, the average ORN→PN connection contains ~70 synapses. whereas in the adult, it contains 23 synapses. Thus, the increased number of ORNs in the adult is partly compensated by a decrease in the number of synapses per connection.</p><p>Another difference is in the control of ORN output. In the larva, almost all synapses onto ORNs arise from multiglomerular neurons. In the adult, most synapses onto ORNs arise from multiglomerular neurons, but a substantial minority arise from PNs and ORNs. This suggests that the adult network may exert more complicated control of ORN neurotransmitter release.</p></sec><sec id="s3-6"><title>Variations in the connectome: signal and noise</title><p>The brain’s computational power would be substantially reduced if all synaptic connections were identical. From this perspective, systematic variations in synaptic connections are evidence of the brain’s functional capacity – the capacity to match a connection’s strength to its required function. In this study, we had an unusual opportunity to discover systematic variations in a particular connection type, because there are many ORN→PN connections per brain (260 connections in the glomeruli we reconstructed). By studying many instances of the same connection type, we were able to discover several systematic variations. Our results indicate that systematic variations in connection strength arise largely as a result of differences in the number of synapses per connection. We show how systematic ipsi-contra differences can enable odor lateralization, while systematic correlations between synapse number and dendrite size can equalize the response of different PNs to an average ORN spike.</p><p>On the other hand, unsystematic wiring variations (‘connection noise’) must limit the capacity of every neural system. Some of this imprecision can be balanced by homeostatic changes to other parameters, including synaptic parameters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Prinz et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Roffman et al., 2012</xref>).

Acquired at 4 nm/pixel in plane, this amounted to 50 terabytes of raw data comprising 250 million cubic microns of brain and &gt;4 million (4000 × 2672 pixel) camera images. Magnification at the scope was 2000×, accelerating potential was 120 kV, and beam current was ~90 microamperes through a tungsten filament.

AlignTK uses linear normalization to enhance image contrast. With individual eight bits/pixel image frames, a histogram of pixel values was generated for each 64 × 64 pixel subregion in a frame. ‘Black’ and ‘white’ levels were chosen every 64 pixels in <italic>x</italic> and <italic>y</italic> at roughly the 0.5% and 99.5% levels in the cumulative distribution function for the surrounding 256 × 256 region.

Each voxel in the final aligned volume was bilinearly interpolated from four adjacent pixels in a chosen raw frame and then linearly normalized to a 0–255 range using black and white values bilinearly interpolated from the coarse grid of adjusted black and white levels. No blending was used between overlapping frames or between sections.</p><p>The aligned series was then imported into CATMAID (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Saalfeld et al., 2009</xref>) for distributed online visualization and segmentation. Within the portion of the volume spanned by the DM6 glomeruli, there were nine single-section losses, 2 instances of 2-section losses, 1 instance of 3-section losses, and 2 instances of 4-section losses (losses refer to consecutive sections). Across the entire series of 1917 sections there were 50 single-section losses, 16 instances 2-section losses, 10 instances of 3-section losses, 3 instances of 4-section losses, 3 instances of 5-section losses, and one instance of a 6-section loss. One reason why we chose the DM6 glomerulus for reconstruction is that there were no 5- or 6-section losses intersecting this glomerulus. Folds, staining artifacts, and cracks occasionally occurred during section processing, but were typically isolated to edges of our large sections and therefore did not usually interfere with manual segmentation.</p></sec><sec id="s4-3"><title>Synapse size analysis (T-bar volume and postsynaptic contact area)</title><p>We randomly selected 5 ORNs from the left antenna and 5 ORNs from the right antenna. Each of these 10 ORNs formed synaptic connections with all 5 DM6 PNs (n<sub>total synapses</sub> = 683, n<sub>total postsynaptic pn profiles</sub>=1106). Volumes of interest around each synapse were exported from the CATMAID environment (512 pix × 512 pix × 51 sections or 2.05 × 2.05 × 2.04 µm volumes centered on CATMAID connectors marking each synapse). We then used itk-SNAP (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.itksnap.org/">http://www.itksnap.org/</ext-link>) to segment all pixels corresponding to T-bars and postsynaptic membranes. PN postsynaptic membranes were marked and area calculated depending on the orientation of the synapse relative to the plane of sectioning. If the section was cut perpendicular to the synaptic cleft, PN membranes were marked with a line. The length of this line in pixels was then multiplied by pixel resolution (4 nm) and average section thickness (40 nm) to give an area in nm<sup>2</sup>. If, however, a section was cut obliquely or parallel to the synaptic cleft, the PN membrane was segmented as a polygon and the number of pixels in the polygon was multiplied by pixel area (16 nm<sup>2</sup>). <italic>En face</italic> or obliquely cut synapses were identified by serial sections that starkly transitioned from a presynaptic specialization hosting a vesicle pool, to a distinctly different postsynaptic cell, typically with an intervening section of electron dense area representing the postsynaptic density and/or synaptic cleft. Because synapse orientation can change across sections, the decision about how to mark and measure PN membrane areas was made on a section-by-section basis. In cases where a single PN was postsynaptic to the same ORN T-bar multiple times at a single synapse (~10% of synapses), we used the same label for all profiles and subsequently manually sorted the segmentations corresponding to different profiles. All pixels corresponding to T-bars were marked with a polygon, and the number of pixels attributed to a T-bar was then multiplied by pixel area and section thickness (16 nm<sup>2</sup> × 40 nm) to yield its volume. Four annotators made the measurements of T-bar volume and postsynaptic contact area, with three annotators independently measuring each T-bar and postsynaptic contact. The annotator whose measurements were overall closest to the average was selected as the benchmark annotator, and all the measurements of the other three annotators were weighted to counteract their overall bias relative to the benchmark annotator (with biases inferred from their independent measurements of the same synapses). Finally, the three bias-corrected measurements of each T-bar and each PN postsynaptic membrane area were averaged together.</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>Reconstruction and verification</title><p>We reconstructed ORNs and PNs in the EM data set by using CATMAID to manually place a series of marker points down the midline of each process to generate wire-frame models of axonal and dendritic arbors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Lee et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Saalfeld et al., 2009</xref>). We identified synapses using a combination of ultrastructural criteria – namely, the existence of a presynaptic T-bar, presynaptic vesicles, a synaptic cleft, and postsynaptic densities. The presence of most, though not necessarily all, of these features over multiple sections was required for a synapse to be annotated. PNs were easily identifiable based on having dendrites restricted to DM6 and axons projecting into the inner antennocerebral tract. Annotators first identified putative PNs within the DM6 volume based on their large-gauge processes. Annotators then traced each arbor to completion, or until a violation of the above-mentioned PN identification criteria made it clear the cell was not a DM6 PN. While tracing, annotators also comprehensively marked all input and output synapses the arbor participated in. This procedure follows a previously described and validated protocol for manual tracing in serial section TEM data sets such as ours (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Schneider-Mizell et al., 2016</xref>). Subsequently, all profiles presynaptic to each PN were annotated in the same manner. Profiles were categorized as ORNs if they arrived in the antennal lobe from the antennal nerve bundle; all such profiles innervated a single glomerulus either bilaterally (in the case of 51 ORNs) or unilaterally (in the case of 2 ORNs). Because ORN axons travel from the antennal nerve to DM6 in a distinctive trajectory, it was clear even before an ORN exited DM6 that it was indeed an ORN. Profiles not annotated as either PNs or ORNs were categorized as multiglomerular neurons; all such profiles presynaptic to PNs were traced until they crossed the border of DM6 before their tracing was suspended. The multiglomerular neurons in DM6 likely include local neurons, multiglomerular PNs, and neurons innervating the antennal lobe from other brain regions (extrinsic neurons). For all reconstructed neurons included in our analysis, at least one additional independent annotator(s) verified the tracing by working backward from the most distal end of every process. Because ORN axons traveling through the anterior commissure run parallel to the plane of sectioning and are relatively fine caliber, tracing errors were more likely in this structure than other regions of the antennal lobe. To verify our reconstructions in this region, we re-imaged sections containing DM6 ORN axons in the commissure at higher magnification (20,000×). We then aligned the higher-resolution data set to the lower-resolution data set, and an additional independent annotator (who was blind to the original reconstructions) was assigned to trace all the DM6 axons through the commissure.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Labeling DM6 PNs for cell counting</title><p>To count the number of PNs that are normally present in a DM6 glomerulus, we labeled and counted these cells in five additional flies.

By selectively photoactivating within the neuropil of DM6, we could photolabel the DM6 PNs alone, and then count the number of PNs innervating that glomerulus. Photoactivation was performed using a custom built two-photon laser-scanning microscope. We first imaged the antennal lobe at 925 nm and low laser power to identify DM6. After defining volumes of interest restricted to the core of the glomerular neuropil based on these images, PA-GFP was photoconverted by imaging through the volume with 710 nm light. In each photoactivation block, we moved through the z depth of the volume of interest with 0.25 μm steps. Each glomerulus was subject to three photoactivation blocks at intervals of five to ten minutes. After PA-GFP is photoactivated in the glomerular neuropil (i.e., axons and dendrites), it diffuses into the somata of cells. We then imaged each brain using an Andor XD spinning disk confocal microscope equipped with a Yokogawa CSU-X1 spinning disk unit and a Zyla 4.2 CMOS camera. For this imaging we used laser illumination at 488 nm.

We did this in the CATMAID environment by estimating the average neurite caliber between each pair of skeleton branch points. We then used this value as the radius of the distal branch point (relative to the soma) and all nodes leading up to the proximal branch point. Dendritic segments between branch points were therefore represented as cylinders of uniform radius matched to the observed caliber of the neurite. This process was repeated until the entire skeleton was inflated.</p><p>Next, we exported PN morphologies along with ORN input synapse locations as neuroML 1.8.1 models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Gleeson et al., 2010</xref>). Using the software tool neuroConstruct (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Gleeson et al., 2007</xref>), we defined PN membrane properties and synaptic conductances, and subsequently exported these models to the NEURON simulation environment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hines and Carnevale, 1997</xref>). Additionally, we used neuroConstruct to remesh the PN models to ensure each segment had an electrotonic length between 0.1 and 0.0001. Each model PN was comprised of 1814–3148 cables, each with a measured diameter taken from the data (these are termed 'sections' in the NEURON modeling environment); these cables were then further subdivided into 14,510–23,502 compartments for numerical simulation purposes, so that each cable was comprised of multiple compartments having equal length and diameter (termed 'segments' in the NEURON modeling environment). We gave PN membranes uniform, passive properties. A previous experimental study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Gouwens and Wilson, 2009</xref>) used electrophysiological recordings from PNs to derive values for their specific membrane resistance (20.8 kΩ cm<sup>2</sup>), specific membrane capacitance (0.8 µf/cm<sup>2</sup>), and specific axial resistivity (266.1 Ω cm). The measurements of that study were taken from DM1 PNs, so in order to use these measurements in our study, we assume that the intensive (size-independent) properties of DM6 PNs are similar to those of DM1 PNs. The ORN to PN synaptic conductance waveform we used was also adapted from this study. This was modeled as the sum of two exponentials, with a rising time constant of 0.2 ms and a decay time constant of 1.1 ms. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Gouwens and Wilson (2009)</xref> modeled the maximum synaptic conductance as having a value of 0.27 nS (it was incorrectly reported in that paper as 2.7 × 10<sup>−4</sup> nS, but the value used was actually 0.27 nS); we used a value of 0.1 nS here because this produced more realistic uEPSP amplitudes (on average roughly 5 mV; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Kazama and Wilson, 2008</xref>).</p><p>To measure the amplitude of individual mEPSPs, we sequentially activated individual synapses in the modeled PN dendrite, allowing enough time (200 ms) between events for the PN membrane potential to decay to baseline. We recorded PN voltage responses either at the cell body (somatic mEPSPs) or within the compartment where the synaptic conductance was activated (dendritic mEPSPs). To simulate unitary EPSPs, we synchronously activated all synapses from an individual ORN. In this case we always measured the PN voltage response at the cell body (somatic uEPSPs).</p><p>It is worth asking whether these models are robust to measured variations in the model parameters derived from electrophysiological experiments. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Gouwens and Wilson (2009)</xref>, measured the specific intracellular resistivity, membrane resistance, and membrane capacitance of three antennal lobe PNs (‘Cell 1’, ‘Cell 2’, and ‘Cell 3’).

As a check, we constructed five alternate model PNs using values fit from Cell 1, and also five more alternate model PNs using values fit from Cell 2. When we used these alternate PNs, we obtained results that were overall the same as the results we obtained with the PNs fit to Cell 3 values. The only difference is that we found a very small but statistically significance left-right difference in uEPSP amplitudes with the models that were fit to Cell 2 values, whereas we did not find any statistically significant left-right difference in uEPSP amplitudes with the models fit to Cell 1 or Cell 3 values (<italic>P</italic><sub>Cell 1</sub> &gt; 0.07, <italic>P</italic><sub>Cell 2</sub> &gt; 0.02, <italic>P</italic><sub>Cell 3</sub> &gt; 0.7, permutation test, <italic>n</italic> = 156 left and 104 right unitary connections).

The mean spontaneous firing rate of the DM6 ORNs cannot easily be measured from single-sensillum recordings on the antenna because the sensillum which houses DM6 ORNs is the ab10 sensillum (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Couto et al., 2005</xref>), which is small and has remained undetected in surveys of single-sensillum physiology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">de Bruyne et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hallem and Carlson, 2004</xref>). We therefore measured the mean spontaneous firing rate of DM6 ORNs by measuring the rate of large spontaneous EPSCs in voltage-clamp recordings from DM6 PNs in a re-analysis of data collected from DM6 PNs for a previously published study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Gaudry et al., 2013</xref>). In all recordings we analyzed, the contralateral antenna had been removed just before the recording, so PNs were receiving spiking input from ipsilateral ORNs only. The rate of these events was 58 Hz, and so dividing by 26.5 ORNs, we obtain 2.2 spikes/s/ORN. This method (using spontaneous EPSC rates) has been shown to provide a good agreement with single-sensillum recordings of ORN spike rates in the case of a different glomerulus, glomerulus DM4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Kazama and Wilson, 2008</xref>). Multiplying the estimated spontaneous ORN spike rate of 2.2 spikes/s by a window of 200 ms and rounding to the nearest integer yields a basal ‘no odor’ value of 12 spikes.</p><p>In each trial, the ipsilateral population of 26 or 27 ORNs fired a specified number of spikes within the first 200 ms, ranging from 12 to 20, and no spikes in the second 200 ms. This allowed the PN membrane potential to return to baseline by the end of each trial. We then used the time-averaged PN membrane potential, recorded at the soma, to train and test a linear classifier to label trials as ‘odor’ (12 ORN spikes) or ‘no odor’ (13–20 ORN spikes). For each of the five model PNs, we ran 2500 trials for training and 2500 independent trials for testing. We initially performed this exercise using model PNs based directly on our reconstructions, where each ORN spike activated all synapses attributed to that ORN in our reconstruction. Subsequently, we artificially equalized the number of synapses per ORN axon in the following manner. We defined a pool of synapse locations on the PN dendrite corresponding to all the synapses made by ipsilateral ORNs onto that PN. We then allocated synapses arbitrarily and evenly to ORNs by drawing from this pool (without replacement) until synapses were re-allocated. When the total number of ipsilateral ORN synapses was not evenly divisible by the number of ipsilateral ORNs, the remainders were randomly assigned to simulated ORNs. When synapse numbers are artificially equalized in this manner, summation efficacy increases, and so uEPSP amplitudes increase. In order to keep average uEPSP amplitudes the same as before, the maximum conductance of our synapse models were reduced to 0.0958 nS. Thus, our synapse equalization procedure made uEPSP amplitudes more uniform across connections without changing the mean uEPSP amplitude. As before, for each of the five model PNs, we ran 2500 trials for training and 2500 independent trials for testing. Synapses were independently re-allocated in each trial.</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>Classifier mimicking an ‘odor lateralization’` task</title><p>The procedure here was the same as for the spike count classifier, except in every trial we modeled ORNs in the right antenna as well as ORNs in the left antenna, and all PNs received both right and left ORN input. On any given trial, the ORNs in one antenna fired 12 spikes, and the ORNs in the other antenna fired 12 to 20 spikes. In every trial, both right and left ORN spike trains were fed into the dendrites of all 5 PN models. We then used the means of the resulting PN responses to train and test a linear classifier to detect trials where there was a right-left asymmetry in ORN spike count. In the equalized case, we equalized synapse numbers independently for each PN-antenna combination. For example, we forced all ORNs in the right antenna to have equal contributions to right PN1, and we also forced all ORNs in the left antenna to have equal contributions to right PN1, but the average asymmetry between ipsi- and contralateral connections was preserved. In the equalized case, the maximum conductance of our synapse models were reduced to 0.0958 nS, as before.</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>Statistics</title><p>The number of observations of any given variable was dictated by the number of cells and synapses in glomerulus DM6, and so was not predetermined using statistical methods. Statistical comparisons between sample distributions were done with Permutation tests (i.e. Monte Carlo-based Randomization tests) unless otherwise noted. Permutation test were used because they do not assume the underlying distributions are normal, and because observations do not need to be independent. For Permutation tests, we computed the incidence of differences between means or Pearson's linear correlation coefficient of randomly drawn samples from combined sample distributions exceeding the empirical difference.</p></sec><sec id="s4-10"><title>Code and data availability</title><p>The aligned EM data set and model files can be accessed as resources at: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://neurodata.io/data/tobin17.">https://neurodata.io/data/tobin17.</ext-link> Custom code is available at: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/htem/tobin17">https://github.com/htem/tobin17</ext-link> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Tobin, 2017</xref>); a copy is archived at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/elifesciences-publications/tobin17">https://github.com/elifesciences-publications/tobin17</ext-link>.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We thank S Bellou, R Caplan, C Dekker, K Hern, M Johnson, P Starkey, Z Tweed for primary tracing and reconstruction; W Copeland, Y Hasanat, J Kiperman, B Sanders for targeted synapse segmentation; E Raviola for discussions and advice; M Reed and C Bolger for technical support at the beginning of the study; A Cardona and S Saalfeld for making the CATMAID project openly available; and T Kazimiers for assistance in optimizing our CATMAID instance.

Your article has been favorably evaluated by Eve Marder (Senior Editor) and three reviewers, one of whom, Liqun Luo (Reviewer #1), is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Albert Cardona (Reviewer #2).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>We append the full reviews from all three reviewers below. We hope that you can address each of the critiques in your revision. We would like to clarify one item regarding &quot;synapse size&quot; (the first critique of reviewer 3). Upon further discussion among reviewers, reviewer 3 has the following additional comments: &quot;The relationship between synapse size, as well as synapse number, and connection strength is part of a general background from <italic>Drosophila</italic> studies. […] Not only would this address an important component of pathway strength, it would acknowledge an important issue that might not be obvious to readers who work on different nervous systems.&quot;</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic> </p><p>This is an excellent paper integrating new EM reconstruction data with modeling and previous electrophysiology studies to produce general insight about the relationship between the structure, physiological properties, and functions of microcircuits. The authors focus on reconstructing olfactory receptor neurons (ORNs) and projection neurons (PNs) that innervate one of the fifty pairs of glomeruli in the <italic>Drosophila</italic> antennal lobe. Besides generating valuable quantitative ultra-structural data about the synaptic connectivity, the authors produced a compartmental model that simulates how ORN inputs are integrated in PNs, and used it to analyze three interesting aspects from their data: how PNs compensate for the difference in their numbers (particularly interesting), why ipsi-lateral ORNs exhibit stronger connections with PNs than do contra-lateral ORNs, and what is the functional implication for variations in synapse numbers between individual ORN→PN pairs. The authors have also explicitly discussed limitations of their study (e.g., their model does not take into account the inhibitory input or variations in strengths of individual synapses). Among the recent surge of EM reconstruction studies, this one ranks as one of the best to integrate structure and physiological properties of a well-studied model circuit, and as such should be of broad interest to the neuroscience community.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic> </p><p>Tobin et al. tackle the timely question of the nature of variation in synaptic connectivity and how neural computations are affected by variations in the synaptic structure of a circuit.</p><p>The manuscript reports on the relationship between neuronal function and dense anatomical reconstructions as obtained from serial section electron microscopy. Among the many interesting results, some of them are likely to make of this paper an instant classic. For example, the authors quite clearly demonstrate that the strength of a unitary connection strongly correlates with the number of synapses from an axon to a dendrite. The entire and rather large emerging field of connectomics in <italic>Drosophila</italic> will look up to this paper for data on how to translate anatomical synaptic contacts to functional connectivity strength.</p><p>In addition, the authors exploit the opportunity to address the neural circuit basis of odor lateralization, that is, the ability of the animal to distinguish odor intensities between the left and right antennae. The bilateral nature of the olfactory receptor neuron (ORN) axons could a priori make this task impossible, but the authors discovered a systematic variation in that the number of synapses is larger in the ipsilateral rather than the contralateral ORN-PN connection, which the authors show is sufficient to enable computing whether the odor concentration is higher on either side of the animal.</p><p>Importantly, this study touches on how neurons of the same cell type interact with neurons of a second cell type, a connectivity arrangement important in large nervous systems such as that of vertebrates. The authors show data in support of an inherent, underlying flexibility in the dimensions of the dendrites of the postsynaptic neurons relative to the number of postsynaptic neurons, given a similar number of presynaptic neurons.</p><p>The statement, quote: &quot;we find that right and left PNs have uniform average voltage responses to ORN spikes, in spite of their marked differences in dendrite size and synapse number.&quot; might turn out to be of extraordinary value, given that it suggests the details of an underlying developmental program that can cope with changes in the number of neurons, allowing the population to explore the fitness landscape towards the best number as appropriate given environmental conditions.</p><p>In summary, this work is largely complete and self-contained, and a pleasure to read.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic> </p><p>References are to text pages, not pdf.</p><p>Wiring variations that enable and constrain neural computation in a sensory microcircuit.</p><p>First, I take my hat off to the authors for their devoted study of AL circuits using such labor-intensive methods. For this submission, anatomy is the bedrock, while the modeling aspects are more conjectural. In particular, I would submit that the weakest link is the main story line, the link between synaptic structure and synaptic strength. Even so, it ought to be possible to relate all parameters of the connectome to those of the modeling, provided we have all the requisite measures. To this end, the authors provide important data on dendritic caliber, which has generally not been treated extensively in the literature on <italic>Drosophila</italic> neurons. While it's easy to count synapse number and plot distributions, however, so far missing from the authors' story is synapse size. Does this vary in any consistent way between (pre)synaptic sites, and do the postsynaptic densities, which I presume are also visible, co-vary with the size of presynaptic contact? The size of the dendrite may co-vary with these, but is not itself a proxy for synapse size. If the authors are to claim a relationship between synapses number and the strength of synaptic transmission, I think these additional parameters should be included, and hope they can be mined with relative ease from existing image data, even if I imagine these are all fixed modules.</p><p>Introduction, fourth paragraph. Additional important discussion on wiring accuracy in brains is to be found in Takemura et al. (PNAS 112 (Rall, 1964): 13711-13716, 2015) which the authors cite but only later in support of missing cells in medulla columns. The PNAS paper includes reference to comparisons between left/right homologues in <italic>C. elegans</italic> and comparisons between synapse numbers in neighboring medulla columns in <italic>Drosophila</italic> both of which bear on the authors' data.</p><p>The authors' conclusions concerning systematic and unsystematic variations in wiring (Introduction, last paragraph and later) stand in contrast to those obtained from the fly's visual system (Takemura et al., 2015). In fact, the medulla analyses indicate the high order of synaptic and wiring accuracy of which <italic>Drosophila</italic> is also capable in constructing the synaptic circuits in its brain, in that case in the visual system. Accuracy, or invariance, in the case of the latter is presumably driven by the need to transmit reliably at the high temporal frequencies demanded by vision, a requirement that can be less demanding in the olfactory pathway.</p><p>Feedforward. I find &quot;feedforward&quot; in the following construction unnecessary and confusing: &quot;along with all the feedforward excitatory synapses onto these cells.&quot; (Introduction, fourth paragraph). 'Feedforward' and 'onto' sound to me to be contradictory because feedforward could refer to the synaptic outputs of the cell in question. I think what the authors want to say is &quot;along with all the excitatory inputs (synapses) onto these cells&quot;.</p><p>&quot;Three experts independently identified glomerulus DM6 in the EM data set by visual inspection based on published light-level maps&quot;. The account is remarkable more for what it does not say than what it does say. I find the documentation of how the authors selected DM6 neurons for reconstruction to be insufficient. Although confocal data clearly reveal the antennal lobe's glomerular map, based especially on synaptic and genetic labelling, such data are deceptive for EM studies, which reveal all profiles not their selective features. In particular there are no clear glial boundaries between glomeruli, and glomeruli, which the authors fail to mention, and can only be identified unambiguously with reference to the map of surrounding glomeruli, or possibly from Cartesian coordinates, and I think the authors should acknowledge this. Quite possibly the authors have gained sufficient expertise from physiological recordings to identify specific glomeruli but this is in the intact living antennal lobe. Glomeruli also partly overlap each other in the depth of the lobe neuropile. Moreover, we are not told why DM6 itself was chosen over other glomeruli, and as a rationale the authors may want to cite their own physiological studies. These questions are central to the authors' analysis and should be made clear in the text, because while I am sure that great care was taken, and we can be reassured that three experts made the same identification, in fact it's not a trivial problem at all at EM level. Most readers would not know or understand this because confocal maps are so convincing, because most readers never see EM, and because most may erroneously assume that there is a clear glial boundary surrounding each glomerulus. It's also quite possible to target DM6 in a living prep, which studies from the Wilson lab have done repeatedly, but the contours of the antennal lobe's surface also differ from the 2D images from EM sections. These issues of 'why' and 'how' need to be clearly addressed. The text of the Methods should enable another worker to repeat the authors' observations. In particular, how can the authors provide the reader the clear assurance that they have actually targeted the same glomerulus on left and right sides of the brain, and that the left/right asymmetries they find are not the outcome of choosing different glomeruli on the two sides. I fully accept, by contrast, that the authors scrupulously identify in the EM dataset ORNs and PNs from their respective arbors and axon trajectories.</p><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>. Related: although valuable as an EM overview, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref> provides insufficient information to identify DM6, especially in the z axis. Was the entire glomerulus reconstructed and how did the authors decide where its boundaries lay?</p><p>Orphans: To what does the rate of orphans refer? The number of independent fragments that were presynaptic to PNs but could not be connected to an identified cell? How many synapses did these contribute? Were any orphaned at both ends, having no contact with either identified ORN or PN? If so, what proportion?</p><p>The claim (subsection “Cells comprising the glomerular micro-circuit”, last paragraph) that false continuations between fragments are easily detected and corrected during independent review is more likely to be an attribute of the arbor than of the reconstruction strategy, since larval neurons in <italic>Drosophila</italic> tend to have relatively more stout neurites with distal extremities that bear most synapses. Thus, the conclusion that they are therefore very rare in the final reconstruction may be less warranted than is claimed.</p><p>Presynaptic T-bars. Please comment on the range of structural phenotypes exhibited by presynaptic T-bars in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1— – figure supplement 3</xref>, or from the authors' analysis of synapses in serial sections.</p><p>Table 1. Subsection “Relative abundance of connection types”, first paragraph. I do not find Table 1, which is needed to interpret <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1—figure supplement 4</xref>.</p><p>Synaptic numbers, subsection “The structure and strength of excitatory connections”. Documentation of synapse numbers is good, and interpretation is generally appropriate, but the authors should review their text carefully to check the tendency to equate synapse number with synapse strength, and to distinguish semantic reference to these two strictly. It's also important to remember the processing depth introduced by feedback synapses, for which transmission gain reflects not only the number of feedforward synapses but also upstream synapses. Thus, in addition to the gain of individual synapses, feedback circuits inherit the signal gain from their synaptic inputs.</p><p>Adjacency matrix in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1—figure supplement 4</xref> resembles a number of such matrices that have now been published, with the top numbers around 50 synapses, in line with those in other brain regions, which the authors could indicate. Each intercept represents the site of presumed transmission between a single pre- and postsynaptic neuron, but the text should acknowledge that because each presynaptic site has several postsynaptic elements, a number of intercepts in the matrix necessarily are coordinately linked. In fact, I find no easy metric for synaptic divergence revealed in this figure, or elsewhere in the text. How many dyads, triads etc. are incorporated in the matrix. Alternatively, how many monads?</p><p>Related to the preceding point: <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref>. These are single images of synapses that fail to reveal profiles above and below the plane of section. Yet clearly there are multiple dendrites at single release sites, as can indeed be seen in some sections. This information is given in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4——figure supplement 1E</xref> but only as averages that compare Ipsi and Contra ORNs.</p><p>The authors state that &quot;All synaptic conductance events had the same size and shape.&quot; This presumably assumes that those conductance events were shared at the same presynaptic site? Do the authors imagine that each postsynaptic dendrite sees the same cloud of neurotransmitter release, or is the cloud shared amongst the several dendrites. If that number varies, does this mean that transmission varies with the number of dendrites, or is the dendritic signal unaltered; how does the outcome affect the authors' modeling? I don't think there is an easy answer, but these issues should at least be acknowledged, and as far as possible discussed.</p><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1—figure supplement 4</xref>. In addition, I find that using black for 0 synapses is confusing, not least because I find it hard to discriminate differences in tone for dark intercepts having few synapses, and recommend replotting this matrix using white for intercepts having 0 synapses. Alternatively, reverse the entire spectrum of tones, so that 50+ is black and 0 is white.</p><p>Methods. Of the 1917 sections cut, we are told, in the subsection “Large-scale TEM imaging and alignment”, how many sections were lost, apparently 145, from 1 to 6, about 7% of the total series – so roughly equal to the number of orphans, but not how many sections were needed to encompass the DM6 glomeruli, and thus not therefore what proportion of those were drops. Losing 6 sections (0.3µm) is very damaging to the continuity of any series, but at least the authors are honest in reporting them. How many of these drops accounted for the occurrence of orphans, one wonders, and were these equal on left and right DN6 sides? The authors should I think try to address these points.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.24838.021</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>We append the full reviews from all three reviewers below. We hope that you can address each of the critiques in your revision. We would like to clarify one item regarding &quot;synapse size&quot; (the first critique of reviewer 3). Upon further discussion among reviewers, reviewer 3 has the following additional comments: &quot;The relationship between synapse size, as well as synapse number, and connection strength is part of a general background from Drosophila studies. It happens that in flies from many studies now that most synapses are of uniform size, so that pathway strength is indeed approximated by synapse numbers without reference to their sizes. Even so, synapse size is rarely reported and compared between neuropile regions. To demonstrate modularity of synapse size it would only be necessary to measure ~40 synaptic profiles in fair cross section and 20 in longitudinal section, in order to determine variation in synapse contact sizes, and to compare with other published reports. Not only would this address an important component of pathway strength, it would acknowledge an important issue that might not be obvious to readers who work on different nervous systems.&quot;</italic> </p><p>We agree that synapse size is an important issue. There are two questions here that we can address with our dataset. First, how much does synapse size vary? Second, how do synapse size variations correlate with other anatomical variations?</p><p>To address these questions, we randomly selected 10 ORNs (5 from the left and 5 from the right antenna), and manually segmented all of their synapses onto all 5 of our reconstructed PNs (n<sub>T-bars</sub>= 683, n<sub>pn profiles</sub>= 1106). At each synapse, two features were measured, the ORN presynaptic T-bar volume and the PN postsynaptic contact area (PSCA) for all postsynaptic PN profiles present. To increase the precision of these measurements, each T-bar volume and PSCA was independently measured by three different annotators, and the measurements of different annotators were then combined after weighting each annotator’s measurements according to their overall measurement bias across the whole data set (relative to the other annotators).</p><p>The results of our synapse size analyses are now shown in a new supplement (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s6">Figure 1—figure supplement 6</xref>). Overall, we found that the two measures of synapse size (T-bar volume and postsynaptic contact area) were significantly (though weakly) correlated. They were also significantly correlated with the number of postsynaptic profiles per T-bar. This means that there must be mechanisms that produce coordinated variations in all three variables on a synapse-by-synapse basis (T-bar volume, postsynaptic contact area, and number of postsynaptic profiles).</p><p>That said, when we compared different ORN→PN connections (by averaging the size of all the synapses belonging to the same connection), we found that synapse size was only a minor source of variation among connections (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s6">Figure 1—figure supplement 6</xref>). The main source of variation among connections was still the number of synapses per connection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). In other words, what distinguishes one connection from another is primarily the number of synapses it contains, and not the size of those synapses.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic> </p><p><italic>This is an excellent paper integrating new EM reconstruction data with modeling and previous electrophysiology studies to produce general insight about the relationship between the structure, physiological properties, and functions of microcircuits. The authors focus on reconstructing olfactory receptor neurons (ORNs) and projection neurons (PNs) that innervate one of the fifty pairs of glomeruli in the Drosophila antennal lobe. Besides generating valuable quantitative ultra-structural data about the synaptic connectivity, the authors produced a compartmental model that simulates how ORN inputs are integrated in PNs, and used it to analyze three interesting aspects from their data: how PNs compensate for the difference in their numbers (particularly interesting), why ipsi-lateral ORNs exhibit stronger connections with PNs than do contra-lateral ORNs, and what is the functional implication for variations in synapse numbers between individual ORN→PN pairs. The authors have also explicitly discussed limitations of their study (e.g., their model does not take into account the inhibitory input or variations in strengths of individual synapses). Among the recent surge of EM reconstruction studies, this one ranks as one of the best to integrate structure and physiological properties of a well-studied model circuit, and as such should be of broad interest to the neuroscience community.</italic> </p><p>We are grateful for this positive feedback.</p><p>We note that we do now look explicitly at anatomical parameters that may be proxies for the “strengths of individual synapses”. To be precise, we describe variations in synapse size parameters (T-bar volume, postsynaptic contact area). We find that while these parameters vary substantially across synapses, they vary only modestly across different synaptic connections, as noted above.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic> </p><p><italic>References are to text pages, not pdf.</italic></p><p><italic>Wiring variations that enable and constrain neural computation in a sensory microcircuit.</italic></p><p><italic>First, I take my hat off to the authors for their devoted study of AL circuits using such labor-intensive methods. For this submission, anatomy is the bedrock, while the modeling aspects are more conjectural. In particular, I would submit that the weakest link is the main story line, the link between synaptic structure and synaptic strength. Even so, it ought to be possible to relate all parameters of the connectome to those of the modeling, provided we have all the requisite measures. To this end, the authors provide important data on dendritic caliber, which has generally not been treated extensively in the literature on Drosophila neurons. While it's easy to count synapse number and plot distributions, however, so far missing from the authors' story is synapse size. Does this vary in any consistent way between (pre)synaptic sites, and do the postsynaptic densities, which I presume are also visible, co-vary with the size of presynaptic contact? The size of the dendrite may co-vary with these, but is not itself a proxy for synapse size. If the authors are to claim a relationship between synapses number and the strength of synaptic transmission, I think these additional parameters should be included, and hope they can be mined with relative ease from existing image data, even if I imagine these are all fixed modules.</italic> </p><p>As requested by the reviewer, we have now measured synapse size parameters. We provide an overview of our analysis and our findings at the beginning of this reply document, where we respond to the Editor’s Summary (which highlighted this particular request). Synapse size analyses are now included in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s6">Figure 1—figure supplement 6</xref>.</p><p><italic>Introduction, fourth paragraph. Additional important discussion on wiring accuracy in brains is to be found in Takemura et al. (PNAS 112 (Rall, 1964): 13711-13716, 2015) which the authors cite but only later in support of missing cells in medulla columns. The PNAS paper includes reference to comparisons between left/right homologues in C. elegans and comparisons between synapse numbers in neighboring medulla columns in Drosophila both of which bear on the authors' data.</italic> </p><p><italic>The authors' conclusions concerning systematic and unsystematic variations in wiring (Introduction, last paragraph and later) stand in contrast to those obtained from the fly's visual system (Takemura et al., 2015). In fact, the medulla analyses indicate the high order of synaptic and wiring accuracy of which Drosophila is also capable in constructing the synaptic circuits in its brain, in that case in the visual system. Accuracy, or invariance, in the case of the latter is presumably driven by the need to transmit reliably at the high temporal frequencies demanded by vision, a requirement that can be less demanding in the olfactory pathway.</italic> </p><p>We agree that Takemura et al. (2015) should be cited more prominently. We had devoted space to this paper in the Discussion, but not in the Introduction. We now cite this paper prominently in the Introduction as an example of variability in neural wiring.</p><p>The reviewer suggests that the demands of visual processing require more precision in neural architecture than the demands of olfactory processing do. We do not think the relative demands of visual and olfactory computations are entirely clear at this point, and we would not agree with the idea that olfactory processing is undemanding. Odors can fluctuate at high temporal frequencies in natural turbulent settings, with plume hit durations of &lt;20 ms or less. These temporal features are useful for navigation. Olfactory transduction in <italic>Drosophila</italic> is fast enough to follow fluctuations up to 10 Hz. Thus, olfaction is not much slower than vision. Olfaction is also very high dimensional, because a large number of physiolochemical dimensions are needed to describe the differences between distinct chemicals. This is yet another reason why it might be adaptive for the olfactory system to have a high rate of information transmission at the periphery. It is therefore particularly interesting that the wiring olfactory system should be imprecise.</p><p>We do not think the level of variation we describe here is notably larger than the imprecision described by Takemura et al. (2015). Takemura et al. described two kinds of variation:</p><p>1) Binary connection variation (missing connections, or connections that are normally absent yet occasionally present). In the optic lobe, Takemura et al. found that the rate of binary variation is about 1%. At ORN-to-PN synapses, we find that the rate is about 2%. (One ORN on the left failed to make a connection with the 2 right PNs, and one ORN on the right failed to make a connection with the 3 left PNs. The rate of missing connections is therefore 2+3 divided by ((26 ORNs+27 ORNs) × 5 PNs), or 2%.) Therefore, binary connection variation is not notably different in the two data sets.</p><p>2) Analog connection variation (variation in the number of synapses per unitary connection, across all instances of a particular connection type). In the optic lobe, Takemura et al. found that the CV of synapse number per connection ranges from 0.08 to 0.87, depending on connection type. At ORN-to-PN synapses, we find that the CV is 0.31. Therefore, analog connection variation is not notably different in the two data sets.</p><p>Given the variability described by Takemura et al., it is unsurprising that we also find variability in our reconstruction. The contribution of our study is not simply to describe variability per se. Rather, the contribution of this study is to provide evidence for both systematic and unsystematic kinds of anatomical variability. We do not need to assume that all variability is “noise” (or “error”). We show that certain anatomical parameters co-vary in a systematic way that ought to be adaptive (given the framework of our model), whereas other parameters vary in an unsystematic way that ought to be maladaptive (again, given the framework of our model).</p><p><italic>Feedforward. I find &quot;feedforward&quot; in the following construction unnecessary and confusing: &quot;along with all the feedforward excitatory synapses onto these cells.&quot; (Introduction, fourth paragraph). 'Feedforward' and 'onto' sound to me to be contradictory because feedforward could refer to the synaptic outputs of the cell in question. I think what the authors want to say is &quot;along with all the excitatory inputs (synapses) onto these cells&quot;.</italic> </p><p>We thank the reviewer for pointing this out. Our intention was just to distinguish ORN→PN synapses from other types of excitatory synapses which are not “feedforward” (e.g., PN→PN synapses, PN→ORN synapses). In the revised manuscript, have revised to this phrase to read as follows: “along with all the feedforward excitatory synapses that these cells receive”.</p><p><italic>&quot;Three experts independently identified glomerulus DM6 in the EM data set by visual inspection based on published light-level maps&quot;. The account is remarkable more for what it does not say than what it does say. I find the documentation of how the authors selected DM6 neurons for reconstruction to be insufficient. Although confocal data clearly reveal the antennal lobe's glomerular map, based especially on synaptic and genetic labelling, such data are deceptive for EM studies, which reveal all profiles not their selective features. In particular there are no clear glial boundaries between glomeruli, and glomeruli, which the authors fail to mention, and can only be identified unambiguously with reference to the map of surrounding glomeruli, or possibly from Cartesian coordinates, and I think the authors should acknowledge this. Quite possibly the authors have gained sufficient expertise from physiological recordings to identify specific glomeruli but this is in the intact living antennal lobe. Glomeruli also partly overlap each other in the depth of the lobe neuropile. Moreover, we are not told why DM6 itself was chosen over other glomeruli, and as a rationale the authors may want to cite their own physiological studies. These questions are central to the authors' analysis and should be made clear in the text, because while I am sure that great care was taken, and we can be reassured that three experts made the same identification, in fact it's not a trivial problem at all at EM level. Most readers would not know or understand this because confocal maps are so convincing, because most readers never see EM, and because most may erroneously assume that there is a clear glial boundary surrounding each glomerulus. It's also quite possible to target DM6 in a living prep, which studies from the Wilson lab have done repeatedly, but the contours of the antennal lobe's surface also differ from the 2D images from EM sections. These issues of 'why' and 'how' need to be clearly addressed. The text of the Methods should enable another worker to repeat the authors' observations. In particular, how can the authors provide the reader the clear assurance that they have actually targeted the same glomerulus on left and right sides of the brain, and that the left/right asymmetries they find are not the outcome of choosing different glomeruli on the two sides. I fully accept, by contrast, that the authors scrupulously identify in the EM dataset ORNs and PNs from their respective arbors and axon trajectories.</italic> </p><p>The borders of antennal lobe glomeruli are delineated by a specialized class of glia (termed “ensheathing glia”; Doherty et al. 2009 J Neurosci29:4768-81). We agree with the reviewer that these glial ensheathments may be more or less clear in ssEM material, depending on how a specimen was prepared and imaged, and also depending on the identity of the glomeruli in question. In our material, the borders of many glomeruli are quite clear at low resolutions (please see <xref ref-type="other" rid="media1">Videos 1</xref>–<xref ref-type="other" rid="media2">2</xref>). We chose to focus on glomerulus DM6, in part because it is a prominent glomerulus, with an easily identifiable position relative to other antennal lobe glomeruli. In published maps of the antennal lobe, DM6 has a particularly consistent location (Laissue et al. 1999 J Comp Neurol405, 543-552; Couto et al. 2005 Curr Biol15, 1535-1547; Grabe et al. 2015 J Comp Neurol523, 530-544). We also chose DM6 because there is a wealth of physiological information regarding this glomerulus. Finally, DM6 was located in a region of the EM series where there are relatively few missing sections (detailed in the original Materials and methods). We have now revised the Methods to explain more clearly our rationale for choosing DM6. The fact that we had correctly identified a pair of homologous glomeruli on the two sides of the brain was ultimately confirmed when the reconstruction was done: we found that DM6 ORN axons crossed the anterior commissure to target the other glomerulus we had identified as DM6.</p><p><italic><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>. Related: although valuable as an EM overview, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref> provides insufficient information to identify DM6, especially in the z axis. Was the entire glomerulus reconstructed and how did the authors decide where its boundaries lay?</italic> </p><p>We thank the reviewer for the opportunity to clarify this point. Some of the borders of DM6 (namely, the anterior, medial, and dorsal borders) were clear based on visual inspection (please see <xref ref-type="other" rid="media1">Videos 1</xref>–<xref ref-type="other" rid="media2">2</xref>). The posterior, lateral, and ventral borders were less clear, and so were ultimately defined by the dendrites of the reconstructed PNs. All the dendrites of the PNs we reconstructed completed filled the same volume (which is typical of most PNs and most glomeruli). As described in the Methods, we reconstructed every single profile presynaptic to every PN dendrite (at least to the border of DM6), and so we have high confidence that we identified every DM6 ORN. The purpose of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref> is to provide an overview of an EM section at the level of DM6, but the identification of DM6 was, of course, done with high-resolution 3D data. We expect that specialist readers who are interested in this issue will examine the 3D data set at neurodata.io.</p><p><italic>Orphans: To what does the rate of orphans refer? The number of independent fragments that were presynaptic to PNs but could not be connected to an identified cell? How many synapses did these contribute? Were any orphaned at both ends, having no contact with either identified ORN or PN? If so, what proportion?</italic> </p><p>We define orphans as fragments of reconstructed neurites that could not be connected to any neuron. We have now revised the text to clarify this definition. The reviewer is correct that orphans were independent fragments that were presynaptic to PNs but could not be connected to an identified cell. With our reconstruction strategy (reconstruct all inputs to PNs) one end is always anchored at a PN input synapse so we do not generate fragments orphaned on both ends. Therefore, by construction, the number of synapses contributed by orphans to PNs is essentially the number of orphans fragments themselves.</p><p><italic>The claim (subsection “Cells comprising the glomerular micro-circuit”, last paragraph) that false continuations between fragments are easily detected and corrected during independent review is more likely to be an attribute of the arbor than of the reconstruction strategy, since larval neurons in Drosophila tend to have relatively more stout neurites with distal extremities that bear most synapses. Thus, the conclusion that they are therefore very rare in the final reconstruction may be less warranted than is claimed.</italic> </p><p>Although false continuations are possible, our reconstruction strategy favors minimizing false continuations at the risk of false terminations to maximize confidence in the connections we reconstruct. Annotators stop tracing</p><p>if a continuation becomes ambiguous. Moreover, all reconstructed neurons were reviewed by multiple independent annotators.</p><p><italic>Presynaptic T-bars. Please comment on the range of structural phenotypes exhibited by presynaptic T-bars in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref>, or from the authors' analysis of synapses in serial sections.</italic> </p><p>We have now included a quantitative analysis of T-bar volumes in the revised manuscript (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s6">Figure 1—figure supplement 6</xref>), as described above. We feel that a detailed description of T-bar shapes is beyond the scope of this study, but we are planning to investigate this issue in the future.</p><p><italic>Table 1.

Documentation of synapse numbers is good, and interpretation is generally appropriate, but the authors should review their text carefully to check the tendency to equate synapse number with synapse strength, and to distinguish semantic reference to these two strictly.</italic> </p><p>We note explicitly in the Introduction that the strength of a synaptic connection can depend on many anatomical features. The number of synapses per connection is just one of those features. One of the goals of our study was to infer which feature(s) are actually the largest contributors to observed physiological variations in connection strength. We begin with the fact that ipsilateral ORN→PN connections are known to be 30 – 40% stronger than contralateral connections (Gaudry et al. 2013), and we ask what anatomical features might account for this physiological difference. We find that synapse number per connection is about 27% higher on the ipsilateral side (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>), while there is no systematic difference in the dendritic properties of ipsilateral and contralateral synapses (as judged by mEPSP amplitudes, which reflect synapse location on the dendrite and the electrical filtering properties of the dendrite itself, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>). This result argues that synapse number is the main contributor to connection strength variations. Moreover, we found no significant difference between ipsi- and contralateral PN postsynaptic contact area. Contralateral T-bars turn out to be 8% larger than ipsilateral T- bars, but this difference is relatively modest, and it is accounted for by the fact that T-bars grow with the number of postsynaptic elements, and contralateral ORN projections target more non-PN profiles than ipsilateral ORNs do (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>). Finally, when we just focus on ipsilateral connections, we again find that the number of synapses per connection is again the most variable anatomical feature of synaptic connections (CV = 0.31, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>), with comparatively less variation in the overall dendritic properties of a connection (CV<sub>mEPSP amplitude</sub>=0.014, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>; <sub>CVsummation efficacy</sub>=0.041, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5G</xref>) or the mean synapse size for each connection (<sub>CVT-bar volume</sub>=0.13, CV<sub>postsynaptic contact area</sub>=0.13, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s6">Figure 1—figure supplement 6d</xref>). Taken together, these results are evidence that synapse number is the main anatomical feature contributing to connection strength variations, although other anatomical features also make a contribution. This is an important result for the field, because it establishes synapse number as a reasonable proxy for connection strength – with the caveat that this feature will certainly not capture <italic>all</italic> the variation in connection strength.</p><p>In the context of the manuscript, we use the phrase “connection strength” only when we are intentionally talking about physiological connection strength – either in the context of published studies that have measured synaptic responses directly, or in the context of our compartmental model, which uses parameters measured in published electrophysiological studies to extrapolate from our anatomical measurements to physiological predictions. We make the point that synapse number is a reasonable proxy for connection strength, but we also make clear that it is merely a rough proxy, because synapse number is not the only anatomical feature that contributes to variation among synaptic connections.</p><p><italic>It's also important to remember the processing depth introduced by feedback synapses, for which transmission gain reflects not only the number of feedforward synapses but also upstream synapses. Thus, in addition to the gain of individual synapses, feedback circuits inherit the signal gain from their synaptic inputs.</italic> </p><p>We agree with the reviewer that the feedforward connections we focus on in this study (ORN→PN connections) are not the only important elements of this circuit. We do report data on PN→PN synapses, ORN→ORN synapses, and PN→ORN synapses, although we do not focus on any of these connection types in the latter part of the study. We are also explicit about the fact that there are many cells in the circuit we have not fully reconstructed (cells we are calling multiglomerular cells, which are mainly local neurons). Certainly, some of these additional cells are likely to be mediating feedback. We anticipate that the feedback elements of this circuit (e.g., local neurons that mediate feedback inhibition) will be described in future ssEM studies.</p><p><italic>Adjacency matrix in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1—figure supplement 4</xref> resembles a number of such matrices that have now been published, with the top numbers around 50 synapses, in line with those in other brain regions, which the authors could indicate. Each intercept represents the site of presumed transmission between a single pre- and postsynaptic neuron, but the text should acknowledge that because each presynaptic site has several postsynaptic elements, a number of intercepts in the matrix necessarily are coordinately linked. In fact, I find no easy metric for synaptic divergence revealed in this figure, or elsewhere in the text. How many dyads, triads etc. are incorporated in the matrix. Alternatively, how many monads?</italic> </p><p>We agree with the reviewer that this information should be reported. We have now added <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s5">Figure 1—figure supplement 5</xref> showing the distribution of polyady at ORN output synapses in DM6.</p><p><italic>Related to the preceding point: <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref>. These are single images of synapses that fail to reveal profiles above and below the plane of section. Yet clearly there are multiple dendrites at single release sites, as can indeed be seen in some sections. This information is given in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1E</xref> but only as averages that compare Ipsi and Contra ORNs.</italic> </p><p>Please see the response to the reviewer’s previous point. We now make the existence of dyads, triads, etc. more explicit in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s5">Figure 1—figure supplement 5</xref>.</p><p><italic>The authors state that &quot;All synaptic conductance events had the same size and shape.&quot; This presumably assumes that those conductance events were shared at the same presynaptic site? Do the authors imagine that each postsynaptic dendrite sees the same cloud of neurotransmitter release, or is the cloud shared amongst the several dendrites. If that number varies, does this mean that transmission varies with the number of dendrites, or is the dendritic signal unaltered; how does the outcome affect the authors' modeling? I don't think there is an easy answer, but these issues should at least be acknowledged, and as far as possible discussed.</italic> </p><p>When we say, “All synaptic conductance events had the same size and shape”, we mean all conductance events, at all postsynaptic sites, period. In essence, our model assumes that the arrival of a spike at a T-bar always opens the same number of postsynaptic ion channels in all cells postsynaptic to that T-bar. We have revised the text of the manuscript to make this assumption as explicit as possible. This assumption is obviously a simplification, but model-building always involves some simplifications, and we think that this is not an unreasonable simplification. Certainly, it is relevant that some T-bars are apposed to a single postsynaptic profile, while others are apposed to two profiles (dyads) or three profiles (triads), or even more. However, we do not think that synaptic conductances are necessarily weaker in cases when more dendrites are “sharing” the same T-bar, because there is no reason why neurotransmitter concentrations are necessarily lower at dyadic or triadic connections, as compared to monadic connections. Notably, we find that T-bar volume grows with the number of profiles postsynaptic to the T-bar (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s6">Figure 1—figure supplement 6A</xref>), which may indicate a mechanism whereby quantal content scales up to match the volume of the synaptic cleft.</p><p><italic><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1—figure supplement 4</xref>. In addition, I find that using black for 0 synapses is confusing, not least because I find it hard to discriminate differences in tone for dark intercepts having few synapses, and recommend replotting this matrix using white for intercepts having 0 synapses. Alternatively, reverse the entire spectrum of tones, so that 50+ is black and 0 is white.</italic> </p><p>We thank the reviewer for this suggestion. Please find <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1—figure supplement 4</xref> updated in the revision.</p><p><italic>Methods. Of the 1917 sections cut, we are told, in the subsection “Large-scale TEM imaging and alignment”, how many sections were lost, apparently 145, from 1 to 6, about 7% of the total series – so roughly equal to the number of orphans, but not how many sections were needed to encompass the DM6 glomeruli, and thus not therefore what proportion of those were drops. Losing 6 sections (0.3µm) is very damaging to the continuity of any series, but at least the authors are honest in reporting them. How many of these drops accounted for the occurrence of orphans, one wonders, and were these equal on left and right DN6 sides? The authors should I think try to address these points.</italic> </p><p>In the revised Methods we provide the following details regarding lost sections: “Within the portion of the volume spanned by the DM6 glomeruli, there were 9 single-section losses, 2 instances of 2-section losses, 1 instance of 3-section losses, and 2 instances of 4-section losses (losses refer to consecutive sections).” Certainly, lost sections are lamentable, but they are also not uncommon in this sort of data set. We chose DM6 specifically because <italic>no</italic> 5-section or 6-section losses intersected this glomerulus. Some of the orphan fragments our reconstruction are the consequence of section losses, but other orphan fragments are not adjacent to section losses and are instead due to ambiguities related to how the plane of a section intersects a neurite.</p></body></sub-article></article>
