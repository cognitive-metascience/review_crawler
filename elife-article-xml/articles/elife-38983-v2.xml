Regularly repeating events are often perceived as a rhythm to which we can readily synchronize our movements, just as in dancing to music. However, the neuronal mechanisms underlying the capacity to encode and maintain rhythms are not understood. We trained nonhuman primates to maintain the rhythm of a visual metronome of diverse tempos and recorded neural activity in the supplementary motor area (SMA). SMA exhibited rhythmic bursts of gamma band (30–40 Hz) reflecting an internal tempo that matched the extinguished visual metronome. Moreover, gamma amplitude increased throughout the trial, providing an estimate of total elapsed time. Notably, the timing of gamma bursts and firing rate modulations allowed predicting whether monkeys were ahead or behind the correct tempo. Our results indicate that SMA uses dynamic motor plans to encode a metronome for rhythms and a stopwatch for total elapsed time.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.38983.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>A catchy tune on the radio, and suddenly we are tapping our foot and moving our bodies to the rhythm of the music. We can follow a beat because our motor neurons, the nerve cells that control movements, work together in circuits. During actions that require precise timing – such as dancing to a rhythm – the motor neurons within these circuits increase and decrease their activity in complex patterns.</p><p>But recent evidence shows that these motor neuron circuits also ‘switch on’ simply when we perceive a rhythm, even if we do not move to it. In fact, just imagining a rhythm triggers the same symphony of electrical activity in the brain. How do motor neurons generate coordinated patterns of activity without movement or even an external stimulus?</p><p>Cadena-Valencia et al. set out to answer this question by training monkeys to follow a rhythm. The animals learned to track a dot that appeared alternately on the left and right sides of a touchscreen with a regular tempo. After a few repeats, the dot disappeared. The monkeys then had to continue mentally tracking where the dot would have been. A group of neurons in a brain region called the supplementary motor area synchronized their activity with the dot. Whenever the dot was due to appear, the neurons in the area showed a burst of rapid firing. These spikes of activity, called gamma bursts, helped the motor neurons to communicate with one another within their circuits.</p><p>The gamma bursts thus acted as an internal metronome, making it easier for the monkeys to follow the rhythm. These results should be a starting point for other studies to pinpoint exactly where and how this rhythmic activity arises, and how the brain uses gamma bursts to synchronize our movements to a tempo.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>rhythm perception</kwd><kwd>supplementary motor area</kwd><kwd>local field potential</kwd><kwd>primate</kwd><kwd>timing</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Rhesus macaque</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100003141</institution-id><institution>Consejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnología</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Fellowship 486768</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Cadena-Valencia</surname><given-names>Jaime</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100003141</institution-id><institution>Consejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnología</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Fronteras de la Ciencia 196</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Merchant</surname><given-names>Hugo</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100003141</institution-id><institution>Consejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnología</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Ciencia Básica 236836</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Merchant</surname><given-names>Hugo</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100005739</institution-id><institution>Universidad Nacional Autónoma de México</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>PAPIIT IN202317</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Merchant</surname><given-names>Hugo</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100005739</institution-id><institution>Universidad Nacional Autónoma de México</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>PAPIIT IN207818</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>de Lafuente</surname><given-names>Victor</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100003141</institution-id><institution>Consejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnología</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Ciencia Básica 254313</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>de Lafuente</surname><given-names>Victor</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund7"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100003141</institution-id><institution>Consejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnología</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Fronteras de la Ciencia 245</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>de Lafuente</surname><given-names>Victor</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Temporal rhythms are encoded in the supplementary motor area by firing rate oscillations and rhythmic bursts of gamma-band LFP activity.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Adaptive behavior benefits from the ability to discern temporal regularities in the environment.

This behavior is evident when we dance to music, which requires perceiving rhythms and generating movements in sync with them (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Levitin et al., 2018</xref>). Nonhuman primates and other vertebrates are capable synchronizing their movements to periodic rhythms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Merchant et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Takeya et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Gámez et al., 2018</xref>), and we recently showed that monkeys can internally maintain rhythms of different tempos in the absence of overt motor actions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">García-Garibay et al., 2016</xref>). Ample evidence indicates that cortical and subcortical motor circuits participate in behavioral tasks that require time perception and temporally precise behavioral responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Mita et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Crowe et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Bartolo et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Merchant and Averbeck, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Grahn and Brett, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Ivry and Spencer, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Murray et al., 2014</xref>). Nonetheless, the neuronal mechanisms that allow motor structures to encode rhythms of different tempos, in the absence of motor commands, are not yet completely understood.</p><p>We developed a novel visual metronome task in which nonhuman primates had to observe, and then internally maintain, a temporal rhythm defined by a <italic>left-right</italic> alternating visual stimulus. Crucially, subjects had to track the rhythm in the absence of overt movements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">García-Garibay et al., 2016</xref>). By uncoupling rhythm encoding and maintenance from motor actions, we aimed to identify the mechanism that allows the brain to internally maintain rhythms of different tempos. While monkeys performed the task, we recorded the local field potentials (LFPs) and spiking activity of single neurons in the supplementary motor area (SMA) that has been implicated in timing and rhythm perception (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Buzsáki et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Pesaran et al., 2002</xref>). Our results show that bursts of lower gamma band activity (30–40 Hz) reflect the internally maintained tempos by a simple mechanism: the intervals defining the rhythm are encoded by the periodic onset of gamma bursts. Moreover, increasing amplitudes of gamma bursts reflected an estimate of total elapsed time (i.e. the total time since the rhythm began). Importantly, gamma bursts encoded both rhythm and the total elapsed time in the absence of sensory stimulation and overt motor activity.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Monkeys can perceive rhythms and maintain them internally</title><p>We trained two rhesus monkeys (<italic>M. mulatta</italic>) to perform a visual metronome task (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>).

A <italic>go-cue</italic> (extinction of the hand fixation) at the middle of any of the four <italic>maintenance</italic> intervals prompted the subjects to reach toward the estimated location of the stimulus. It is important to note that this was not an interception task because the left-right switching stopped at the time of the <italic>go-cue</italic>. Monkeys received a liquid reward when correctly indicating the stimulus location.

Performance was significantly above chance (broken line at p=0.5; z-test p&lt;0.001; n = 131 sessions; median ±I.Q.R. over sessions). The decrease in performance as a function of elapsed time is expected from variability of the subjects’ internal timing in the absence of the external visual rhythm. This drop in performance was captured by a model of timing subject to scalar variability (continuous lines).

To test the ability of subjects to maintain the rhythms, a <italic>go-cue</italic> at the middle of any one of up to four <italic>maintenance</italic> intervals instructed the subjects to reach towards the stimulus location (the <italic>go-cue</italic> consisted of removing the hand fixation point; the number of <italic>maintenance</italic> intervals was pseudo-randomly chosen; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Thus, the key parameters in the visual metronome task were (1) interval duration (500, 750, or 1000 ms), and (2) the number of <italic>maintenance</italic> intervals that subjects had to wait after the visual stimulus was gone.</p><p>We characterized monkeys’ ability to maintain the rhythms by plotting the proportion of correct responses as a function of the elapsed time since the initiation of the first <italic>maintenance</italic> interval (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). The behavioral results show that monkeys satisfactorily performed the task and were able to correctly estimate the location of the stimulus in more than 80% of trials (94 ± 0.2% monkey 1; 86 ± 0.3% monkey 2; mean ± s.e. over sessions, n = 131 sessions).</p><p>Importantly, performance as a function of time displays the hallmark of a timing task: the proportion of correct responses declines as a function of the number of <italic>maintenance</italic> intervals (or equivalently, elapsed time). The proportion of correct responses started close to 100% and declined to approximately 75% for the last <italic>maintenance</italic> intervals (last two data points for each curve). This behavior is consistent with the internal rhythm gradually drifting away from the true tempo of the stimulus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Gibbon et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Grondin, 2001</xref>). As we described in previous work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">García-Garibay et al., 2016</xref>), this pattern is well captured by a model in which the subject’s time estimates arise from increasingly noisy (wider) distributions, described by Weber’s Law of time (also called the <italic>scalar property</italic> of timing) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Laje et al., 2011</xref>). The increase in timing variability causes the subjects to eventually fall out of synchrony with the true stimulus position (getting ahead, or behind the true tempo), thus explaining the decrease in correct responses as a function of elapsed time (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>, the colored curves are fits of this model to the data; pooled data across monkeys; see also <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). Behavioral performance for the 4th maintenance interval of the 750 and 1000 ms tempos is higher than would be expected, that is it is higher than the performance on the previous 3rd interval. This is likely due to the fact that our experiment only included up to four <italic>maintenance</italic> intervals. We speculate that monkeys exploited this information and halted the <italic>maintenance</italic> at the 4th interval, so that they could avoid errors due to moving onto the 5th interval. In the future, we plan to mitigate this bias by choosing the number of <italic>entrainment</italic> and <italic>maintenance</italic> intervals from an exponential distribution with a flat hazard rate.</p><p>Reaction times to the <italic>go-cue</italic> increases significantly in proportion to elapsed time within a narrow window ranging between 350 ms after the first maintenance interval of the fastest tempo (500 ms intervals), to 400 ms after the last interval of the slowest tempo (1000 ms intervals) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>; R<sup>2</sup> = 0.72, slope = 11 ms/s, p&lt;0.001; monkey 1 = 10.2 ms/s±0.8; monkey 2 = 11.3 ms/s ± 0.5). This increase in reaction times could be a result of the increasing difficulty in estimating the true stimulus position. As expected by scalar variability, the subject’s estimate of the stimulus position becomes noisier with time, thus increasing uncertainty and the reaction time necessary to make a decision. In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>, we provide the LFP spectrogram aligned to movement onset, demonstrating that gamma band activity decreases, and it is replaced by low-frequency oscillations at movement onset. We also demonstrate that larger gamma band amplitudes are correlated with increased reaction times.

The only difference between the three groups of trials (500, 750, 1000 ms) is the tempo of the internal rhythm that subjects are maintaining. In other words, the rapid succession of the gamma bursts in the 500 ms intervals, and the more temporally distant bursts in the 1000 ms intervals, are a reflection of the subject’s internal maintenance of a visuo-spatial rhythm for the fast and slow tempos, respectively. This finding reveals a neural signature of rhythms, of different tempos, that are maintained internally.</p><p>Alignment of the gamma bursts to their onset time revealed that bursts have a similar temporal profile across tempos and elapsed intervals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>).

The results presented so far indicate that (1) the LFPs in SMA encode internal rhythms by means of gamma bursts that occur in sync with the beats (i.e. location switch) of a visual metronome presented earlier; and that (2) these bursts increase in amplitude, providing a neural correlate for total elapsed time.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Errors due to deviations of the internal rhythm from the objective tempo</title><p>In a previous study, we demonstrated that human subjects tend to lag behind fast tempos and get ahead of slow ones (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">García-Garibay et al., 2016</xref>). This predicts that animals might systematically overestimate the 500 ms rhythms, and underestimate the 1000 ms rhythms. However, since animals only had two response options (left or right), it was not possible to use behavioral responses to disambiguate errors in which the animals were ahead or behind the true tempo. Nonetheless, we hypothesized that systematic over- and under-estimations of the intervals should be reflected in the patters of gamma activity in SMA. We therefore compared the profile of gamma activity on correct and error trials (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). The results showed that, on fast tempo trials (500 ms interval), the dynamics of gamma on error trials was right-shifted with respect to correct trials. That is, error trials displayed slower dynamics compared to correct trials (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>, upper panel). This trend was captured by the power spectrums of error and correct trials, which showed that error trials indeed oscillated at lower frequencies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>, inset on upper panel). Conversely, the dynamics of errors on slow tempo trials (1000 ms) resemble a left-shifted version of the correct trials, that is errors displayed faster dynamics as compared to the correct trials (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>; bottom panel). This pattern is captured by the power spectrums of correct and error trials, which show that error trials oscillated at higher frequencies compared to correct trials (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>, inset on the bottom panel).

This pattern holds true for a classifier that cumulatively uses gamma amplitude information as the trial develops, and also for a classifier using the information from a sliding window of constant length (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>).

It is important to note that gamma activity in <italic>entrainment</italic> intervals peaked after each stimulus presentation. This is in contrast to what was observed during <italic>maintenance</italic> intervals, in which the peaks of gamma occurred when the stimulus switched sides. We speculate that this phase offset could be related to the process of estimating interval duration, a process that necessarily happens during <italic>entrainment</italic> intervals.</p><p>A potential concern is that the gamma bursts in <italic>entrainment</italic> intervals are merely sensory responses to visual stimuli. However, a pure sensory response should produce similar gamma dynamics after each stimulus presentation, both across consecutive entrainment intervals (1st, 2nd, 3rd), and also similar across tempos (500, 750, 1000 ms), which was clearly not the case in our results (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>). In particular, two observations suggest that gamma bursts during entrainment cannot be explained solely in terms of a sensory response. First, gamma bursts increased in amplitude as a function of elapsed time, but the amplitude dropped sharply 500 ms after the onset of the third <italic>entrainment</italic> interval (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figures 6A,</xref> 750 and 1000 ms panels). Therefore, gamma bursts carry information about the animals’ knowledge that the third <italic>entrainment</italic> interval was the last visible interval, that is the last interval that could be used for estimating the tempo. Thus, gamma dynamics likely incorporate aspects of higher cognitive processing. Second, the times of burst onset do not have a fixed temporal profile with respect to stimulus presentation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>). To demonstrate this, we measured the distribution of burst onset time across each consecutive interval (1st, 2nd, and 3rd <italic>entrainment</italic> intervals) and across metronome tempos (500, 750, and 1000 ms), and then performed Chi-squared tests between these distributions (by using burst onset time we removed the effect of burst amplitude). The tests demonstrated that the temporal profiles of gamma onset times significantly differ, both across consecutive intervals and across metronome tempos (p&lt;0.01; corrected for multiple comparisons). In fact, gamma responses to stimulus onset are similar only during the first 500 ms of the first <italic>entrainment</italic> interval, which is the only epoch in which monkeys have no information about the metronome tempo (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>). These results indicate that gamma bursts reflect cognitive processes related to estimating the rhythm of the visual metronome.</p><p>To quantify the extent to which gamma burst amplitude encodes total elapsed time, we measured burst amplitudes in each of the three <italic>entrainment</italic> intervals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>). We found that burst amplitude increased linearly in proportion to total elapsed time (R<sup>2</sup> = 0.94).

(2) Those internal rhythms are encoded by bursts of low gamma-band LFP oscillations in SMA whose timing and amplitude indicate rhythm intervals and total elapsed time, respectively. (3) The spikes of single neurons are associated with the low gamma band frequency of the LFP, which is consistent with the idea that gamma oscillations might help to synchronize populations of neurons whose temporally coincident firing would have a larger impact on its postsynaptic targets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Buzsáki and Schomburg, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Cardin et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Fries, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Siegle et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Veit et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Womelsdorf et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Wong et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>In our metronome task, the go-cue can arrive at the middle of any of the four <italic>maintenance</italic> intervals. So, there is a rhythmic modulation in the likelihood of motor response initiation. This could be related the periodic modulation of the gamma bursts and the firing rates of SMA neurons. However, we must emphasize that the rhythmicity in the gamma bursts and firing rates is also observed in <italic>entrainment</italic> intervals, where no movement is ever required. In addition to rhythmic modulations, the probability of the go-cue appearing, given that it has not appeared yet, increases as a function of total elapsed time (hazard rate). Thus, the increase in gamma amplitude and in the firing rates that is observed as total time elapses, could be related to the increasing likelihood of a motor response. We must note, however, that in the delayed-reach task we used an exponential distribution of delay times, resulting in a flat hazard rate. Even with a flat hazard rate, we observed increases in gamma amplitude, and in the firing rates, that are related to total elapsed time. Overall, we favor the interpretation that SMA participates in the metronome task by generating a motor plan that dynamically matches the spatio-temporal tempo defined by the rhythmic visual stimulus.</p><p>SMA plays a central role in learning, imaging, planning and executing complex motor actions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Nachev et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Romo and Schultz, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Kurata and Wise, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Shima and Tanji, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Murakami et al., 2014</xref>). It is densely and reciprocally connected to M1 and to the parietal and frontal lobes, and has direct projections to motor nuclei in the brain stem (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Jürgens, 1984</xref>). Thanks to this diverse input and output relationships its activity been found to correlate not only with motor actions but also with cognitive, emotional, and perceptual functions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Narayana et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Vergara et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">de Lafuente and Romo, 2005</xref>). SMA is active before the actual movement begins, participating in action selection, and importantly, determining the time at which actions are performed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Merchant and Averbeck, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Mita et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Chen et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Ohara et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Yokoyama et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Shima and Tanji, 2000</xref>). Preparatory activity can be observed even when monkeys are required to rapidly produce a movement in response to a sensory cue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Lara et al., 2018</xref>), and it has been proposed that this preparatory activity constitutes the initial step of the temporal evolution of a dynamical system for the control of movement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Churchland et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Remington et al., 2018</xref>). Consistent with this view, our results show that LFP and single neuron activity in SMA starts during the <italic>entrainment</italic> epoch of the metronome task, seconds before an actual movement will be required. Thus, the internal metronome is encoded as a dynamic motor plan that is initiated by the presentation of <italic>entrainment</italic> intervals.</p><p>That behavioral performance decreases as a function of time while gamma amplitude increases with elapsed time might seem counterintuitive. However, we must note that the tempo of the internal metronome is encoded by the timing, not the amplitude of the gamma bursts. On <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref> we show a six-choice variation of the metronome task that allowed determining that error trials are not explained by random behavioral responses. Instead, the behavioral responses on the six-choice version of the task demonstrate that error trials are due to the internal metronome lagging or getting ahead of the true tempo. Even on error trials, gamma activity, and the firing pattern of neurons, show rhythmic dynamics and a mean amplitude that increases with total elapsed time. Thus, there are three independent lines of evidence supporting the notion that error trials arise from the internal metronome falling out of sync with the intended tempo. First, the periodograms of gamma activity indicate that errors on fast trials (500 ms interval) oscillate at slower frequencies as compared to correct trials. Conversely, errors on slow tempos (1000 ms) oscillate faster than correct responses. Second, these same patterns were demonstrated by the cross-correlograms of the firing rates in correct and incorrect trials (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7E</xref>). Finally, the behavioral results on the six-choice version of the metronome task showed that errors are not uniformly distributed across choices (as would be expected from lapses of attention), but distribute around the correct stimulus position, with increasing variability for longer elapsed times, as would be expected from the scalar property of timing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>). Moreover, the distributions show that errors tend to be behind the true stimulus position on fast trials, and ahead on slow trials.</p><p>It has been debated whether subjects performing a rhythmic task measure individual intervals separately, or instead rely on an estimate of total elapsed time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Laje et al., 2011</xref>). Our results now reveal that rhythms of different tempos are supported by the presence of rhythmic neuronal activity outlining each individual interval. In addition to this, the increases in gamma burst amplitude, and mean firing rates, provide information about total elapsed time.</p><p>Gamma synchronization might be useful to the formation of local ensembles of neurons that increase the temporal coordination of presynaptic spikes on postsynaptic targets, allowing brief windows of effective communication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Wong et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Womelsdorf et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Buzsáki and Schomburg, 2015</xref>). Previous results show that gamma oscillations increase before the execution of a motor action, and then shut down at the time of movement onset (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Yokoyama et al., 2016</xref>) a result replicated by our data. Previous work by Merchant and colleagues found that LFP gamma band activity in the basal ganglia was associated with the presentation of sensory stimuli defining the intervals within a hand tapping task (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Bartolo et al., 2014</xref>). They found that bursts of gamma were selective for intervals of different durations, and thus different cell populations were selective for different time intervals. We found no such duration selectivity in the SMA cortex, instead observing that gamma bursts encoded intervals of different durations.</p><p>Signals associated with timing tasks can be found across multiple brain areas, including parietal, motor, and premotor cortices, as well as dopaminergic midbrain neuron in the primate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Ghose and Maunsell, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Genovesio et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Lebedev and Wise, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Mita et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Harrington et al., 2010</xref>). For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Jazayeri and Shadlen, 2015</xref> have shown that activity of single neurons in the lateral intraparietal area encodes the time elapsed from a previous sensory stimuli, as well as the time remaining to initiate a saccadic eye movement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Jazayeri and Shadlen, 2015</xref>). Importantly, they showed that these signals calibrate themselves according to the underlying probability to make an eye movement within a given temporal window. A recent important result by Jazayeri and colleagues demonstrated that encoding intervals of different lengths is achieved by means of speeding up or slowing down the temporal dynamics of populations of neurons that, individually, display widely different firing patterns (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Wang et al., 2018</xref>). Our results extend this finding to the dynamics of the LFP oscillations by demonstrating that they also show temporal scaling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figures 3A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">6C</xref>). A coherent picture is thus emerging, indicating that time-estimation and time-production signals are present as dynamic motor plans that are distributed across the motor structures that participate in executing timely motor actions.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Subjects</title><p> Two adult male Rhesus monkeys (<italic>Macaca mulatta</italic>) participated in the study (weight: 5–7 kg, age: 5, 7 years).

Briefly, while maintain eye and hand fixation over a touch screen (ELO Touch Solutions, model 1939L; ASL Eye-Track 6), subjects observed a visual stimulus (gray circle, 10° diameter, 25° eccentricity) that periodically changed position from one side of the screen to the other, at regular intervals (<italic>entrainment</italic> epoch; 500, 750, or 1000 ms interval; pseudo-randomly selected on each trial; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>).

For analyzing the activity during the delay period (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figures 5</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">7</xref>), we used every trial up to the time before the go-cue. This ‘attrition’ method allows to use all available information up a given point in time (without the go-cue, or movement related- activity).

The sign at the peak of the cross-correlogram tells us if increasing firing rates are significantly correlated, or anti-correlated, with the stimulus position being on the left.

A lightly edited version of the letter sent to the authors after peer review is shown, indicating the most substantive concerns; minor comments are not usually included.</p></boxed-text><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Entrainment and maintenance of an internal metronome in premotor cortex&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by two peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by Richard Ivry as the Reviewing Editor and Senior Editor. The following individuals involved in review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Masaki Tanaka (Reviewer #1).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>In this experiment, monkeys are trained to perform a task requiring the representation of rhythmic information and neural activity is recorded in SMA, asking about the role of this area in entrainment, timing, and motor preparation. An entrainment phase in which a visual stimulus jump from left to right in a periodic manner is following by a maintenance phase in which the stimulus is no longer presented and the monkey must keep an internal record of the period in order to generate a movement to the appropriate location following an imperative cue. LFP recordings in SMA show that gamma bursts occur at the extrapolated transition times, and increase in amplitude with elapsed time. A control experiment indicates that in a task that does not require entrainment, that there is also an increase in gamma over the course of a delayed response. These results indicate that SMA is sensitive to the periodic fluctuations in response likelihood, an interesting extension of prior work linking this area to motor preparation.</p><p>Overall recommendation:</p><p>In general, we had a favorable opinion of the paper, with the LFP data clearly showing rhythmic activity during the maintenance period, entrained to the preceding metronome. However, given that the behavioral data have been reported in a previous paper from your group, there was concern that the LFP data on their own do not represent a sufficient advance given interpretation issues (see below). An expanded presentation of the single unit data would really strengthen the paper. Whether this means a full presentation of that work or an expanded presentation on the most relevant issues is something you can determine.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Relevance of response preparation in interpreting the LFP data. You have placed a strong emphasis on the idea that the LFP data indicate that &quot;premotor areas use dynamic motor plans to encode a metronome for rhythms and a stopwatch for total elapsed time.&quot; However, this has to be reconciled with the fact that the control experiment shows very similar changes in terms of gamma activity and clearly here there is no encoding of a rhythm or metronome. Taken together, one can say that the gamma increase is indicative of motor preparation (or temporal prediction/anticipation). This is, of course, related to elapsed time, but it is not the same as equating the activity with a metronome or a stopwatch. Similarly, the Abstract states that gamma amplitude provided an estimate of total elapsed time. This seems quite a bit stronger than what we see; the main inference to be taken from the increase in gamma power over time is that anticipation increases (given that the likelihood of the go-cue is increasing). Is it possible that gamma is in a sense encoding &quot;certainty&quot; or the hazard function? That is over the maintenance intervals, gamma increases because the animal is increasingly certain that a motor response will be required? We imagine that you will argue that, even if the gamma activity is a signature of response preparation/anticipation, it is rhythmic in nature across the maintenance period. That is, it rises and falls with each possible point in time at which the go-cue might appear. So the response preparation and rhythmic representation ideas are not mutually exclusive. Rather, in addition to being a signature of response preparation, SMA activity is also exhibiting sensitivity to the periodic fluctuations in response likelihood. The response preparation issue needs to be developed in the manuscript.</p><p>2) The minimal presentation of the single unit data. We understand that your plan is to report a comprehensive analysis of the single unit data in another paper, providing a brief &quot;appetizer&quot; here. In some ways, this was unsatisfying, especially since the single unit data have the potential to really complement the LFP data. There are places where we think the neural data would really boost the impact value of the paper. To provide two examples: 1) Your LFP analysis pools data from trials in which the animal responds left and right. Analyses of directionality at the single unit level might be useful in addressing the preparation/attention hypotheses mentioned above (at least in a specific sense, assuming the two directions are sufficiently discriminable). 2) The LFP data indicate that population gamma increases during both your experimental and control tasks, and thus, in both a rhythmic and non-rhythmic context. Is this similarity also seen in the single unit data? Or might we see different subpopulations of neurons? We imagine there are other insights to be gained from the single unit data.</p><p>3) Readers might be confused that performance became worse as time elapsed yet gamma power became greater. If gamma is simply signaling the anticipated time of the stimulus based on some oscillatory process, the negative relationship of these two variables is puzzling. You argue that the fall off in accuracy with elapsed time and increase in RTs are the result of scalar properties, namely increase in variability with increasing duration. While this may well be, it also seems possible that this could be an attentional effect. That is, as maintenance period grows, the likelihood that the animal falls off task increases. Some discussion of these issues would be helpful.</p><p>4) Related to the above is how to think about the analyses comparing correct and incorrect trials. You propose that incorrect trials are due to the failure to maintain the right tempo – that is, the internal rhythm might slow down or speed up, leading to the incorrect prediction of the stimulus position (when a phase shift has occurred). As above, an alternative here is an attentional one, namely that on incorrect trials the animal falls off task and guesses. Now the two hypotheses make different predictions. The attention hypothesis would be that the gamma oscillations should more or less disappear. The incorrect tempo hypothesis would predict that the gamma oscillations should persist, but either speed up or slow down. It may not be possible to discriminate these hypotheses with your data. First, a reduction in gamma power/signature might come about even if the tempo hypothesis is correct since you would be blending speed up and slow down trials. Second, the subtle shifts discussed (Figure 4) about 500 becoming slower and 1000 faster on incorrect trials might emerge from a regression towards the mean.</p><p>5) The results should be presented in a more consistent manner. You performed 131 recording sessions in two monkeys and combined the data from all sessions (Figures 1, 4, 5, 8) or presented the data obtained from representative sessions (Figures 2, 3, 6, 7). The variability across sessions and monkeys are reported for behavioral performance (Figure 1 and relevant text), but not for the neural data. You need to clearly explain how the data are pooled for each figure. It would also be helpful to see the data for each monkey separately in supplementary figures.</p><p>6) Figure 4A shows that the shift of periodic gamma band activity in error trials was only subtle and was not as large as half cycle of periodic stimulus. Although the most critical difference is seen at the time of go-cue, the difference in neural activity was minimal here. This indicates that the changes in gamma power may not account for the behavioral difference. You should address this point.</p><p>7) If the gamma bursts are associated with motor preparation one might ask whether there is a relationship between gamma and reaction time. For example, within a given maintenance interval was there a correlation between gamma and RT?</p><p>8) The paper doesn't provide sufficient methods concerning the control experiment. We assume that the animal gets a visual cue on one side and then waits during a variable delay for the go-cue. Assuming this is right, Figures 5A and 5C are puzzling since they don't divide trials by the duration of the delay. This means that they are pooling trials in which the go-cue has occurred and trials in which it has yet to appear. This seems problematic. Figure 5B doesn't do this, but it isn't clear what one is to take from this panel.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.38983.028</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Relevance of response preparation in interpreting the LFP data.

The response preparation issue needs to be developed in the manuscript.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with these very relevant points raised by the reviewers. We recorded from a motor-related cortical area so the patterns of activity that we see are ultimately associated with the preparation and execution of motor actions. We tried to emphasize this by stating that, in this area, the internal metronome is reflected as a “dynamic motor plan”, i.e. a motor plan that rhythmically alternates between “touch left” and “touch right” motor actions. The reviewers are correct in pointing out that, in our metronome task, the variables “total elapsed time” and “hazard rate” are correlated, so a deeper discussion on this issue is granted.</p><p>The increase in gamma amplitude that we observed as time elapsed during the maintenance epoch might be related to the increase in the probability of initiating a motor response (hazard rate). Thus, there is the possibility that the increasing gamma amplitude might be encoding movement hazard rate. However, there are some features of our results that the hazard rate-encoding hypothesis does not fully account for. It must be noted that, in the delayed-reach task, we used a variable time delay with an exponential distribution of go-cue times. This exponential distribution flattens the hazard rate during the delay period. In spite of this, the results show that gamma amplitude increases during the delay, even with a flat hazard rate. However, we want to emphasize that the metronome task does not have a flat hazard rate in <italic>maintenance</italic>, and the probability of the go-cue does increase with elapsed time (i.e. there is an increase in the probability that the go-cue occurs given that it has not occurred yet). For this reason, we cannot fully discard the hypothesis that, instead of total elapsed time, the increase in gamma amplitude could be coding the increasing movement hazard rate.</p><p>Having said that, it is also important to summarize the two observations that the movement hazard rate hypothesis cannot account for. (1) There is an increase in gamma amplitude during the entrainment period, in which no movement is ever required, and (2) there is an increase in gamma amplitude during the delayed-reach task even when the movement hazard rate remains constant due to the exponential distribution of delay times.</p><p>We aimed at providing a balanced discussion on these views. The new text in Discussion reads:</p><p>“In our metronome task, the go-cue can arrive at the middle of any of the four maintenance intervals. […] Overall, we favor the interpretation that SMA participates in the metronome task by generating a motor plan that dynamically matches the spatio-temporal tempo defined by the rhythmic visual stimulus.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) The minimal presentation of the single unit data. We understand that your plan is to report a comprehensive analysis of the single unit data in another paper, providing a brief &quot;appetizer&quot; here. In some ways, this was unsatisfying, especially since the single unit data have the potential to really complement the LFP data.

Is this similarity also seen in the single unit data? Or might we see different subpopulations of neurons? We imagine there are other insights to be gained from the single unit data.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewers. Although we originally planned to communicate single unit results separately, the reviewers are correct in pointing out that the spiking data could complement the results of the LFP recordings. We are glad to present the results of the single unit recordings in a new multi-panel figure, and in associated texts in Results and Materials and methods sections.</p><p>Figures 7A and 7B, depict the firing rates during <italic>entrainment</italic> and <italic>maintenance</italic> epochs of sample neuron, and of the total population (n=113), respectively. Trials in which the visual metronome started on the neuron’s preferred side are depicted in red. Figure 7C shows the mean firing rate during the <italic>delayed-reach</italic> control task.</p><p>We are glad to communicate that the firing patterns of the recorded neurons corroborate the LPF findings in the sense that (1) they show oscillatory dynamics, both during <italic>entrainment</italic> and <italic>maintenance</italic> intervals; (2) the firing rates increase as a function of total elapsed time; and (3) the activity of neurons during the <italic>delayed-reach</italic> task increase during the delay period preceding the reach movement to the target signaled by a briefly presented visual cue. These results are consistent with the interpretation that SMA neurons encode a metronome by dynamically alternating between “move left” and “move right” motor plans.</p><p>The main difference between the LFP signal and the firing rate modulations, is that firing rates show a significant side preference, i.e. neurons fired more spikes when the stimulus was presented (<italic>entrainment</italic>), and was estimated to be (<italic>maintenance</italic>), on one side of the screen. We called this side the preferred spatial location (Figure 7B). Of the 113 recorded neurons, 74 showed more activity when the stimulus was on the right side of the screen (contralateral to the recording side), and 39 preferred the left side.</p><p>We also analyzed the spiking activity in the error trials. We performed a cross-correlation analysis between the mean firing rate of correct and incorrect trials (we de-trended the firing rates to keep only the oscillatory dynamics between preferred and non-preferred screen locations). We are glad to report that this analysis further supports our interpretation that error trials are mostly due to the internal metronome lagging behind fast rhythms, and getting ahead of slow ones. This is demonstrated by the cross-correlogram between correct and incorrect trials. For example, for the fast tempo, the correlogram peaks at -100 ms, showing that incorrect trials have a rightward displacement with respect to correct ones. In other words, errors are explained by the internal metronome lagging behind the correct fast tempo. The opposite pattern is observed for the slow tempo (1000 ms interval). These new results are described in the main text, Results section, and the new Figure 7. The old Figure 7, depicting sample neurons, is now a figure supplement.</p><p>The new text in Results (subsection “The metronome is encoded in the firing patterns of SMA neurons”) reads:</p><p>“Simultaneously with LFPs, we recorded the extracellular spike potentials of 113 neurons (78 monkey 1; 35 monkey 2). […] The cross-correlogram for the 500 and 750 ms intervals peak at negative lags, demonstrating that incorrect trials lag behind the correct tempo. The opposite pattern was observed for the slow tempo (1000 ms tempo).”</p><p>The new text in Methods (subsection “Neuron’s spatial preference”) reads:</p><p>“To estimate each neuron’s spatial preference, we computed the cross-correlation between the stimulus position (left and right) and the mean firing rate. […] The detrended firing rates were obtained by subtracting the mean activity across all trials, from the mean firing rates of each trial type (starting on the preferred and non-preferred location; Figure 7D).”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Readers might be confused that performance became worse as time elapsed yet gamma power became greater. If gamma is simply signaling the anticipated time of the stimulus based on some oscillatory process, the negative relationship of these two variables is puzzling. You argue that the fall off in accuracy with elapsed time and increase in RTs are the result of scalar properties, namely increase in variability with increasing duration. While this may well be, it also seems possible that this could be an attentional effect. That is, as maintenance period grows, the likelihood that the animal falls off task increases. Some discussion of these issues would be helpful.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewers in the sense that at least some fraction of error trials could arise from a failure of attention/short-term memory to maintain the rhythm, or otherwise properly engage the task. We are confident however, that these often called “lapses” constitute a small proportion of the error trials. This assertion is backed by several observations: (1) Gamma activity shows an oscillatory pattern even on incorrect trials (Figure 4A). A failure of attention in which gamma activity loses its cyclic pattern would not have resulted in gamma showing an oscillatory pattern even on error trials. (2) The new analyses on the firing rate of single neurons support the notion that error trials are mostly due to a departure of the oscillatory frequency from the true stimulus tempo. The new Figure 7D demonstrates that, on error trials, the firing rate of neurons oscillates with an amplitude comparable with correct trials. As the new cross-correlation analysis shows (Figure 7E), it is the frequency of these oscillations that differs between error and correct responses.</p><p>The inverse relation between performance and gamma amplitude might seem counter-intuitive at first. However, we must note that gamma encodes individual intervals by the timing of the gamma bursts. Similar oscillatory patterns are observed in the firing rates of individual neurons. These observations mean that gamma amplitude and performance have a very specific relationship, i.e. it is the timing of gamma bursts that reveal the internal metronome while the amplitude of gamma signals total elapsed time (which is also related to the increasing hazard rate).</p><p>We are glad to present additional behavioral results from a 6-choice variation of the metronome task. In this version of the task the visual stimulus appeared at one of 6 positions arranged in a circular path centered on the eye fixation point. The stimulus then jumped clock or counter-clockwise (randomly chosen) defining the <italic>entrainment</italic> intervals, and then disappeared to initiate up to four <italic>maintenance</italic> intervals. The advantage of the 6-choice task is that it allowed us to measure whether the behavioral response was ahead or behind the true stimulus position, something that cannot be done with the 2-choice version. The behavioral results show that error trials are not due to random behavioral responses, as would be expected from a failure of attention. Instead, the distributions of responses are centered around the correct response position, and errors tend to lag behind the true stimulus position on fast tempos, and get ahead of the correct position on slow trials. These results further support the notion that error trials are due to the metronome increasingly getting out of the intended tempo as time elapses. These results are now presented as Figure 4—figure supplement 1. The new text Discussion relating to this issue reads:</p><p>“That behavioral performance decreases as a function of time while gamma amplitude increases with elapsed time might seem counterintuitive. […] Thus, even on error trials, gamma activity, and the firing pattern of neurons, show rhythmic dynamics and a mean amplitude that increases with total elapsed time.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) Related to the above is how to think about the analyses comparing correct and incorrect trials. You propose that incorrect trials are due to the failure to maintain the right tempo – that is, the internal rhythm might slow down or speed up, leading to the incorrect prediction of the stimulus position (when a phase shift has occurred). As above, an alternative here is an attentional one, namely that on incorrect trials the animal falls off task and guesses. Now the two hypotheses make different predictions. The attention hypothesis would be that the gamma oscillations should more or less disappear. The incorrect tempo hypothesis would predict that the gamma oscillations should persist, but either speed up or slow down. It may not be possible to discriminate these hypotheses with your data. First, a reduction in gamma power/signature might come about even if the tempo hypothesis is correct since you would be blending speed up and slow down trials. Second, the subtle shifts discussed (Figure 4) about 500 becoming slower and 1000 faster on incorrect trials might emerge from a regression towards the mean.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that the interpretation of error trials is a critical issue. To further support our interpretation, we now provide additional behavioral results, from one of the monkeys, during a 6-choice version of the task that we describe in our response to point 3, and also in Figure 4—figure supplement 1 (18 behavioral sessions, 12,809 trials). The 6-choice task allowed us to measure whether incorrect responses were ahead or behind the true tempo. The results also demonstrate the scalar property of timing, i.e. responses become more variable with increasing total elapsed time. Importantly, the distributions of responses show that error trials on fast tempos tend to lag behind the true stimulus position and, conversely, error trials on slow tempos tend to get ahead of the true stimulus position. These results provide further support to the hypothesis that the vast majority of error trials are not due to attentional lapses. As reviewers correctly point out, attentional lapses would have resulted in the monkeys generating random behavioral responses (guesses). The results on Figure 4—figure supplement 1 show that behavioral responses are not random, but instead are distributed around the correct response, with increasing variability for longer elapsed times, as expected from the scalar property of timing.</p><p>Additionally, the new analysis of the firing rates of individual neurons provide independent support to our hypothesis that error trials are not due to lapses in attention. The new Figure 7 on the main text shows that firing rates during error trials do show an oscillatory pattern (Figure 7D). Furthermore, the cross-correlation of activity between error and correct trials shows that errors on fast trials (500 ms interval) lag behind the activity on correct trials. Conversely, the activity of error trials on slow trials (1000 ms interval) oscillates faster than on correct trials (Figure 7E).</p><p>To summarize, we now have three independent sources of information and analyses supporting the hypothesis that errors are not due to attentional lapses, but arise as the metronome falls out of sync with the true stimulus tempo: (1) The periodograms of gamma activity (Figure 4A) comparing hit and error trial dynamics, (2) the behavioral results of the 6-choice version of the task, showing the distribution of responses around the correct choice (Figure 4—figure supplement 1), and (3) the cross-correlation of the firing rates between hit and error trials (Figure 7E). Taken together, these three analyses favor the hypothesis that errors are due to the metronome failing out of sync from the true tempo. The new text in Discussion reads:</p><p>“Thus, there are three independent lines of evidence supporting the notion that error trials arise from the internal metronome falling out of sync with the intended tempo. […] Moreover, the distributions show that errors tend to be behind the true stimulus position on fast trials, and ahead on slow trials.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) The results should be presented in a more consistent manner. You performed 131 recording sessions in two monkeys and combined the data from all sessions (Figures 1, 4, 5, 8) or presented the data obtained from representative sessions (Figures 2, 3, 6, 7). The variability across sessions and monkeys are reported for behavioral performance (Figure 1 and relevant text), but not for the neural data. You need to clearly explain how the data are pooled for each figure. It would also be helpful to see the data for each monkey separately in supplementary figures.</p></disp-quote><p>We apologize for not being clear enough on how/when data was pooled across sessions and monkeys. We now state the number of sessions that went into each analysis across figures and panels. Also, as suggested, we now present behavioral and LFP data separately for each monkey on a supplementary figure (Figure 1—figure supplement 1).</p><p>– Figure legends 2C and 2D now state that they show every trial, and the average, of the 500 ms interval that started on the left, across sessions and subjects.</p><p>– Figure legend 3 now explicitly states that every trial, across sessions and subjects, is shown.</p><p>– Figure legend 4A states that data was pooled across sessions.</p><p>– Figure legends 5A and 5C state the number of sessions (n=131) and indicates that it includes all delayed-reach trials in which the cue was displayed on the left.</p><p>– Figure legend 6A now states that every trial starting on the left is shown (n=131 sessions). Linewidth denotes s.e. across trials.</p><p>– On the new Figure 7, we indicate the total number of neurons analyzed (n=113 neurons).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) Figure 4A shows that the shift of periodic gamma band activity in error trials was only subtle and was not as large as half cycle of periodic stimulus. Although the most critical difference is seen at the time of go-cue, the difference in neural activity was minimal here. This indicates that the changes in gamma power may not account for the behavioral difference. You should address this point.</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewers are correct in pointing out that the gamma activity on error trials does not lag or gets ahead a complete half-cycle as compared to correct trials. For the monkeys to generate an error, the internal metronome should be ahead or behind at least half a cycle. However, we must note that the mean activity of errors comes from a mixture of trailing and leading internal tempos. Due to this mixture of trials, mean error activity might not show half a cycle lag. This mixture of error trials is well illustrated by the distributions of the behavioral responses in the 6-choice task (Figure 4—figure supplement 1). It can be seen that errors are distributed before and after the correct stimulus position. The activity in error trials do show a slowing or speeding dynamic across tempos (500 ms vs. 1000 ms) because there is a tendency or errors to be behind the true tempo in fast trials, and be ahead on slow ones. It is also important to note that the logistic classifier was able to correctly label error and correct trials in up to 70% of single trials, based on the pattern of gamma activity (Figure 4B). We now address this issue in Results as follows:</p><p>“On average, monkeys tend lag behind fast rhythms and get ahead of slow ones. […] Thus, mean error activity does not necessarily reflect the half a cycle de-synchronization that must underlie incorrect responses on single trials.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7) If the gamma bursts are associated with motor preparation one might ask whether there is a relationship between gamma and reaction time. For example, within a given maintenance interval was there a correlation between gamma and RT?</p></disp-quote><p>This an interesting question. To address it we conducted a regression analysis between the amplitude of gamma and the reaction times in each trial. To avoid the general effects of gamma increasing as a function of time, and also the general effect of increasing reaction times (Figure 1C), we subtracted the mean gamma amplitude, and also the mean reaction times of each maintenance interval. Then, we performed a linear regression on the gamma and RT residuals. We found a significant positive correlation between gamma amplitude and reaction times, that is, increases in gamma are significantly associated with larger reaction times. The positive slope indicated that for each millisecond increase in reaction time, gamma increases by 0.19 in amplitude (Figure 1—figure supplement 2).</p><p>Additionally, we now provide a supplementary figure in which we plot the spectrogram of the LFP signal around the time of response movement onset. The figure shows that gamma amplitude decreases sharply before movement initiation. This result is consistent with the positive correlation between gamma amplitude and reaction time: large values of gamma mean that monkeys have not yet initiated the response movement. We address this issue in Results as follows:</p><p>“In Figure 1—figure supplement 2, we provide the LFP spectrogram aligned to movement onset, demonstrating that gamma band activity decreases, and it is replaced by low frequency oscillations at movement onset. We also demonstrate that larger gamma band amplitudes are correlated with increased reaction times.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>8) The paper doesn't provide sufficient methods concerning the control experiment. We assume that the animal gets a visual cue on one side and then waits during a variable delay for the go-cue. Assuming this is right, Figures 5A and 5C are puzzling since they don't divide trials by the duration of the delay. This means that they are pooling trials in which the go-cue has occurred and trials in which it has yet to appear. This seems problematic. Figure 5B doesn't do this, but it isn't clear what one is to take from this panel.</p></disp-quote><p>We apologize for not providing sufficient details on the control task and its related analyses. The reviewers are correct, during the <italic>delayed-reach</italic> task, a brief visual cue appeared on one side of the screen (left or right, randomly selected; 500 ms duration), and after a variable delay (1.1 – 3 s) monkeys made a reach movement towards that location.</p><p>For the mean activity shown in panels 5A and 5B we used all trials up the time at which the go-cue was presented. In this manner, every trial contributes to the mean at elapsed time 1.1 s. After that time point, there is a progressive “attrition” of trials so that the mean is calculated only for the trials whose delay duration was larger than the time indicated by the elapsed time axis. In other words, the mean is calculated with the available trials up to any given point in time, without the go-cue activity. The effect of this attrition can be seen in the increasing standard error of the mean activity in panel 5C. This averaging method allows using all available information up to a given point in time. We now explain this, in a new Materials and methods section:</p><p>“Delayed-reach control task: In this task monkeys were required wait a variable delay period before making a reach movement to one side of the screen signaled by a brief visual stimulus (Figure 5). […] Then, there is a progressive attrition of trials so that for the 3 s time point ~300 trials contribute to the mean. Figure 5B shows every trial in which the visual cue appeared on the left.”</p></body></sub-article></article>
