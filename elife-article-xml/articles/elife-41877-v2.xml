Many intertidal marine crustaceans, such as the crabs and lobsters inhabiting the North Atlantic, experience large fluctuations in ocean temperature, acidity, dissolved oxygen levels, and salinity. The Jonah crab, <italic>Cancer borealis</italic>, can often be found foraging for food in intertidal zones where it experiences temperatures between 3°C and 24°C with fluctuations as great as 10°C in a single day (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Donahue et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Haefner, 1977</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Stehlik et al., 1991</xref>). As pH is temperature-dependent, ocean pH fluctuations occur over the daily, monthly, and yearly experiences of long-lived crustaceans, such as <italic>C. borealis.</italic></p><p>In several marine invertebrates including the lobster, <italic>Homarus americanus</italic>, and the crab, <italic>Carcinus maenas</italic>, hemolymph pH varies inversely with temperature following the rules of constant relative alkalinity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Dove et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Howell et al., 1973</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Qadri et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Truchot, 1978</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Truchot, 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Wood and Cameron, 1985</xref>). In other words, as temperature increases, hemolymph acidifies by approximately −0.016 pH/°C to maintain a constant ratio of pH to pOH through a process of bicarbonate buffering. Maintenance of this ratio in extra- and intracellular fluids is thought to be important for stabilizing macromolecular structure and function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Reeves, 1972</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Reeves, 1977</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Somero, 1981</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Truchot, 1973</xref>). In vitro, shifts in hemolymph pH can alter the frequency and strength of the lobster cardiac rhythm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Qadri et al., 2007</xref>). Like hemolymph, intracellular pH generally decreases as temperature rises, but has been shown to change at varying rates in different tissues in the crab, <italic>Callinectes sapidus</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Wood and Cameron, 1985</xref>). Active mechanisms for the maintenance of intracellular pH have been suggested in the crab, <italic>Cancer pagurus</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Golowasch and Deitmer, 1993</xref>).</p><p>Both temperature and pH alter the biophysical parameters governing the activity of ion channels and pumps in excitable membranes. Under moderately acidic extracellular conditions, attenuation of sodium, calcium, and potassium currents by up to 60% has been shown in mammalian and nonmammalian systems. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Courtney, 1979</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Doering and McRory, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Hille, 1968</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Mozhaev et al., 1970</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Tombaugh and Somjen, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Wanke et al., 1979</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Woodhull, 1973</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">Zhou and Jones, 1996</xref>). The reversible effects of pH on these channels may result from protonation of an acidic group with pK<sub>a</sub> between 5.2 and 7.1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Tombaugh and Somjen, 1996</xref>). Decreases in glutamatergic synaptic function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Billups and Attwell, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bloch et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Sinning et al., 2011</xref>) and increases in GABAergic synaptic function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Sinning and Hübner, 2013</xref>) in response to extracellular acidification have also been shown.</p><p>Further, respiratory control in mammals is highly pH sensitive and important for the regulation of CO<sub>2</sub> and O<sub>2</sub> levels in the blood (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Richerson, 1998</xref>) as CO<sub>2</sub> rapidly dissolves in and acidifies physiological solutions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Nattie, 1999</xref>). Multiple pH-sensitive ion channels and pumps, including a family of acid-sensing ion channels (ASICs) have been discovered in mammalian cells and are hypothesized to play a role in the maintenance of blood pH (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Buckler et al., 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Husson and Smith, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Wang et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>Although the biophysical, ethological, and environmental implications of changing pH have been well studied, less is known about the effect of pH changes on neuronal circuits in marine invertebrates. Here, we study the effects of acute changes in extracellular pH on two well characterized neuronal circuits, the stomatogastric (STG) and cardiac (CG) ganglia, of the crab, <italic>C. borealis</italic>. These central pattern generators (CPGs) drive the coordinated and rhythmic muscle movements of the crab’s stomach and heart, respectively. Although these CPGs are driven by numerically small neuronal circuits, their dynamics involve complex interactions between many intrinsic and synaptic currents.</p><p>Previous studies have shown that the pyloric rhythm of the STG and cardiac rhythm of the CG are remarkably robust to short- and long-term changes in temperature in both in vivo and ex vivo preparations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Kushinsky et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Marder et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Soofi et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Tang et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Tang et al., 2012</xref>). Despite similarly robust activity under moderate perturbation, these experiments have revealed animal-to-animal variability in network activity at extreme temperatures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Haddad and Marder, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Tang et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Tang et al., 2012</xref>). Given the relative insensitivity of the STG to moderate shifts in pH (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Golowasch and Deitmer, 1993</xref>), we sought to probe the robustness and variability of these circuits to extreme pH perturbation. To provide insight into the animal-to-animal variability in response to this extreme perturbation, we challenged these preparations with saline whose pH was outside the range expected in the normal ocean environment. Both the pyloric and cardiac rhythms are remarkably robust to acute pH changes within the range tested. This is surprising given the sensitivity of many ion channels to pH in these ranges and suggests that networks can be more robust to pH changes than expected.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>Two neuronal networks were studied in this paper. The stomatogastric ganglion (STG) of the crab, <italic>Cancer borealis</italic>, contains the neurons that generate two stomach rhythms, the fast pyloric rhythm and the slower gastric mill rhythm. The pyloric rhythm is driven by a three-neuron pacemaker kernel – one Anterior Burster (AB) and two Pyloric Dilator (PD) neurons. The Lateral Pyloric (LP) and Pyloric (PY) neurons fire out of phase with the PD neurons because they are rhythmically inhibited by the PD/AB group (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Marder and Bucher, 2007</xref>). The cardiac ganglion (CG) generates the rhythm responsible for heart contraction, and consists of four pacemaker Small Cell (SC) neurons that drive five motor Large Cell (LC) neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Cooke, 2002</xref>).</p><p>A schematic diagram of the stomatogastric nervous system preparation is found in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>.

Preparations were categorized systematically according to the criteria outlined in Materials and methods. The mean fraction of time that all preparations spent in these five states during the last 8 min of each pH step was analyzed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>).</p><p>Rhythms rarely transitioned intermittently between two states. For example, once a pyloric rhythm had transitioned from normal triphasic to weak triphasic, it rarely transitioned back to normal triphasic until after recovery in control pH. Further, rhythms generally transitioned in a stereotypical pattern. The pyloric rhythm often transitioned from normal triphasic to weak triphasic to intermittent triphasic to all silent. During recovery, this transition pattern was reversed. Both acid and base significantly decreased the fraction of time that preparations were rhythmic, a combined metric of states 1 (normal triphasic) and 2 (weak triphasic) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>). Preparations were significantly less triphasically rhythmic at pH 5.5 and pH 10.4 compared to control pH 7.8.</p><p>To describe these effects quantitatively, measures of the pyloric rhythm frequency, the number of PD spikes per burst, and PD duty cycle were calculated. Violin plots give pooled distributions for each pH across all preparations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D–F</xref>). Mean pyloric burst frequency was relatively invariant across pH values in the presence of acid, but varied significantly across base steps (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>). Pyloric burst frequency at pH 9.3 and 10.4 was significantly slower than that at control. Both acid and base significantly affected the mean number of PD spikes per burst (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>). The number of spikes per burst was significantly reduced at pH 5.5.

Note the large LP-evoked inhibitory post-synaptic potentials (IPSPs) in the trough of the PD neuron waveform and the large amplitude inhibition of the LP caused by activity of the PD, AB, and PY neurons. Following application of PTX at control pH 7.8 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>; center traces), the PD neuron was still bursting but the LP-evoked IPSPs were entirely blocked. Most of the inhibitory inputs to the LP neuron were blocked, leaving only the cholinergic inhibition contributed by the PD neurons. At pH 6.7, the PD neuron of this preparation lost most of its slow wave activity. It then became silent and depolarized in pH 5.5 saline. At pH 8.8, the PD burst was largely intact, and at pH 10.4, the neuron showed single spike bursts.

Three of 15 CG preparations maintained a normal rhythm in every pH condition. Interestingly, STG preparations that showed decrements in activity during basic conditions were extremely susceptible to reductions in activity during extreme acid.

Contrastingly, increasing pH reveals non-linear effects on activity, which may suggest more complex mechanisms.</p><p>Given that the physiological properties of ion channels are sensitive to pH (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Anwar et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bayliss et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Catterall, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Cens et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Cook et al., 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Doering and McRory, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Guarina et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Harms et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Hille, 1968</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Mahapatra et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Marcantoni et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Tombaugh and Somjen, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Vilin et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib97">Zhou et al., 2018</xref>), one might imagine that a neuronal circuit might be as sensitive to changes in pH as its most sensitive ion channels. Therefore, it is surprising that the central pattern generating rhythms of both the STG and the CG of the crab, <italic>C. borealis</italic>, are relatively insensitive to acute pH change from about pH 6.1 to pH 8.8 while the individual functions of many ion channels are known to be considerably altered within this range.</p><p>One possible explanation for these results is that crustacean ion channels are more robust to pH change than channels from other species. In most vertebrate animals, pH is carefully regulated. Slight acidosis or alkalosis can have deleterious effects on many aspects of vertebrate physiology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chesler, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Fencl et al., 1966</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Nattie, 1999</xref>), which may be partially a consequence of the relative sensitivity of many vertebrate ion channels and synapses to pH. Unfortunately, little is known about the pH sensitivity of crustacean ion channels, but it would be surprising if it differed drastically from that seen in other animals as there is considerable homology across phylogeny in channel structure and function. Recent evidence suggests that acid-sensing ion channels are evolutionarily conserved, which presents the possibility of specialized channels for the modulation of pH in crustacean ganglia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Lynagh et al., 2018</xref>). However, the possibility remains that modest evolutionary changes in channel structure occurred to allow endothermic animals to function in high temperature and low pH conditions. Evidence of evolved pH robustness has been shown in mammals where smaller voltage-gated Na<sup>+</sup> and ASIC-mediated currents likely confer greater resistance to acid-induced cell death in the naked mole-rat brain compared to that of the mouse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Husson and Smith, 2018</xref>).</p><p>Another possibility for the circuit robustness seen in this study could be that there are compensatory and/or correlated changes in the effects of pH across the population of channels in these networks. Therefore, one prediction of the relative pH insensitivity of these networks is that numerous pH sensitive changes occur across the population of ion channels, but that these circuits have evolved sets of correlated ion channels that compensate for these changes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">O'Leary and Marder, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">O'Leary et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">O'Leary et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Temporal et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Temporal et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Tobin et al., 2009</xref>). Consistent with this possibility is the finding that in mammalian thalamocortical neurons, the counterbalancing activities of HCN and TASK channels restricts the effect of extracellular acidification (pH 7.3 to 6.3) on resting membrane potential (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Meuth et al., 2006</xref>).</p><p>In addition to the relative pH insensitivity of these circuits, we were surprised that the cardiac and pyloric rhythms of <italic>C. borealis</italic> are differentially sensitive to acid and base. This was unexpected as there is almost a complete overlap of ion channel genes expressed in the two ganglia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Northcutt et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Ransdell et al., 2013a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Ransdell et al., 2013b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Schulz et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Schulz et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Tobin et al., 2009</xref>). This differential sensitivity could be due to differences in the burst generating mechanisms of the two networks. The pyloric rhythm depends heavily on a bursting pacemaker neuron and on post-inhibitory rebound as a timing mechanism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Harris-Warrick et al., 1995a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Harris-Warrick et al., 1995b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Hartline and Gassie, 1979</xref>). In contrast, the cardiac ganglion depends on strong excitatory drive from the pacemaker neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Cooke, 1988</xref>). These excitatory and inhibitory synaptic connections could be differentially sensitive to pH. Additionally, although both networks are driven by bursting pacemaker neurons, the relative contribution of different ion channels to the burst generating mechanism may be sufficiently different so that the pacemakers themselves respond differently to high and low pH. A similar conclusion comes from a recent study that demonstrated that the arterioles in the retrotrapezoid nucleus, a region critical for respiratory chemosensation, and those in the cortex are differentially modulated during exposure to high CO<sub>2</sub>/H<sup>+</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Hawkins et al., 2017</xref>). Together, these findings support the possibility of specialization of a circuit’s response to pH in the context of its local function.</p><p>The membrane potentials of the semi-isolated pyloric neurons, LP and PD, varied differentially with changes in extracellular pH. Semi-isolated LP neurons fired tonically and hyperpolarized in extreme base while semi-isolated PD neurons depolarized in acid. In intact preparations, we observed depolarization in acid for both neurons, suggesting an important role of circuit connectivity in regulating network activity across pH. These results illustrate the potential difficulty in generalizing the effects of environmental perturbation across neurons and circuits, even within the same animal.</p><p>Under most control conditions, the gastric mill rhythm was silent as is typically observed in STG preparations when the descending modulatory inputs are removed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Hamood and Marder, 2015</xref>). Unexpectedly, gastric mill rhythms were frequently activated upon exposure to or recovery from extreme pH. It is possible that either sensory or modulatory axons were activated by the pH changes, and it is feasible that specific sensory and/or modulatory neurons might be part of a circuit important in vivo for a response to altered pH.</p><p>In this study, we examined the effects of manipulating extracellular pH. However, the extent to which intracellular pH was affected and its contribution to changes in activity remain unclear. Neurons penetrated with intracellular recording electrodes exhibited more labile activity in response to changing pH than ones that were not penetrated with a sharp electrode. This may indicate that changes in intracellular pH would be more deleterious than what occurs in response to changes in extracellular pH alone. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Golowasch and Deitmer, 1993</xref> revealed that extracellular pH in the STG of the crab, <italic>Cancer pagurus</italic>, was reliably around 0.1 pH more alkaline than bath pH while intracellular pH was 0.3 to 0.4 pH more acidic. Further, moderate shifts in bath pH – from pH 7.4 to 7.0 or 7.8 – resulted in negligible changes in pyloric frequency and slow and low amplitude shifts in extracellular pH while NH<sub>4</sub>Cl induced acidosis resulted in recoverable alkylosis of both the intracellular and extracellular space (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Golowasch and Deitmer, 1993</xref>). These results suggest the restriction of the free diffusion of protons through the ganglion and the existence of active Na<sup>+</sup>-dependent mechanisms to maintain more acidic intracellular and more alkaline extracellular compartments. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Golowasch and Deitmer, 1993</xref> hypothesized that glial cells surrounding the neuronal processes in the neuropil of the STG may contain a Na<sup>+</sup>/H<sup>+</sup> exchanger.</p><p>The results of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Golowasch and Deitmer (1993)</xref> are consistent with what is known in other systems. The distribution of pH values within the brainstem during acute hypercapnia, an increase in blood CO<sub>2</sub>, is heterogenous and location-dependent, reflecting local blood flow and pH regulatory mechanisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Ichikawa et al., 1989</xref>). Further, it remains uncertain as to whether or not pH sensation involved in the mammalian respiratory response is extracellular or intracellular (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Buckler et al., 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Fencl et al., 1966</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Lassen, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Ritucci et al., 1997</xref>). In the pulmonate snail, <italic>Helix aspersa</italic>, the effect of hypercapnic solutions on the ventilatory response was greater than that of NH<sub>4</sub>Cl solutions of the same extracellular pH lacking CO<sub>2</sub>, which suggests that the effects of CO<sub>2</sub> on intracellular pH is responsible for modulating chemoreception in this system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Erlichman and Leiter, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Erlichman and Leiter, 1994</xref>). Mammalian studies have also suggested a role for glia in the modulation and maintenance of extracellular pH (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Kaila and Ransom, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Ransom, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Wenker et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>The ocean environment is both warming and acidifying at historic rates. <italic>Cancer borealis</italic> maintains relatively robust pyloric and cardiac rhythms in the temperature ranges it usually experiences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Marder et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Soofi et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Tang et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Tang et al., 2012</xref>). The effect of temperature on ocean pH is relatively modest in comparison to the range of pH studied here; though, ocean pH can fluctuate in response to other environmental conditions. In <italic>Carcinus maenas</italic>, exposure to artificial ocean acidification produced relatively small changes in hemolymph pH (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Maus et al., 2018</xref>). Therefore, unlike some ocean organisms that are very sensitive to even small ocean pH changes, we predict that the neuronal circuits in <italic>C. borealis</italic>, at least in adults, will be largely insensitive to changes in ocean pH, although the effects of pH swings may be exacerbated by changes in temperature or other environmental variables. Other physiological parameters, such as metabolic rates and hemolymph flow may be more pH sensitive (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Maus et al., 2018</xref>). Moreover, network performance may be further attenuated when pH is coupled to increasing temperature and other environmental insults.</p><p>The data in this paper and in previous work on temperature reveal considerable animal-to-animal variability in response to extreme perturbations. Here, all preparations behaved predictably and reliably across more than a thousand-fold change in hydrogen ion concentration, an unexpectedly large range of robust performance. At more extreme pH, animal-to-animal variability became apparent, consistent with the responses of these circuits to extreme temperatures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Marder et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Soofi et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Tang et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Tang et al., 2012</xref>). This animal-to-animal variability is almost certainly a consequence of the fact that similar network performance can arise from quite variable sets of underlying conductances (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Goaillard et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Grashow et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Grashow et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Prinz et al., 2004</xref>). What remains to be seen is whether animals that are more robust to a given extreme perturbation are less robust to others and whether there are given sets of network parameters that confer robustness to many different perturbations.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Animals</title><p>From March 2016 to May 2018, adult male Jonah crabs (<italic>Cancer borealis)</italic> weighing between 400 and 700 grams were obtained from Commercial Lobster (Boston, MA).

A transition from one state to another was noted when there was a sustained change in activity lasting a minimum of 10 s. In other words, if the rhythm transitioned from one state into another and maintained the new state of activity for at least 10 s, a transition was noted at the start of that new state. The mean fraction of time that the preparations remained in each state during the last 8 min of recording at each pH step is plotted as stacked bar graphs.</p><p>Quantitative variables of frequency, number of spikes per burst, and duty cycle were measured using extracellular recordings. Spikes and bursts were first isolated in Spike2 by thresholding extracellular recordings. MATLAB was then used for further analysis. Instantaneous burst frequency was calculated by taking the inverse of the cycle’s period, the time elapsed between the onset of one burst and the onset of the next. The number of spikes per burst of a given neuron reflects the number of spikes contributing to each burst. Duty cycle reflects the fraction derived by dividing the burst duration – time elapsed between the first and last spike – by the burst period. Mean values were computed for bins of 10 s such that for eight minutes of data, there were 48 binned mean values for each preparation, condition, and measure. Violin plots show distributions of these binned mean values pooled for all preparations. The body of the violin is a rotated kernel density estimate (KDE) plot.

Spike amplitude was retrieved by subtracting the filtered slow wave signal from the original recording and then measuring the amplitude from trough to peak of each action potential. PD burst frequency was calculated by finding the inverse of the time period between one slow wave trough to the next.

The following individuals involved in review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Scott Hooper (Reviewer #1); Mark Beenhakker (Reviewer #2); Ronald M Harris-Warrick (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>Haley et al. present a compelling study that describes how pH differentially modulates two motor patterns generated by the crab nervous system. The study focuses on the pyloric rhythm and the cardiac rhythm, motor patterns generated by neurons in the stomatogastric ganglion and the cardiac ganglion, respectively. Two interesting phenomena are observed. First, both motor patterns are stable across an impressively broad range of pH's (6.1-8.8). Second, at extreme pH's (5.5 and 10.4), the pyloric and cardiac motor patterns are often altered, but in animal-specific ways. Generally, however, the pyloric rhythm was more sensitive to low pH while the cardiac rhythm was more sensitive to high pH.</p><p>The observation regarding motor pattern stability across pH is quite interesting as the ion channels expressed by the constituent motor circuit neurons are likely pH-sensitive. While the authors do not provide direct evidence of such sensitivity, many previous studies, including those of the stomatogastric ganglion, show that ion channel conductances can be pH-dependent. Considering the strong likelihood that channel activity is changing, it is surprising that the motor output is unaltered.</p><p>In sum, the authors present an interesting study that carefully documents the pH sensitivity of motor circuits in the crab. The inclusion of corresponding data that demonstrates the pH sensitivity of the underlying ionic conductances would be nice, but is likely beyond the scope of the manuscript. The opinion that the study is thorough and includes an assessment of two independent motor circuits in the same animal tempers this critique.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>There were several concerns that need to be addressed in a comprehensive revision of the manuscript.</p><p>1) Warming of the oceans is used as a basis for arguing that crabs are likely to experience pH stress. This argument about temperature cannot account for the broad range of pH tolerated. Indeed it seemed to the reviewers that much of the pH range explored is artificial. It is better to frame the study as extending well beyond any likely physiological pH range (~6.8 – 8.8) and focus Introduction and Discussion on how such pH tolerance might be achieved. Possibilities might include:</p><p>a) Mammalian proteins and similar have become very pH sensitive in evolution, and the primitive state of these entities was one of much less pH sensitivity.</p><p>b) pH sensitivity is indeed the general state of proteins and similar, and crabs have been for some reason evolved so that their neuronal networks were pH resistant. This could occur due to the individual molecules being pH resistant, or arise from &quot;balancing&quot; compensatory interactions in the ensemble of entities underlying neuron physiology. Then lead into how these data should inform future work on these issues. A major rewrite of Introduction and Discussion is in order.</p><p>2) There was a concern that the pH was adjusted in a non-physiological way (i.e., using strong acids and bases not in a CO2 HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> system) and thus providing challenges to pumps.</p><p>3) Several other concerns are to be found in the detailed reviews that can be answered in the context of these two major points.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 Minor Comments:</italic> </p><p>Some of the networks (Figure 2) recorded from in the present work continue to produce relatively normal rhythms over a pH range from 5.5 to 10.4.

Our original impetus for doing this work was not so much to understand the possible effects of ocean acidification but to probe the consequences of mild and extreme perturbations on the circuits of the stomatogastric and cardiac ganglia. Consequently, we have removed the paragraph on ocean acidification from the Introduction and have reframed parts of the Discussion to better frame our study within this context.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) There was a concern that the pH was adjusted in a non-physiological way (i.e., using strong acids and bases not in a CO2 HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> system) and thus providing challenges to pumps.</p></disp-quote><p>We understand the reviewers’ concern. We thought hard about the best way to manipulate the pH of our system. As there is no way to make a bicarbonate buffer work over the pH range that we wanted to test, we decided to use a strong acid and base to push the saline into these ranges. We made this decision in an effort to maintain the saline composition (440 mM NaCl, 11 mM KCl, 13 mM CaCl<sub>2</sub>, 26 mM MgCl2, 11 mM Trizma base, and 5 mM Maleic acid) that has been well studied. Given that we were using pH as a perturbation to explore the robustness and variability of these circuits to perturbation, we don’t believe that this method of pH adjustment should affect the interpretation of our results.</p><p>Further, this study revealed surprisingly robust activity of these circuits in the pH altered salines. If these preparations had been more sensitive than expected to pH, we would have been concerned that the effects could be partially attributable to how the pH was manipulated. Given that these circuits are highly robust and that we were able to explore a large range of pH without significantly altering the control saline, we believe that the potential effects of strong acids and bases on pumps do not impact the results and conclusions of this study.</p><p>Reviewer #1 Minor Comments:</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Some of the networks (Figure 2) recorded from in the present work continue to produce relatively normal rhythms over a pH range from 5.5 to 10.4.
