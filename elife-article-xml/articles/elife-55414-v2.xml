colonize new ecological niches. We previously reported that aerobic growth on citrate (Cit<sup>+</sup>) evolved in an <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> population during adaptation to a minimal glucose medium containing citrate (DM25). Cit<sup>+</sup> variants can also grow in citrate-only medium (DM0), a novel environment for <italic>E. coli</italic>. To study adaptation to this niche, we founded two sets of Cit<sup>+</sup> populations and evolved them for 2500 generations in DM0 or DM25. The evolved lineages acquired numerous parallel mutations, many mediated by transposable elements. Several also evolved amplifications of regions containing the <italic>maeA</italic> gene. Unexpectedly, some evolved populations and clones show apparent declines in fitness. We also found evidence of substantial cell death in Cit<sup>+</sup> clones. Our results thus demonstrate rapid trait refinement and adaptation to the new citrate niche, while also suggesting a recalcitrant mismatch between <italic>E. coli</italic> physiology and growth on citrate.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>adaptation</kwd><kwd>experimental evolution</kwd><kwd>genomics</kwd><kwd>gene amplification</kwd><kwd>evolutionary innovation</kwd><kwd>niche invasion</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>E. coli</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100007709</institution-id><institution>Michigan State University</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Ralph Evans Award</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Blount</surname><given-names>Zachary David</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100005958</institution-id><institution>Kenyon College</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Individual Faculty Development Award</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Blount</surname><given-names>Zachary David</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100007709</institution-id><institution>Michigan State University</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Rudolph Hugh Award</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Grant</surname><given-names>Nkrumah A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000001</institution-id><institution>National Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>DEB-1451740</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Lenski</surname><given-names>Richard E</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000001</institution-id><institution>National Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>DBI-0939454</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Lenski</surname><given-names>Richard E</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100005825</institution-id><institution>USDA National Institute of Food and Agriculture</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>MICL02253</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Lenski</surname><given-names>Richard E</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund7"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000001</institution-id><institution>National Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>MCB-1923077</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Slonczewski</surname><given-names>Joan L</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Transposable elements and gene amplifications can provide variation needed for novel trait refinement and adaptation to new niches, though a recalcitrant organism-environment mismatch may persist.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Evolutionary novelties are qualitatively new traits that allow populations to invade previously inaccessible ecological niches (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Simpson, 1953</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Mayr, 1960</xref>). Novel traits are thus important drivers of speciation and adaptive radiations that promote biodiversity and ecological complexity. Indeed, many major transitions in evolution have been mediated by novel traits such as photosynthesis, multicellularity, endoskeletons, sociality, and cognition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Maynard Smith and Szathmary, 1997</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Lundgren et al., 2016</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Erwin, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Erwin, 2019</xref>).</p><p>We previously proposed a model in which novel traits can evolve in three distinct phases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Blount et al., 2012</xref>). In the potentiation phase, mutations accumulate in a lineage that make it possible to evolve the trait. In the actualization phase, a specific mutation produces the trait. Newly evolved traits are typically weak and ineffective. However, if the new trait confers even a slight advantage, it may spread throughout a population and, in the refinement phase, be improved by natural selection acting on subsequent mutations.</p><p>While potentiation and actualization enable the emergence of a novel trait, the capacity for refinement affects the trait’s long-term persistence and potential to influence subsequent evolution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Quandt et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Erwin, 2015</xref>). Prospects for refinement depend on the capacity to generate heritable phenotypic variation that can improve the trait and integrate it with other aspects of organismal performance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Kirschner and Gerhart, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Pigliucci, 2008</xref>), a facet of evolvability that we call ‘refinement potential’.</p><p>Refinement potential is likely crucial for a population’s long-term success in a new niche. A novel trait might allow a lineage to discover a new niche, but it does not guarantee long-term persistence. The new conditions may expose the population to selection pressures that differ in important respects from those of its ancestral niche, resulting in a mismatch between the organism and its environment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Yeh, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Schluter and Conte, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Hu et al., 2017</xref>). Successful establishment can depend on ameliorating this mismatch (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Chang et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Turkarslan et al., 2011</xref>), and failure to further adapt may lead to invasion failures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Zenni and Nuñez, 2013</xref>). Adaptation to a new niche therefore reflects a tension between evolvability and robustness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Lenski et al., 2006</xref>). The benefits of refining a novel trait must outweigh the costs (if any) of integrating that trait into organismal physiology.</p><p>Adaptation to novel niches has been widely studied in the context of invasive species that colonize and adapt to unfamiliar environments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Davis, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">MacDougall et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Logan et al., 2019</xref>). However, the ongoing refinement of traits that provide access to novel niches has received little attention, probably because most evolutionary novelties (and associated niche discoveries) occurred in the distant past and are therefore difficult to study. Experimental evolution allows researchers to overcome this challenge. It is possible to study evolutionary novelties that arise during experiments with microbial (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Blount et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Ratcliff et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Barrick and Lenski, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Kassen, 2019</xref>) and digital (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Lenski et al., 2003</xref>) systems, in which evolution can be studied in real-time.</p><p>One such system is the Long-Term Evolution Experiment with <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> (LTEE), in which 12 bacterial populations founded from a common ancestral strain have been propagated for &gt;70,000 generations in a glucose-limited minimal medium, DM25 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Lenski et al., 1991</xref>). DM25 also contains abundant citrate, which serves as an iron-chelating agent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Blount, 2016</xref>). Many bacteria can grow aerobically on citrate, but most <italic>E. coli</italic> strains cannot because they are unable to transport citrate into the cell (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Koser, 1924</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Hall, 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Reynolds and Silver, 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Pos et al., 1998</xref>).</p><p>Citrate was unexploited as a carbon and energy source in all of the LTEE populations until a Cit<sup>+</sup> variant evolved in the population designated Ara−3 after ~31,000 generations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Blount et al., 2008</xref>). The Cit<sup>+</sup> trait arose in one of three coexisting lineages in this population by a genetic duplication that activated a previously unexpressed di- and tricarboxylate transporter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Blount et al., 2012</xref>). The benefit of this duplication mutation was contingent, at least in part, on that lineage’s prior evolution of an enhanced ability to use acetate excreted into the medium as a byproduct of glucose metabolism. That enhanced ability resulted from a mutation in citrate synthase that altered carbon flow into the tricarboxylic acid cycle in a manner that was pre-adaptive for growth on citrate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Quandt et al., 2015</xref>). Concurrently, the supply of competing beneficial mutations of large effect declined over time in the LTEE, allowing the Cit<sup>+</sup> lineage to escape competitive exclusion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Leon et al., 2018</xref>). The Cit<sup>+</sup> trait radically altered this population’s ecology and subsequent evolution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Blount et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Blount et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Quandt et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Quandt et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Turner, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Turner et al., 2015</xref>). Access to the large citrate pool in the medium led to a several-fold increase in population size (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Blount et al., 2008</xref>). Nonetheless, a Cit<sup>−</sup> lineage stably coexisted with the new Cit<sup>+</sup> lineage for some 10,000 generations, before finally going extinct (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Blount et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Blount et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Turner, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Turner et al., 2015</xref>). Even after 70,000 generations, none of the other 11 populations in the LTEE have evolved the ability to use the available citrate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Blount et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>The emergence of Cit<sup>+</sup> in the LTEE provides a powerful model system for studying the process of evolutionary innovation. Cit<sup>+</sup> variants can grow not only in DM25, which contains both glucose and citrate, but also in DM0, a citrate-only medium in which <italic>E. coli</italic> normally cannot grow. How would the Cit<sup>+</sup> trait be refined if these variants colonized and adapted to this newly accessible citrate-only environment? To address this question, we founded 12 new, initially clonal Cit<sup>+</sup> populations and allowed them to evolve in DM0 for 2500 generations. We also allowed a second set of 12 populations to evolve in the original DM25 medium for comparison. We sequenced the genomes of evolved clones sampled from all 24 populations to find parallel genetic changes that indicate likely targets of selection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Tenaillon et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Deatherage et al., 2017</xref>). Among other parallel changes, we identified numerous IS element insertions and several large gene amplifications. Our results thus show that genomic structural variation involving transposable elements and amplifications can provide a rich source of plasticity and potential for novel trait refinement and adaptation to new niches.</p><p>We also compared the growth of the DM0-evolved clones to that of their ancestors in both DM0 and DM25, and we examined fitness changes at the level of both whole populations and individual clones. Although all populations show substantial adaptation reflected in their growth parameters, we also found evidence of persistent maladaptation, suggesting that this new function poses metabolic challenges that are difficult to overcome evolutionarily. Some individual evolved clones grow more poorly than their ancestors, even in the medium in which they had evolved. The fitness assays show atypically large variation across replicate assays of evolved populations and clones, as well as some paradoxical apparent declines in fitness despite 2500 generations of evolution. We also observed high levels of cell death in the ancestral and evolved Cit<sup>+</sup> clones that we examined. This experimental system thus sheds light not only on how new traits are refined during adaptation to a novel niche, but also on how maladaptive phenotypes may persist for long periods in new environments.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Experimental design and phylogenetic analysis of sequenced strains</title><p>We isolated three Cit<sup>+</sup> clones (CZB151, CZB152, and CZB154) from the 33,000-generation sample of the Ara−3 population, and derived spontaneous Ara<sup>+</sup> revertants of each clone (ZDB67, ZDB68, and ZDB69, respectively). We used each of the six clones to found two populations that evolved in the citrate-only medium (DM0) for 2500 generations and two populations that evolved for 2500 generations in the medium containing both glucose and citrate (DM25) as a control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). Evolved clones were isolated from each of the 24 populations at the end of the experiment, and we sequenced their genomes along with those of the six founding clones. We used these data to identify mutations that had accumulated during the evolution experiment.</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Experimental design and sequenced clone derivations.</title><p>We isolated three Cit<sup>+</sup> clones (red hexagons) from generation 33,000 of LTEE population Ara−3.

Twelve populations evolved for 2500 generations in citrate-only medium, DM0 (cyan lines). The remaining 12 evolved for 2500 generations in glucose and citrate medium, DM25 (black lines).

This analysis showed that CZB154 is one mutation off the line of descent for the post-33,000 generation Cit<sup>+</sup> lineage in the Ara−3 population, as it subsequently evolved in the LTEE (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Blount et al., 2012</xref>). That mutation is a 1 bp deletion (GGGGGG → GGGGG) in the promoter of the hypothetical protein-coding gene ECB_03525. CZB151 does not have that mutation, but it possesses all of the other mutations found in the CZB154 clone, as well as two additional mutations. One is a C→G transversion that causes a nonsynonymous E181K mutation in the <italic>insD</italic> transposase. The other is a deletion of a CGCGG repeat that restores both the reading frame and function to the pseudogene <italic>dcuS</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Turner, 2015</xref>). The restored gene encodes a histidine kinase that regulates anaerobic fumarate respiration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">The UniProt Consortium, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Jeske et al., 2019</xref>). CZB152, by contrast, belongs to a lineage somewhat farther from the eventual line of Cit<sup>+</sup> descent in the Ara−3 population, and it differs from CZB151 and CZB154 by several mutations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Blount et al., 2012</xref>). Genomic analysis also showed that the Ara<sup>+</sup> revertant ZDB67 differs from its parent clone, CZB151, only in the expected restoration-of-function mutation in the <italic>araA</italic> gene. The Ara<sup>+</sup> revertants ZDB68 and ZDB69 have secondary mutations relative to CZB152 and CZB154, respectively, in addition to the expected mutation in <italic>araA</italic>. ZDB68 has a C→G transversion that introduces a nonsynonymous T33I mutation in <italic>yfcC</italic>, which encodes a predicted inner-membrane protein; and ZDB69 has a 1 bp deletion in <italic>nplI,</italic> which encodes a hypothetical protein of unknown function. All 24 evolved clones evolved in DM0 or DM25 have the mutations that are unique to their ancestors. Therefore, no cross-contamination that would compromise the independence of the evolved lines took place during the experiment.</p><p>One evolved clone from population DM0−2, ZDBp874, lacks the <italic>citT</italic> amplification that confers the Cit<sup>+</sup> trait (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Blount et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Blount et al., 2012</xref>). That clone also displays a negative reaction on Christensen’s Citrate agar, confirming a Cit<sup>−</sup> phenotype. We therefore sequenced the genome of a second isolate, ZDBp875, from the same population. We verified that ZDBp875 has the Cit<sup>+</sup> trait. The ZDBp874 and ZDBp875 genomes share only a single derived mutation, an IS<italic>150</italic> insertion at the −35 position of the promoter of <italic>yhiO</italic>, which encodes universal stress protein B (UspB). The two clones thus appear to belong to coexisting lineages that diverged early during their evolution in DM0. We did not discover any additional Cit<sup>−</sup> variants in the DM0−2 population during a phenotypic screen of several hundred clones. Previous work has shown that the <italic>citT</italic> amplifications are prone to spontaneous collapse back to a single copy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Blount et al., 2012</xref>). This collapse, which presumably occurs by homologous recombination, eliminates CitT expression and causes reversion to the Cit<sup>−</sup> phenotype. The ZDBp874 clone could be either a recent and fortuitously sampled ‘amplification collapse’ mutant or a representative of a rare and stably coexisting Cit<sup>−</sup> lineage in that population.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Genome evolution is faster in the citrate-only environment than in the control environment</title><p>The populations that evolved in the citrate-only DM0 medium accumulated more mutations than those that evolved in DM25, which contains both glucose and citrate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref> vs. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). The DM0-evolved genomes had an average of 19.5 mutations, whereas the DM25-evolved genomes had an average of 13.7 mutations (Mann-Whitney two-tailed test, p=0.0116). The DM0 genomes had an average of 3.1 nonsynonymous SNPs in protein-coding genes, as compared to 1.1 on average for the DM25 genomes.

The nearly identical numbers of synonymous mutations and SNPs outside protein-coding genes that we see in genomes evolved in DM0 and DM25 imply that the disparities in nonsynonymous mutations and IS insertions between the two conditions were, at least in part, driven by stronger selection in DM0, as opposed to a higher mutation rate or differences in population dynamics caused by the more stressful DM0 environment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Frenoy and Bonhoeffer, 2018</xref>).</p><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Numbers and types of mutations in evolved genomes.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Evolved genomes from the DM0 treatment after 2500 generations.

On average, 10.7% of the LTEE ancestral cells grown in DM25 were scored as dead in stationary phase. By contrast, when grown in the same DM25 medium, 29.6% and 39.9% of cells were scored as dead for the Cit<sup>+</sup> clones isolated from LTEE population Ara−3 at 33,000 (CZB151) and 50,000 generations (REL11364), respectively. We observed similarly high proportions of dead cells for both clones in DM0 as well (33.1% and 44.2% for CZB151 and REL11364, respectively). These results indicate that the evolution of aerobic growth on citrate in the LTEE was associated with elevated mortality. Moreover, the increased mortality was not remedied even after almost 20,000 generations since the new trait arose in the Ara−3 population. The two evolved clones we examined from our evolution experiment, ZDBp871 and ZDBp910, show somewhat different patterns. Both show lower mortality in glucose-containing DM25 (25.3% and 12.4% for ZDBp871 and ZDBp910, respectively) but higher mortality in citrate-only DM0 (53.0% and 51.6% for ZDBp871 and ZDBp910, respectively). The reduced mortality of ZDBp910 in DM25, in which it evolved for an additional 2500 generations, suggests that the apparent metabolic imbalance associated with growth on citrate may be reduced by evolving in a medium that also contains glucose. It is even more surprising, then, that we observed no comparable reduction in mortality in the 50,000-generation Ara−3 clone, which might indicate that historically contingent ecological and genetic interactions are important for this trait. Moreover, the very high death rate of ZDBp871 in DM0, the medium in which it evolved, suggests that correcting the metabolic imbalance is even more difficult when citrate is the sole carbon and energy source.</p></sec><sec id="s2-6"><title>Specificity of genome evolution in the DM0 and DM25 environments</title><p>We found evidence that the DM0 and DM25 environments selected for mutations in different genes.

We evaluated the significance of the difference between <italic>S<sub>w</sub></italic> and <italic>S<sub>b</sub></italic> using a randomization test in which clones were permuted across samples 10,000 times, and the difference between the two measures was calculated for each permutation. The observed difference between the DM0- and DM25-evolved clones was higher than in any of the permutations. The greater genomic parallelism within than between environments is therefore highly significant (<italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.0001).</p><p>Five genes had significantly more parallel mutations in one environment than in the other. Eleven of the 12 DM0-evolved Cit<sup>+</sup> clones had qualifying mutations associated with <italic>yhiO</italic>, encoding the universal stress protein UspB, compared to 4 of 12 clones that evolved in DM25 (Fisher’s exact test: p=0.0094).

Six DM0-evolved genomes have qualifying mutations in the <italic>fadL</italic> gene, which encodes an outer membrane long-chain fatty acid channel, but none of the DM25-evolved genomes have mutations in this gene (Fisher’s exact test: p=0.0137).

These three <italic>gltA</italic> mutations presumably have similar effects. We also saw parallel I197L substitutions in <italic>ygaF</italic>, which encodes a protein that dehydrogenates L-2-hydroxyglutarate to alpha-ketoglutarate and replenishes the cell’s reduction potential by feeding electrons from this reaction into the membrane quinone pool (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Kalliri et al., 2008</xref>).

DctA is a proton motive force-driven, generalized di- and tricarboxylic acid transporter. During growth on citrate, the CitT antiporter protein exports TCA cycle intermediates into the medium in exchange for citrate. DctA enables recovery of those intermediates. Two mechanisms of increasing <italic>dctA</italic> expression have been shown to improve growth on citrate. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Quandt et al., 2014</xref> identified mutations in the <italic>dctA</italic> promoter that cause high-level expression. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Van Hofwegen et al., 2016</xref> showed that increased copy number of <italic>dctA</italic> is likewise beneficial. We found evidence that these two mechanisms are anticorrelated. Two of the ancestral clones, CZB151 and CZB154, have a shared (identical by descent) mutation in the promoter sequence of <italic>dctA</italic>. The third ancestor, CZB152, lacks this mutation. Only one of the 16 evolved descendants of CZB151 or CZB154 has a <italic>dctA</italic> amplification, whereas five of CZB152’s eight descendants have such an amplification (Fisher’s exact test: p=0.0069). Also supporting this anticorrelation, one of the three CZB152 descendants without a <italic>dctA</italic> amplification independently evolved a mutation affecting that gene’s promoter.</p><p>We identified another set of parallel amplifications in six evolved genomes. These amplifications are large and highly variable in extent, but all include at least the <italic>fdnI</italic>, <italic>yddM</italic>, <italic>adhP, maeA, rpsV,</italic> and <italic>bdm</italic> genes. These amplifications were often present in high copy numbers. Three DM25-evolved genomes have 2–13 copies, and three that evolved in DM0 have 28–59 copies (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 2</xref>). In one case, ZDBp889, the amount of DNA in the amplified region constitutes more than 15% of the total evolved genome (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig13">Figure 13</xref>). By contrast, the amplifications of <italic>citT</italic> and <italic>dctA</italic> contain an average of 4–5 and 2–3 copies, respectively (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Tables 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2">2</xref>).</p><p>These long, high-copy-number amplifications must exert a metabolic burden, due to the costs of additional DNA synthesis and increased gene expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">da Silva and Bailey, 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Lenski and Nguyen, 1988</xref>). The repeated evolution of amplifications of this genomic region suggests that they confer some selective benefit that outweighs their cost. We examined the genes shared among the amplifications to identify which might confer this benefit. The <italic>rpsV</italic> gene, which encodes the 30S ribosomal subunit protein D, appears to have been a minor target for adaptation to DM0 based on parallel mutations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11">Figure 11</xref>). The <italic>maeA</italic> gene encodes an NAD<sup>+</sup>-dependent oxaloacetate-decarboxylating malate dehydrogenase (EC 1.1.1.38) that catalyzes the decarboxylation of malate to pyruvate. This plausible connection to citrate metabolism led us to hypothesize that increased <italic>maeA</italic> dosage and expression provides the benefit that overcomes the cost imposed by the amplifications.</p></sec><sec id="s2-9"><title>Increased MaeA expression is highly beneficial in the citrate-only environment</title><p>We tested our hypothesis that increased <italic>maeA</italic> dosage confers a fitness benefit by transforming the ancestral strains CZB151 and CZB152 with a low-copy plasmid, RM4.6.2, which contains a copy of <italic>maeA</italic> that is under the control of a strong constitutive synthetic promoter and ribosome-binding site. These Ara<sup>−</sup> RM4.6.2 transformants were competed in DM0 against Ara<sup>+</sup> mutants (ZDB67 and ZDB68, respectively) of the same clones transformed with the empty-plasmid control. The RM4.6.2 transformants had a fitness advantage of ~28% in both the CZB151 (<italic>n</italic> = 6; mean fitness = 1.2790, <italic>t</italic>-distributed 95% confidence interval: [1.2636, 1.2944]) and CZB152 (<italic>n</italic> = 6; mean fitness = 1.2778, <italic>t</italic>-distributed 95% confidence interval: [1.2597, 1.2959]) backgrounds relative to their otherwise isogenic competitors.

This discrepancy might be explained by the evolution of increased <italic>maeA</italic> expression via other mutations. To evaluate this possibility, we also used RNA-Seq to examine the transcriptome of ZDBp877, a DM0-evolved clone without a <italic>maeA</italic> amplification. In contrast to ZDBp883 and ZDBp889, ZDBp877 expresses <italic>maeA</italic> at a level similar to that of the ancestral clones (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig14">Figure 14</xref>).

ZDBp877 and ZDBp889, but not ZDBp883, both downregulate the cytochrome <italic>bo<sub>3</sub></italic> terminal oxidase complex, <italic>cyoABCD</italic>.

By contrast, we see strong upregulation of genes encoding certain prophage-associated proteins (ECB_00826 and ECB_00827); some toxin-antitoxin pairs (<italic>chpA-chpR</italic>); proteins involved in recombinational DNA repair (<italic>recA</italic> and <italic>recN</italic>); SOS response proteins (<italic>dinD</italic>, <italic>sulA</italic>, <italic>umuC</italic>, and <italic>umuD</italic>); proteins associated with stationary phase (<italic>csiE</italic> and <italic>sbmC</italic>); a biofilm-associated stress protein (<italic>bhsA</italic>); and others of unknown significance (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp3">Supplementary file 3</xref>).</p><p>The downregulation of transcription, translation, and NADH dehydrogenase genes and the increased expression of stress-associated genes suggest that adaptation to DM0 involved reducing growth rate (relative to the faster growth on glucose), presumably to achieve balanced growth on citrate alone. The upregulation of fatty-acid β-oxidation genes (albeit less so in the ZDBp877 clone without the <italic>maeA</italic> amplification) also indicates some remodeling of the connection between fatty acid and citrate metabolism that is mediated by acetyl-CoA.

In this study, we investigated how <italic>E. coli</italic> variants with the new ability to grow aerobically on citrate adapted to a novel, citrate-only resource environment in the laboratory. We examined the genomic and phenotypic evolution of 12 initially clonal populations after 2500 generations in this new environment, along with 12 initially identical control populations maintained for the same time in the ancestral environment that contains glucose as well as citrate, to better understand their post-invasion potential, including refinement of the Cit<sup>+</sup> trait.</p><p>The founding clones grew poorly in their new medium, exhibiting long lag phases, slow growth, and high variation in their growth kinetics. However, those founding clones had substantial potential to adapt to citrate as their sole carbon and energy source, as the experimental populations evolved shorter lag times and faster growth rates in DM0. The evolved populations also showed correlated improvements in the ancestral glucose-citrate medium, DM25. These changes are consistent with selection pressures typical for evolution experiments that use a serial batch-culture regime like that of the LTEE (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Vasi et al., 1994</xref>), upon which our experiment was based. In contrast to the LTEE, but consistent with other lines of evidence that growth on citrate is stressful for <italic>E. coli</italic>, the growth-curve trajectories and even stationary-phase optical densities exhibited substantial variability for replicate assays performed using the same population sample. Assays of competitive fitness over the same 24 hr transfer cycle also showed extreme variability, especially in DM0, making it difficult to reliably estimate overall fitness gains. Increasing the duration and replication of the fitness assays should help reduce this variation in future work. Nonetheless, our difficulty in measuring adaptation in this system is striking in contrast to the ease of doing so in the LTEE (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Lenski et al., 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Wiser et al., 2013</xref>). It is also possible that other demographic components of fitness besides shorter lag times and faster growth rates are at play in this citrate-based system. Indeed, we observed extensive cell death in Cit<sup>+</sup> clones, and the level of mortality varied considerably even between replicate assays for reasons that we do not understand.</p><p>The evolved clones exhibit even greater variation in their growth phenotypes. While most have faster growth rates and shorter lag times, similar to the improvements observed at the population level, some evolved clones grow only slightly better, or even worse, than their ancestors. Similarly, most evolved clones show no significant increase in fitness, and some are less fit than their ancestor, even in the environment where they evolved. In some cases, the fitness estimates are discordant with measured growth characteristics. For example, one clone from a population that evolved in DM25 (ZDBp917) has a lag time far longer than its ancestor, yet it has a marginally higher fitness.</p><p>Complex ecological interactions between genotypes might explain such discordant outcomes between competitive fitness assays and growth parameters estimated in pure culture. For example, non-transitive competitive interactions can give rise to evolved clones that are more fit than their immediate predecessors, but less fit than their earlier ancestors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Paquin and Adams, 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Buskirk et al., 2019</xref>). We cannot exclude the possibility of non-transitive dynamics in our system at this time, but we note that they have not been observed in the LTEE on which our experiments are based (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">de Visser and Lenski, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Lenski, 2017</xref>). A more likely alternative is that the paradoxical changes in fitness and growth are caused, in part, by cross-feeding and similar negative frequency-dependent interactions. The ancestral clones, for example, might be better at invading some of the evolved communities than they are at growing alone in the same medium. Similarly, some evolved clones with paradoxical growth phenotypes might be specialized ecotypes that have adapted to unknown niches, such as scavenging on dead cells or cross-feeding on metabolites produced by coexisting lineages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Turner et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Rozen et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Velicer and Mendes-Soares, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Le Gac et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Maddamsetti et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Good et al., 2017</xref>).

These findings support and extend previous work showing the importance of such plasticity in adaptation to other selective challenges (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Chang et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Vandecraen et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Press et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Lauer and Gresham, 2019</xref>), including the rapid evolution of antibiotic heteroresistance in some pathogens (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Nicoloff et al., 2019</xref>). Our work especially bolsters previous demonstrations of the evolutionary importance of dynamic gene amplifications, which increase the dosage of genes encoding specific products needed at higher levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Patrick et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Andersson and Hughes, 2009</xref>). For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Blank et al., 2014</xref> found that <italic>E. coli</italic> strains with single-gene knockouts rapidly re-evolved the capacity to grow in minimal medium in part via amplifications that increased genome size by more than 20%. Such amplifications may also impose substantial metabolic costs, and they are prone to recombination-mediated collapse, so they are readily lost when the relevant gene products are no longer needed at higher levels. Amplifications also increase the opportunity for further mutations that may provide a benefit for a single copy, thereby favoring subsequent collapse and elimination of the cost of multiple copies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Andersson and Hughes, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Brennan et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Näsvall et al., 2012</xref>). In addition to their role as substrates for promoting amplifications, IS elements seem to have both inactivated and modulated the expression of various genes in our evolution experiment. The activity of some IS elements appears to be increased by stress, which cells may experience when they invade a new niche to which they are poorly adapted (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Vandecraen et al., 2017</xref>). Of course, this plasticity is a double-edged sword: the genomic instability that transposable elements cause can also produce deleterious mutations, which could impede adaptation and might even lead to extinction, especially when small founding populations invade a new niche.</p><p>Altogether, our results have several nuanced implications for evolution following the innovation-driven discovery of new niches. They suggest that genomes often possess latent potential to refine novel traits and adapt to new niches. This potential can be fulfilled not only by point mutations, but also via larger mutations such as gene amplifications and transpositions that may allow more rapid adaptation after niche discovery. Despite such adaptation, however, suboptimal traits may persist long after the new niche has been successfully invaded. In our study, the evolved Cit<sup>+</sup> bacteria’s physiology shows an evolutionary mismatch with their growth on the newly accessible citrate, even after thousands of generations of adaptation to that new niche. Evidence for the mismatch includes erratic growth trajectories and fitness measures that suggest extreme sensitivity to small differences in the environment, the identity of competitors, or both. It is also seen in the high levels of mortality during stationary phase in some Cit<sup>+</sup> clones, as shown using live-dead staining of cells. Further evidence comes from analyses of transcriptomic data, which shows that some Cit<sup>+</sup> lines evolved increased expression of stress-associated genes during exponential phase. Thus, while a nascent ecotype’s latent potential for adaptation may allow its establishment in a new niche (especially in the absence of established competitors), it may nonetheless continue to experience stress and suffer from suboptimal phenotypes for a long time before becoming truly well suited to its new conditions.</p><p>Our findings also highlight that the fact that organisms are historically contingent patchworks of traits and functions constructed by evolutionary tinkering, and so they are rife with design compromises (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Pittendrigh, 1958</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Tinbergen, 1965</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Jacob, 1977</xref>). Natural selection integrates these complex assemblies into idiosyncratic, but usually robust and stable, biological systems. This stability can be disrupted, however, such as when a novel trait that is beneficial, on the whole, nonetheless generates new stresses. These secondary tradeoffs are also implicit in Fisher’s geometric model of adaptation, in which mutations of large effect, including those that produce new functions, are especially likely to disrupt other phenotypes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Fisher, 1930</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Orr, 2000</xref>). We have shown that such disruptions can persist for thousands of generations, which implies that re-evolving a stable, robust system in which a novel trait is fully integrated with the preexisting physiology can be difficult.</p><p>Organisms typically maintain their physiological systems at a dynamic steady state. This homeostasis implies that organisms have evolved to maintain physiological variables within an acceptable range in the face of perturbations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Albergante et al., 2014</xref>). Failure to maintain homeostasis may result in illness and even death. Viability is sometimes possible outside the usual range of homeostasis, but often at the cost of stress and lasting damage to the organism. Our findings imply that the disruptions caused by evolutionary novelties can maladaptively change the system parameters that maintain homeostasis, thereby causing stress and increasing mortality. Many questions remain about the nature and consequences of these homeostatic disruptions, as well as how novel traits might eventually become well integrated with an organism’s existing physiology to restore its prior homeostasis.</p><p>Our experimental system has the potential to address these and other questions about innovation, adaptation, and maladaptation that are relevant to both evolutionary biology, in general, and evolutionary medicine, in particular. In humans, for example, cultural innovations, including the agricultural revolution, have vastly reshaped our diets and thereby also changed our gut microbiota (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">McMichael et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">David et al., 2014</xref>). Contemporary high-calorie diets and sedentary lifestyles have led to an epidemic of associated illnesses, including hypertension, diabetes, and obesity. Might new traits typically exhibit more phenotypic variation, reflecting greater sensitivity to intrinsic stochasticity, lower robustness to environmental perturbations, or both? If growth on citrate by <italic>E. coli</italic> required major changes in physiology and metabolism, then that innovation may have increased fragility due to new difficulties in coordinating cell growth and division (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Scott et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Schaechter, 2015</xref>). By disrupting existing physiological and metabolic processes, innovations can introduce new compromises and imbalances, the resolution of which requires novel variation. That new variation may, in turn, affect correlated traits and the organism’s overall robustness. We conjecture that the evolutionary refinement of traits that open new niches may often promote evolvability at the expense of robustness and overall good health (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Lenski et al., 2006</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><p>Key resources are listed and described in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>: Key Resources Table.</p><sec id="s4-1"><title>Evolution experiment</title><p>We previously isolated three random Cit<sup>+</sup> clones, designated as CZB151, CZB152, and CZB154, from the 33,000-generation sample of LTEE population Ara−3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Blount et al., 2008</xref>). We also isolated spontaneous Ara<sup>+</sup> revertants for each clone, designated as ZDB67, ZDB68, and ZDB69, respectively. For long-term preservation, we inoculated Luria Bertani (LB) broth with isolated colonies of each clone and its revertant, grew them overnight at 37°C with orbital shaking at 120 rpm, and froze samples of each at −80°C with glycerol as cryoprotectant. We revived the clones and revertants from the frozen stocks and grew them in LB overnight. We then diluted the LB cultures 10,000-fold into 9.9 mL of Davis Mingioli (DM) minimal medium supplemented with 25 mg/L glucose (DM25), and grew them at 37°C with orbital shaking at 120 rpm. After 24 hr, we diluted these cultures 100-fold in 9.9 mL of fresh DM25 and grew them for another 24 hr. This preconditioning acclimated the bacteria to growing on citrate. The preconditioned cultures were then diluted 100-fold into 9.9 mL of base DM medium (DM0), which lacks any glucose but contains 1 g/L (1,700 mM) of citrate for carbon and energy. We started two replicate populations from each LTEE-derived clone and each revertant, for a total of 12 DM0 populations. At the same time, we inoculated 12 populations into DM25 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). We maintained these DM25 populations at 37°C with orbital shaking, and transferred them by 100-fold dilution into fresh DM25 every 24 hr (i.e., the same conditions as in the LTEE) for 375 transfers and 2500 generations in total. The founding Cit<sup>+</sup> clones grow poorly in the citrate-only resource environment. They were unable to reach stationary phase or, in some cases, exponential phase within 24 or even 48 hr. We therefore incubated the DM0 populations for 72 hr after their initial inoculation so they could reach stationary phase before transfer to fresh medium. We then diluted them 100-fold into 9.9 mL of DM0 every 48 hr for seven cycles (two weeks), and then subsequently every 24 hr for a total of 375 transfers and 2500 generations.

We then diluted each population 100,000-fold in 0.85% saline and spread 100 μL on an LB agar plate marked with three dots on the bottom.

These cultures then grew overnight at 37°C with 120 rpm orbital shaking, after which we diluted each 10,000-fold into either DM25 or DM0 and preconditioned as described above. We inoculated 50 μL of each competitor’s preconditioned culture into 9.9 mL of the corresponding medium, vortexed to mix, and then we spread 100 μL of 10<sup>−2</sup> and 10<sup>−3</sup> dilutions on Tetrazolium Arabinose (TA) indicator agar plates to estimate the competitors’ initial densities. We estimated their densities again at the end of the assay by spreading 100 μL of 10<sup>−4</sup> and 10<sup>−5</sup> dilutions on TA plates. For whole populations, we assayed fitness with 3-fold replication in one-day competitions, in which final densities were estimated after 24 hr. For the evolved clones, we assayed fitness with 5-fold replication, and measured final densities after 3 days, with 100-fold serial transfers to fresh medium after 24 and 48 hr. The realized growth rates of the two competitors were determined from their starting and ending densities, accounting for the dilutions. We calculated the fitness of an evolved clone or population as its realized growth rate divided by that of the ancestral competitor.

We randomized well assignments for the cultures to minimize position effects. We measured optical density (OD) at 420 nm wavelength every 10 min for 48 hr using a Molecular Devices SpectraMax 384 automated plate reader.

We revived clones from the frozen stocks and preconditioned them as described above, except that the preconditioning steps in DM0 or DM25 were extended to four daily passages to ensure acclimation to these environments. We performed preparations for live/dead cell staining and microscopic analyses on the fifth day. In these preparations, we concentrated the cells in each culture by centrifugation at 7,745 g for 8 min and decanted the supernatant. We then resuspended the cell pellets in Corning tubes containing 10 mL of 0.85% saline, and incubated them at room temperature for 1 hr; we inverted the tubes every 15 min. We then centrifuged these cultures for an additional 8 min, decanted the supernatant, and resuspended the cell pellets in 0.85% saline. We adjusted the volume of saline based on variation in turbidity to ensure that we had sufficient cells in a typical field of view for microscopy. We examined 14–55 fields per replicate for each combination of strain and media treatment.

After labeling, we fixed 3 µL of each sample onto a 1% agarose pad and performed fluorescent microscopy using a Nikon Eclipse Ti inverted microscope. Phase-contrast images were taken using diascopic illumination with an exposure time of 100 ms. Fluorescence was measured with an exposure time of 200 ms at 25% power of the fluorescent light source using two filter sets, 49003-ET-EYFP and 49008-ET-mCherry Texas Red (Chroma), which correspond to the fluorescence spectra of ‘live’ and ‘dead’ cells, respectively.

First, we reduced reaction volumes by half. Second, we designed DNA adapters that incorporate additional 6-base sample-specific barcodes such that the barcodes are sequenced as the first bases of both read 1 and read 2.

Finally, we calculated a Bonferroni-corrected <italic>p</italic>-value for contiguous stretches of the genome in which the 1× null model was rejected at each site. We examined coverage at sites separated by the maximum read length to ensure they were not spanned by a single read. For example, in the case of a region of elevated coverage that was 1000 bp in length, covered by 150-base Illumina sequencing reads, the value of <italic>P</italic>(<italic>coverage</italic> = <italic>min</italic>)<sup>6</sup> would be calculated, where <italic>min</italic> is the minimum coverage in that region, <italic>P</italic>(<italic>coverage</italic> = <italic>min</italic>) is the probability of that minimum coverage under the negative binomial null model, and six represents the (integer) number of sites that are 150 bp apart in the 1000 bp stretch.

The discovery of <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> lineages from long-term experimental evolution populations that evolved ability to metabolise citrate under aerobic conditions has provided a window to deeper understanding. Of particular note are dynamic mutational processes underpinned by amplifications and insertion sequence movement, and the curious, but entirely believable finding, that adaptation to the new citrate environment is limited by physiological constraints.</p><p><bold>Decision letter after peer review:</bold></p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Genomic and phenotypic evolution of <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> in a novel citrate-only resource environment&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by two peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Patricia Wittkopp as the Senior Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>All reviewers and editors find the work a useful extension of the cit<sup>+</sup> (invasion of new niche) angle arising from the LTEE and appreciate the new insights particularly concerning structural variant mutations. The work should be broadly valued by the field and especially understanding of how capacity to utilise citrate has become refined during the course of the selection experiment.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>Blount et al. founded 24 experimental populations from cit<sup>+</sup> clones, 12 replicates were evolved in DM25, and 12 in DM0. At the end of the evolution experiment the authors characterised growth phenotypes, sequenced clones and followed up with some plasmid complementation and gene expression analysis. The systematic and thorough follow up on the evolved clone from DM0-2, ZDBp874 is a good example of the elegant experimental design and clear writing that characterise this study- it is very easy to follow. Overall, the genetic characterisation of the populations is thorough, although this part would have benefited from temporal analysis of mutations. Arguably the most interesting part of the work arises from phenotypic analysis of derived lines, but here we have concerns regarding the conclusions.</p><p>Major concerns:</p><p>All reviewers were surprised to find that derived lines were not subject to standard population-level assays of competitive fitness. Instead, OD was used as a phenotypic measure of performance, sometimes with populations, but the more significant data came from analysis of individual clones. Reliance on OD, without calibration against viable cell counts, can result in misleading conclusions. Small differences in death, or cell size, all impact on OD. In a similar vein, Figure 6—figure supplement 1: Some populations (both ancestors and evolved strains) appear to reach a much higher OD. This receives no comment but it would appear to be a significant observation. There also seems to be very large differences between replicates of the evolved clones and ancestors in Figure 7—figure supplement 1/Figure 8—figure supplement 1 that should be commented on in the text as this is quite atypical for growth curves measurements of clones, in that there are more than two-fold differences in endpoint OD.</p><p>Of real interest is the evolution of cell death, however, cell death assays are based on only 5 clones and no population-level assay. The five clones include only two clones evolved in this experiment, (including ZDBp910 which is particularly sick in DM 0). Clones do not perform as well as populations in the growth assays, and it is reasonable to expect that clones do not perform as well as populations in the mortality assays. In other words, reliance on growth assays (Figure 3) does not provide knowledge of improvements in the population growth parameters that are evident in the population growth assays (Figure 2). Without carrying out population-based mortality assay, for multiple populations, it is not clear what trait has actually evolved in the population.</p><p>Strain ZDBp871 did not show improvement in DM0 and was worse in DM25, yet it was chosen for microscope analysis of cell death. Why were clones that showed large improvements included in the cell death analysis? It would be of major interest for the conclusions of the article to determine if there are strains that evolved reduced cell death. This seems like this is an unnecessary omission that could quite easily be fixed.</p><p>One of the claims that follows from the mortality experiments is that there is a mismatch between <italic>E. coli</italic> physiology and the citrate only environment. This is an interesting idea, and the discussion in paragraph four of the Discussion is compelling, but very speculative, with no data to support the idea of pleiotropy, tradeoffs or a relationship between cit<sup>+</sup> and mortality, aside from the mortality assays in 5 clones.</p><p>The mortality assay measures the number of dead cells at stationary phase- cells die at a faster rate in stationary phase than log phase. Since the evolved clones have a reduced lag time, by the time you come to measure mortality these have been in stationary phase for longer than cells that have remained in log phase for a greater proportion of the 24hrs. Could this explain greater number of dead cells in evolved cit0?</p><p>It looks like every clone isolated from the LTEE has a high mortality rate- could it be that high mortality is a trait of the LTEE and not specific to cit<sup>+</sup>?</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>If time and resources were unlimited we would request the inclusion of population-based competitive fitness measures of all derived lines relative to the respective ancestor, plus calibration of OD against cell viability, and a more comprehensive set of cell death assays in order to support the claims of increased mortality.</p><p>Recognising that both time and resources are limited, plus the fact that there is much that is valuable in the paper, we urge the authors to consider the above requests, but in terms of required revisions, we insist solely on inclusion of additional cell death assays sufficient to bolster claims and address the concerns raised above. We think these can be done quickly.</p><p>Even with the addition of further analysis of experimental lines, we think it will likely be necessary to dial back claims about the evolution of increased mortality.

Unfortunately, we were unable to conduct longer competitions due to the research shutdown caused by the pandemic. We have also included the results of 3-day competition assays on a subset of evolved clones (for which we isolated neutral Ara<sup>+</sup>/Ara<sup>−</sup> mutants of their ancestors for comparison). We present these data in the revised text in a new subsection of the Results. We show the fitness data in Figures 3 and 4 of our revised manuscript. Jessica A. Baxter performed part of these competitions. We have in consequence added her as a co-author. The other authors of the manuscript have approved her addition and placement in the author list. We would also emphasize that we do not use OD per se as a measure of performance; rather, we use <italic>rates of change</italic> in OD to estimate some standard growth parameters. The inclusion of both competitive fitness assays and growth-parameter estimates should make the differences in these approaches clear.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In a similar vein, Figure 6—figure supplement 1: Some populations (both ancestors and evolved strains) appear to reach a much higher OD.

This variation has made it challenging to characterize their growth parameters and fitness. While such extreme variation in OD values is atypical of most study systems, it is entirely consistent with the several lines of evidence we present for a persistent mismatch between <italic>E. coli</italic> physiology and growth on citrate, as it implies the cells are extremely sensitive to subtle environmental fluctuations when growing on citrate. We now discuss these issues thoroughly in the revised text.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Of real interest is the evolution of cell death, however, cell death assays are based on only 5 clones and no population-level assay.

We planned additional experiments to look more closely at the phenomenon of cell death, but we were unable to conduct them before the COVID-19 pandemic necessitated a research hiatus. We think the fitness data we have included, especially those that show paradoxical fitness declines during evolution, are consistent with the cell-death data we have presented, and we discuss them in that context. Nonetheless, in the absence of follow-up experiments on cell death, we have tempered our claims on this issue. That said, it remains clear that, for at least some combinations of strains and environments, there is substantial cell death, which is indicative of the mismatch between <italic>E. coli</italic> physiology and growth on citrate.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Strain ZDBp871 did not show improvement in DM0 and was worse in DM25, yet it was chosen for microscope analysis of cell death. Why were clones that showed large improvements included in the cell death analysis?</p></disp-quote><p>We chose these two evolved strains without considering (and prior to knowing) their growth characteristics. We designed this experiment as a simple demonstration of extensive death of Cit<sup>+</sup> cells. We were motivated by some preliminary microscopy observations of many ghost-like cells, suggestive of mortality, in the original Cit<sup>+</sup> LTEE population; those observations were made in the context of a separate (as yet unpublished) study on the evolution of cell size in the LTEE.</p><p>Our consideration was simply choosing one DM0-evolved clone (ZDBp871), one DM25-evolved clone, and their common ancestor, CZB151. We chose to use strains descended from CZB151 because the Ara<sup>+</sup> derivative of that ancestor, ZDB67, has no secondary mutations. The absence of secondary mutations meant we could better relate the cell-mortality results to the fitness analyses of these same strains relative to their ancestor.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>It would be of major interest for the conclusions of the article to determine if there are strains that evolved reduced cell death. This seems like this is an unnecessary omission that could quite easily be fixed.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that it would be interesting to find genotypes that evolved reduced death, if they exist. As explained above, we intend to carry out additional experiments on cell mortality in future work, but we are unable to do so at present due to the COVID-19 pandemic.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>One of the claims that follows from the mortality experiments is that there is a mismatch between <italic>E. coli</italic> physiology and the citrate only environment. This is an interesting idea, and the discussion in paragraph four of the Discussion is compelling, but very speculative, with no data to support the idea of pleiotropy, tradeoffs or a relationship between cit<sup>+</sup> and mortality, aside from the mortality assays in 5 clones.</p></disp-quote><p>We are pleased that you found this discussion compelling, albeit speculative. Given our limited data on mortality, and the fact that we cannot perform further experiments at this time, we have eliminated the more speculative aspects of the discussion.</p><p>That said, our additional fitness results provide yet more evidence to support our hypothesis of a mismatch between <italic>E. coli</italic> cell physiology and the citrate-only environment. The variation among replicate fitness assays, the limited fitness gains even after 2,500 generations, the striking variability across replicate growth curves, and the heightened mortality in the Cit<sup>+</sup> clones—all indicate that these bacteria struggle to grow normally on citrate. In future work, we will try to more rigorously examine the relationship between the Cit<sup>+</sup> trait and mortality, and the possible role of pleiotropic tradeoffs.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The mortality assay measures the number of dead cells at stationary phase- cells die at a faster rate in stationary phase than log phase. Since the evolved clones have a reduced lag time, by the time you come to measure mortality these have been in stationary phase for longer than cells that have remained in log phase for a greater proportion of the 24hrs. Could this explain greater number of dead cells in evolved cit0?</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for these ideas. It would be interesting if cell death correlates with time spent in stationary phase (even over the relatively short duration of our growth curve experiments), and if the shorter lag phase could then account for increased death. We hope to answer this question in future experiments (once lab work can be safely resumed) with live/dead staining on samples taken at various stages of population growth. We have revised the text to present the cell-death results that we have for now in as straightforward a way as possible, to avoid possible over-interpretation.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>It looks like every clone isolated from the LTEE has a high mortality rate- could it be that high mortality is a trait of the LTEE and not specific to cit<sup>+</sup>?</p></disp-quote><p>Similar preliminary and unpublished live-dead staining performed on other LTEE populations indicates that elevated cell death is specific to the Cit<sup>+</sup> phenotype, with little to no death occurring in Cit<sup>–</sup>strains. This inference is also supported by the observation (now mentioned in our revised paper) of many “ghost-like” cells only in the Cit<sup>+</sup> population, which first raised the possibility of elevated cell death in this lineage. In addition, Vasi et al., 1994, directly estimated cell mortality (based on viable CFUs) during stationary phase for the ancestor and early-generation samples of all the LTEE populations, and found very little mortaility.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>If time and resources were unlimited we would request the inclusion of population-based competitive fitness measures of all derived lines relative to the respective ancestor, plus calibration of OD against cell viability, and a more comprehensive set of cell death assays in order to support the claims of increased mortality.</p><p>Recognising that both time and resources are limited, plus the fact that there is much that is valuable in the paper, we urge the authors to consider the above requests, but in terms of required revisions, we insist solely on inclusion of additional cell death assays sufficient to bolster claims and address the concerns raised above.
