increased variation in phenotypic outcomes, a phenomenon termed decanalization. Phenotypic discordance is often observed in the absence of genetic and environmental variations, but the mechanisms underlying such inter-individual phenotypic discordance remain elusive. Here, using the anterior-posterior (AP) patterning of the <italic>Drosophila</italic> embryo, we identified embryonic geometry as a key factor predetermining patterning outcomes under decanalizing mutations. With the wild-type AP patterning network, we found that AP patterning is robust to variations in embryonic geometry; segmentation gene expression remains reproducible even when the embryo aspect ratio is artificially reduced by more than twofold. In contrast, embryonic geometry is highly predictive of individual patterning defects under decanalized conditions of either increased <italic>bicoid (bcd)</italic> dosage or <italic>bcd</italic> knockout. We showed that the phenotypic discordance can be traced back to variations in the gap gene expression, which is rendered sensitive to the geometry of the embryo under mutations.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>canalization</kwd><kwd>pattern formation</kwd><kwd>inter-individual variation</kwd><kwd>scaling</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>D. melanogaster</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001381</institution-id><institution>National Research Foundation Singapore</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>NRF2012NRF-NRFF001-094</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Saunders</surname><given-names>Timothy E</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Gene regulatory networks incorporate information of the embryonic geometrical parameters to give rise to differential individual patterning outputs under decanalized genetics backgrounds.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The phenomenon of canalization describes the constancy in developmental outcomes between different individuals within a wild-type species growing in their native environments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Flatt, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Hallgrimsson et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Waddington, 1942</xref>). To better understand how canalized a developmental process is, we need to quantitatively measure the molecular profiles of the developmental regulatory genes in multi-cellular organisms. In <italic>Drosophila,</italic> the highly reproducible body patterning in adult flies originates from both the reproducible setup of the instructive morphogen gradients and the precise downstream transcriptional readouts early in embryogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bollenbach et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Gregor et al., 2007a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Petkova et al., 2014</xref>). In particular, the inter-individual variation of the positional information conferred by gene expression can be less than the width of a single cell (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Dubuis et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Gregor et al., 2007a</xref>); that is these processes are highly canalized. Given the ubiquity of canalization in nature, such highly reproducible developmental processes are likely not exclusive to insect development.</p><p>The developmental canalization that we see in contemporary species is the product of evolution, either as the consequence of stabilizing selection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Gibson and Wagner, 2000</xref>) or the manifestation of the intrinsic properties of the underlying complex gene regulatory networks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Siegal and Bergman, 2002</xref>). Canalization can break down in individuals subjected to aberrant genetic mutations or extreme environmental conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Imasheva et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Rutherford and Lindquist, 1998</xref>). Such individuals in decanalized conditions become sensitive to variations in their genetic background and external environments, which are otherwise neutral to developmental outcomes. This leads to significantly increased inter-individual variation in phenotypic outcomes.</p><p>It is important to characterize the sources of variation in order to understand what canalization is actually buffering against. Interestingly, significant phenotypic variation remains in laboratory animals with isogenic genomes, exposed to homogeneous environments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Gärtner, 1990</xref>). This indicates that under decanalized conditions, other components besides genetic and environmental variation may also cause phenotypic discordance. Previous work has proposed that stochastic expression of redundant genes predicts the developmental outcome of the mutant individuals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Burga et al., 2011</xref>). However, in many other cases, it remains elusive as to why mutation increases inter-individual phenotypic variation and what alternative components underlie such variation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Janssens et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Surkova et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>To identify potential sources of variation that govern phenotypic discordance, we utilized the highly canalized process of early <italic>Drosophila</italic> embryonic AP patterning. We proposed that the inter-individual variation of the embryonic geometry is one of the factors that predetermine individual patterning outcomes under decanalizing mutations. We found that the patterning system in genetically intact embryos has a striking capacity to buffer against variations in embryonic geometry. When we artificially reduced the aspect ratio of the embryos by more than twofold, the relative boundary positions of segmentation genes showed only a minor shift compared to that of the wild type. The preservation of the boundary positions can be, at least partially, attributed to changes in the Bcd gradient profile due to the rounder embryonic shape in the shorter embryos. Importantly, the inter-individual variations of boundary positions remained comparable to that of the wild type. In contrast, when we introduced decanalizing mutations such as increased maternal <italic>bcd</italic> dosage or <italic>bcd</italic> knockout, the embryonic geometry becomes predictive of patterning outcomes of individuals. In both scenarios, the inter-individual phenotypic discordance can be traced back to variations in gap gene expression patterns. This suggests that under decanalized conditions particular gene interactions are preferentially affected by geometric constraints. Taken together, our study reveals embryo geometry, or more generally the physical domain in which patterning occurs, is a significant source of variation that can account for phenotypic discordance under decanalized conditions.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Embryos with dramatically reduced embryonic length still proceed with normal development</title><p>Scaling is one of the most astonishing features of embryonic patterning in dipteran insects. The expression boundaries of the early patterning genes reside at conserved relative positions among closely related dipteran species, although they differ dramatically in egg size (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Gregor et al., 2005</xref>). Such inter-species scaling can be attributed to the Bcd gradient of a conserved characteristic length (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Gregor et al., 2008</xref>). Within the <italic>Drosophila</italic> species, individual embryos of different size also exhibit scaled pattern as a consequence of adapted Bcd production and degradation rate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Cheung et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Cheung et al., 2014</xref>). We propose here that another macroscopic variable that the patterning system needs to adapt to in order to ensure scaling is the geometry, or shape of the egg. Given a defined embryonic volume, the embryos can vary significantly in their aspect ratio (AR = embryonic length/embryonic width, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Since Bcd molecules diffuse mainly at the cortical region of the embryo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Gregor et al., 2007b</xref>), varying embryonic geometry affects the effective diffusion area, and thus the length and time scales of the morphogen gradient formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Grimm et al., 2010</xref>). Therefore, we first examined how altering embryonic geometry affects embryonic patterning.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>The Bcd gradient in embryos with differing geometry is consistent with the SDD model.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Distribution of embryonic length in wild type (n = 239) and <italic>fat2RNAi</italic> (n = 364) embryos.

This process is mediated by the planar cell polarity of the follicle cells and the elliptical shape of the embryos remains unchanged throughout embryogenesis. Here, we used maternal ShRNA to knockdown one of the planar cell polarity core components, atypical cadherin Fat2 specifically in the follicle cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Horne-Badovinac et al., 2012</xref>), and we henceforth refer to these as <italic>fat2RNAi</italic> embryos. As Fat2 expression is only inhibited within the somatic cells of the egg chamber using <italic>traffic jam</italic> (<italic>tj</italic>) &gt;Gal4 driver, the fertilized eggs produced by this perturbation remain genetically intact.

First, we focus on Bcd, which provides AP positional information in the early embryo. To compare the spatial Bcd concentration profile in different embryonic geometry, we live-imaged eGFP-Bcd fusion protein in both control and <italic>fat2RNAi</italic> backgrounds, and measured the nuclear Bcd intensity along the AP axis at mid nuclear cycle (n.c.) 14 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>). We found that the absolute Bcd concentration is lower in the anterior half of the embryo in <italic>fat2RNAi</italic> individuals compared to that of control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G and H</xref>) (p&lt;10<sup>−3</sup>, two-sided t-test comparing intensity in region 5–15% EL). Further, Bcd profiles from different individuals intersect near the mid region of the embryo, with shorter embryos showing higher Bcd concentration in the posterior region (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G and H</xref>) (p&lt;10<sup>−3</sup>, two-sided t-test comparing intensity in region 65–75% EL).</p><p>The formation of the Bcd gradient depends on the amount and the spatial distribution of <italic>bcd</italic> mRNA molecules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Little et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Cheung et al., 2014</xref>). To examine <italic>bcd</italic> mRNA distribution under geometrical perturbations, we performed fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) against <italic>bcd</italic> mRNA in both wild type and <italic>fat2RNAi</italic> embryos (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1I</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1F</xref>). We found that at all stages prior to n.c. 12, the majority of the <italic>bcd</italic> mRNA is localized within the anterior 50 µm of the embryo, regardless of the embryonic geometry (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1J</xref>). Due to the difficulty in quantifying FISH data, we note that we cannot discount possible variation in the <italic>bcd</italic> mRNA amount between wild type and <italic>fat2RNAi</italic> embryos. However, such variations are likely small and do not substantially alter the overall distribution of <italic>bcd</italic> mRNA. These results are consistent with previous work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Cheung et al., 2011</xref>), which suggested that embryo volume was a key determinant of <italic>bcd</italic> mRNA levels; in the <italic>fat2RNAi</italic> embryos, volume does not substantially change. Importantly, the geometrical alterations induced in <italic>fat2RNAi</italic> embryos does not change the <italic>bcd</italic> mRNA distribution on an absolute scale.</p><p>Given that the <italic>bcd</italic> mRNA distribution does not appear substantially different between the wild type and <italic>fat2RNAi</italic> embryos, what is the cause of the spatial shift in the Bcd profile? We used theoretical modeling to test whether the geometrical changes alone (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Umulis and Othmer, 2012</xref>) are sufficient to explain the altered Bcd profile. The <underline>s</underline>ynthesis , <underline>d</underline>iffusion , <underline>d</underline>egradation (SDD) model of Bcd gradient formation provides an excellent description of the Bcd gradient (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Gregor et al., 2007b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Durrieu et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Little et al., 2011</xref>). A one-dimensional description generally works well for modelling the Bcd gradient (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Gregor et al., 2007b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Durrieu et al., 2018</xref>). However, the full three-dimensional geometry of the embryo can be important (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Mogilner and Odde, 2011</xref>), such as in interpreting FRAP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Castle et al., 2011</xref>) measurements and explaining differences in the gradient between dorsal and ventral sides of the embryo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">He et al., 2010a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Hengenius et al., 2011</xref>).

Note these parameters are based on an one-dimensional SDD model, as such models are typically a reasonable approximation to the formation of the Bcd gradient (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Little et al., 2011</xref>). <italic>f(x)</italic> is defined such that little Bcd production occurs greater than 50 μm from the anterior pole (Materials and methods). We solve for <italic>[Bcd]</italic> on the surface of an ellipsoid, as Bcd transport through the yolk appears to be limited (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Gregor et al., 2007b</xref>). For each simulation, we keep all dynamic parameters fixed and only change the embryo geometry. In particular, we assume that the Bcd production rate is unchanged in <italic>fat2RNAi</italic> embryos. Since the embryo volume does not markedly change, this means that the total amount of Bcd is similar in the model for both wild-type and <italic>fat2RNAi</italic> embryos. We change the width to maintain the experimentally measured aspect ratios (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>) and account for eGFP folding time (~50 min) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Liu et al., 2013</xref>). See Materials and methods for detailed description.</p><p>The SDD model can fit the observed Bcd gradient profiles in different embryonic geometries without requiring any change to the Bcd dynamics or production (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1K</xref>). As a consequence, we can explain the above observations. First, the lower Bcd intensity near the anterior pole in <italic>fat2RNAi</italic> embryos is because of dilution due to the larger DV extent in rounder embryos. If the total Bcd molecule number is similar at a particular AP position, the measured Bcd nuclear concentration (which depends on both total protein number and the local volume) at that position is lower in <italic>fat2RNAi</italic> embryos. Second, since the diffusion coefficient appears to remain unchanged, there is greater accumulation of Bcd in the posterior region of <italic>fat2RNAi</italic> embryos as the total travel distance is reduced in the rounder, shorter embryos, even when accounting for the higher curvature in <italic>fat2RNAi</italic> embryos. The ability of the SDD model to explain these differences in the Bcd profile simply by accounting for embryo geometry provides further support to the SDD model being an excellent biophysical description of the process of Bcd gradient formation. It is worth noting that the nuclei respond to the local concentration of mature Bcd protein regardless of the folding state of the tagged eGFP. Although we cannot infer the precise profile of mature Bcd from our experimentally measured eGFP profile as the Bcd protein folding rate is unknown, our model can test the effects of different protein folding time on the functional gradient in different geometries. From the model shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1K</xref>, we can infer the total Bcd concentration, where we assume Bcd folds at a much faster rate than eGFP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1G</xref>). The predicted total Bcd concentration displays qualitatively similar behavior in varying embryonic geometries to our experiments; that is our results are unlikely an artefact of protein folding time differences between Bcd and eGFP.</p><p>Does the change of the Bcd concentration profile in <italic>fat2RNAi</italic> embryos impact on the scaling of downstream patterning genes? To address this question, we measured Hunchback (Hb) expression in mid n.c. 14 using live imaging of <italic>hb &gt;LlamaTag</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bothma et al., 2018</xref>), (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>).

Comparatively, the Hb boundary shows a posterization in <italic>fat2RNAi</italic> embryos (52.9% EL). Further, we found an increased variation of 2.3% EL in the Hb boundary position (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). However, considering the absolute length of <italic>fat2RNAi</italic> embryos, the variation of Hb boundary positions (~8 µm) between different individuals is still less than the average distance between neighboring nuclei.</p><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Embryonic patterning is robust to perturbation of embryonic geometry.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Max projection of ctrl (top) and <italic>fat2RNAi</italic> (bottom) embryos expressing maternally loaded eGFP and hb &gt;LlamaTag.

However, the inter-individual variation remains comparable to that of the wild type (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C–F</xref>, bottom row). We conclude that when we manipulate the embryonic geometry to an extent beyond that naturally observed, the reproducibility of the patterning outcomes is preserved. Therefore, the intact early embryonic patterning network is highly robust to variations in embryonic geometry.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Embryonic length predetermines patterning outcomes in decanalized conditions of increased bcd dosage</title><p>We have demonstrated that <italic>fat2RNAi</italic> embryos provide an excellent system for testing the role of geometry on patterning networks.

Individuals with mild defects frequently displayed missing or fused denticle belts in the fourth abdominal (A4) segment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C–D</xref>), a positional bias that has been reported previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Namba et al., 1997</xref>). More severe phenotypes showed defects in a spreading region centered about the A4 segment. Meanwhile, embryos show high rate of mouth defects as a consequence of significantly increased local Bcd concentration in the most anterior region (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C–D</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1D</xref>). Patterning defects were rarely seen in 3-fold <italic>bcd</italic> over-expression embryos unless <italic>fat2RNAi</italic> knockdown is further introduced into this genetic background (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C–D</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1E</xref>). A large percentage of these individuals showed abdominal patterning defects, with A4 showing the highest defective frequency (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C–D</xref>). Interestingly, a similar distribution of defective abdominal segments is also seen in the small proportion of non-hatched <italic>fat2RNAi</italic> individuals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C–D</xref>).</p><p>To understand if embryonic geometry predetermines the severity of phenotypic defects in individuals, we characterized the patterning outcomes using En expression in embryos with various <italic>bcd</italic> copy number and embryonic length. Individuals with 2-fold <italic>bcd</italic> overexpression (single insertion of tandem <italic>bcd</italic>), within the natural range of embryonic geometry, showed intact En expression. However, shorter embryos (&lt;450 µm) frequently presented patterning defects, most commonly in the 6th En stripe (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>, top panel). Interestingly, this position corresponds to the A4 segment in the cuticle pattern. Comparatively, patterning defects become more pervasive in 3-fold <italic>bcd</italic> over-expression individuals when embryonic length reduced below 470 µm. The range of defective segments gradually expands from the 6th En stripe to both anterior and posterior regions with decreasing embryonic length (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>, middle panel and 3F). Further, increasing <italic>bcd</italic> dosage 5-fold renders patterning processes exceedingly susceptible to reduced embryonic length. Defects are observed in comparatively shorter individuals within the natural range and recurringly the 6th En stripe is the most frequent breaking point in the patterning (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>, bottom panel).</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>The A4 segment is a weak point in the gap gene network due to repression of eve stripe five in short embryos</title><p>The defective abdominal patterning that we observe here is an intuitive result, as both the posterization of gap gene boundaries due to increased <italic>bcd</italic> dosage and reduced embryonic length lead to reduced number of nuclei along the AP axis in the trunk region. When the number of nuclei falls short of the minimal requirement to fulfill all the different cell identities along the AP axis, certain cell fates become lost. It is surprising, however, that this defect originates at and expands from the same position in all defective embryos, the A4 segment. This positional bias is also reflected in the segmentation gene pattern at the blastoderm stages. While the gap gene boundaries remain roughly at the same scaled positions across different geometries (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>), the absolute distance between neighboring gap gene expression peaks decreases in response to reduced embryonic length (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). This in turn changes the combinatorial inputs to activate downstream pair-rule genes, for example <italic>even-skipped</italic> (<italic>eve</italic>). The expression peaks of Kni and Gt are brought into proximity with gradually reducing embryonic length (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B–C</xref>). As Kni and Gt confine the boundaries of <italic>eve</italic> stripe 5 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Fujioka et al., 1999</xref>), the expression of this <italic>eve</italic> stripe is over-repressed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>, asterisk). This results in the loss of correct cell fate at this position, corresponding to the future A4 segment. With further reduced embryonic length, a larger percentage of individuals fail to activate Kni and Gt in the trunk region (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>, green crosses; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>, arrowhead), leading to defects across a broader range.</p><fig id="fig4" position="float"><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><title>Embryonic patterning breaks down at A4 segment with <italic>bcd</italic> overexpression.</title><p>(<bold>A–B</bold>) Embryonic length of 6x<italic>bcd</italic> individuals plotted against the scaled (<bold>A</bold>) or absolute (<bold>B</bold>) AP position of four gap gene boundaries (Hb, blue; Gt, magenta; Kr, red and Kni, green).

This question is motivated by the significant phenotypic variation observed among embryos derived from females carrying the same <italic>bcd</italic> null allele (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Frohnhöfer and Nüsslein-Volhard, 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Frohnhofer and Nusslein-Volhard, 1987</xref>).

The MiMIC transposon carrying stop codons in all three reading frames is targeted by CRISPR to insert into the first intron of the endogenous <italic>bcd</italic> gene. Therefore, no functional Bcd protein is produced by this knockout allele (annotated <italic>bcd<sup>KO</sup></italic>).

While the anterior embryonic patterning is entirely defective, the patterning defects in posterior regions are more variable. The number of normal abdominal denticle belts in each embryo ranges from three (A6 - A8) to seven (A2 - A8), with four intact abdominal segments (A5 –A8) being the most frequently observed phenotype (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>).

The anterior Gt stripe in <italic>bcd</italic> mutants has been observed before (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Staller et al., 2015</xref>) but its regulatory interactions remain elusive. Potentially it is activated by the remnant anterior determinants such as the maternal Hb, distributed in the anterior half of the embryo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Irish et al., 1989</xref>). Comparatively shorter embryos show phenotypically higher degree of symmetry in both cuticle and gene expression patterns, conceivably due to stronger repression of maternal Hb in shorter individuals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1B–D</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2</xref>).</p><p>Looking more closely at individuals within the natural range of embryonic geometry (range 3, EL within 510–540 µm), the sufficient physical space between two Hb stripes permits the expression of Kr, Kni and Gt, arranged in spatial order that is conserved as in wild-type embryos (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A–C</xref>, range 3). In summary, as a consequence of gradually increasing embryonic length, a continuously increasing variety of gap gene expression domains are activated along the AP axis, which is in turn, translated into increased number of body segments, as manifested by the pair-rule gene expression pattern (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1E</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Individuals of the same species often display a certain level of morphological and behavioral differences, such as in animal color patterns and human facial features (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Beldade et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Sheehan and Nachman, 2014</xref>). This reflects inter-individual variation in genetic composition and life-history environmental exposure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Dall et al., 2012</xref>). Such intraspecific individuality may have significant ecological and social impacts on the population (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Forsman and Wennersten, 2016</xref>). Equally, these same genetic and environmental variations pose challenges to fundamental developmental processes as they try to generate invariant developmental outcomes. Multiple lines of evidence suggest that organisms have evolved canalization mechanisms that render developmental processes insensitive to such sources of variation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Félix and Barkoulas, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Flatt, 2005</xref>). Early <italic>Drosophila</italic> embryonic patterning provides an excellent example of a canalized developmental process – the boundaries of segmentation gene expression remain highly reproducible amongst individuals in the face of heterozygous mutations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Lehmann and Nüsslein-Volhard, 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Wieschaus et al., 1984</xref>), genetic variations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Lott et al., 2007</xref>) and temperature perturbations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Houchmandzadeh et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Lucchetta et al., 2005</xref>). These studies suggest that mechanisms including epistasis, genotype-environment interactions and canalizing gene regulatory networks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Manu et al., 2009</xref>) work together to ensure precise patterning outputs.</p><p>In this study, we have identified embryonic geometry as an additional source of variation that patterning processes have evolved to buffer against. The geometry, or in other words, the aspect ratio of each ellipsoid-shaped embryo is determined during oogenesis, and this parameter varies by ±10% in the population of the wild-type strain OreR. The variable geometry in turn increases the variation in embryonic length given the natural range of embryonic geometry. Previous studies have shown that patterning outcomes are highly reproducible and remain scaled to embryonic length (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Antonetti et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Lott et al., 2007</xref>). What roles do Bcd and the gap gene interactions have in this scaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Wu et al., 2015</xref>)? Combining results from <italic>fat2RNAi</italic> embryos with theoretical modeling may reveal exciting new insights into the underlying scaling mechanisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bieler et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Jaeger et al., 2004</xref>). Correspondingly, we found that under decanalized conditions, either by depleting maternal <italic>bcd</italic> inputs or artificially increasing the <italic>bcd</italic> dosage, the patterning process loses its capacity to buffer embryonic length variations. Consequently, the length of an individual embryo predetermines its patterning outcomes. The predictive power becomes stronger when we artificially increase the variation of the embryonic geometry. The aspect ratio of the <italic>fat2RNAi</italic> embryos differs by ±30% while the average embryonic volume is only slightly reduced by ~8%. These results further support embryonic geometry as a major source of variation that accounts for inter-individual phenotypic variation under decanalized conditions.</p><p>Both embryonic volume and embryonic length are inheritable traits and therefore adaptive to artificial selection or environmental changes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Azevedo et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Fox and Czesak, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Lott et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Miles et al., 2011</xref>). It will be interesting to understand if the aspect ratio of the embryo shape is also a genetically variable trait so that the population can be selected to produce progenies with a biased geometry. If this is the case, embryonic geometry may be involved in the complex interplay between environment, genetic components and developmental processes during the course of evolution. When a population confronts selection towards a new phenotypic optimum, for example, larger egg volume due to decreasing temperature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Azevedo et al., 1997</xref>), such directional selection may result in decanalizing effects on the patterning processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Miles et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Wagner et al., 1997</xref>). Meanwhile, the naturally variable embryonic geometry - together with other sources of variation - generates a spectrum of patterning outcomes in different individuals. As a result, a different range of embryonic geometry will be favored and selected as they maintain the patterning outcomes of the parental lines. Conceivably, this may be one of the reasons why eggs of closely related Dipteran species differ not only in size (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Gregor et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Markow et al., 2009</xref>) but also in geometry, and such geometrical differences can also be observed in different laboratory lines carrying different genetic background.</p><p>Our quantitative analysis of segmentation gene expression demonstrates how embryonic geometry affects individual patterning outcomes under two decanalizing conditions. In the case of the maternal <italic>bcd</italic> null mutant, we have shown that the signaling centers located at both poles of the embryo initiate the hierarchical gene expression along the AP axis in a non-scaled manner. This explains, mechanistically, how patterning processes incorporate information of the embryonic geometry to account for the final outputs. It remains unclear, however, in the case of increased <italic>bcd</italic> dosage, what determines the breaking point (the fourth abdominal segment) of the final pattern. One possibility is that the susceptibility of this position reflects the strength of the regulatory interactions between the segmentation genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Jaeger, 2011</xref>). Systematic comparisons among different <italic>Drosophila</italic> species have shown that the regulatory sequences of the segmentation genes are rapidly evolving and thus substantially diverged (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Ludwig et al., 2000</xref>). Interestingly, the spatio-temporal dynamics of the segmentation gene expression patterns are highly conserved between species, suggesting that the co-evolution of modular transcription binding sites compensate for each other to keep the patterning outcomes unchanged (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Gregor et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Ludwig et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Ludwig et al., 2000</xref>). Such an inter-species canalization phenomenon is also observed among more distally related species within the sub-taxon Cyclorrhapha, which involved more dramatic rewiring of the regulatory network (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Crombach et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Wotton et al., 2015</xref>). If the breaking point of patterning processes under decanalized conditions truly depends on the system parameters of the underlying network (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Jaeger and Crombach, 2012</xref>), we expect to see different susceptible points in different network structures. This can be tested by characterizing decanalizing phenotypes in related species.</p><p>A longstanding question in patterning is how do gene regulatory networks downstream of morphogens incorporate information about the macroscopic geometrical parameters of each individual to give rise to scaled patterning outputs? While our results do not provide mechanistic insight into the scaling mechanisms of the gap gene network, they define the physical boundaries where such scaling breaks down. The emergence of scaled expression boundaries is closely linked to embryo geometry, and future models will hopefully more rigorously test the role of geometry in the scaling. Further, our results directly show that the Bcd gradient shape depends on the embryo geometry; in our case, by roughly conserving embryo volume but reducing the aspect ratio, the Bcd gradient extends further into the posterior, resulting in a posterior shift in gap gene expression boundaries.</p><p>In conclusion, embryonic geometry was identified as a source of variation in addition to environmental and genetic factors that predetermines phenotypic outcomes in mutant conditions. We think that embryonic or more generally, tissue geometry may play an important role in other decanalizing conditions by affecting patterning outputs, such as other segmentation gene mutants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Janssens et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Surkova et al., 2013</xref>), or in vitro induction of patterning systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Lancaster and Knoblich, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Simunovic and Brivanlou, 2017</xref>), both of which show significant inter-individual phenotypic variations. Our work highlights that care must be taken when taking a system out of its native environment – for example organoids – as the system boundaries affect the operation of signaling networks. Characterizing the influence of the geometrical parameters will help us to have a more complete understanding of decanalization, and in turn, canalizing phenomenon.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Fly stocks and genetics</title><p>The <italic>bcd</italic> knockout allele (<italic>bcd<sup>KO</sup></italic>) used in this study was generated by CRISPR-mediated insertion of a MiMIC cassette into the first intron of the <italic>bcd</italic> gene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Huang et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Venken et al., 2011</xref>) The cuticle phenotype of <italic>bcd<sup>KO</sup></italic> was compared to that of the classic <italic>bcd<sup>E1</sup></italic> allele (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Frohnhöfer and Nüsslein-Volhard, 1986</xref>) To generate embryos with artificially reduced aspect ratio, we expressed RNA interference against the <italic>fat2</italic> gene using a maternal <italic>traffic jam (tj) &gt;Gal4</italic> driver (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Barlan et al., 2017</xref>) Both <italic>UAS &gt; fat2</italic> RNAi and <italic>tj &gt;Gal4</italic> were either crossed to or recombined with the <italic>bcd<sup>KO</sup></italic> allele, so that the females carrying all three alleles produce bcd null embryos with wide range of aspect ratio.</p><p>The <italic>tandem bcd</italic> construct was generated by replacing the eGFP sequence in the pCaSpeR4-<italic>egfp-bcd</italic> vector (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Gregor et al., 2007b</xref>) by <italic>bcd</italic> protein coding sequence.

Finally, after washing in PBT for 6 times, embryos were mounted on microscopy slides with Aqua-Poly/Mount [Polysciences, Inc- 18606].</p></sec><sec id="s4-6-4"><title>Microscopy imaging and image analysis</title><p>Slides were imaged on a Zeiss confocal LSM880 using 40X water immersion lens. For each embryo, Z-stack images were taken covering the region from surface to the midsagittal plane, and the neighbouring planes were separated by 3 µm. Following that, a projected maximum intensity image was generated. The outside of the embryo was segmented using thresholding in Matlab after using rolling ball background subtraction. A 10μm-thick mask was defined around the embryo perimeter in order to avoid effects from yolk autofluorescence. Finally, the average signal intensity at each position along the AP axis was taken from the mask. The signal from each embryo varies significantly, making a rigorous quantitative comparison challenging. The signal from each embryo was normalized by the intensity around 200 μm from the anterior pole.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Simulation of SDD (Synthesis, Diffusion, Degradation) model</title><p>We use COMSOL Multiphysics 5.3 to simulate diffusion along the surface of prolate ellipsoids of varying sizes to account for the geometries of wild type and <italic>fat2RNAi</italic> embryos.</p><p>We consider steady state equations for the concentration of Bcd in the unfolded (U) and folded (F) states.

The images of laterally oriented embryos were rotated so that the anterior is to the left and dorsal to the up. A line with the width of 100 pixels crossing the center of the embryo was drawn to extract average intensity along the AP axis.

consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by two peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Naama Barkai as the Senior Editor.

Remarkably, they find that in mutant embryos, the number of engrailed stripes and the number of abdominal segments is determined by the length of the embryo. This rule applies to embryos with abnormally short AP axes generated by knockdown of fat2. In contrast, in the presence of Bcd, the correct number of segments always arise, regardless of embryo length, even in fat2 KD embryos. Thus, Bcd is required for scaling of expression patterns to accommodate variation in embryo length. Measurements of Bcd-GFP strongly suggests that this scaling is achieved by reducing the amplitude of the Bcd gradient concomitant with the reduction in egg length. By examining gap gene expression, they show that in short <italic>bcd</italic> mutant eggs, the distance between anterior and posterior poles must be sufficiently large to permit the expression of the genes Kruppel and knirps. Their data are consistent with a view of the bicoid mutant phenotype in which Torso signaling is not scaled in accord with embryo length, so that terminal signaling in short embryos overrides factor(s) that would otherwise permit the expression of Kr and knirps. Finally, the authors show that excess Bcd also disrupts patterning by interfering with specification in the vicinity of the fourth abdominal segment, with additional segments affected in shorter embryos.</p><p>The work is exciting because it articulates an explanation for phenotypic variability in <italic>bcd</italic> mutants. The manuscript is significant in showing that the Bcd gradient itself provides a buffer against variation in egg length.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>The paper will benefit from re-structuring, to better explain the main findings. This is detailed in the individual reports, but in the discussion, the reviewers reached an agreement on what they find to be promising approach, which is described below. In addition, to fully establish the main findings, the following additional data are requested:</p><p>1) Please explore further how <italic>bcd</italic> mRNA and protein distributions are affected by fat2 KD, since this may help explain how <italic>bcd</italic> provides scaling. If the simulation can be used to address this point, the manuscript will be stronger. However, the authors must provide much more detail on how the simulation was implemented if the reader is to believe any conclusion drawn from it. As it stands now, the simulation is a distraction from the results.</p><p>2) Please perform an in situ hybridization and quantification of <italic>bcd</italic> mRNA, as suggested in the review</p><p>3) Please include an experimental verification of embryo shrinking.</p><p>Suggestion for revising the writing:</p><p>The opening question can remain the same (&quot;what is canalization buffering against&quot;); the authors show buffering against a wide range of embryo sizes, even well outside the normal range; this sets up the question of what AP patterning factors are required for canalization; then authors show the requirement of Bcd: without <italic>bcd</italic>, aspects of the resulting mutant phenotype (like the number of En stripes) now correlate with embryo size. I also suggest to keep the Bcd overexpression data at the end of the manuscript. Then at the very least, the authors should discuss ways / propose models to explain how Bcd might provide scaling, possibly through altered mRNA expression, localization, and/or translation, with references to Jun Ma's set of work on this very subject. The manuscript would be greatly strengthened if the authors could provide evidence, experimental and/or using their (currently rather poorly explained) model, that one or more of these processes are different in embryos of different sizes. This would help the field understand how the Bcd protein gradient is reshaped (as they claim) and in turn how this reshaping confers scaling.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic></p><p>Executive summary: Overall, I believe this paper contains enough material to support and justify an interesting point using a clever method. However, I also find that, as written, its order of presentation does the narrative a great disservice. Below, I advocate for a rather serious reorganization of presentation (which incidentally should also make the paper shorter). But provided the presentation is modified, I do believe this paper can be made acceptable for <italic>eLife</italic> without additional experimental work (except for one small point – see moderate point #3).</p><p>Details:</p><p>Embryonic development in the fruit fly is said to exhibit &quot;canalization&quot;, generating reproducible phenotypic outcomes despite inter-individual differences in genetic background and environmental conditions, within a certain range. Outside this range (&quot;decanalized conditions&quot;), individuals become sensitive to variations that would otherwise be neutral. In this manuscript, Huang &amp; Saunders ask exactly what sources of variation canalization is buffering against. They argue that, in addition to genetic and environmental perturbations, another previously unidentified source of variation is the &quot;naturally variable embryonic geometry&quot;. [But see &quot;minor point 2&quot;]</p><p>To address this question (&quot;what sources of variation is canalization buffering against?&quot;), the authors designed a clever way to modify geometry of the embryo, plausibly without changing very much else [but see &quot;minor point 3&quot;]. Using their clever tool, the authors can effectively increase the variability in embryo geometry – thus testing the ability of the developmental system to buffer against such perturbations.</p><p>In the absence of other complicating factors, the embryo demonstrates a truly remarkable capacity to deal with perturbation of its geometry. Frankly, to me this is perhaps the most striking finding reported here, but this is not what the authors focus on.</p><p>Now, in my mind, the way for the authors to make their point would be to apply a pressure towards decanalization of development, and observe that the ability of the embryo to buffer the geometric perturbations is reduced. With no other problems, embryos are basically normal (Figure 3—figure supplement 1, panels EFGH are frankly amazing and deserve to be in the main text.) With some perturbation (e.g. temperature, or increased dosage of Bcd like here) the embryos are able to buffer small variations of geometry but not big ones. With an even larger perturbation, embryos with non-normal aspect ratio fail to develop. This is the approach I would have expected, given the authors' stated goals.</p><p>But the authors instead apply a truly dramatic perturbation, removing maternal <italic>bcd</italic>. This is a lethal mutant. They then observe that sometimes the embryo is short, and everything is broken completely. At other times the embryo is longer and everything is broken partially. (A few structures do form in a way that resembles normal – but the entire first half of the embryo is still gone.) Thus, observed results subsection 2, the degree to which the embryo is broken is correlated with embryo length. And if we make the embryo's life even more difficult by compounding the already lethal <italic>bcd</italic> knockout with a further perturbation of geometry, things get even worse. (Results subsection 4).</p><p>I do not understand how we can make claims about what perturbations a system had evolved to buffer by studying it in a completely dysfunctional regime, which is by definition irrelevant for development. The authors demonstrated that in a family of lethal mutants shorter embryos are even more screwed up than longer ones. But all of them are lethal, at which point counting &quot;just how badly lethal&quot; seems irrelevant.</p><p>The authors then go on to apply another set of dramatic perturbations – rather than increasing Bcd a little, they overexpress it 6x or 10-fold, the latter again being lethal.</p><p>By this point I personally was not buying the story at all – but finally, the paper gets to Figure 5 and subsection “The gene network breaks at susceptible point in decanalized conditions” onwards, which finally turned everything around. I found that result very strong and interesting. But if I were a reader rather than a reviewer, I would not have made it that far.</p><p>My proposal: if the point made in the Introduction/Discussion section is indeed the intended focus of the narrative, I believe the paper could make it point much more persuasively, while also being shorter:</p><p>• Introduce the fat2RNAi trick that allows generating embryos with a much more varied geometry than normal, and explain how that offers a fantastic window into studying canalization</p><p>• Observe that, absent other perturbations, the development is capable of buffering that &quot;geometric&quot; variability. Move supplementary panels from Figure 3 supplement to the main text.</p><p>• Stress the system by increasing <italic>bcd</italic> dosage (4x, 6x), and proceed through the argument at the end of the Results section.</p><p>This is the narrative that actually makes the point set up in the Introduction, and this point is a strong one: the construct developed by the authors allows directly probing the ability of a system to buffer variations – in a very clean, controlled setting, of which I know few. It is a remarkable setting and beautiful result. Only after this point is made, can the response to <italic>bcd</italic> removal really be seen as further reinforcing the authors' point – not before, because such dramatic perturbation is way beyond anything relevant for normal development and therefore canalization; on its own, this line of evidence alone would be questionable. E.g. last paragraph of subsection “Embryonic length dictates segmentation gene pattern in the absence of <italic>bcd</italic>” – these discussions are useful for mapping out who activates who in a pathway, but entirely irrelevant for normal development and &quot;what canalization evolved for&quot;, surely! I would in fact consider largely moving all the discussions of non-viable mutants to the supplement.</p><p>Other specific issues:</p><p>Moderate points:</p><p>1) Paragraph two of subsection “Embryonic length dictates segmentation gene pattern in the absence of <italic>bcd</italic>” unexpectedly bring up the question of expression pattern scaling and I'm not sure whether this is a good move. Exactly what is the paper contributing to that conversation? It seems like a distraction. I suggest removing.</p><p>2) &quot;Genetic network breaks at susceptible point&quot; – what does this sentence mean? How does a genetic network &quot;break&quot;? What is a &quot;susceptible point&quot;? Is this a result, or some intuition the authors are trying to communicate? The strongest point in this paper is introduced by the weakest/meaningless header. Similarly, when the Abstract is revised, I would suggest removing the last sentence referring to &quot;vulnerable points in the network&quot; which again sounds like some intuition (belonging to Discussion section) rather than a finding.</p><p>3) Second paragraph of subsection “Measurement of embryonic geometry”: I found this hard to parse (particularly the use of the term &quot;further&quot;). My interpretation is that EL pre-fixation is inferred from EL post-fixation assuming that aspect ratio is unchanged – correct? This should be clarified. But even more importantly – was this assumption of isotropic shrinkage verified? In my experience a harsh fixation protocol can lead to extensive deformations, their isotropic nature is not obvious, and given the role played by the aspect ratio in this paper, this seems an important point to demonstrate. [This is the one place where additional data may be required, but shouldn't be too onerous to obtain]</p><p>4) SDD simulation: I am very confused.</p><p>a) If I use an cylinder to approximate an ellipsoid, then geometrically, the &quot;best approximation&quot; cylinder is surely narrower than the embryo. Not wider. It seems like width is used as a free fitting parameter to make the data fit better, but the text tries to make it sound like this larger-than-actual radius was somehow expected, and I don't understand the argument.</p><p>b) Further, I believe the diffusion parameters, both in the bulk and at the surface, for a small molecule like Bcd or Hb, were previously measured in the embryo specifically. So it sounds like this could be a zero-parameter fit. How bad is it? Why the discrepancy?</p><p>c) And in particular, if using an elliptical geometry truly does not significantly alter the results, why not use it, given that the parameters of the actual geometry are, again, known?</p><p>d) Does the SDD simulation also reproduce the features that the plot of Figure 3G specifically highlights, namely the larger concentration in the posterior and the crossing point? The panel D in Figure 3 supplement does not allow to see this.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>Huang and Saunders investigate phenotypic variability of bicoid mutant <italic>Drosophila</italic> embryos. Remarkably, they find that in mutant embryos, the number of engrailed stripes and the number of abdominal segments is determined by the length of the embryo. This rule applies to embryos with abnormally short AP axes generated by knockdown of fat2.

The manuscript is significant in showing that the Bcd gradient itself provides a buffer against variation in egg length. The main finding, at least to this reviewer, is that Bcd itself is required for length scaling. The authors should draw greater attention to this result. This result seems consistent with the work of Jun Ma, whose publications should be cited (e.g., doi: 10.1242/dev.064402). Interestingly, scaling occurs in fat2-depleted embryos despite the paradoxical finding of more <italic>bcd</italic> mRNA upon fat2 KD (Figure 5—figure supplement 1). This suggests alteration in Bcd translation and/or localization of mRNA in short eggs. The manuscript would be strengthened if the authors could comment further about the nature of Bcd-mediated canalization, particularly to explain why more mRNA generates less protein. Along these lines, more detailed description of the simulation would be helpful. In particular, it would strengthen the manuscript to know whether <italic>bcd</italic> mRNA localization might play a role in canalization. What geometry of <italic>bcd</italic> mRNA was used in the simulation? It should not be beyond the technical limits of the lab to perform a semi-quantitative in situ hybridization for <italic>bcd</italic> mRNA to address the question of whether <italic>bcd</italic> mRNA distribution is changed by fat2 KD in a way that helps explain Bcd-mediated scaling.</p><p>As a final major comment, the authors document variability in gap gene boundaries in control embryos, fat2 KD, and <italic>bcd</italic> mutants (Figure 1 J-M, Figure 1—figure supplement 1, and Figure 3—figure supplement 1). The authors should address how much of this variability arises from variability in egg length. The LlamaTag experiment suggests that at some of the variability originates from differences in egg length (this is clear from the anticorrelation in Figure 3I). If egg length determines boundary positions, then there should be a relationship between egg length and gap gene boundary position in <italic>bcd</italic> mutants. The degree of correlation might be even stronger in <italic>bcd</italic> mutants due to the absence of the canalizing activity of Bcd. The authors should plot boundary position for each gap gene boundary as a function of egg length, similar to Figure 3I.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were suggested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for resubmitting your work entitled &quot;Embryonic geometry underlies phenotypic variation in decanalized conditions&quot; for further consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your revised article has been evaluated by Naama Barkai (Senior Editor) and a Reviewing Editor.</p><p>The manuscript has been improved but there are some remaining issues that need to be addressed before acceptance. please address the remaining comments, as specified below</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic></p><p>I believe the revisions improved the manuscript significantly.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>The revised manuscript will be satisfactory for publication if the authors can clarify the following points listed below regarding the simulation of Bcd-GFP production. The main point of Figure 1F-K is to address how the Bcd gradient changes in embryos with altered geometry. My concern is that the presentation of the simulation in the text may appear at first glance incongruent with the figures. In the end I believe the figures are consistent with the text, but I would like some clarification. I imagine what I am requesting will be trivial for the authors to provide, but at the same time very useful and insightful for readers.</p><p>1) The authors state that the same parameter values describe the distribution of fluorescent Bcd-GFP regardless of embryo geometry. Unless I am mistaken, this means that, at steady-state imposed by the model (and using the finding that <italic>bcd</italic> mRNA doesn't change very much in terms of its total amount), the total amount of Bcd-GFP embryo-wide is equivalent in all embryos regardless of their geometry. Further, the total amounts of fluorescent and non-fluorescent Bcd-GFP are also equivalent. It would be helpful to explicitly state this in the text for those not immediately familiar with modeling and/or may not be aware that the maturation time of GFP is non-negligible in this context.</p><p>2) Assuming that Bcd-GFP amount is the same in all embryos, a reader will then examine Figure 1G and note that the summed nuclear intensity (or in some sense, the area under the curve) does not appear to be the same in embryos of different sizes. Instead it appears that Bcd-GFP scales with embryo length. This appears to contradict the idea that total BcdGFP is unchanged. However, the authors say that this is due to &quot;dilution&quot; of Bcd-GFP. I interpret this to mean that if one considers an embryo as a set of &quot;salami slices,&quot; then, due to the altered aspect ratio, a slice at some absolute distance from the anterior pole in fat2 KD (or, more generally, in short) embryos has a larger volume compared to a slice at the same distance in wild-type. The apparent reduction in &quot;nuclear concentration&quot; of Bcd-GFP occurs because whatever amount of Bcd-GFP is available at that distance is roughly the same between long and short embryos. This amount distributes into the available volume, so that the apparent concentration of BcdGFP appears lower in fat2 KD. Could the authors please state this more explicitly, if my interpretation is correct. I believe that splitting the long sentence the fifth paragraph of subsection “Developmental reproducibility is preserved with a minor impact on scaling under geometrical perturbations” into two or three sentences will suffice, devoting a sentence or two to each of the two differences (low anterior, high posterior) in the gradients of long and short eggs. This will help the reader to understand why the 1D plot of Bcd-GFP vs AP does not accurately represent the total amount of Bcd and results in the reduction in nuclear intensity in the anterior.</p><p>3) Figure 1 presents data and simulation regarding only fluorescent Bcd-GFP. A powerful aspect of the simulation is that it can estimate the quantity that we (and the embryo) actually care about, the distribution of _total_ Bcd. Given the sizable maturation time of 50 minutes used in the simulation, my intuition is that the invisible proportion likely extends over a significantly larger fraction of egg length in short embryos compared to long. However my intuition may well be wrong. Could the authors please present and discuss the estimated _total_ Bcd-GFP distribution as a function of both absolute and normalized distance in embryos of various aspect ratios (lengths)? To my thinking, this is the only way to address the question of how the actual gradient (not just the visible one) changes with changing geometry. For example, after estimating the gradients of total Bcd, could the authors now show the difference in total Bcd concentration, as in Figure 1K lower panel, except now for total Bcd. (Could the authors also include error bars on the difference in 1K and in a new plot regarding total concentration?) Moreover, the difference in total Bcd can be converted into a difference in fractional egg length (&quot;positional error&quot;) as a function of normalized AP position, i.e., the difference in the positions at which the same Bcd concentration is found in short eggs compared to long. This difference is zero near the midpoint of the AP axis where the curves cross and becomes larger moving toward either pole. This will give the reader a sense of magnitude of the mistakes in assigning positional identity that we would expect in short embryos if Bcd were the only patterning cue. In turn, these differences can be compared to the changes in the placement of gap gene expression boundaries presented in Figure 2. Are the changes in the Bcd gradient predictive of the changes in boundary placement (in other words, do gap gene boundaries arise at the same Bcd concentration in long and short eggs)? Do gap gene boundaries shift more, less, or the same amount as predicted by the changes in the Bcd gradient? The answers will help address how the altered Bcd gradient in short embryos generates (or works against!) scaling, and how much of the scaling phenomenon must arise independently of the Bcd gradient.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.47380.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>The paper will benefit from re-structuring, to better explain the main findings.

We have given greater prominence to these results and explained their significance in more detail.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>My proposal: if the point made in the Introduction/Discussion section is indeed the intended focus of the narrative, I believe the paper could make it point much more persuasively, while also being shorter:</p><p>• Introduce the fat2RNAi trick that allows generating embryos with a much more varied geometry than normal, and explain how that offers a fantastic window into studying canalization</p></disp-quote><p>We have reordered the manuscript to make the <italic>fat2RNAi</italic> results with normal Bcd levels more obvious – this now constitutes revised Figures 1 and 2.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>• Observe that, absent other perturbations, the development is capable of buffering that &quot;geometric&quot; variability.

It is a remarkable setting and beautiful result. Only after this point is made, can the response to bcd removal really be seen as further reinforcing the authors' point – not before, because such dramatic perturbation is way beyond anything relevant for normal development and therefore canalization; on its own, this line of evidence alone would be questionable. E.g. last paragraph of subsection “Embryonic length dictates segmentation gene pattern in the absence of bcd” – these discussions are useful for mapping out who activates who in a pathway, but entirely irrelevant for normal development and &quot;what canalization evolved for&quot;, surely! I would in fact consider largely moving all the discussions of non-viable mutants to the supplement.</p></disp-quote><p>We understand the reviewers point, but we do feel that the depleted Bcd condition provides important insights that cannot be gleaned from the over-expression mutants. For example, as stated above, these results provide an important insight into how the large phenotypic variability often seen in mutant conditions of key patterning genes may have (at least to some degree) a systematic cause related to embryo size. In the revised manuscript, these results now constitute revised Figures 5 and 6.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Other specific issues:</p><p>Moderate points:</p><p>1) Paragraph two of subsection “Embryonic length dictates segmentation gene pattern in the absence of bcd” unexpectedly bring up the question of expression pattern scaling and I'm not sure whether this is a good move. Exactly what is the paper contributing to that conversation? It seems like a distraction. I suggest removing.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that where this point was raised in the original manuscript was confusing. We do feel that an important point here is being discussed regarding how scaling occurs. Therefore, we have moved this part in to the Discussion and reworked it to highlight the key points.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) &quot;Genetic network breaks at susceptible point&quot; – what does this sentence mean? How does a genetic network &quot;break&quot;? What is a &quot;susceptible point&quot;? Is this a result, or some intuition the authors are trying to communicate? The strongest point in this paper is introduced by the weakest/meaningless header. Similarly, when the Abstract is revised, I would suggest removing the last sentence referring to &quot;vulnerable points in the network&quot; which again sounds like some intuition (belonging to Discussion section) rather than a finding.</p></disp-quote><p>We have reworked this section, including the header. By “susceptible”, we meant the point in the patterning network where we most often see patterning defects under perturbation (either to embryo size or Bcd expression levels, or both). However, we agree that the original wording was not clear. As suggested, we have removed these words from the Abstract and Results, and elaborated these concepts in the Discussion.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Second paragraph of subsection “Measurement of embryonic geometry”: I found this hard to parse (particularly the use of the term &quot;further&quot;). My interpretation is that EL pre-fixation is inferred from EL post-fixation assuming that aspect ratio is unchanged – correct? This should be clarified. But even more importantly – was this assumption of isotropic shrinkage verified? In my experience a harsh fixation protocol can lead to extensive deformations, their isotropic nature is not obvious, and given the role played by the aspect ratio in this paper, this seems an important point to demonstrate. [This is the one place where additional data may be required, but shouldn't be too onerous to obtain]</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for raising this important point which was insufficiently explained in the original submission. As described in the Materials and methods section, we fix the embryos in heptane saturated by 37% paraformaldehyde for 1 hr, after which the embryos are devitellinized manually. As this fixation method does not involve any vortex or heat shock step, it generally preserves embryo morphology. The fixed embryos only shrink during mounting, when the mounting medium is added (Aqua-Poly/Mount).</p><p>In the revised manuscript, we have carried out quantifications to verify that such shrinkage is close to isotropic by nature. We measured the length and width of OreR and <italic>fat2RNAi</italic> embryos, in both live and fixed conditions (n = 239 each condition). We found that the aspect ratio of the OreR embryos remains comparable prior and post fixation (Figure 1—figure supplement 1B-C). This suggests isotropic shrinkage and supports our approach to use aspect ratio of post-fixation embryos to estimate their original embryonic length.</p><p>We do see a smaller aspect ratio of <italic>fat2RNAi</italic> embryos post fixation. However, this can be explained by the differential collection of embryos. While the live condition measurements are carried out on a stereoscope, where we collected <italic>fat2RNAi</italic> embryos spanning all geometrical range, the fix condition measurements are obtained using confocal staining data, where we focused on imaging <italic>fat2RNAi</italic> individuals of extremely short length.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) SDD simulation: I am very confused.</p><p>a) If I use an cylinder to approximate an ellipsoid, then geometrically, the &quot;best approximation&quot; cylinder is surely narrower than the embryo. Not wider. It seems like width is used as a free fitting parameter to make the data fit better, but the text tries to make it sound like this larger-than-actual radius was somehow expected, and I don't understand the argument.</p></disp-quote><p>In the original submission we tried to keep the model as simple as possible, while including 3D effects of embryo size. However, it is clear that our approximation was unhelpful. In the revised manuscript we now perform our simulations on the surface of an ellipsoid – a much better approximation to the embryo geometry.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>b) Further, I believe the diffusion parameters, both in the bulk and at the surface, for a small molecule like Bcd or Hb, were previously measured in the embryo specifically. So it sounds like this could be a zero-parameter fit. How bad is it? Why the discrepancy?</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewer is correct; effectively this is a zero parameter fit. Taking the measured diffusion coefficient and degradation time from Durrieu et al.,2018 and accounting for the eGFP folding time (~50 minutes), we are able to fit reasonably well both the Bcd concentration profile in n.c. 13 for both wild-type and <italic>fat2RNAi</italic> embryos by simply altering the embryo geometry and no other parameters.</p><p>We now present this data more clearly in Figure 1, making assessment of fit quality easier.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>c) And in particular, if using an elliptical geometry truly does not significantly alter the results, why not use it, given that the parameters of the actual geometry are, again, known?</p></disp-quote><p>We have now included the full elliptical solution.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>d) Does the SDD simulation also reproduce the features that the plot of Figure 3G specifically highlights, namely the larger concentration in the posterior and the crossing point? The panel D in Figure 3 supplement does not allow to see this.</p></disp-quote><p>We still observe the crossing point in concentrations between wild type and <italic>fat2RNAi</italic> embryos (when the AP axis is scaled), and the higher Bcd concentration in the posterior for <italic>fat2RNAi</italic> embryos. In the revised Figure 1 this is clearer.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2:</p><p>Huang and Saunders investigate phenotypic variability of bicoid mutant <italic>Drosophila</italic> embryos. Remarkably, they find that in mutant embryos, the number of engrailed stripes and the number of abdominal segments is determined by the length of the embryo. This rule applies to embryos with abnormally short AP axes generated by knockdown of fat2. In contrast, in the presence of Bcd, the correct number of segments always arise, regardless of embryo length, even in fat2 KD embryos. Thus, Bcd is required for scaling of expression patterns to accommodate variation in embryo length. Measurements of Bcd-GFP strongly suggests that this scaling is achieved by reducing the amplitude of the Bcd gradient concomitant with the reduction in egg length. By examining gap gene expression, they show that in short bcd mutant eggs, the distance between anterior and posterior poles must be sufficiently large to permit the expression of the genes Kruppel and knirps. Their data are consistent with a view of the bicoid mutant phenotype in which Torso signaling is not scaled in accord with embryo length, so that terminal signaling in short embryos overrides factor(s) that would otherwise permit the expression of Kr and knirps. Finally, the authors show that excess Bcd also disrupts patterning by interfering with specification in the vicinity of the fourth abdominal segment, with additional segments affected in shorter embryos.</p><p>The work is exciting because it articulates an explanation for phenotypic variability in bcd mutants. The manuscript is significant in showing that the Bcd gradient itself provides a buffer against variation in egg length. The main finding, at least to this reviewer, is that Bcd itself is required for length scaling. The authors should draw greater attention to this result. This result seems consistent with the work of Jun Ma, whose publications should be cited (e.g., doi: 10.1242/dev.064402).</p></disp-quote><p>Our results are consistent with previous studies (Cheung et al., 2011, 2014) showing that the scaling of embryonic patterns can be traced back to the scaling of the Bcd gradient itself. Although the phenomena are similar, the mechanisms underlying the adaptive Bcd gradient formation are different. This is because the macroscopic variable that the patterning system is buffering against is different (volume and geometry, respectively). Embryos adapt to volume variation by altering the amount and distribution of mRNA deposition (Cheung et al., 2011). In our case, geometry changes but not (substantially) volume. In our case, we found that SDD model is sufficient to generate different Bcd profiles in embryos of different geometry without altering any other dynamic parameters. We have improved discussion of this point, and it is included within Figure 1.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Interestingly, scaling occurs in fat2-depleted embryos despite the paradoxical finding of more bcd mRNA upon fat2 KD (Figure 5—figure supplement 1).

The fixation protocol required optimization, which took a few months. We performed FISH on wild-type, <italic>fat2RNAi</italic> and <italic>10</italic>x-<italic>bcd</italic> embryos.

The authors should address how much of this variability arises from variability in egg length. The LlamaTag experiment suggests that at some of the variability originates from differences in egg length (this is clear from the anticorrelation in Figure 3I). If egg length determines boundary positions, then there should be a relationship between egg length and gap gene boundary position in bcd mutants. The degree of correlation might be even stronger in bcd mutants due to the absence of the canalizing activity of Bcd. The authors should plot boundary position for each gap gene boundary as a function of egg length, similar to Figure 3I.</p></disp-quote><p>We have plotted the relative boundary positions against embryonic length for all four gap genes in <italic>bcdKO</italic> and <italic>bcdKO, fat2RNAi</italic> embryos (Figure 6—figure supplement 2).

The main point of Figure 1F-K is to address how the Bcd gradient changes in embryos with altered geometry. My concern is that the presentation of the simulation in the text may appear at first glance incongruent with the figures. In the end I believe the figures are consistent with the text, but I would like some clarification. I imagine what I am requesting will be trivial for the authors to provide, but at the same time very useful and insightful for readers.</p><p>1) The authors state that the same parameter values describe the distribution of fluorescent Bcd-GFP regardless of embryo geometry. Unless I am mistaken, this means that, at steady-state imposed by the model (and using the finding that bcd mRNA doesn't change very much in terms of its total amount), the total amount of Bcd-GFP embryo-wide is equivalent in all embryos regardless of their geometry. Further, the total amounts of fluorescent and non-fluorescent Bcd-GFP are also equivalent. It would be helpful to explicitly state this in the text for those not immediately familiar with modeling and/or may not be aware that the maturation time of GFP is non-negligible in this context.</p></disp-quote><p>Yes, the reviewer interpretation is correct. Because the <italic>fat2RNAi</italic> embryos are bigger in embryonic width than wild-type embryos, the change in volume is not large despite the change in the anterior-posterior length. Therefore, from our model, the total amount of Bcd in the embryos does not change substantially. We have clarified this in the text during discussion of the modelling (subsection “Developmental reproducibility is preserved with a minor impact on scaling under geometrical perturbations”).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Assuming that Bcd-GFP amount is the same in all embryos, a reader will then examine Figure 1G and note that the summed nuclear intensity (or in some sense, the area under the curve) does not appear to be the same in embryos of different sizes. Instead it appears that Bcd-GFP scales with embryo length. This appears to contradict the idea that total BcdGFP is unchanged. However, the authors say that this is due to &quot;dilution&quot; of Bcd-GFP. I interpret this to mean that if one considers an embryo as a set of &quot;salami slices,&quot; then, due to the altered aspect ratio, a slice at some absolute distance from the anterior pole in fat2 KD (or, more generally, in short) embryos has a larger volume compared to a slice at the same distance in wild-type. The apparent reduction in &quot;nuclear concentration&quot; of Bcd-GFP occurs because whatever amount of Bcd-GFP is available at that distance is roughly the same between long and short embryos. This amount distributes into the available volume, so that the apparent concentration of BcdGFP appears lower in fat2 KD. Could the authors please state this more explicitly, if my interpretation is correct. I believe that splitting the long sentence the fifth paragraph of subsection “Developmental reproducibility is preserved with a minor impact on scaling under geometrical perturbations” into two or three sentences will suffice, devoting a sentence or two to each of the two differences (low anterior, high posterior) in the gradients of long and short eggs. This will help the reader to understand why the 1D plot of Bcd-GFP vs AP does not accurately represent the total amount of Bcd and results in the reduction in nuclear intensity in the anterior.</p></disp-quote><p>Yes, the reviewer interpretation is correct. We appreciate the advice on improving the description and we have clarified in the text (subsection “Developmental reproducibility is preserved with a minor impact on scaling under geometrical perturbations”).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Figure 1 presents data and simulation regarding only fluorescent Bcd-GFP. A powerful aspect of the simulation is that it can estimate the quantity that we (and the embryo) actually care about, the distribution of _total_ Bcd. Given the sizable maturation time of 50 minutes used in the simulation, my intuition is that the invisible proportion likely extends over a significantly larger fraction of egg length in short embryos compared to long. However my intuition may well be wrong. Could the authors please present and discuss the estimated _total_ Bcd-GFP distribution as a function of both absolute and normalized distance in embryos of various aspect ratios (lengths)? To my thinking, this is the only way to address the question of how the actual gradient (not just the visible one) changes with changing geometry.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that the relevant readout biologically is the local concentration of mature Bcd protein regardless of the folding state of the tagged GFP. However, we do not have data on the folding time of Bcd protein itself and so it is not straightforward to infer the functional Bcd concentration from the experimental data. In the modelling we now test two different scenarios. First, we assume Bcd folds at the same rate as eGFP, as shown in Figure 1. We also include in Figure 1—figure supplement 1G, the total nuclear Bcd concentration (assuming immediate folding of Bcd) as a function of absolute or normalized embryonic length. The real functional Bcd gradient lies between these two curves.</p><p>Interestingly, the profiles of long and short embryos intersect at a relatively more anterior position when we consider the total Bcd concentration (disregarding protein folding time). Intersection of the profiles now occurs around 25% EL vs. ~40% EL in our observed experimental profiles (which are affected by protein folding rates). To double-check our simulations, we used a simpler cylindrical geometry where we could analytically solve the SDD model to further validate this observation. Taking diffusion to only occur on the body of cylinders of equal surface area (ignoring ends) but different lengths (350um and 500um), we also see an anterior shift in the crossover position when considering the total Bcd concentration, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig1">Author response image 1</xref>. We discuss these results in paragraph five of subsection “Developmental reproducibility is preserved with a minor impact on scaling under geometrical perturbations”.</p><fig id="respfig1"><label>Author response image 1.</label><caption><title>Bcd gradient at steady-state using SDD model on surface of a cylinder (blue: L = 500μm, r = 100μm; red: L =350μm, r = 143μm).</title><p>Bcd is introduced at rate J at the anterior end of the cylinder.

(Could the authors also include error bars on the difference in 1K and in a new plot regarding total concentration?)</p></disp-quote><p>We have replotted Figure 1K to include the experimental data with error bars. We have included a similar plot for the theory in Figure 1—figure supplement 1G. In summary, the parameter of protein folding time does not affect the relative shape of the gradient in long vs short embryos but does alter the relative position where curves intersect.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Moreover, the difference in total Bcd can be converted into a difference in fractional egg length (&quot;positional error&quot;) as a function of normalized AP position, i.e., the difference in the positions at which the same Bcd concentration is found in short eggs compared to long. This difference is zero near the midpoint of the AP axis where the curves cross and becomes larger moving toward either pole. This will give the reader a sense of magnitude of the mistakes in assigning positional identity that we would expect in short embryos if Bcd were the only patterning cue. In turn, these differences can be compared to the changes in the placement of gap gene expression boundaries presented in Figure 2. Are the changes in the Bcd gradient predictive of the changes in boundary placement (in other words, do gap gene boundaries arise at the same Bcd concentration in long and short eggs)? Do gap gene boundaries shift more, less, or the same amount as predicted by the changes in the Bcd gradient? The answers will help address how the altered Bcd gradient in short embryos generates (or works against!) scaling, and how much of the scaling phenomenon must arise independently of the Bcd gradient.</p></disp-quote><p>This is a challenging question to answer. As shown by a number of labs, the positional information transfer from the Bcd gradient to gap gene expression is a dynamic and history dependent process. Liu et al.,2013, have shown that the gap gene boundary positions only correlate with absolute local Bcd concentration at early stages (10 min into n.c. 14), while in late stages (50 min into n.c. 14) the boundary positions depend on combinatorial inputs from maternal gradients and the gap genes themselves. Here Liu et al.perturb the Bcd gradient by altering maternal dosage, which changes mainly the amplitude but not the characteristic length of the gradient. However, how gap gene expression temporally integrates a gradient of different characteristic length (as in this study) remain unclear. Our results (Figure 2) only demonstrate that at late stages, the gap gene boundaries largely recapitulate the wild-type scenario, even with an altered Bcd gradient due to geometrical perturbation. But, providing precise predictions for the gap gene shifts due to Bcd perturbation is difficult without a full model of gap gene formation. We have in fact tried tackling this problem using the model published by Bieler et al., 2011. However, there are many biological and technical challenges in fully modelling such interactions and this represents a new piece of work. Indeed, we have had discussions with modelling groups, such as Manu, to explore this question further. We have added a sentence to the Discussion to highlight this interesting point.</p></body></sub-article></article>
