In this study, we describe a novel function of TAFs in directing genomic occupancy of a transcriptional activator. Using liver-specific inactivation in mice, we show that the TAF4 subunit of TFIID is required for post-natal hepatocyte maturation. TAF4 promotes pre-initiation complex (PIC) formation at post-natal expressed liver function genes and down-regulates a subset of embryonic expressed genes by increased RNA polymerase II pausing. The TAF4–TAF12 heterodimer interacts directly with HNF4A and in vivo TAF4 is necessary to maintain HNF4A-directed embryonic gene expression at post-natal stages and promotes HNF4A occupancy of functional cis-regulatory elements adjacent to the transcription start sites of post-natal expressed genes. Stable HNF4A occupancy of these regulatory elements requires TAF4-dependent PIC formation highlighting that these are mutually dependent events. Local promoter-proximal HNF4A–TFIID interactions therefore act as instructive signals for post-natal hepatocyte differentiation.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.03613.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.03613.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.03613.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>To decode the information contained within a gene, a number of processes need to occur. For example, the DNA sequence that makes up the gene needs to be copied to make a molecule of RNA, which is then translated to build the corresponding protein. The first steps in the manufacture of RNA involve a structure called a ‘pre-initiation complex’ moving an enzyme called RNA polymerase II to the start of the gene that needs to be copied.</p><p>The pre-initiation complex is made up of many types of protein, including a set of proteins called TAFs. However, the way that these proteins work in mammals is not well understood. There are good reasons for this: proteins are often studied by seeing what happens when the protein is removed, but many TAFs are so important that removing them is lethal.</p><p>Alpern et al. have now studied the function of TAF4 by removing this protein from mouse liver cells. This causes severe hypoglycemia (that is, a drop in sugar levels in the blood). Moreover, it seems as if these cells start dying before they become fully mature. In liver cells lacking TAF4, some 1408 genes that are normally turned on just after birth are not properly switched on; these genes are necessary for the metabolic functions of the liver. Furthermore, 776 genes that are normally turned off after birth continue to be expressed. It seems that the absence of TAF4 sometimes disrupts the formation of the pre-initiation complex, which would slow down the production of RNA. However, it can also have the opposite effect by increasing the activity of RNA polymerase II, hence making too many copies of RNA from some genes.</p><p>Alpern et al. also find that TAF4 is needed to allow a protein called HNF4A, which is important in the development of the liver and in controlling metabolism, to interact with over 7000 important DNA sequences. Mutations in HNF4A are responsible for a syndrome known as Maturity Onset of Diabetes in the Young. The next stage in this work will be to explore if these mutations influence the interaction between HNF4A and TAF4, and if they do, whether these changes contribute to this form of diabetes.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.03613.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.03613.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author keywords</title><kwd>developmental biology</kwd><kwd>genomic</kwd><kwd>bioinformatic</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Davidson</surname><given-names>Irwin</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001677</institution-id><institution>Institut National de la Santé et de la Recherche Médicale</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Davidson</surname><given-names>Irwin</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Ligue national contre le cancer</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Davidson</surname><given-names>Irwin</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001665</institution-id><institution>Agence Nationale de la Recherche</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Davidson</surname><given-names>Irwin</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Physical and functional interactions between HNF4A and TAF4 coordinate HNF4A genomic occupancy with pre-initiation complex formation to activate post-natal hepatocyte gene expression.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>TFIID plays a critical role in RNA polymerase II (Pol II) pre-initiation complex (PIC) formation. The TATA-box binding protein (TBP) and 13–14 TBP-associated factors (TAFs) assemble to form TFIID from an association between the ‘core complex’ comprising the TAF4–TAF12 and TAF6–TAF9 histone-fold heterodimers together with TAF5 and a second module comprising TBP, TAF1, TAF2, and TAF7 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Cler et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bieniossek et al., 2013</xref>). The TAF10–TAF8 dimer associates with the core complex, while the role of the TAF10–TAF3 and TAF11–TAF13 dimers is less well described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bieniossek et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>Extensive genetic analysis of TAFs has been performed in yeast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Shen et al., 2003</xref>), but their function in mammalian cells particularly in complex physiological processes remains poorly characterised. The best understood are those of the cell-specific TAF paralogues like TAF7L that plays a critical role in male germ cell development and in adipocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Cheng et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Zhou et al., 2013</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">2014</xref>) or TAF4B essential for male and female fertility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Falender et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Voronina et al., 2007</xref>). In contrast, much less is known about the ubiquitously expressed ‘core’ TAFs. For example, mice carrying loss of function alleles for TAF10, TAF8, TAF7, or TBP die between blastocyst and pre-implantation stages upon depletion of the maternal protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Voss et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Martianov et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Mohan et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Gegonne et al., 2012</xref>). TAF4 and TAF10 have also been analysed in somatic tissues where they are necessary for normal development of the mouse epidermis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Indra et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Fadloun et al., 2007</xref>). In contrast, in adult epidermis, loss of TAF10 has no evident phenotype whereas TAF4 plays a critical role in keratinocyte proliferation acting as a cell autonomous and non-cell autonomous tumour suppressor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Fadloun et al., 2007</xref>).</p><p>Despite these studies, the role of TAFs in physiological processes in vivo remains largely unknown and the molecular basis of their action is poorly characterised. In this study, we show that TAF4 is essential for activation of the post-natal hepatocyte gene expression programme. The TAF4–TAF12 heterodimer interacts with the nuclear receptor HNF4A to promote its binding to conserved and functional cis-regulatory elements located close to the transcription start sites of liver function genes. The stable binding of HNF4A to these elements is thus dependent on concomitant pre-initiation complex formation. These results reveal that HNF4A interaction with the basal transcription machinery controls not only PIC formation but also the occupation of its cognate regulatory elements.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>TAF4 inactivation in hepatocytes leads to cholestatic lesions and early post-natal death associated with hypoglycemia</title><p>Immunofluorescence revealed TAF4 expression in P12 wild-type (WT) hepatocytes, mesenchymal tissues, endothelial and smooth muscle cells around the hepatic veins and arteries, and cholangiocytes lining the bile ducts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>).

Reanalysis of public ES cell data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Liu et al., 2011</xref>) also showed localisation of TAF3 and TAF1 downstream of the TSS, while TBP localised upstream.

In ES cells, 30% of distal TAF3 sites correlated with CTCF occupancy, whereas in liver only 11% correlation was seen (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figures 6—figure supplement 1B,C</xref>). This is not due to differences in analysis procedures, as we independently calculated a 29–31% TAF3–CTCF correlation from the public ES data set (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1C</xref>). In hepatocytes, the TAF3–CTCF correlation was higher at the TSS (0.55) than at distal regions, the opposite of ES cells. A high TAF3–H3K4me3 correlation was observed at distal sites suggesting that this may be a mechanism of recruitment to these sites. Nevertheless, H3K4me3 levels are low at many of these distal TAF3 sites and other recruitment mechanisms cannot be excluded. Comparison of TAF3 genomic occupancy in liver and ES cells identified common and specifically occupied sites at the TSS, reflecting different sets of active promoters in these two cell types. Moreover, many of the distal regions are also unique to each cell type (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1D</xref>). Together these data indicate that TAF3 can be recruited to the genome independently of TBP and PIC formation not only at distal regions but also at the TSS.</p><p>We also noted that TAF3 and H3K4me3 levels did not fully correlate with Pol II occupancy and PIC formation at the most highly expressed genes.

At the <italic>Dio1</italic> gene for example, two HNF4A binding sites were lost in the mutant, but a third was unchanged (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s1">Figure 8—figure supplement 1A</xref>). We therefore asked if the HNF4A sites depleted in the mutant correspond to functionally active sites. Comparison with public adult liver data showed that many depleted HNF4A sites associate with p300, H3K4me1, and H3K27ac, whereas less of the enriched HNF4A sites show this association (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s1">Figure 8—figure supplement 1B</xref>). Previous experiments identified evolutionary conserved HNF4A sites, suggesting they are critical for function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Schmidt et al., 2010</xref>). A subset of HNF4A occupied sites is associated with binding sites for CEBPA, HNF6, and FOXA2 forming cis-regulatory modules (CRMs) many of which are conserved in at least two species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Ballester et al., 2014</xref>). Other sites, designated here as ‘singletons’, correspond to HNF4A occupied sites that are not associated with binding sites for these other factors, although some are also conserved between at least two species. 60% of HNF4A sites depleted upon TAF4 inactivation overlap with CRMs, 16% of which are conserved (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8D</xref>). These CRMs display a higher proportion of sites for three or four factors and many associate with p300, H3K4me1, and H3K27ac (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s1">Figure 8—figure supplement 1B</xref>). In contrast, only 20% of HNF4A sites enriched in the mutant overlap with CRMs of which only 4% are conserved and they show lesser association with active marks. Furthermore, CRMs depleted in the mutant, and in particular those associated with the 487 down-regulated genes, are strongly enriched at the TSS, whereas those with enhanced HNF4A occupancy appear more random although they are so few that there is no statistical significance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8E</xref>). This allowed us to define a set of 296 down-regulated genes where the depleted HNF4A sites are localised between ±10 kb relative to the TSS (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Supplementary file 1</xref>). ChIP-qPCR showed occupancy of CRMs at the <italic>Dio1</italic>, <italic>Slc22a7</italic>, and <italic>Car5a</italic> genes by FOXA2, HNF6, and CEBPA in WT liver, but not in the TAF4 mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s1">Figure 8—figure supplement 1C</xref>). Conversely, at one of the rarer CRMs enriched in the mutant, ChIP-qPCR showed increased HNF4A, CEBPA, and HNF6 occupancy, while that of FOXA2 was not significantly modified. TAF4 is therefore required for occupancy of a set of functional CRMs located close to the TSS explaining the failure to activate HNF4A-regulated liver function genes in the TAF4 mutant.</p><p>We examined HNF4A genomic occupancy at E18.5 compared to neonatal and adult liver profiles. 4353 sites were occupied at E18.5 compared to &gt;65,000 at P12 and &gt;70,000 at P75 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s2">Figure 8—figure supplement 2A</xref>). The reduced HNF4A occupancy at E18.5 is not due to the lack of its expression that is comparable at E18.5 and adult stages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s2">Figure 8—figure supplement 2B</xref>). The E18.5-occupied sites associate with &gt;1800 genes enriched in liver metabolic functions (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Supplementary file 1</xref>). While almost all E18.5-occupied sites were occupied at P12 and P75, subsets of sites show stronger occupation at P12 or P75 compared to other stages. We investigated the occupancy of sites enriched or depleted in the TAF4 mutant at the different developmental stages. A significant proportion of depleted sites maps to those with enriched occupancy at the neonatal stage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s2">Figure 8—figure supplement 2C</xref>). In contrast, around 30% of sites enriched in the mutant show only very low occupancy at other stages. Thus in the absence of TAF4, HNF4A occupies a set of sites the vast majority of which are not normally occupied either in embryonic or adult liver. This suggests that there may be a disorganisation of the chromatin landscape in the TAF4-mutant liver that allows HNF4A accessibility to sites that are not accessible in wild type. TAF4 is therefore necessary to promote normal HNF4A genomic occupancy, in particular of promoter-associated functional CRMs.</p></sec><sec id="s2-10"><title>HNF4A interacts with the TAF4–TAF12 heterodimer</title><p>It has previously been shown that HNF4A interacts physically with TFIID via TBP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Takahashi et al., 2009</xref>). HNF4A correlated with TBP/PIC occupancy at the TSS where HNF4A sites are enriched, but also at distal sites, indicative of functional HNF4A–TFIID interactions in vivo in hepatocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1C</xref>). Diminished TBP recruitment in TAF4 mutant liver may by itself not explain the loss of PIC formation and HNF4A occupancy of the functional TSS-proximal CRMs. We therefore asked whether HNF4A also interacts with TAF4, as loss of this interaction would better explain the observed phenotype. HEK cells were transfected with vectors expressing combinations of HNF4A, full-length mouse, or human TAF4 in the presence or absence of TAF12 and the extracts precipitated with anti-HNF4A antibodies. TAF4 alone and the TAF4–TAF12 heterodimer efficiently co-precipitated with HNF4A compared to the negative controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9A</xref>, lanes 2, 3, and 5 compared to 1 and 4). We also expressed HNF4A along with the C-terminal histone fold-containing region of TAF4. The TAF4(805–1083)–TAF12 heterodimer efficiently co-precipitated with HNF4A compared to the negative control (lanes 8 and 6), however, TAF4(805–1083) alone did not co-precipitate with HNF4A (lane 7) as this short domain is mainly insoluble in the absence of TAF12. As a further control, no co-precipitation of HNF4A with the TAF11–TAF13 histone fold pair was observed (lane 9).

Three major features characterise this phenotype: defective bile duct formation, disorganised hepatocyte epithelium with loss of cell junctions and blood–bile barrier, lack of post-natal gene activation and consequent metabolic abnormalities. Many of these features, indicative of retarded hepatocyte maturation, can be explained by TAF4 acting as a cofactor for HNF4A, an idea that is supported by functional and biochemical data.</p><p>Several features of the TAF4 knockout are observed when HNF4A is inactivated during hepatoblast development, such as disorganisation of the hepatocyte epithelium and liver architecture, loss of cell junctions, and glycogen accumulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Parviz et al., 2003</xref>). While the genes involved in these processes are activated by HNF4A during embryogenesis before TAF4 inactivation, TAF4 is required to maintain their expression as PIC formation and Pol II recruitment at their TSS were diminished at post-natal stages in mutant liver. At most of these genes, however, HNF4A occupancy was not strongly affected by TAF4 inactivation.</p><p>HNF4A is required for post-natal expression of many liver metabolic function genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Hayhurst et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Inoue et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Kyrmizi et al., 2006</xref>). For example, HNF4A is necessary for fatty acid metabolism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Martinez-Jimenez et al., 2010</xref>) and bile acid synthesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Inoue et al., 2006</xref>). In these studies, however, HNF4A inactivation occurred between P35 and P40, while using our mice (carrying a different <italic>Alb</italic>-Cre transgene) TAF4 inactivation is complete by P12 resulting in the loss of HNF4A binding to regulatory elements of at least 296 genes. Consequently, we observe a more severe general loss of liver metabolic functions with many relevant genes amongst these 296 requiring TAF4–HNF4A cooperation. While loss of HNF4A in adults has little effect on the expression of other nuclear receptors such as FXR, PXR, and LXR that play important functions in liver, their expression is strongly diminished in the <italic>Taf4a</italic><sup>hep−/−</sup> liver also contributing to the more severe phenotype.</p><p>Two different situations can thus be defined. At many, but not all, genes activated by HNF4A pre-natally in the presence of TAF4, subsequent TAF4 inactivation leads to diminished PIC formation, but has little effect on HNF4A occupancy of their regulatory elements that persists at post-natal stages. In contrast, TAF4 is required to stably recruit HNF4A to regulatory elements and for PIC formation at post-natal activated genes as both processes are disrupted upon TAF4 inactivation.</p><p>Our data also define for the first time the full scope of HNF4A in maintaining the integrity of the hepatocyte epithelium acquired during embryogenesis and in activation of the post-natal gene expression programme. In previous studies not all of these functions were observed due to the inappropriate timing of HNF4A inactivation that was either too early or too late to reveal them. While loss of HNF4A function accounts for many aspects of the TAF4 phenotype, we do not exclude that TAF4 may act as a cofactor for other transcription factors, for example RPBJ-NCID involved in bile duct morphogenesis.</p><p>In addition to the above functional data, biochemical data also support the idea that TAF4 acts as a cofactor for HNF4A. Epitope-tagged HNF4A can precipitate TFIID (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Takahashi et al., 2009</xref>). We also show a correlation between HNF4A, TBP/TFIID, and PIC occupancy at distal sites, possibly enhancers, indicative of functional HNF4A–TFIID interactions in vivo. While this may in part be accounted for by interaction of the HNF4A-DBD with TBP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Takahashi et al., 2009</xref>), we show that HNF4A also interacts with the TAF4–TAF12 heterodimer via its LBD. HNF4A directly forms a complex with the histone fold-containing regions of TAF4–TAF12 when co-expressed in bacteria. In the absence of TAF4, HNF4A occupancy of TSS-proximal CRMs and/or PIC formation are compromised strongly suggesting that two direct HNF4A–TFIID interactions via the TAF4–TAF12 heterodimer and TBP are required to activate liver function genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9D</xref>). An analogous mechanism has been described where TAF4 acts as a cofactor for E-proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Chen et al., 2013</xref>). E-proteins interact with the TAFH domain of TAF4 as opposed to the histone-fold region for HNF4A, and this interaction enhances TFIID binding to the core promoter. Our data are consistent with a model where stable binding of HNF4A to TSS proximal CRMs and PIC formation require HNF4A–TFIID interactions. The concomitant loss of PIC formation and CRM occupancy upon TAF4 inactivation indicates that they are mutually dependent events.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Effect of TFIID disassembly on transcription</title><p>Given the essential role of TAF4 in TFIID core assembly, the lack of TAF4b to compensate for its absence, and the reduced TBP-TAF co-precipitation, it is likely that TFIID integrity is disrupted in mutant hepatocytes, with the residual TBP-TAF co-precipitation reflecting the presence of intact TFIID in the cell types where TAF4 remains expressed. A similar conclusion was drawn when TAF10 that is also essential for TFIID integrity was inactivated in adult liver (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Tatarakis et al., 2008</xref>). TAF10 inactivation occurred later than TAF4 in this study and despite TFIID disassembly, a milder phenotype is observed as <italic>Taf10</italic><sup>hep−/−</sup> animals die at P35–P38. Upon TAF10 inactivation, recruitment of TBP and TAFs to many promoters is lost but PIC formation was not affected suggesting that transcription persists in the absence of TBP/TFIID. In contrast, we show that TBP (and TAF1, unpublished data) is recruited to promoters of expressed genes, and its recruitment and PIC formation are diminished to comparable extents. Moreover, TAF3 promoter occupancy at expressed genes is less affected. While loss of TFIID integrity compromises TBP occupancy and PIC formation, interaction with H3K4me3 acts to stabilise TAF3 recruitment independently of TBP. We therefore find no evidence for PIC formation and gene expression in the absence of TBP and TAF3 recruitment in the TAF4 mutant hepatocytes.</p><p>TAF4 regulates hepatocyte gene expression by controlling HNF4A occupancy, PIC formation, and Pol II pausing. Expression of subset of embryonic genes is up-regulated in the absence of TAF4 due to decreased Pol II pausing, although it is also possible that changes in RNA stability may also contribute to the observed increase in mRNA abundance. Why TAF4 regulates pausing at this set of genes remains to be determined, although we note that they are enriched in short intron-less genes. Also it has been previously described that TAF7 has a negative effect on CDK9 and BRD4 activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Devaiah et al., 2010</xref>). Perhaps defective recruitment of TAF7 at these genes due to compromised TFIID integrity would explain the augmented CDK9 recruitment and an increase in its kinase activity would account for the enhanced elongation. Nevertheless, our observations show that down-regulation of many of these genes normally occurs at least initially through increased Pol II-pausing at post-natal stages, while in the absence of TAF4 they continue to be expressed with higher levels of elongating Pol II as in their embryonic mode. We also observed diminished paused Pol II at a small subgroup of highly expressed liver identity genes that may be under the control of ‘super enhancers’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Whyte et al., 2013</xref>), where TAF3 and H3K4me3 levels were also reduced. This concomitant reduction suggests that TAF3/H3K4me3 levels may modulate Pol II pausing at this class of genes.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="conclusion"><title>Conclusion</title><p>We show that TAF4 is essential for activation of the post-natal hepatocyte gene expression programme acting as a cofactor for HNF4A.

Global clustering analysis and quantitative comparisons were performed using seqMINER (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://bips.u-strasbg.fr/seqminer/">http://bips.u-strasbg.fr/seqminer/</ext-link>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Ye et al., 2011</xref>) and R (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.r-project.org/">http://www.r-project.org/</ext-link>) and visualized using <italic>ggplot2</italic> package. Genomic region annotation was performed with either seqMINER or GREAT (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://bejerano.stanford.edu/great/public/html/">http://bejerano.stanford.edu/great/public/html/</ext-link>). Overlap between HNF4A-binding sites that are enhanced or depleted in TAF4-mutant liver and CRMs was performed by intersecting the corresponding genomic coordinates.</p></sec><sec id="s5-3"><title>Extract preparation, immunoprecipitation, and Western blot</title><p>Liver nuclei extracts were made as follows. Livers were homogenized by douncing in cold hypotonic buffer with 25 mM HEPES, pH 7.8, 1.5 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 10 mM KCl, and 0.1% NP-40, supplemented with Protease Inhibitor Cocktail (Roche, Basel, Switzerland) and DTT. Nuclei were washed twice in cold hypotonic buffer followed by centrifugation (3000 rpm, 5 min) and lysed in 50 mM Tris–HCl, pH 7.5, 450 mM NaCl, 0.5% NP40, 5% glycerol for 2 hr on 4°C with constant rotation. Detection was performed using the same antibodies as for ChIP or previously described in house antibodies against TBP and TAFs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Gangloff et al., 2001</xref>). TAFs, HNF4A, CDK9, Pol II, and TBP were revealed with the antibodies described elsewhere in the ‘Materials and methods’. Immunoprecipitation was performed overnight with anti-TBP (3G3) or anti-HA as control.</p></sec><sec id="s5-4"><title>Histochemistry and immunofluorescence</title><p>Livers were fixed at 4°C for 16 hr in 4% paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), washed overnight in PBS, and embedded in paraffin. For immunofluorescence 10 µm sections were treated in a microwave oven in citrate buffer pH 6.0 for 15 min at 150 W. Staining was performed with primary anti-TAF4 (sc-136093) and anti-HNF4A (sc-6556) from Santa Cruz, Claudin3 (ab15102) and TBP (ab51841) from Abcam, Sox9 (AB5535) from Chemicon, anti-aSMA (M0851) from DAKO, TJP1 from Invitrogen (Carlsbad, CA) (339100), KI67 from Novocastra (Nussloch, Germany) (NCL-KI67P). Nuclei were counterstained with Hoechst. For histological analysis, sections were stained with Hematoxylin and Eosin, Red Oil O, and <italic>Periodic</italic> acid–<italic>Schiff</italic> (PAS) following the standard procedures.</p></sec><sec id="s5-5"><title>Bacterial co-expression of TAF4, TAF12, and HNF4 and complex purification</title><p>Full length HNF4A and its indicated deletion mutants, the histone-fold containing fragments of human TAF4 (805–1083) and (832–966) and TAF12 (29–161), were cloned into the His-Tag vector pEA-tH and/or the native pCS vector (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Diebold et al., 2011</xref>). <italic>E. coli</italic> BL21 cells were transformed with respective vectors and colonies were used to grow 15 ml cultures at 37°C till the OD600 = 0.4. Protein expression was induced by IPTG and cultures were grown at 25°C overnight. Cells were resuspended in 1.5 ml of lysis buffer (10 mM Tris–HCl, pH 8.0 and 50 mM, 200 mM or 400 mM NaCl) and sonicated. After the centrifugation, the supernatants were incubated with TALON resin for two hours at 4°C with the permanent agitation. The resin was washed twice with 1 ml of ice-cold lysis buffer and resuspended in 25 µl of Laemmli buffer. Samples were analysed by SDS-PAGE with subsequent Coomassie brilliant blue staining.</p></sec><sec id="s5-6"><title>RNA extraction and quantitative real-time RT-PCR</title><p>Total RNA was extracted with the RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen, Venlo, Holland) following the manufacturer's instructions and treated with RNase-free DNase (Fermentas). RNA (3 μg) was reverse transcribed by using a Maxima Kit (Fermantas, Pitsburgh, PA). The final product was then diluted 10 times and 2 μl were mixed with forward and reverse primers (250 nM of each primer at final concentration) and 5 μl of SYBR Green master mix (Qiagen). The real-time PCR reaction was performed by using the LightCycler 1.5 system (Roche). Each cDNA sample was tested at least in triplicate.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We thank I Michel for excellent technical assistance, Dr N Engelhardt and Dr N Lazarevich for monoclonal antibodies and HNF4A expression vector respectively; Dr P Jacquemin for advice and comments, all staff of the IGBMC and ICS common services in particular the sequencing and bioinformatics platform.

Your article has been favorably evaluated by Stylianos Antonarakis (Senior editor) and 3 reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors.</p><p>The following individuals responsible for the peer review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Michael R Green (Reviewing editor), Robert Roeder (one of the two other reviewers).</p><p>The Reviewing editor and the other reviewers discussed their comments before we reached this decision, and the Reviewing editor has assembled the following comments to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>This manuscript elaborates a specific TAF4 requirement for liver development and functions that reflects a major contribution to the HNF4a-mediated genomic program. By using a liver-specific TAF4 mutant mouse line, the authors observed several severe liver failures in P12 to P21 mice that led to lethality. RNA-seq analysis suggest that a subset of liver functional genes are deregulated in TAF4 mutant mice. Using genome-wide ChIP-seq assays, the authors further show that TAF4 inactivation diminishes PIC formation and attenuates HNF4a occupancy on a subset of post-natally expressed genes in liver. Finally, in a biochemical analysis the authors show a direct interaction between HNF4a and the TAF4/TAF12 dimer that may explain the impaired HNF4a occupancy of its targets in TAF4 mutant mice.</p><p>Overall, the results presented in this manuscript provide substantial evidence for the physiological functions of a TAF subunit that is specifically required for HNF4a-controlled gene expression related to liver function. Although previous studies have shown a TAF10 subunit requirement for liver function and TAF coactivator functions in cell-based assays, the current manuscript provides significant new evidence for physiological TAF coactivator functions by showing, first, a TAF4 function in the genome-wide occupancy of a TAF4-interacting activator and, second, a mechanism involving direct interactions.</p><p>However, the three reviewers have a number of specific concerns and the authors are encouraged to address as many of these as possible with experimentation and/or textual revisions as appropriate.</p><p>Major specific comments:</p><p>1) The main conclusion that Taf4 is a cofactor for Hnf4a during liver maturation is not supported by the data provided in this paper. Although the authors show that the Taf4-Taf12 heterodimer interacts with Hnf4a when the recombinant proteins are expressed in E. coli, these data do not support a physiological interaction of these two proteins during liver maturation. Additionally, due to the fact that Hnf4a has been previously shown to directly interact with TBP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Takahashi et al 2009</xref>), and the data in this paper show that TBP does not interact with the TFIID complex properly when Taf4 is conditionally knocked out, and TBP is obsolete from the majority of its genomic binding locations in the Taf4 depleted livers, it seems appropriate for the authors to conclude that the mis-localization of Hnf4a at its genomic binding sites in the Taf4 depleted livers results from a secondary effect (improper TFIID assembly which results in a loss of TBP at Hnf4a target genes).</p><p>2) Another explanation for the altered genomic binding locations of Hnf4a in Taf4 depleted livers may be that the loss of Taf4 results in altered genomic locations of other Hnf4a cofactors. Several other cofactors have been identified for Hnf4a, including CBP/p300. It would add to the breadth of the paper, and allow for a more succinct conclusion to be made about the disrupted genomic binding of Hnf4a in the Taf4-/- livers, if analysis was performed to determine whether or not CBP/p300 or other Hnf4a cofactors are lost at Hnf4a binding locations when Taf4 is conditionally ablated.</p><p>3) In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>, the authors observed a reduction of TSS-bound Pol II (paused) in the up-regulated gene subset. The explanation offered is that TAF4 inactivation increases the recruitment of CDK9 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D</xref>), leading in turn to release of paused Pol II and increased gene expression. However, it also is noted that PIC formation is diminished on those genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>). Could the authors provide a possible mechanism for reduced PIC formation leading to enhance CDK9 recruitment and Pol II release?</p><p>4) In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>, the authors show increased Pol II occupancy for a few up-regulated genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B and C</xref>). However the Pol II metaprofile (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>) does not show a significant enhancement for up-regulated genes. Since the RNA-seq measures accumulated mRNA molecules, other mechanisms, such as mRNA stability, should be discussed.</p><p>5) In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>, it is noted that TAF4 inactivation globally diminishes the occupancies of TBP, TFIIB, TFIIE and H3K4Me3, but has less effect on TAF3 binding. Is this observed variation in TAF3 binding due to an alternative chromatin fragmentation method used for TAF3 ChIP or is there something unique about TAF3 relative to TFIID-specific TAFs? Was any other TAF analyzed?</p><p>6) In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9B</xref>, an analysis of HNF4a-enriched sites should be added as well.</p><p>7) The authors should discuss how a GTF (TAF4) recruits a sequence-specific DNA binding protein (HNF4A). The more general model is that the sequence-specific DNA binding protein recruits the GTF. Likewise, the authors should discuss what might be the basis of occupancy of HNF4A at new sites in the absence of TAF4.</p><p>8) In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>, what is the criterion used (e.g., distance from TSS) for association between HNF4A and a gene?</p><p>9) In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref> the authors need to explain in the Results section how paused pol II downstream of the transcription start-site is distinguished from the pol II of the PIC.</p><p>10) The authors conclude that down-regulation is due to defective PIC formation, while up-regulation of many genes reflects decreased pausing and increased elongating Pol II and CDK9 recruitment. Do the authors have any ideas as to how TAF4 can act in such a dual fashion and the basis by which TAF4 behaves so differently at down and up regulated genes?</p><p>11) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D</xref>. Have the authors performed a similar experiment measuring CDK9 recruitment for up-regulated genes?</p><p>12) The TAF3 results, although interesting, don't really connect well with the major conclusions of this study, which are TAF4, HNF4A and liver development. This reviewer at least found these to be a distraction. The authors might consider removing these experiments or at least de-emphasizing them by for example moving them to supplemental.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.03613.021</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>1) The main conclusion that Taf4 is a cofactor for Hnf4a during liver maturation is not supported by the data provided in this paper.

This is why we illustrated this in our summary model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9E</xref> in the original version of the paper). Also in the Discussion section we stated ‘While this may in part be accounted for by HNF4A-TBP interactions, we show that HNF4A also interacts with the TAF4-TAF12 heterodimer.’ We also stated ‘…strongly suggesting that direct HNF4A-TFIID interactions via the TAF4-TAF12 heterodimer and perhaps also TBP are required to activate liver function genes.’ Thus, we did not want to imply that the HNF4A-TAF4-TAF12 interaction was the only one involved. We have modified the text of the revised Discussion section to try and make this clearer.</p><p>Furthermore, we now show in new data added in the new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref> of the revised version that TAF4-TAF12 interacts with the LBD of HNF4A. This is complementary to the TBP-DBD interaction reported by Takahashi et al. These new data indicate that HNF4A can make contacts with TFIID both through its DBD and its LBD. Indeed, as the referees point out the defective TFIID assembly in the mutant suggests that interactions with TBP may contribute to, but are not sufficient for HNF4A recruitment and PIC assembly and that multiple interactions with TFIID through TBP and the associated TAF4-TAF12 are necessary. The new data have been added to the text and the Discussion section has been modified. We believe that this new data strengthens our original findings of HNF4A-TAF4-TAF12 interactions.</p><p><italic>2) Another explanation for the altered genomic binding locations of Hnf4a in Taf4 depleted livers may be that the loss of Taf4 results in altered genomic locations of other Hnf4a cofactors. Several other cofactors have been identified for Hnf4a, including CBP/p300. It would add to the breadth of the paper, and allow for a more succinct conclusion to be made about the disrupted genomic binding of Hnf4a in the Taf4-/- livers, if analysis was performed to determine whether or not CBP/p300 or other Hnf4a cofactors are lost at Hnf4a binding locations when Taf4 is conditionally ablated</italic>.</p><p>Based on the suggestion of the referees, we have attempted to perform anti-p300 ChIP-qPCR experiments, but we saw little enrichment even at HNF4A-occupied sites where public ChIPseq data shows that p300 should be present. While this is probably a technical issue that would take some time to resolve, we would like to stress however that in the original manuscript, we showed that Cebpa, Foxa2 and Hnf6 were all depleted along with Hnf4a at CRMs (Figure 9–figure supplement 1). As it is the activators that recruit the co-activators rather than the co-activators that recruit the activators, it would seem highly unlikely that changes in p300 recruitment are the principal cause of the lost HNF4Aa binding. In addition, our new data showing that TAF4-TAF12 interacts with the HNF4a LBD reinforce the idea that a specific interaction with HNF4A is the important one.</p><p><italic>3) In</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7"><italic>Figure 7A</italic></xref><italic>, the authors observed a reduction of TSS-bound Pol II (paused) in the up-regulated gene subset. The explanation offered is that TAF4 inactivation increases the recruitment of CDK9 (</italic><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7"><italic>Figure 7D</italic></xref><italic>), leading in turn to release of paused Pol II and increased gene expression. However, it also is noted that PIC formation is diminished on those genes (</italic><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6"><italic>Figure 6A</italic></xref><italic>). Could the authors provide a possible mechanism for reduced PIC formation leading to enhance CDK9 recruitment and Pol II release?</italic></p><p>For the moment, we do not have a specific mechanism that would explain this. As it is likely that TFIID integrity is compromised, perhaps the presence of TAF4 or other TAFs at these promoters that is lost in the mutant, has a negative effect on CDK9 recruitment. It has been previously described by the Singer lab that TAF7 has a negative effect on CDK9 and BRD4 activity. Perhaps defective recruitment of TAF7 at these genes due to compromised TFIID integrity would explain the augmented CDK9 recruitment and an increase in its kinase activity would account for the enhanced elongation. We did not discuss this as we have no ChIP-grade TAF7 antibody that allows us to test the idea. Also enhanced elongation is not a general effect, but is limited to a sub-set of genes. We originally investigated whether these promoters had some common feature (TATA+, or TATA-less for example), but so far we have not identified any common feature of this subset of promoters. We have included a discussion of this in the revised version.</p><p><italic>4) In</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7"><italic>Figure 7</italic></xref><italic>, the authors show increased Pol II occupancy for a few up-regulated genes (</italic><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7"><italic>Figure 7B and C</italic></xref>)<italic>. However the Pol II metaprofile (</italic><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7"><italic>Figure 7A</italic></xref><italic>) does not show a significant enhancement for up-regulated genes. Since the RNA-seq measures accumulated mRNA molecules, other mechanisms, such as mRNA stability, should be discussed</italic>.</p><p>We fully agree with the referees and we have added a word factor in the revised version on the possibility of changes in mRNA stability as a contributing factor.</p><p><italic>5) In</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6"><italic>Figure 6A</italic></xref><italic>, it is noted that TAF4 inactivation globally diminishes the occupancies of TBP, TFIIB, TFIIE and H3K4Me3, but has less effect on TAF3 binding. Is this observed variation in TAF3 binding due to an alternative chromatin fragmentation method used for TAF3 ChIP or is there something unique about TAF3 relative to TFIID-specific TAFs? Was any other TAF analyzed?</italic></p><p>In fact TAF3 was the not only protein that we analysed by MNaseI digestion. TBP was also analysed in this way. We have corrected the Materials and methods section to clarify this point as it was not correctly described in the original version. The classic sonication method does not work with our anti-TAF3 antibody and this is why MNaseI was used, while for TBP, ChIP is much more efficient with MNaseI than sonication. Thus, it is not the chromatin fragmentation method that accounts for the lesser effect seen with TAF3. We rather propose that the high affinity of TAF3 for H3K4me3, a unique feature of TAF3 relative to other TAFs, accounts for the observed data.</p><p><italic>6) In</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9"><italic>Figure 9B</italic></xref><italic>, an analysis of HNF4a-enriched sites should be added as well</italic>.</p><p>We have added this additional analysis requested by the referees (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8C</xref> in the new version of the paper). In our new analysis, we show that these sites have no specific location, in particular no striking enrichment at the TSS as seen with depleted sites, although a small number are associated with up-regulated genes. This small set perhaps corresponds to sites that are occupied during embryogenesis and normally lost in neonatal liver, but not in the mutant. The vast majority of sites are however not in this category. It is more likely that there is a more general disorganisation of the chromatin landscape in the mutant liver and that this allows accessibility to sites that are not normally accessible to HNF4A. The text has been modified accordingly.</p><p><italic>7) The authors should discuss how a GTF (TAF4) recruits a sequence-specific DNA binding protein (HNF4A). The more general model is that the sequence-specific DNA binding protein recruits the GTF. Likewise, the authors should discuss what might be the basis of occupancy of HNF4A at new sites in the absence of TAF4</italic>.</p><p>In the Discussion section of the paper, we tried to emphasize that PIC formation and HNF4A binding are mutually dependent events. Our data are consistent with a model where stable binding of HNF4A to TSS proximal CRMs requires interaction with TFIID and PIC formation. Mutual interactions between HNF4A and TFIID stabilise both PIC formation and CRM occupancy, without PIC formation HNF4A does not stably bind to its binding sites. In our data we showed that a majority of sites occupied in absence of TAF4 are not normally occupied either during embryogenesis or in adult liver. As mentioned above, sites enriched in the TAF4 mutant have no specific location although a small number are associated with upregulated genes. This small set perhaps corresponds to sites that are occupied during embryogenesis and normally lost in neonatal liver, but not in the mutant. The vast majority of sites are however not in this category. It is more likely that there is a more general disorganisation of the chromatin landscape in the mutant liver and that this allows accessibility to sites that are not accessible to HNF4A.</p><p><italic>8) In</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9"><italic>Figure 9</italic></xref><italic>, what is the criterion used (e.g., distance from TSS) for association between HNF4A and a gene?</italic></p><p>In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref> (new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>) we used a window of +/-40 kb with respect to the TSS. This was indicated in the figure and in the figure legend, but not in the text. This has been corrected.</p><p><italic>9) In</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7"><italic>Figure 7A</italic></xref> <italic>the authors need to explain in the Results section how paused pol II downstream of the transcription start-site is distinguished from the pol II of the PIC</italic>.</p><p>We do not understand exactly what the referees are referring to here. It is now well established that ‘paused’ Pol II accumulates around 50 nucleotides downstream of the TSS at a large number of promoters. This is what is visualized in the ChIP-seq experiments.</p><p><italic>10) The authors conclude that down-regulation is due to defective PIC formation, while up-regulation of many genes reflects decreased pausing and increased elongating Pol II and CDK9 recruitment. Do the authors have any ideas as to how TAF4 can act in such a dual fashion and the basis by which TAF4 behaves so differently at down and up regulated genes?</italic></p><p>This is related to comments 3 and 7.

Have the authors performed a similar experiment measuring CDK9 recruitment for up-regulated genes?</italic></p><p>I presume that the referees are referring to ‘down-regulated’ genes, as up-regulated genes were already shown in the original manuscript. Yes, we had performed these experiments and there is no enhanced CDK9 recruitment at down-regulated genes. We have now included one example in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D</xref> to illustrate this.</p><p><italic>12) The TAF3 results, although interesting, don't really connect well with the major conclusions of this study, which are TAF4, HNF4A and liver development. This reviewer at least found these to be a distraction. The authors might consider removing these experiments or at least de-emphasizing them by for example moving them to supplemental</italic>.</p><p>We fully agree with the comment of the referees: the TAF3 data are interesting but not central to the story. We have therefore moved these data into the supplemental section, new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6–figure supplement 1</xref>, thus allowing addition of the new co-expression data that has been moved to a new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>, without increasing the overall number of figures.</p></body></sub-article></article>
