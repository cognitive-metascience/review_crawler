of H3K27 (H3K27me3), and paradoxically, H3K27me3 peaks remain at hundreds of genomic loci, a dichotomous change that lacks mechanistic insights. Here, we show that the PRC2 complex is sequestered at poised enhancers, but not at active promoters with high levels of H3.3K27M proteins, thereby contributing to the global reduction of H3K27me3. Moreover, the levels of H3.3K27M proteins are low at the retained H3K27me3 peaks and consequently having minimal effects on the PRC2 activity at these loci. H3K27me3-mediated silencing at specific tumor suppressor genes, including Wilms Tumor 1, promotes proliferation of DIPG cells. These results support a model in which the PRC2 complex is redistributed to poised enhancers in H3.3K27M mutant cells and contributes to tumorigenesis in part by locally enhancing H3K27me3, and hence silencing of tumor suppressor genes.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>diffuse intrinsic pontine glioma</kwd><kwd>H3.3K27M</kwd><kwd>PRC2</kwd><kwd>H3K27me3</kwd><kwd>tumor suppressor gene</kwd><kwd>WT1</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>CA204297</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Zhang</surname><given-names>Zhiguo</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Redistribution of the PRC2 complex in H3.3K27M mutant cells to poised enhancers contributes to the global reduction of H3K27me3 in cells expressing the mutant proteins.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Diffuse intrinsic pontine glioma (DIPG) is the most aggressive primary malignant brain tumor found in children (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Jones and Baker, 2014</xref>). The median survival time after diagnosis is approximately one year with no cure in sight (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Dellaretti et al., 2012</xref>). Recent studies have identified, in more than 75% of DIPG cases, a somatic mutation of the <italic>H3F3A</italic> gene, leading to a lysine 27 to methionine mutation at histone H3 variant H3.3 (H3.3K27M) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Castel et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Schwartzentruber et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Sturm et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Wu et al., 2012</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">2014</xref>). In addition, <italic>HIST1H3B</italic> or <italic>HIST1H3C</italic>, one of the 13 genes encoding canonical histone H3.1/H3.2, is also mutated, resulting in the same K to M change in a small fraction of DIPG tumors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Castel et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Fontebasso et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Solomon et al., 2016</xref>). However, it remains largely unknown how the histone H3K27M mutation drives epigenetic changes and tumorigenesis.</p><p>H3.3 is a histone H3 variant that differs from H3.1/H3.2 by only four or five amino acid residues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Campos and Reinberg, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Maze et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Szenker et al., 2011</xref>). Compared to canonical histone H3.1/H3.2 that is assembled into nucleosomes in a replication-coupled process, histone variant H3.3 is assembled into nucleosomes in a replication-independent manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Ahmad and Henikoff, 2002a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Tagami et al., 2004</xref>). H3.3 has diverse functions including epigenetic memory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Ng and Gurdon, 2008</xref>), heterochromatin formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Banaszynski et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Rai et al., 2014</xref>), silencing of endogenous retroviral elements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Elsässer et al., 2015</xref>), and gene transcription (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Ahmad and Henikoff, 2002b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Chen et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Deaton et al., 2016</xref>). Genome-wide analysis of H3.3 distribution reveals that H3.3 is enriched at gene promoter and gene body of actively transcribed genes compared to lowly expressed genes. Moreover, H3.3 is also localized at gene regulatory elements including promoters and enhancers. The distinct distributions of H3.3 likely contribute to the diverse roles of H3.3 in cells.</p><p>H3K27 can be mono-, di- and tri-methylated (H3K27me1/me2/me3). H3K27me2/me3 is catalyzed by the Polycomb Repressive Complex 2 (PRC2) and plays an important role in the repression of developmentally regulated genes during development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Banaszynski et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cao et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Margueron and Reinberg, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Simon and Kingston, 2013</xref>). H3K27me3 is enriched at promoters of silenced genes. Moreover, low levels of H3K27me3 are also detected at poised enhancers along with H3K4me1 in mouse and human embryonic stem (ES) cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Creyghton et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Rada-Iglesias et al., 2011</xref>) as well as bivalent chromatin domains containing H3K4me3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bernstein et al., 2006</xref>). The PRC2 complex consists of four core subunits (Ezh2, Suz12, EED, and RbAP46/48), and methylates preferentially nucleosomal histone H3K27.</p><p>We and others have found that H3K27me3 levels are dramatically reduced in DIPG cells as well as other tested cell types or organisms expressing H3.3K27M mutant proteins, including mice and <italic>Drosophila</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bender et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chan et al., 2013a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">2013b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Funato et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Herz et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Lewis et al., 2013</xref>). However, it remains in a debate on how H3.3K27M mutant proteins lead to a global reduction of H3K27me3 in cells. Several studies support a model that H3.3K27M mutant proteins may trap the PRC2 complex and lead to a global reduction of H3K27me3. For instance, it has been shown that, <italic>in vitro</italic>, PRC2 complex binds to H3K27M peptides with high affinity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Jayaram et al., 2016</xref>), and H3K27M peptides or mononucleosomes inhibit the enzymatic activity of PRC2 complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Jayaram et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Jiao and Liu, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Justin et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Lewis et al., 2013</xref>). Moreover, Ezh2 is enriched at H3.3K27M mononucleosomes compared to wild type H3.3 mononucleosomes isolated from cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bender et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chan et al., 2013a</xref>). However, this model has been challenged by several recent observations. For instance, using ChIP-seq, it has been shown that H3.3K27M mutant proteins co-localize with active histone mark H3K27ac where the PRC2 complex should be absent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Piunti et al., 2017</xref>). Moreover, the PRC2 complex binds H3K27M mononucleosomes with equal affinity as wild type nucleosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Herz et al., 2014</xref>). Therefore, additional studies are needed to help resolve the current debate.</p><p>In addition to the global loss of H3K27me3, we and others observed that H3K27me3 is retained or elevated at the promoters of a small coterie of genes in DIPG xenograft cell lines harboring H3.3K27M mutation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bender et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chan et al., 2013a</xref>). Moreover, gene etiology analysis indicates that these genes are enriched in cancer pathways. We proposed that this locus-specific gain/retention of H3K27me3 acts together with the more general decline of H3K27me3 to promote tumorigenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chan et al., 2013a</xref>). Supporting this model, it has been shown that Ezh2 is required for tumorigenesis of DIPG in a mouse model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Mohammad et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Piunti et al., 2017</xref>). It has been shown that Ezh2 and H3K27me3 silence the tumor suppressor gene (TSG) p16 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Cordero et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Mohammad et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Piunti et al., 2017</xref>). However, it is unknown how H3K27me3 at these genes such as p16 is retained or gained in cells expressing H3.3K27M mutant proteins and whether other TSGs are also silenced via H3K27me3-mediated mechanism.</p><p>Here, we report a surprising observation that the PRC2 complex is sequestered at poised enhancers, but not at active promoters containing high levels of H3.3K27M mutant proteins. We propose that the poised enhancers but not active promoters possess a mechanism for the initial recruitment of the PRC2 complex. Once recruited, the H3.3K27M mutant proteins will help sequester the PRC2 complex to these sites, which reduces the availability of the PRC2 complex at other sites and thereby leads to a global reduction of H3K27me3. Moreover, the phenomenon of sustained or enhanced accumulation of H3K27me3 is detected in DIPG xenograft cell lines and one primary tumor sample, harboring the H3.3K27M mutation. Further, H3.3K27M mutant proteins associated with these H3K27me3 are low or absent, consequently having little effects on the activity of the PRC2 complex at these sites. Finally, we report that H3K27me3-mediated silencing of Wilms Tumor 1 (WT1) gene supports the proliferation of DIPG cells.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>H3.3K27M mutant proteins are enriched at highly expressed genes in both DIPG cells as well as mouse ES cells knocked-in with the H3.3K27M mutation</title><p>To understand how the reduction of H3K27me3 occurs in DIPG cells, SF7761 and SF8628, which contain a heterozygous mutation at <italic>H3F3A</italic> gene, replacing H3.3 lysine 27 with methionine (K27M), we analyzed the localization of H3.3K27M mutant proteins using H3K27M-specific antibody (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>).

We chose mouse ES cells because it is relatively easier to introduce the site-specific mutation. Moreover, the localizations of H3.3 and H3K27me3 have been studied extensively before (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Banaszynski et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Goldberg et al., 2010</xref>).

In contrast, H3K27me2 and H3K27me3 levels, while detectable in high amounts of cell extracts, were reduced dramatically in H3.3K27M mutant cells compared to wild type cells. Moreover, the reduction of H3K27me2/me3 in each of the H3.3K27M mutant ES cell clone is unlikely due to the reduced levels of the PRC2 complex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1F</xref>).</p><p>We next analyzed the chromatin distribution of H3.3K27M using ChIP-seq in wild type and these H3.3K27M mutant mouse ES clones.

H3.3K27M mutant proteins in H3.3K27M mutant ES cells were also enriched at promoters and gene bodies of actively transcribed genes compared to lowly expressed genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>), a pattern that resembles wild type H3.3 in mouse ES cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Goldberg et al., 2010</xref>). Together, these results indicate that H3.3K27M mutant proteins are high at the promoters of actively transcribed genes in both DIPG lines and mouse ES cells with the H3.3K27M mutation. Because the PRC2 complex in general is not localized at highly expressed genes, these results support the idea that the PRC2 complex is unlikely trapped at places with high levels of H3.3K27M mutant proteins and high gene activities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Piunti et al., 2017</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Ezh2 is redistributed to poised enhancers without methylating H3K27 at these sites in mutant mouse ES cells</title><p>To understand how the expression of H3.3K27M mutant proteins results in reduced levels of H3K27me3, we first analyzed Ezh2 and H3K27me3 ChIP-seq peak numbers in wild type and H3.3K27M mutant mouse ES cells, an analysis not feasible for DIPG cells due to a lack of matched controls.

Specifically, 40% of the overlapped Ezh2 peaks between two H3.3K27M mutant clones were unique in H3.3K27M mutant mouse ES cells, and were not detected in wild type mouse ES cells using the same cut off. In contrast, the number of H3K27me3 peaks, majority of which overlapped with those in wild type ES cells, is far less in H3.3K27M mutant ES cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). This result suggests that Ezh2 proteins, most likely the PRC2 complexes, are redistributed to new locations but do not generate new H3K27me3 peaks in H3.3K27M mutant mouse ES cells.</p><p>To gain insights of the properties of Ezh2 ChIP-seq peaks in H3.3K27M mutant mouse ES cells, we first separated 6,658 Ezh2 ChIP-seq peaks identified in H3.3K27M mutant cells into two groups, peaks commonly found in both wild type and H3.3K27M mutant ES cells and peaks unique to H3.3K27M mutant ES cells, based on their overlap with Ezh2 ChIP-seq peaks found in wild type ES cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). First, we compared the levels of H3.3K27M and H3K27me3 at these two groups of Ezh2 peaks, and found that the H3.3K27M reads density was significantly higher at Ezh2 peaks unique in H3.3K27M mutant ES cells than those found in both wild type and mutant ES cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). Interestingly, similar analysis on the published dataset using HA- and EYFP-tagged H3.3 proteins in mouse ES cells showed that wild type H3.3 was enriched to a similar level between these two groups of Ezh2 peaks (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1C</xref>). The difference in the enrichment of H3.3K27M and wild type H3.3 at these two groups of Ezh2 peaks is currently unknown. Nonetheless, compared to wild type cells, H3K27me3 levels at the Ezh2 peaks unique to H3.3K27M mutant cells were dramatically reduced in the H3.3K27M mutant cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). These results strongly support the idea that Ezh2 is redistributed to new sites in H3.3K27M mutant cells, but the presence of Ezh2 at the new sites does not generate H3K27me3, likely due to the presence of H3.3K27M mutant proteins at these sites (see below).</p><p>To analyze the properties of Ezh2 peaks found in H3.3K27M mutant cells, we then analyzed the overlap of these two groups of Ezh2 peaks with Ezh2, H3K4me3, H3K27me3, EP300, H3K27ac and H3K4me1 ChIP-seq peaks as well as annotated promoters, CpG island and bivalent promoter elements in wild type mouse ES cells from ENCODE database (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>). The common Ezh2 ChIP-seq peaks overlapped with high levels of H3K27me3 and were enriched with promoters including bivalent promoters and CpG island in wild type ES cells. These results suggest that these common Ezh2 peaks are classical and strong PRC2 sites, and that Ezh2 is recruited to these sites to retain H3K27me3 in H3.3K27M mutant ES cells. Surprisingly, the Ezh2 peaks unique to H3.3K27M mutant ES cells were overlapped with H3K27me3 and H3K4me1 in wild type ES cells. Chromatin regions containing both H3K4me1 and H3K27me3 are classified as poised enhancers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Creyghton et al., 2010</xref>).</p><p>To validate the ChIP-Seq results, we analyzed the enrichments of Ezh2 and H3.3K27M at three poised enhancers using ChIP-PCR. Ezh2 was indeed enriched at all three poised enhancers in H3.3K27M mutant ES cells compared to wild type ES cells. In contrast, Ezh2 was reduced at the Hoxa1 promoter, which contained high levels of H3K27me3, in H3.3K27M mutant ES cells compared to wild type ES cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>). H3.3K27M mutant proteins were enriched at these three poised enhancers compared to the Hoxa1 promoter, but to a significantly reduced degree compared to the actively transcribed gene, Actin, in H3.3K27M mutant ES cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G</xref>). These results strongly support the idea that Ezh2, possibly the PRC2 complex, is redistributed to new sites (poised enhancers) in H3.3K27M mutant cells, which leads to the reduction of the PRC2 complex and thereby H3K27me3 at the strong PRC2 sites.</p><p>In summary, most H3.3K27M mutant proteins, like wild type H3.3, are enriched at actively transcribed genes where the PRC2 complexes are absent. However, Ezh2, likely other subunits of PRC2 complex, is trapped at poised enhancers where H3.3K27M mutant proteins are detected, albeit at reduced levels compared to actively transcribed genes. This provides an explanation for our previous observation that more Ezh2 proteins were co-purified with H3.3K27M- than wild type H3.3-mononucleosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chan et al., 2013a</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>A subgroup of Ezh2 ChIP-seq peaks co-localizes with H3.3K27M mutant proteins in SF8628 cell line</title><p>The absence of matched control of DIPG lines precluded us from finding whether Ezh2 is also redistributed to poised enhancer using the same method utilized in mouse ES cells. Therefore, we used 16,656 Ezh2 ChIP-seq peaks identified in DIPG line, SF8628, and performed unsupervised clustering analysis on their overlaps with H3.3K27M and H3K27me3 peaks in DIPG cells as well as their overlap with H3K4me1, H3K4me3 and H3K27me3 and annotated promoters in human neuro precursor cells (NPCs). We observed that Ezh2 peaks were separated into five different clusters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2H</xref>). Cluster 1 and 2 Ezh2 peaks overlapped with H3K27me3 and low levels of H3.3K27M mutant proteins in SF8628 cells. Ezh2 peaks in Cluster 1 and 2 also overlapped with promoters and H3K27me3 in human NPCs, consistent with the idea that these Ezh2 and H3K27me3 peaks likely represent Ezh2 peaks commonly found in tumor-initiating cells before the introduction of H3.3K27M mutation. Interestingly, the other three clusters of Ezh2 peaks overlapped with H3.3K27M mutant proteins, but with very low levels of H3K27me3. Analysis of Ezh2 and H3.3K27M mutant protein peaks in SF8628 cells using the published datasets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Piunti et al., 2017</xref>) also identified a group of Ezh2 peaks that co-localize with H3.3K27M mutant proteins, but with very low levels of H3K27me3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1D</xref>).

To do this, we first divided H3K27me3 peaks into two groups, most reduced and least reduced, based on the average levels of H3K27me3 in both H3.3K27M mutant mouse ES clones (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). We then compared the average H3.3K27M ChIP-seq reads density between these two groups of gene promoters in H3.3K27M mutant cells. The gene promoters with the least reduced H3K27me3 had lower levels of H3.3K27M mutant proteins than those with most reduced H3k27me3 in mutant cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>). Moreover, we also compared the H3K27me3 ChIP-seq read density at the promoters of these two groups of genes in wild type ES cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>) and found that gene promoters with the least reduced H3K27me3 in H3.3 K27M mutant cells had higher levels of H3K27me3 in wild type cells than the gene promoters with the most reduced H3K27me3. Together, these results support the idea that the presence of H3K27me3 peaks in H3.3K27M mutant cells is likely due to two non-exclusive possibilities, high levels of H3K27me3 at these sites before the introduction of H3.3K27M mutant proteins and low levels of H3.3K27M mutant proteins assembled to these sites after expression of H3.3K27M mutant proteins.</p><p>Next, we analyzed whether similar observations hold true for the observed H3K27me3 peaks in DIPG tumor line, SF8628 and SF7761. Because vast difference in the number of H3K27me3 peaks was identified between these two samples, we analyzed H3K27me3 and H3.3K27M datasets from each line independently. To do this, we need to identify the PRC2 sites in ‘tumor-initiating cells’ of each DIPG line before the introduction of H3.3K27M mutant proteins. Because the expression of H3.3K27M in human NPCs resulted in neoplastic transformation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Funato et al., 2014</xref>), and mouse NSCs are proposed to be the cell origin of DIPG (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Monje et al., 2011</xref>), we hypothesize that human NSCs or NPCs are ‘tumor-initiating cells’ of DIPG. We used two H3K27me3 ChIP-seq datasets, one from human NSCs that we generated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chan et al., 2013a</xref>), and one from human NPCs downloaded from GEO (GSM896165) and identified 3212 overlapped H3K27me3 ChIP-seq peaks at promoters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2A</xref>). Because NPCs and NCSs are not matched controls for DIPG tumor-initiating cells, we also included H3K27me3 ChIP-seq peaks unique in SF8628 or SF7761 compared to NSCs or NPCs for the analysis. In total, 4,195 H3K27me3 peaks were identified and assumed to be present in ‘tumor-initiating cells’ of SF8628 before the introduction of H3.3K27M mutant proteins. We then divided the 4195 H3K27me3 promoters into two groups, high and low, based on the average levels of H3K27me3 at these gene promoters in SF8628 cell line, and compared the levels of H3.3K27M mutant proteins between these two groups of gene promoters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref>).

Second, we tested whether alterations in chromatin states of the WT1 promoter by targeting p300 using CRISPR/dCas9 (catalytic dead Cas9) would also change the expression of WT1 and cell proliferation. We targeted dCas9-HA and dCas9-HA fused with p300 catalytic domain (dCas9-HA-p300-HA) to the WT1 promoter in SF8628 cells using two independent sgRNAs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1C</xref>). The dCas9-HA and dCas9-HA-p300-HA were enriched at the WT1 promoter only when they were co-expressed with either of the two sgRNAs.

Importantly, targeting dCas9-HA-p300-HA, but not dCas9-HA alone to the WT1 promoter led to a reduction of H3K27me3 and Ezh2 as well as an increase of H3K27ac at the WT1 promoter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>).

Since these genes are silenced, the levels of H3.3 are low. Poised enhancers contain low levels of H3K27me3, PRC2 complex and H3.3. In H3.3K27M mutant cells, the PRC2 complexes, once recruited to the poised enhancers, are trapped there, likely due to higher concentration of H3.3K27M mutant proteins at poised enhancers. This will lead to a reduction of the PRC2 complex at strong PRC2 sites and a global reduction of H3K27me3. However, the amount of H3.3K27M mutant proteins at major PRC2 sites are low and thus having limited effect on the ability of the PRC2 complex, which is at reduced levels compared to wild type cells, to methylate H3K27.</p><p><supplementary-material id="fig5sdata1"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.36696.016</object-id><label>Figure 5—source data 1.</label><caption><title>The source data to plot the bar chart in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>.</title></caption><media mime-subtype="xlsx" mimetype="application" xlink:href="elife-36696-fig5-data1-v2.xlsx"/></supplementary-material></p><p><supplementary-material id="fig5sdata2"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.36696.017</object-id><label>Figure 5—source data 2.</label><caption><title>The source data to plot the bar chart in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>.</title></caption><media mime-subtype="xlsx" mimetype="application" xlink:href="elife-36696-fig5-data2-v2.xlsx"/></supplementary-material></p><p><supplementary-material id="fig5sdata3"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.36696.018</object-id><label>Figure 5—source data 3.</label><caption><title>The source data to plot the bar chart in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>.</title></caption><media mime-subtype="xlsx" mimetype="application" xlink:href="elife-36696-fig5-data3-v2.xlsx"/></supplementary-material></p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="x-tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-36696-fig5-v2"/></fig><fig id="fig5s1" position="float" specific-use="child-fig"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.36696.015</object-id><label>Figure 5—figure supplement 1.</label><caption><title>Forced expression of WT1 inhibits the proliferation of DIPG cells with H3.3K27M mutation.</title><p>(<bold>A–B</bold>) Cell proliferations of two DIPG cell lines were inhibited by overexpression of different WT1 isoforms.

Using mouse ES cells knocked-in with the same H3.3K27M mutation found in most DIPG lines, we observed that Ezh2, most likely the PRC2 complex, is redistributed to poised enhancers containing both H3K4me1 and low levels of H3K27me3, but not at promoters or gene bodies of highly transcribed genes where H3.3K27M mutant proteins are high. In DIPG cells, we also observed that a group of Ezh2 peaks co-localizes with H3.3K27M mutant proteins, likely also at poised enhancers. These results support a model whereby some PRC2 molecules are sequestered at these gene regulatory elements. Because the expression of key subunits of the PRC2 complex is not affected in H3.3K27M mutant cells, we suggest that the sequestration of PRC2 complex at these poised enhancers contributes to the global reduction of H3K27me3 in cells expressing H3.3K27M mutant proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>). We also observed that H3.3K27M mutant proteins are low at gene promoters with high H3K27me3 in H3.3K27M mutant mouse ES cells as well as DIPG cells. These results indicate that low levels or absence of H3.3K27M mutant proteins contributes to the retention of H3K27me3 at these sites. Finally, we show that WT1 is silenced through the H3K27me3-mediated mechanism, and forced expression of WT1 inhibits the proliferation of DIPG cells. Together, these studies provide the mechanistic insight into reprograming H3K27me3 by H3.3K27M mutant proteins and identify a novel TSG that is silenced in DIPG tumor cells for the proliferation of tumor cells.</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>How are the PRC2 complexes redistributed to poised enhancers?</title><p>How H3.3K27M mutant proteins affect H3K27me3 levels in cells remain in a debate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chan et al., 2013a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Justin et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Lewis et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Piunti et al., 2017</xref>). Using mouse ES cells knocked-in with the H3.3K27M mutation found in DIPG cells, we observed that H3.3K27M mutant proteins are enriched at actively transcribed genes where H3K27me3 and PRC2 are absent. In addition, Ezh2 proteins are detected at many more loci in H3.3K27M mutant than wild type ES cells. These Ezh2 peaks unique in H3.3K27M mutant ES cells are enriched with poised enhancers as well as H3.3K27M mutant proteins compared to those Ezh2 peaks commonly found in both wild type and H3.3K27M mutant ES cells. These results support the model that the PRC2 complex is redistributed to poised enhancers in H3.3K27M mutant ES cells. Because the total levels of the PRC2 complex are not altered in H3.3K27M mutant ES cells, the enrichment of the PRC2 complex at poised enhancers will lead to the reduced amounts of the PRC2 complex to methylate the PRC2 sites. While we do not have a perfect control for our analysis of DIPG cells, we also found that a group of Ezh2 peaks co-localize with H3.3K27M mutant proteins in DIPG line SF8628 based on analysis of Ezh2 and H3.3K27M ChIP-seq datasets from ours and published ones. These results indicate that the reduction of H3K27me3 in cells expressing H3.3K27M mutant proteins including DIPG cells is likely due, at least in part, to the redistribution of the PRC2 complex to poised enhancers.</p><p>How is the PRC2 complex redistributed to poised enhancers instead of active promoters with high levels of H3.3K27M mutant proteins? Two properties at the poised enhancers likely contribute to the retention of the PRC2 complex at these loci in H3.3K27M mutant cells. First, these poised enhancers, in general, contain low levels of H3K27me3 in wild type cells, suggesting that the PRC2 complex can be recruited to these loci, but cannot be detected at these loci in wild type cells because of its low affinity and/or low residence time at these sites. Moreover, it is known that H3.3 proteins localize at gene regulatory elements including poised enhancers in mouse ES cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Goldberg et al., 2010</xref>), and we observed that H3.3K27M mutant proteins can be assembled to these poised enhancers, although at a lower level compared to actively transcribed genes. Therefore, we propose that the PRC2 complex is recruited to poised enhancers independent of H3.3K27M mutant proteins but stays at these sites much longer because of the presence of the H3.3K27M mutant proteins. We speculate that while the levels of H3.3K27M mutant proteins at the gene promoters of actively transcribed genes are high, the PRC2 complex cannot be recruited to these sites initially and therefore the PRC2 complex cannot be sequestered at these sites despite the presence of high levels of H3.3K27M mutant proteins. Thus, we propose that the ability of poised enhancers to recruit the PRC2 complex, as well as the presence of H3.3K27M mutant proteins at these gene regulatory elements, contributes to the sequestration of the PRC2 at these gene regulatory elements in mouse ES cells and possibly in DIPG cells with the H3.3K27M mutation. In the future, it will be very interesting to test this model once we know how the PRC2 complex is recruited to poised enhancers.</p><p>While our manuscript is under revision, it has been observed that the residence time and search time of Ezh2 are prolonged in the H3.3K27M mutant ES cells using live-cell single-molecule imaging, while the total protein levels of Ezh2 on chromatin are not changed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Tatavosian et al., 2018</xref>). The prolonged search time of Ezh2 may either reflect the trapping of Ezh2 at the poised enhancers and/or an alternative mechanism that also contributes to the reduction of H3K27me3.</p><p>About 20% DIPG tumors contain the mutation at genes encoding histone H3.1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Nikbakht et al., 2016</xref>). H3.1 is assembled into nucleosomes through DNA replication-coupled nucleosome assembly. Moreover, H3.1 is predominantly localized at heterochromatin, which is in contrast to H3.3 localization at genic regions. Therefore, it would be interesting to determine how Ezh2 and PRC2 complex are distributed in cells expressing the H3.1K27M mutant protein in the future. In addition to H3.3K27M mutation, cells containing H3.3K36M mutation found in chondroblastoma exhibit a global reduction of H3K36 methylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Fang et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Lu et al., 2016</xref>).

The present study also begs the questions on whether the H3K36 methyltransferases are also redistributed in H3.3K36M mutant cells and contribute to the reduction of H3K36 methylation.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Mechanism for the retention of H3K27me3 in DIPG cells</title><p>We and others also observed that H3K27me3 peaks were present at hundreds of loci based on the analysis of H3K27me3 ChIP-seq (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bender et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chan et al., 2013a</xref>). In this study, we further confirm the dichotomous changes of H3K27me3 in one primary DIPG tumor sample. Importantly, we show that a significant number of gene promoters with H3K27me3 is common among three DIPG samples analyzed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). In H3.3K27M mutant mouse ES cells, almost all retained H3K27me3 ChIP-Seq peaks are also found in wild type mouse ES cells, but at a reduced level compared to wild type mouse ES cells. These results suggest that these H3K27me3 peaks in the mutant mouse ES cells are the bona fide PRC2 sites. H3.3K27M mutant proteins at H3K27me3-containing loci are either absent or at very low levels in both mouse ES cells and DIPG cells. In vitro, H3.3K27M mutant proteins inhibit the activity of the PRC2 complex. Similarly, replacement of other histone lysine residues to methionine such as H3K9 and H3K36 also inhibits the enzymatic activity of their corresponding lysine methyltransferase in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Fang et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Herz et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Jayaram et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Lu et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Shan et al., 2016</xref>). In fission yeast, overexpression of Clr4, the H3K9 methyltransferase, overcomes the inhibition of H3K9M mutant proteins on H3K9me3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Shan et al., 2016</xref>). Thus, the absence of or a low level of H3.3K27M mutant proteins at the gene promoters with H3K27me3 may be insufficient to inhibit the enzymatic activity of the PRC2 complex, leading to the retention of H3K27me3 at these sites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>).</p><p>It is known that high levels of H3.3 are enriched at highly transcribed genes compared to lowly expressed genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Chow et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">McKittrick et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Schübeler et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Stroud et al., 2012</xref>). H3.3K27M mutant proteins exhibit the same localization pattern in two DIPG lines as well as in H3.3K27M mutant mouse ES cells. We suggest that low levels of H3.3K27M mutant proteins detected at these gene promoters of strong PRC2 sites are likely due to the low expression level of these PRC2 regulated genes.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Epigenetic silencing of WT1 is important for the proliferation of DIPG cells</title><p>Genetic studies using mouse models indicate that Ezh2 is required for both the initiation and maintenance of tumors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Mohammad et al., 2017</xref>), demonstrating the importance of the retention/gain H3K27me3 in tumorigenesis. Moreover, it has been shown that p16 is repressed through H3K27me3-mediated silencing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Mohammad et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Piunti et al., 2017</xref>). In agreement with their studies, we also observed that depletion of Suz12 results in increased expression of p16. We extend this observation and show that WT1 is silenced through the H3K27me3-mediated mechanism and WT1 silencing is important for the proliferation of DIPG cells. Like p16, the expression of WT1 is low in DIPG tumor samples compared to NBS-HGG samples with wild type H3.3. WT1 is a zinc finger transcription factor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bardeesy and Pelletier, 1998</xref>). It was first identified as a TSG in Wilms tumor, a tumor also found exclusively in children (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Gessler et al., 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Maiti et al., 2000</xref>). Accumulating evidence suggests that WT1 is also expressed in many different classes of intracranial tumors, including gliomas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Izumoto et al., 2008</xref>), oligodendrogliomas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Rauscher et al., 2014</xref>), ependymomas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Yeung et al., 2013</xref>), and meningiomas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Iwami et al., 2013</xref>) and functions as an oncogene in these tumors. We suggest that H3K27me3 and the PRC2 likely silence multiple TSGs including p16 and WT1 for the initiation and maintenance of DIPG tumors.</p><p>About 6 to 9% H3K27me3 peaks had a higher level of H3K27me3 in DIPG lines and tissues than reference cells or tissue, respectively. However, almost all retained H3K27me3 peaks in H3.3K27M mutant mouse ES cells exhibit reduced levels compared to wild type mouse ES cells. The apparent discordance between these two results suggests that the reference cells (NPCs and NSCs) or tissues used as controls for DIPG cells and tissues are not perfect. Alternatively, some of these high levels of H3K27me3 peaks detected in DIPG cells are selected for the ‘tumor-initiating cells’ to gain the proliferative advantage. Supporting this idea, high levels of H3K27me3 are detected at the down-regulated genes including NKX2.2 gene in H3.3K27M transformed NPCs compared to control cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Funato et al., 2014</xref>). It is proposed that this will facilitate the resetting of neuro-precursor into stem cells state. Moreover, TSGs such as WT1 are likely expressed in tumor-initiating cells, and consequently, contain low levels of H3K27me3 at their gene promoters. Therefore, we speculate that selective pressure will lead to an increase of H3K27me3 at these gene promoters, which leads to silencing of these TSGs and drives tumorigenesis in DIPG cells.</p><p>The dichotomous change in H3K27me3 in DIPG cells is reminiscent of DNA methylation alteration observed in many cancer cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Baylin and Jones, 2011</xref>). Genomic DNA in most cancer cells is hypomethylated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Eden et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Ehrlich, 2009</xref>), and yet DNA hypermethylation at the promoters of TSGs has been frequently reported in many cancer types (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Baylin and Jones, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Esteller, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Struhl, 2014</xref>). DNA methylation analysis in DIPG cells indicates that DNA is hypomethylated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bender et al., 2013</xref>). Therefore, we propose that it is the dichotomous changes in H3K27me3, including both the global loss and locus retention/gain of H3K27me3, that contribute to tumor initiation and maintenance of DIPG.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table

Cells or tissue homogenates were crosslinked with 1% formaldehyde for 10 mins and then quenched with 125 mM glycine for five mins at room temperature. Samples were washed with cold TBS twice before resuspended in cell lysis buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl, pH7.5, 10 mM NaCl, 0.5% NP-40) and incubated on ice for 10 mins.

Samples were sonicated for 15 mins (30 secs on/30 secs off). The chromatin content was estimated by the Qubit assay. For the normalization of ChIP efficiency, the chromatin prepared similarly from S2 or Sf9 cells was added to 1 to 5% of total chromatin. The chromatin was then incubated with 5 µg of rabbit monoclonal anti-Ezh2 antibody (Cell Signaling, Cat.# 5246), 1.4 µg of rabbit monoclonal anti-H3K27me3 antibody (Cell Signaling, Cat.# 9733), 2 µg of rabbit polyclonal anti-H3K27ac antibody (Abcam, Cat.# ab4729), 2 µg of rabbit polyclonal anti-H3K27M antibody (Millipore, Cat.# abe419), 2 µg of mouse monoclonal anti-Flag antibody (Sigma, Cat.# F1804), 2 µg of mouse monoclonal anti-HA antibody (Clone No. 12CA5), or 2 µg of rabbit polyclonal anti-H3K4me1 antibody (Abcam, Cat.# ab8895) on a rocker overnight. 30 μl of protein G-magnetic beads were added for additional 3 hr incubation.

The consistent pair reads were used for the further analysis. After removal of PCR duplication reads by SAMtools (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Li et al., 2009</xref>), we used BEDTools (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Quinlan and Hall, 2010</xref>) and in-house Perl programs to calculate the genome-wide reads coverage.

The reads density scan was performed by in-house Perl programs using the normalized method: Reads Per Kilobase per 10 Million mapped reads. In order to calculate the average profile of H3.3K27M ChIP-seq, the gene annotation by UCSC was split into three groups (high expression genes, medium express genes, and low express genes) based on the expression levels of RNA-seq. Then the average read coverage for these three groups of genes was calculated across the annotated gene regions. Coverage across the annotated region which is the transcription start sites (TSS) to transcription end sites (TES) of each gene was calculated in 100 equally spaced bins. In addition, coverage was calculated in 100 equally spaced bins for both up-stream and down-stream flanking regions. The promoters used in this study were defined as 2 kb upstream and 500 bp downstream of TSS (base on UCSC annotation genes transcription start sites). Because we are using the MNase-digested chromatin to perform the ChIP-seq, it may contribute to high enrichment of H3.3K27M at TSS and TES.</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>Spike-in chromatin H3K27me3 ChIP-seq analysis</title><p>For H3K27me3 ChIP-seq using the patient tissue, chromatin from sf9 cells was used as the spike-in reference.

Three custom Bowtie2 libraries for combined genome sequence were built by Bowtie2-build. All sequenced reads were aligned against custom library using bowtie2 with default parameters.

The mechanism of these changes remains unclear. In this manuscript, the authors report that H3.3 K27M mutant proteins are enriched in highly expressed genes, whereas PRC2 is scarce. An increase of Ezh2 peaks is observed in H3.3 K27M expressing cells and many of these are unique to mutant cells. Despite the presence of PRC2, H3K27me3 is absent from these sites, possibly due to the presence of H3.3K27M mutant proteins at these regions. These regions are enriched for H3K4me1 and identified as poised enhancers. Furthermore, the absence of H3K27M protein at lowly expressing gene promoters (thus have low H3.3K27M protein incorporation) may help retain high levels of H3K27me3. Based on these observations, a model that H3K27M protein sequesters PRC2 to poised enhancers, thus resulting in a reduction of global H3K27me3 and the maintenance of H3K27me3 at lowly expressing gene promoters, is proposed. Finally, they report that tumor suppressor gene WT1 is repressed by H3K27me3 and forced expression of this gene inhibits proliferation of DIPG cells.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) One general concern is that: what is the ratio of poised enhancers and promoters that contain H3K27me3?

The authors propose that the PRC2 complex is recruited to poised enhancers independent of H3.3K27M mutant proteins but stays at these sites much longer because of the presence of the H3.3K27M mutant proteins; whereas a lack of initial PRC2 recruiting mechanism to the active gene promoters prevents the PRC2 complex from binding to these sites despite the presence of high levels of H3.3K27M mutant proteins.

It will greatly strengthen the paper if the author can perform some experiments to support this model.</p><p>4) In the comparison analyses, some random numbers of genes/peaks are used, e.g., 2000 or 1000 gene promoters for different comparisons.

Can this fully explain the reduction of H3K27me3 in DIPG cells?</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer’s comments. We detected 30295 H3K27me3 peaks in the wild type mouse ES cells. Among them, 5421 peaks are close to promoters and 8846 at the poised enhancers. The number of posited enhancers we identified is similar to the previous report, showing that there are around 11000 poised enhancers in the mouse ES cells (Jaenisch et al., 2010). Therefore, poised enhancers account for about 29% of all H3K27me3 peaks detected. In H3.3K27M mutant cells, we detected far more Ezh2 peaks that are close to these regions. Therefore, we propose that Ezh2 is trapped at poised enhancers for the reduction of H3K27me3 in DIPG cells.</p><p>It is possible that other mechanisms also contribute to the global reduction of H3K27me3. Recently, our collaborators used live-cell single-molecule imaging to show that the residence time and search time of Ezh2 was prolonged in H3.3K27M mutant cells but had no effect on its protein level on chromatin (Tatavosian et al., 2018). They also found that Ezh2 is trapped at some loci. However, the identities of these loci were not clear. These results are consistent with our observations. In the revised manuscript, we cited this newly published and discussed these possibilities in the Discussion, subsection “How are the PRC2 complexes redistributed to poised enhancers?”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) The genome-wide study in this manuscript clearly shows that H3K27M levels are high at promoters of actively transcribed genes but low at H3K27me3 domains.

Explanation of such difference is necessary.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer’s comments. The apparent contradiction of these two results likely results from inadequate explanations. In the genome-wide ChIP-seq study, H3.3K27M proteins are enriched at promoters of actively transcribed genes, like wild type H3.3. This result is consistent with the observation made by Dr. Ali Shilatifard’s laboratory. Moreover, as pointed out in the original manuscript, wild type H3.3 proteins are also enriched at gene promoters and gene bodies of actively transcribed genes. In addition to actively transcribed genes, wild type H3.3 and H3.3K27M are also detected at poised enhancers, while at low levels compared to actively transcribed genes. In our biochemical analysis of Ezh2 that were co-purified with wild type and H3.3K27M mononucleosomes, we expressed H3.3-Flag and H3.3K27M-Flag to a similar level in 293T cells. Assuming that equal amount of H3.3-Flag and H3.3K27M-Flag mutant proteins are found at actively transcribed genes that do not contain Ezh2, the enrichment of Ezh2 at poised enhancers containing H3.3K27M-mononucleosomes as detected by ChIP-seq in this study provided an explanation for the enrichment of Ezh2 on the H3.3K27M-Flag-containing mononucleosomes compared to H3.3-Flag mononucleosomes. We discussed this point in the Results, subsection “Ezh2 is redistributed to poised enhancers without methylating H3K27 at these sites in mutant mouse ES cells” as the following:</p><p>“In summary, most H3.3K27M mutant proteins, like wild type H3.3, are enriched at actively transcribed genes where the PRC2 complexes are absent. However, Ezh2, likely other subunits of PRC2 complex, is trapped at poised enhancers where H3.3K27M mutant proteins are detected, albeit at reduced levels compared to actively transcribed genes. This provides an explanation for our previous observation that more Ezh2 proteins were co-purified with H3.3K27M- than wild type H3.3-mononucleosomes (Chan et al., 2013).”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Ezh2 is redistributed to poised enhancers but not the active promoters where H3K27M proteins are much higher. The authors propose that the PRC2 complex is recruited to poised enhancers independent of H3.3K27M mutant proteins but stays at these sites much longer because of the presence of the H3.3K27M mutant proteins; whereas a lack of initial PRC2 recruiting mechanism to the active gene promoters prevents the PRC2 complex from binding to these sites despite the presence of high levels of H3.3K27M mutant proteins. However, there is not any experimental data to support this hypothesis. It will greatly strengthen the paper if the author can perform some experiments to support this model.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewers that it would be a great idea to provide more experimental evidence to support this model. As the reviewers know, how the PRC2 complex is recruited to poised enhancers in mammalian cells is not known. Therefore, it is almost impossible for us to analyze the role of the initial recruitment of the PRC2 complex in the trapping the PRC2 complex to targeted regions. However, this model is supported by our results that PRC2 complex was not detected at actively transcribed genes with high levels of H3.3K27M mutant proteins, and yet PRC2 complex was detected at poised enhancers where it contains low levels of H3K27me3 and PRC2. To address the reviewer’s concern, we validated our findings using ChIP-PCR. Briefly, we performed Ezh2 and H3.3K27M ChIP in wild type and two independent H3.3K27M knocked-in mouse ES cells. The enrichments of Ezh2 and H3.3K27M at three poised enhancers, labeled as enhancer 1 to 3, and one strong PRC2 site, Hoxa1, were analyzed by PCR. We found that Ezh2 was indeed enriched at all poised enhancers in H3.3K27M mutant cells compared to wild type mouse ES cells. Moreover, H3.3K27M mutant proteins were also enriched at these three sites compared to the Hoxa1 site. In addition, Ezh2 was reduced at the Hoxa1 promoter despite low levels of H3.3K27M mutant proteins were detected. These results fully support our original conclusion that the PRC2 complex is redistributed to poised enhancers, which contributes to the reduction of H3K27me3. We included these results in new Figure 2F-G and Results section of the revised manuscript.</p><p>Second, as mentioned above, our collaborators recently utilized live-cell single-molecule tracking to determine the impact of H3.3K27M mutant protein on the chromatin binding kinetics of Ezh2. They found that Ezh2 has a prolonged search time in H3.3K27M mutant cells compared to wild type cells, which supports our model that the PRC2 complex stays at poised enhancers much longer, likely due to the presence of the H3.3K27M mutant proteins. In the revised manuscript, we cited this study in the Discussion, subsection “How are the PRC2 complexes redistributed to poised enhancers?”.</p><p>Finally, to address this concern further, we point out that “In the future, it will be very interesting to test this model once we know how the PRC2 complex is recruited to poised enhancers.” in the aforementioned Discussion subsection.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) In the comparison analyses, some random numbers of genes/peaks are used, e.g., 2000 or 1000 gene promoters for different comparisons.

To address this concern, we divided H3K27me3 peaks into two groups, most reduced and least reduced, based on the average levels of H3K27me3 in both H3.3K27M mutant mouse ES clones, and then performed the same calculation and obtained the same pattern. We replaced original Figure 3 C-I with the new figures and modified the main text and figure legend accordingly.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) Figure 1A, 1B, 1D, the signals of H3.3K27M in up-stream of TSS and down-stream of TES are higher than that of gene coding region.

Does wild-type H3.3 also behavior like this?</p></disp-quote><p>We carefully compare the distribution pattern of H3.3K27M with wild type H3.3 in mouse ES cells published in other studies. The higher enrichment of wild type H3.3 at up-stream of TSS and down-stream of TES can be seen in other studies (e.g. Figure 2A of Goldberg et al., 2010 and Figure S1D from Banaszynski et al., 2013). We do not need to perform normalization to perform this analysis as we simply calculate the read density of H3.3K27M at three groups of genes based on expression levels. Therefore, this pattern is unlikely to arise from the normalization problem. Finally, I would like to point out, as described in experimental procedures, we performed H3.3K27M ChIP-seq using MNase-digested chromatin, which could contribute to the high enrichment of H3.3K27M at TSS and TES.</p><p>In the revised manuscript, we add the above discussion in the Materials and methods subsection “ChIP-seq data analysis”: “Because we are using the MNase-digested chromatin to perform the ChIP-seq, it may contribute to high enrichment of H3.3K27M at TSS and TES.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) Figure 1—figure supplement 1E, it looks like that H3K27me3 is completely abolished in H3.3K27M mutant cells.

According to the reviewer’s suggestions, we analyzed the levels of H3K27me1/me2/me3 in wild type and H3.3K27M mutant cells by titrating cell lysates as requested by the reviewers. It appears that H3K27me1 level in H3.3K27M mutant cells did not change to a detectable degree, whereas H3K27me2 and H3K27me3 were reduced dramatically.</p><p>This result is included in Figure 1—figure supplement 1E. The description of this data is in the Results, subsection “H3.3K27M mutant proteins are enriched at highly expressed genes in both DIPG cells as 141 well as mouse ES cells knocked-in with the H3.3K27M mutation”: “To analyze the impact of H3.3K27M mutation on H3K27 methylation, we compared the levels of H3K27me1, H3K27me2 and H3K27me3 in wild type and H3.3K27M mutant cells using different amount of extracts (Figure 1—figure supplement 1E). Compared to wild type cells, H3K27me1 was not affected to a detectable degree in H3.3K27M mutant cells under all these conditions, consistent with published study in DIPG cells (Bender et al., 2013). In contrast, H3K27me2 and H3K27me3 levels, while detectable in high amounts of cell extracts, were reduced dramatically in H3.3K27M mutant cells compared to wild type cells. Moreover, the reduction in H3K27me2/me3 in each of the H3.3K27M mutant ES cell clone is unlikely due to the reduced levels of the PRC2 complex (Figure 1—figure supplement 1F).”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7) Figure 2—figure supplement 1B, please explain the figures in detail.

H3K27me3 ChIP-seq was performed in WT and two H3.3K27M mutant clones spiked-in with chromatin from <italic>Drosophila</italic>. H3K27me3 peaks were identified and cumulative distribution analysis of the Log<sub>2</sub> ratio of H3K27me3 levels between mutant and WT cells (K27M / WT) was shown (X-axis). The percentage of H3K27me3 peaks at each ratio was shown at the Y-axis. Note that the percentage of H3K27me3 peaks reaches 100 with a Log<sub>2</sub> ratio of H3K27me3 levels (K27M / WT) less than 0, which indicates the levels of H3K27me3 at all H3K27me3 peaks identified in H3.3K27M mutant ES cells are reduced compared to WT mouse ES cells.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>8) Figure 2C, &quot;the H3.3K27M ChIP-seq read density was significantly higher at Ezh2 peaks unique in H3.3K27M mutant ES cells than those found in both wild type and mutant ES cells&quot;. Does this indicate that H3.3K27M incorporate differently into these two regions? Does wild-type H3.3 also have the same behavior?</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewers for these insightful questions. To address these questions, we initially planned to perform H3.3 ChIP-seq using antibodies against H3.3 in the mutant cells and compared the incorporation of H3.3K27M and wild type H3.3 in H3.3K27M mutant mouse ES cells. However, the following complications prevent us from taking this approach. First, the incorporation of H3.3K27M mutant proteins would change the gene expression and therefore likely the distribution of wild type H3.3 in H3.3K27M mutant ES cells at some gene loci. Second, the H3.3 antibodies were raised against a peptide to differentiate H3.3 from H3.1. Therefore, the antibodies cannot differentiate wild type H3.3 from H3.3K27M mutant proteins. Importantly, we tested several H3.3 antibodies for ChIP, and it appears that these antibodies also recognize H3.1 to some extent in our hands.</p><p>Therefore, to answer the reviewer’s question, we downloaded the published wild type H3.3 ChIP-seq datasets in mouse ES cells based on HA- and EYFP-tagged H3.3 proteins, and then compared the enrichment of wild type H3.3 at these two group of peaks in wild type mouse ES cells. Interestingly, we observed that wild type H3.3 was enriched similarly between Ezh2 peaks unique in H3.3K27M mutant ES cells and those found in both wild type and mutant ES cells. These results indicate that the enrichment of H3.3K27M mutant proteins at Ezh2 peaks unique to H3.3K27M mutant ES cells is different from wild type H3.3. In the revised manuscript, we add these results as Figure 2—figure supplement 1C and described them in the Results, subsection “Ezh2 is redistributed to poised enhancers without methylating H3K27 at these sites in mutant mouse ES cells”. “Interestingly, similar analysis on the published dataset using HA- and EYFP-tagged H3.3 proteins in mouse ES cells showed that wild type H3.3 was enriched to a similar level between these two groups of Ezh2 peaks (Figure 2—figure supplement 1C). The difference in the enrichment of H3.3K27M and wild type H3.3 at these two group of Ezh2 peaks is currently unknown.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>9) The data in Figure 2F and Figure 2—figure supplement 1C are not exactly the same. Several groups of genes in Figure 2—figure supplement 1C are indeed enriched both for H3.3K27M and H3K27me3, which are not seen in Figure 2F. What is the explanation?</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewers for the careful examination of these figures. Currently, we do not know the primary reason for the difference. One possible reason is that different antibodies against H3K27me3 were used in these two studies. We used a rabbit monoclonal anti-H3K27me3 antibody (Cell Signaling, Cat.# 9733) and this antibody was validated extensively (Rothbart et al., 2015). Figure 2—figure supplement 1C utilized the H3K27me3 antibodies homemade in Dr. Ali Shilatifard’s laboratory. Moreover, the number of H3K27me3 peaks were also different from these two studies. Using the same cut off value, there were 7610 H3K27me3 peaks in the supplemental figure and 5080 peaks in our study.</p><p>In the revised manuscript, we point this out at Figure legend of Figure 2—figure supplement 1C (New Figure 2—figure supplement 1D).</p><p>Despite the difference, both studies clearly show that a fraction of Ezh2 co-localized with H3.3K27M mutant proteins.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>10) The H3K27me3 peaks identified in different cell lines vary a lot, for example, &quot;2,356 H3K27me3 ChIP-seq peaks in SF7761, 5,080 in SF8628 and 12,033 peaks in DIPG patient tissue&quot;, &quot;30,295 H3K27me3 ChIP-seq peaks in wild type mouse ES cells, 17,158 peaks in H3.3K27M mutant clone #1 and 16,316 in H3.3K27M mutant clone #2&quot;. Is this a technical issue or related to specific cell lines?</p></disp-quote><p>The difference in the number of H3K27me3 peaks likely reflects different cell lines and primary tissue used. While SF7761 and SF8682 are DIPG lines containing H3.3K27M mutation, they grow very differently. For instance, SF7761 cells can only grow like neurosphere in neural stem cell media, whereas SF8628 cells grow adherently in DMEM media. DIPG tissue is different from DIPG cells as it is likely to be heterogeneous. Therefore, it is not surprising that different numbers of H3K27me3 ChIP-seq peaks were identified among these two cell lines and the primary DIPG tissue. Supporting this idea, the number of Ezh2 peaks identified in two H3.3K27M mutant mouse ES clones are very close to each other (about 4.9% difference). Moreover, we also analyzed the H3K27me3 peaks in the ENCODE project GSE49847 and found that there are 18169 H3K27me3 peaks in mouse ES cells and 1730 H3K27me3 peaks in mouse B-cells (CD43-). Therefore, the difference in H3K27me3 peak numbers may arise from different cell lines used.</p><p>Importantly, I would like to point out that the difference should not affect our conclusion for two reasons. First, we analyzed H3K27me3 ChIP-seq results in each cell line (Figure 3 F-I) independently and similar conclusions/results were obtained from datasets obtained from these different lines. Second, we utilized the H3K27me3 peaks that commonly found in all three lines (Figure 4—figure supplement 1A) to identify tumor suppressor genes that are silenced in DIPG cells.</p><p>In the revised manuscript, we point out in the Materials and methods, subsection “Spike-in chromatin H3K27me3 ChIP-seq analysis”, that “Different numbers of H3K27me3 peaks were identified among two DIPG lines SF7761 and SF8682 and one primary DIPG tissue. These differences are likely due to different cell lines used, which grow in different media and conditions. However, the difference does not affect our conclusions because we analyzed the H3K27me3 ChIP-seq result at each cell line independently. The analysis from each line supports the same conclusion.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>11) The manuscript needs to be carefully proof read.
