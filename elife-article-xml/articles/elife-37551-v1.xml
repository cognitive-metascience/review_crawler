dysfunction. Here, we report an efficient strategy for precise exploration of gene expression and epigenetic events in specific cell types in a range of species, including postmortem human brain. We demonstrate that classically defined, homologous neuronal and glial cell types differ between rodent and human by the expression of hundreds of orthologous, cell specific genes. Confirmation that these genes are differentially active was obtained using epigenetic mapping and immunofluorescence localization. Studies of sixteen human postmortem brains revealed gender specific transcriptional differences, cell-specific molecular responses to aging, and the induction of a shared, robust response to an unknown external event evident in three donor samples. Our data establish a comprehensive approach for analysis of molecular events associated with specific circuits and cell types in a wide variety of human conditions.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>molecular evolution</kwd><kwd>RNA-seq</kwd><kwd>cerebellum</kwd><kwd>human molecular variation</kwd><kwd>tools and resources</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd><kwd>Mouse</kwd><kwd>Rat</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000011</institution-id><institution>Howard Hughes Medical Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Heintz</surname><given-names>Nathaniel</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>1P30 DA035756-01</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Heintz</surname><given-names>Nathaniel</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Leon Black Family Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Heintz</surname><given-names>Nathaniel</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100012007</institution-id><institution>Rockefeller University</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Robertson Therapeutic Development Fund</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Xu</surname><given-names>Xiao</given-names></name><name><surname>Heintz</surname><given-names>Nathaniel</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Estelle G.

It has been established, for example, that each anatomically distinct, classically defined cell type expresses a set of genes that is characteristic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Dougherty et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Doyle et al., 2008</xref>), that these genes confer properties that are essential for specialized cellular functions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Kim et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Nakajima et al., 2014</xref>), and that the expression of these genes is highly correlated with cell specific epigenetic states that organize nuclear function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Kriaucionis and Heintz, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Mellén et al., 2012</xref>). Application of these powerful new technologies in mouse models has also led to the realization that environmental influences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Heiman et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Shrestha et al., 2015</xref>), internal physiological cues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Schmidt et al., 2012</xref>), and disease causing genetic lesions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Fyffe et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Ingram et al., 2016</xref>) alter gene expression in affected cell types. Despite the pace of advances in experimental systems, fundamental issues of human brain complexity remain unsolved. It is not known, for instance, how many distinct cell types exist in the human brain, how these cell types vary between individuals or across species, whether the process of brain aging is equivalent between cell types, and why mutations in broadly expressed genes can have devastating consequences in one or a few select cell types.</p><p>To address these questions, two main approaches have been taken that enable molecular characterization of cell types without the need for transgenic animals. The first involves gene expression profiling at the level of single cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Darmanis et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Macosko et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Saunders et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib99">Thomsen et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib111">Zeisel et al., 2015</xref>) or single nuclei (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Grindberg et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Habib et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Krishnaswami et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Lacar et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Lake et al., 2016</xref>). These studies have been instrumental in providing an unbiased description of the diversity of cell types and even subpopulations of cell types in the mouse and human brain. However, the profiles generated from these studies are highly variable, both due to the technical challenge of amplifying signal from a small amount of starting material as well as biological mechanisms such as transcriptional bursting (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Haque et al., 2017</xref>). Additionally, because single cell studies usually profile all cells from a tissue without enriching for cell types of interest, the vast majority of sequences generated from these studies will correspond to common cell types, with only limited sequences corresponding to rare cell types.</p><p>A second approach for molecular characterization has been developed to capture specific cell types, usually by cellular labeling followed by fluorescence activated cell sorting (FACS). Because neurons have complex cellular architecture, and techniques to achieve the single cell suspension required for FACS stress and damage neurons, an alternative strategy is to analyze isolated nuclei instead of whole cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Matevossian and Akbarian, 2008</xref>). These methods have enabled transcriptional and epigenetic profiling of several cell types during development of both the mouse and human brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Ernst et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Lister et al., 2013</xref>). However, only a few cell types have been characterized using this approach, primarily due to the difficulty of identifying antibodies to nuclear localized proteins that can label the nuclei from cell types of interest with sufficient specificity to enable sorting. To overcome this limitation, we have taken advantage of the fact that the endoplasmic reticulum membrane (ER) is contiguous with the nuclear membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Hetzer, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib103">Watson, 1955</xref>). We reasoned that we could expand the number of antibodies for purifying cell-type specific nuclei by targeting ER proteins in addition to nuclear regulatory proteins. Here we demonstrate that antibodies against both ER resident proteins and plasma membrane proteins being translated in the ER can be used for labeling and sorting nuclei from postmortem brains, dramatically expanding the pool of antibodies available for cell specific nuclear isolation.</p><p>In this manuscript, we establish a workflow for purifying and molecular profiling of nuclei from specific cell types in the mammalian nervous system without the need for transgenic animals. As a proof of principle, we used antibodies against a variety of different proteins to purify nuclei and profile gene expression and chromatin accessibility from the major cell types in the mouse cerebellum. We demonstrate that this approach can be readily extended to cell types from rat and human brain, and that the cell specific nuclear expression profiles are pure, reproducible, and comprehensive. These profiles enabled us to perform comparative studies of gene expression at a deeper level than previously achieved, and revealed a surprising degree of evolutionary divergence of gene expression profiles in rodent and human brain, even in classically defined, highly conserved cerebellar cell types (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">D’Angelo, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Eccles, 1967</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Llinas, 1969</xref>). As an extension to the gene expression studies, we also used purified nuclei to generated genome-wide maps of accessible chromatin for two cell types in mouse and human. Integrating cell-type specific gene expression profiles, epigenetic profiles, and analysis of DNA sequence conservation revealed that genes that change in expression between mouse and human have concordant changes in chromatin accessibility, and have less conserved regulatory sequences compared to genes that are stably expressed across species.</p><p>The ability to profile gene expression in defined cell types in the human brain was critical for our studies of aging as our data suggest that molecular mechanisms of brain aging unfold differently in each cell type. Finally, this approach has allowed us to discover a robust, cell-type specific molecular phenotype in a subset of samples. Although it is not clear whether this reflects an unknown clinical condition or changes that arise due to agonal factors or tissue processing, its presence in samples from control donors highlights the need to interrogate the extent of gene expression heterogeneity across control donors prior to comparative analysis with identified clinical conditions. We anticipate that the methodology established in this manuscript will enable the usage of postmortem tissue from common brain banks for correlative studies of human genetic and clinical data with cell-type specific expression, and for identifying as yet unrecognized molecular characteristics of human brain function and dysfunction.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>A non-genetic method to specifically isolate nuclei from selected cell types</title><p>To generate reference nuclear profiles for cell types of interest and to identify general characteristics of nuclear transcriptional profiles, we employed transgenic mice expressing an EGFP-L10a ribosomal protein fusion under the control of cell-type specific drivers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Doyle et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Heiman et al., 2008</xref>) for purification of nuclei by FACS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Kriaucionis and Heintz, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Mellén et al., 2012</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref>). RNA-seq was used to generate nuclear expression profiles for five different cell types – cerebellar Purkinje cells, granule cells, or Bergmann glia, or corticopontine or corticothalamic pyramidal neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1D</xref>). As expected, as a large proportion of nuclear transcripts are unspliced, we observe that the majority of the reads from our nuclear RNA-seq samples map to introns (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1C-D</xref>). Thus, all read quantification for nuclear samples in this manuscript were performed using whole gene annotations. Analysis of these data and published data for three cortical cell types (excitatory neurons, PV interneurons, and VIP interneurons, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Mo et al. (2015)</xref> demonstrated that nuclear RNA expression profiles can both distinguish different cell types and reveal relationships between cell types (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1E</xref>). This finding confirms the utility of nuclear RNA profiles for characterization of CNS cell types.</p><p>Next, we generated expression profiles from non-transgenic brains, focusing on several classically defined neuronal and glial cell types that exhibit unique morphology and distribution in the cerebellum (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Candidate antibodies for each cell type were chosen from our previously published translating RNA (TRAP) data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Dougherty et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Doyle et al., 2008</xref>). To isolate three neuronal cell types (granule, Purkinje, basket) and two glial cell types (astrocytes and oligodendrocytes) from the cerebellum of wild-type mice, we purified and then labeled nuclei (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2A</xref>) using antibodies against one transcription factor (OLIG2), one ER resident membrane protein Inositol 1,4,5-Triphosphate Receptor Type 1 (ITPR1), and two plasma membrane proteins, Sortilin Related VPS10 Domain Containing Receptor (SORCS3) and Glutamate Aspartate Transporter (EAAT1 or GLAST). To facilitate separation of neuronal from glial nuclei, we used in combination with each of these cell-type specific antibodies an antibody against the splicing protein RBFOX3/NeuN. We also used NeuN to positively select granule cells while removing nuclei from contaminating cell types using a combination of ITPR1, SORCS3, and OLIG2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). Imaging of nuclei labeled with these antibodies confirmed the expected distribution of the target proteins – while the nuclear factors NeuN and OLIG2 are localized within the nucleus, specifically in euchromatin, the ER resident protein ITPR1 and the plasma membrane proteins SORCS3 and EAAT1 localize to the ER/nuclear membrane and appear as a ring around the nucleus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E–F</xref>). However, both flow cytometry and imaging of the labeled nuclei yielded a surprising result: although NeuN is not known to label Purkinje nuclei in cerebellar tissue, staining of nuclei using NeuN robustly labels Purkinje nuclei (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). This is not due to spectral overlap from the Purkinje specific marker, as ITPR1 localizes to the ER/nuclear membrane while NeuN localizes to euchromatin, both as expected. Although we do observe lower levels of NeuN in labeled basket, astrocyte, and oligodendrocyte nuclei, this result suggests that exposure of antibody epitopes might be slightly different between isolated nuclei and tissue sections.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.37551.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Generation of gene expression profiles for distinct cell types from the cerebella of wild-type mice.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Immunofluorescence staining of five distinct cell types in the cerebellum.

To evaluate the purity of these profiles, we checked the expression of known markers for each cell type of interest. In all cases, we observed high expression of markers only in the appropriate cell type. For example, the granule cell markers <italic>Rbfox3</italic> (NeuN) and <italic>Fat2</italic> are highly expressed in granule cells and are minimally expressed in the other four cell types (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C–D</xref>). Next, we evaluated these samples at a genome-wide level by computing the pairwise Pearson’s correlation coefficient (r) between all samples using normalized gene expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>). From this analysis, we could make several observations. First, the correlation between different cell types in the cerebellum is high: r = 0.91–0.94. Second, the correlation across biological replicates is very high: r = 0.98–1. Third, when we compared to the reference gene expression profiles from the EGFP-L10a labeled nuclei from granule cells, Purkinje cells, and Bergmann glia, we observed very high correlations between the genetically defined cell types and antibody defined cell types: r = 0.98 for granule cells and r = 0.99 for Purkinje cells; r = 0.96–0.97 between Bergmann glia purified from <italic>Sept4</italic> EGFP-L10a animals and astrocytes purified via antibody labeling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>). Since Bergmann glia are a sub-population of cerebellar astrocytes, it makes sense for these datasets to have slightly lower correlations. Fourth, when we perform hierarchical clustering, the samples cluster according to the cell class. Thus, neuronal and glial samples separate from each other in the first split. The five cell types then separate from each other regardless of whether the nuclei were purified using genetic labeling (G) or antibody labeling (A). Finally, although the antibody labeled samples undergo additional processing steps such as fixation, they are highly similar to the GFP-sorted samples in read distribution (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1C—D</xref>) and gene expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>), suggesting that these technical differences have no or minimal effects on transcriptional profiles. Taken together, our results demonstrate that that fluorescence activated nuclear sorting allows cell-type specific gene expression profiling without the requirement for transgenic animals.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Antibody-based sorting enables the isolation and identification of subpopulations of cell types</title><p>In the FACS isolation of oligodendrocyte nuclei, we noticed that the OLIG2+ population could be subdivided based on its levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2B</xref>). By flow cytometry, we found that approximately 20% of all OLIG2+ nuclei have high levels OLIG2 (High) while 80% have lower levels (Low). To determine whether these two populations form distinct subpopulations of oligodendrocytes, we isolated and analyzed them individually using RNA-seq. We found that both populations express general oligodendrocyte markers such as OLIG2, but that only OLIG2 +High nuclei express genes such as <italic>Pdgfra</italic> and <italic>Cspg4</italic> that mark oligodendrocyte precursor cells (OPCs) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2C</xref>). We conclude that the OLIG2+ Low population contains mature oligodendrocytes, while OLIG2+ High nuclei contain a mix of mature oligodendrocytes and immature OPCs. This is consistent with previous studies demonstrating that OLIG2 levels are higher in oligodendrocyte precursors compared to mature oligodendrocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Hayashi et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Kitada and Rowitch, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Kuhlmann et al., 2008</xref>). Furthermore, hierarchical clustering of nuclear RNA-seq profiles from all cerebellar cell types indicates that the oligodendrocyte lineage splits into two groups, mature oligodendrocytes and OPCs, with the set of all oligodendrocytes clustering with mature oligodendrocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>). These results indicate that fluorescence activated nuclear sorting can also be used to identify subpopulations of cell types. In succeeding text and figures, these two subpopulations are analyzed separately and mature oligodendrocytes referred to simply as oligodendrocytes.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>Comparison of expression data from cell type specific populations of nuclei to single nuclei</title><p>The application of our population based, cell type specific technologies for expression profiling in the human brain provides an important complement to ongoing surveys of CNS cell types using single cell analysis. In particular, the ability to selectively isolate populations of interest allows for efficient profiling of rare cell types without the need to extensively profile common cell types. Additionally, when we compared our cerebellar glial datasets to published sequencing results from hippocampal glial single nuclei (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Habib et al., 2016</xref>), we found that our methodology outperforms single nuclei sequencing in the number of genes detected regardless of sequencing depth (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2D-E</xref>), and that the expression of general or cell-type specific genes is more variable across single nuclei samples than in our biological replicates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2F</xref>). While the variability present in single nuclei data may be desirable for addressing some biological questions, we believe that the reproducibility evidenced by highly correlated biological replicates can present important advantages for detection of cell specific molecular phenotypes associated with human pathophysiology.</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>Antibody-based sorting of cell types is easily transferrable to other species</title><p>An important reason for development of this approach was to enable cell-type specific profiling in species where transgenic strains are not readily available. As a first test of this property, we chose the rat because it is a well-established model organism for behavioral neuroscience. Nuclei were isolated from rat cerebellum, fixed and stained using the same antibodies that we used in mouse, and the results were analyzed on a flow cytometer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). The staining profiles of rat nuclei resembled those of mouse (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>), although there were differences. For example, in the rat cerebellum, NeuN staining resulted in better separated positive and negative populations than was evident in the mouse cerebellum. As a result, additional distinct and reproducible populations of nuclei were revealed. Purification and analysis of these populations by RNA-seq revealed that some cell types could be isolated using more than one sorting strategy. For example, we found that it was possible to isolate nuclei from basket cells, astrocytes, and oligodendrocytes by staining with antibodies against SORCS3 and NeuN. This flexibility allowed us to purify all six cell types using only four types of staining (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). For cell types that were isolated from more than one type of staining, we chose the population that by RNA-seq was most enriched for known markers (*) and depleted for markers of other cerebellar cell types.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.37551.005</object-id><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Generation of gene expression profiles for distinct cell types from rat and human cerebella.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Fluorescence activated sorting of stained nuclei from six cell types in the rat cerebellum.

As expected, we observed enrichment for known markers for each cell type and depletion for markers for all other cell types. In addition, our data identified 700 to 1600 expressed genes that are significantly enriched in each of the rat cell types. We also identified genes that are most specific for each cell type using an updated version of the specificity index algorithm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Dougherty et al., 2010</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp3">Supplementary file 3</xref>). The advantage of this approach is that it can identify specifically expressed genes even in cell types that are very abundant in the region of interest (e.g. cerebellar granule cells). To validate both our cell-type specific rat data and the updated specificity index algorithm, we examined the expression of genes identified as being specific to each cell type using the Allen Mouse Brain Atlas in situ hybridization database (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A</xref>). For the top 20 most specific genes for all cell types, we observe labeling specifically in the defined cell type on average 93% of the time.</p></sec><sec id="s2-6"><title>Antibody-based sorting of cell types can be applied to postmortem human tissue</title><p>To determine whether antibody based nuclear sorting can be used productively for analysis of cell types in the human brain, we acquired postmortem human cerebellar tissue from two donors (codes XK and PK), then isolated and stained nuclei using the cell-type specific antibodies defined previously. Although the profile of stained human cerebellar nuclei is generally similar to rodent, there are differences (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). For example, the conditions used to sort granule and basket neurons, astrocytes, oligodendrocytes, and OPCs were directly transferrable to human postmortem tissue, whereas those used to sort mouse and rat Purkinje cell nuclei were not successful for isolation of human Purkinje cell nuclei, possibly because while Purkinje cells are already rare in mouse and rat (0.1% in mouse, 0.05% in rat; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">2A</xref>), they have been reported to be even more rare in human (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Korbo and Andersen, 1995</xref>). We also observed slight differences in staining between the two postmortem human samples: in XK the oligodendrocyte and OPC populations are well separated, whereas they are more difficult to distinguish in the sample PK. To assess whether these differences might prevent cell type specific analysis of human postmortem samples, we profiled gene expression in nuclei isolated from five cell types (granule, basket, astrocyte, oligodendrocyte, OPC) in these two individual brains using RNA-seq. Examination of known markers from each of these cell types established that relevant cell specific markers are enriched in the data for each cell type, and depleted from the other cell types (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1B</xref>). Calculation of pairwise Pearson correlation coefficients across the ten datasets revealed that the two neuronal cell types (granule and basket) were highly correlated between samples (r = 0.99 for both), while the glial data had slightly lower correlations (r = 0.96–0.97). Hierarchical clustering resulted in separation of the samples by cell type, indicating that the variation across cell types is stronger than that between individual samples (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). Finally, we applied the specificity index algorithm to these data to identify specifically expressed genes in each human cell type (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>). When we examined the genes that are most specific, we noted that many of these genes were also highly expressed in the same cell type in mouse and rat, but some genes appeared to be human-specific in each cell type (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp3">Supplementary file 3</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-7"><title>Cross-species comparison reveals cell-type and species specific genes</title><p>Given the high quality of the cell specific expression profiles that we generated for mouse, rat, and human, we were interested in addressing directly the extent of gene expression conservation and divergence between species in these well-defined, classical cerebellar cell types. To ensure that our results reflected altered expression rather than differences in annotation between species, we limited our analysis to high-confidence 1:1 orthologous genes between mouse, rat and human (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1A</xref>, methods). To explore the similarities and differences across species, we used hierarchical clustering to determine the relationships between samples. Interestingly, we found that when we performed clustering using all genes, the samples resolved primarily by species (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1B</xref>). However, when we performed clustering using the 250 most variable genes across samples, they clustered primarily by the cell type (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). To further investigate this result, we computed the pairwise Pearson correlation coefficients across all samples (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1C</xref>). We found that the range of correlation coefficients between the samples for the same cell type across species is similar to that for cell types isolated from the same species, suggesting that both cell type and species are important determinants of the expression profiles. Our interpretation of these data is the biggest differences (most variable genes) define cell types, while the accumulation of more subtle differences define species. To explore whether species also contributes to bigger differences, we performed principal components analysis using the 250 most variable genes across samples (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1D-F</xref>). Examination of the first eight principal components (PC1-8), which collectively account for 90.5% of the variability across all samples, revealed that PC1 and 3 categorize samples by the cell type, while PC2, 6, and 8 split samples by species. The other principal components organize samples by both cell type and species. Because PC1 and 3 account for 47% of the variability across samples while PC2, 6, and 8 account for only 22% of variability (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1D</xref>), we conclude that the most important differences between the profiles result from the cell-type specific expressed genes that are shared among species, but that some important differences also arise due to the expression of species-specific genes.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig3" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.37551.007</object-id><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>Comparative analysis of gene expression across species reveals cell-type and species specific differences.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Heatmap showing normalized expression of the 250 most variable genes across all samples.

This may explain why hierarchical clustering using all genes results in clustering by species while clustering with the most variable genes results in clustering by cell type. To gain further insight into cell-type specific functions that have changed across species, we calculated the specificity index for all genes in a given species. We next compared the rank of the 100 most specific genes for each cell type in mouse with their ranks in rat or human (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1G–H</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp3">Supplementary file 3</xref>). We found that, in general, genes that are highly specific in mouse are also highly specific in rat and human but there are many exceptions. As expected, the specificity rank was more conserved between mouse and rat than mouse and human.</p><p>To explore further the extent to which the expression of cell-type specific genes change across species, we focused our comparative analysis on the data from mouse and human because the annotations of these genomes are more complete than the annotations for the rat genome. As a result, the number of high-confidence orthologs that could be used for comparison increased from 11,443 to 14,273 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2A</xref>). To focus on differentially expressed genes that are most likely to impact cellular function, we selected only genes that passed a stringent adjusted p-value cutoff of &lt;10e-5, that changed in expression by at least 4-fold between species, and that are expressed at significant levels in each cell type (average number of normalized counts (DEseq2 baseMean)&gt;400 and average log<sub>2</sub>(fpkm) in at the species with higher expression &gt;4). Using these criteria, we found between 132 and 408 genes that are mouse or human enriched in these cell types (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2B</xref>). To identify cell-type and species differences rather than general differences between mouse and human, we removed from the analysis genes that are differentially expressed between mouse and human in all cell types analyzed (adjusted p&lt;10e-5, fold change &gt;2, no expression cutoff). Filtering in this way yielded between 70 and 280 cell-type and species specific differentially expressed genes that were approximately equally distributed between those enriched in mouse and those enriched in human (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>, S5B, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp4">Supplementary file 4</xref>). Examples of shared and species-specific expressed genes are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>. Interestingly, expression of these genes in rat most often resembles expression in mouse (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2C</xref>).</p><p>Because our analysis compares the expression of populations of nuclei, it is possible that some of the species enriched genes that we have identified could be the result of sorting for slightly different subpopulations in mouse and human rather than real species differences. To test this, we examined the expression of our species-enriched genes in published human cerebellar single nuclei RNA-seq data from (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Lake et al., 2018</xref>) and mouse cerebellar single cell RNA-seq data from (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Saunders et al., 2018</xref>). We noted that although Lake et al. label two of their clusters as populations of Purkinje neurons, these clusters actually contain cerebellar GABAergic interneurons (no cerebellar interneurons were identified in the publication), as both clusters express cerebellar interneuron markers such as <italic>SLC6A1 and TFAP2B</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Chiu et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib110">Zainolabidin et al., 2017</xref>), and neither express well characterized Purkinje markers such as <italic>CALB1</italic> and <italic>CA8</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Jiao et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib98">Taniuchi et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib100">Tolosa de Talamoni et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib107">Whitney et al., 2008</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3A</xref> - left). Instead, the group labeled Purk1 express basket cell markers <italic>SORCS3</italic> and <italic>LYPD6</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Doyle et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Hermey et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Schilling and Oberdick, 2009</xref>)(<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3A</xref> - left). These marker genes for Purkinje neurons, GABAergic interneurons, and basket neurons are correctly expressed in the mouse data from Saunders <italic>et al.</italic>, although we note that while basket neuron subtypes 3 and 4 express <italic>Slc6a1</italic> and <italic>Tfap2b</italic>, they do not express <italic>Sorcs3</italic> and <italic>Lypd6</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3A</xref> - right). Thus, we have renamed the two populations from Lake <italic>et al.</italic> Basket and Interneuron type 2 (Int2). In keeping with the conventions of this paper, we also renamed their Cerebellar astrocyte population Bergmann glia.</p><p>To assess whether our species-enriched genes are heterogeneously expressed in single nuclei/cell data, we first examined violin plots of gene expression of example marker, human-enriched, or mouse-enriched genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3B</xref>). In human single nuclei data, expression of the human-enriched granule cell genes <italic>VWC2</italic> and <italic>CCDC175</italic> revealed granule cell-specific expression similar to granule marker genes <italic>FAT2</italic> and <italic>RBFOX3</italic>. However, mouse-enriched granule cell genes <italic>CNKSR3</italic> and <italic>ECE1</italic> displayed only background levels of expression across all cell types (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3B</xref> - left). In contrast, in mouse single cell data, expression of the mouse-enriched granule cell genes <italic>Cnksr3</italic> and <italic>Ece1</italic> revealed granule cell expression similar to granule marker genes <italic>Fat2</italic> and <italic>Rbfox3</italic>, while human-enriched granule cell genes <italic>Vwc2</italic> and <italic>Ccdc175</italic> displayed only background levels of expression across all cell types (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3B</xref> - right).</p><p>To quantify these observations for all cell-type specific species-enriched genes, we used two metrics to measure gene expression in single nuclei/cell populations - mean expression levels and the proportion of nuclei with expression over a threshold one log<sub>2</sub>(TPM). For each cell type, we measured expression using these two metrics for all human- or mouse-enriched genes in the cluster(s) corresponding to that cell type. For example, for granule cells, we quantified mean expression and proportion of nuclei with expression for all 101 human-enriched or 109 mouse-enriched genes. As a reference, we also quantified expression for 472 housekeeping genes that are unchanged in expression between mouse and human. For astrocytes, because our sorted populations capture both conventional astrocytes and Bergmann glia (specialized cerebellar astrocytes), we examined the expression of our 107 human-enriched or 75 mouse-enriched genes in the single nuclei populations for both astrocytes and Bergmann glia. Saunders <italic>et al.</italic> subdivide their basket neurons into four subpopulations, non-Bergmann glia astrocytes into two subpopulations, and oligodendrocytes into two subpopulations; we also examined the expression of our human and mouse-enriched genes for these cell types in all subpopulations. We found that for all cell types and for both measures of expression, the expression of human-enriched genes in human single nuclei data is significantly higher than the expression of mouse-enriched genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3C</xref>). Concordantly, the expression of mouse-enriched genes in mouse single cell data is higher than the expression of human-enriched genes for all cell types, including subpopulations of each cell type (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3D</xref>). For both measures of expression, the distributions of expression for mouse- and human-enriched genes are statistically different for all cell types except for OPCs, which is likely due to sample size as Saunders <italic>et al.</italic> only identified eight cerebellar OPCs. These results confirm that the genes we have identified as differentially expressed between human and mouse are likely to be true species differences, and do not arise as a result of sorting different subpopulations in the two species.</p><p>We next performed Gene Ontology (GO) analysis of species-specific genes to understand whether their expression might reflect changes that occur independently, or arise due to transcriptional programs that are altered between species. GO analysis of human-enriched genes from granule neurons, astrocytes, oligodendrocytes, and OPCs do not have significantly associated GO categories, suggesting species differences in these cell types contribute to a wide range of pathways and functions. The majority of human-enriched genes in basket cells are also unrelated functionally, although there was significant enrichment for the cellular component sub-ontology cell projection membrane. GO analysis of mouse-enriched genes from astrocytes revealed weak enrichment for genes with phosphoric diester hydrolase/phospholipase activity, while mouse-enriched genes from granule neurons, basket neurons, oligodendrocytes, and OPCs revealed enrichment for genes with transporter activity or those involved in neuronal development (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp9">Supplementary file 9</xref>). These data indicate that evolutionary divergence between mouse and human cell types involves both frequent alterations in regulatory mechanisms impacting single genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib101">Villar et al., 2015</xref>), and those regulating conserved, functionally important pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Nord et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Rebeiz et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>To confirm the presence or absence of some of these species and cell-type specific genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1A-B</xref>) in the mouse brain, we examined publicly available gene expression data from the Allen Mouse Brain Atlas and GENSAT Project (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Gong et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Lein et al., 2007</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1C</xref>).

Since previous studies have demonstrated that ATAC peaks are typically found in the promoters and gene bodies of expressed genes and severely reduced or absent from genes that are not expressed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Buenrostro et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Mo et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">Su et al., 2017</xref>), we collected ATAC-seq data from mouse and human cerebellar granule and basket nuclei to confirm the expression data. The majority of ATAC peaks in our samples are located in promoters or gene bodies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2A</xref>).

In human granule cells, all three genes are expressed at significant levels, as is evident by the presence of primary transcripts over the gene body, and ATAC peaks at the promoter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref> - top). In mouse granule cells, expression of the <italic>Rtn1</italic> gene [1] is conserved, with similar levels of nuclear transcripts (7.6 log<sub>2</sub>(normalized counts) in human vs 8.1 in mouse) and promoter ATAC coverage (2.6 log<sub>2</sub>(FPKM) in mouse vs 2.9 in human). In to contrast the robust expression of the <italic>CCDC175</italic> gene [2] evident in human granule cells, no primary transcripts and no promoter ATAC peaks are observed for the mouse gene (we did not quantify expression or ATAC coverage for CCDC175 because the mouse and human genes are annotated as low confidence orthologs and thus excluded from quantitative analysis). This gene, therefore, is an example of a human specific granule cell expressed gene. The third gene in this locus <italic>Jkamp</italic> [1], is an intermediate case. Although <italic>Jkamp</italic> is expressed in both human and mouse granule neurons, its expression in mouse is reduced approximately five-fold (8.6 log<sub>2</sub>(normalized counts) in human vs 6.3 in mouse) and the accessibility of its promoter is reduced (ATAC coverage 3.8 log<sub>2</sub>(FPKM) in human vs 1.7 in mouse).

The reverse is true for basket cells as the promoters of basket-enriched genes have elevated ATAC signal compared to the promoters of granule-enriched genes.

To measure sequence conservation, we used PhastCons scores, which estimate from multiple species sequence alignments the likelihood that a base is under purifying selection. As a reference, we identified 472 well-expressed genes that are not significantly differentially expressed between mouse and human (p&gt;0.2 using samples from all cell types, DESeq2 baseMean &gt;400, log<sub>2</sub>(fpkm) &gt;4), which we call housekeeping genes. We found that DNA bases contained within ATAC peaks associated with mouse- or human-enriched genes are less conserved than those associated with housekeeping genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>, left for granule cells, right for basket cells). Analysis of conservation scores over the normalized length of promoter ATAC peaks reveals that while the centers of defined peaks are more conserved compared to the beginning or end of peaks, this difference is more prominent for housekeeping genes that for human- or mouse-enriched genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>, left for granule cells, right for basket cells). These results suggest that differences we observe in the expression of cell-type and species-specific genes between human and mouse might result from evolutionary driven differences in promoter chromatin accessibility between the two species.</p><p>While examining the genes that differ in granule cells between mouse and human, we noted an interesting example that involves changing expression of alternative family members.

Our data demonstrate that mouse granule cells express only <italic>Pde1c</italic>, whereas granule cells from human express high levels of <italic>PDE1A</italic> and low levels of <italic>PDE1C</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1B</xref>). Our results match previous findings that <italic>PDE1A</italic> is expressed in the human but not mouse cerebellum (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Loughney and Ferguson, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Loughney et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Sonnenburg et al., 1993</xref>). To further confirm this result, we assayed levels of PDE1A and PDE1C in mouse and human cerebellar sections by immunofluorescence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref>). We found, consistent with the RNA-seq and ATAC data, that both PDE1 members are primarily localized in the granule layer, with PDE1C expression predominant in mouse and PDE1A expression predominant in human cerebellum (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref>). Since PDE1A preferentially hydrolyzes cGMP while PDE1C hydrolyzes both cAMP and cGMP with equal efficiencies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib97">Takimoto, 2009</xref>), these differences in gene expression may result in changes in neuronal activity between granule cells from the two species.</p><p>To assess whether some of these species differences may have arisen due to changes in <italic>cis</italic>-regulatory regions, we identified motifs that are enriched in accessible regions associated with mouse or human enriched genes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp6">Supplementary file 6</xref>). In general, we found that only a few motifs reach significance after correcting for multiple testing, and these motifs tend to correspond to common transcription factors such as CTCF or cell-type specific transcription factors such as NEUROD1 for granule cells. However, we noticed that the top motifs for gene body peaks in mouse-enriched granule cell genes contain motifs for 4 GATA transcription factors (GATA2, GATA6, GATA1, and GATA4). Although none of these motifs reached significance after correcting for multiple hypothesis testing (Benjamini q-values: 0.0676, 0.1069, 0.176, and 0.2192), we were intrigued by this result as none of the conventional GATA family members (<italic>Gata1 - 6</italic>) are expressed in mouse granule cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1D</xref>). However, we found that <italic>Trps1</italic>, which encodes an atypical GATA factor that has been shown to specifically bind to the consensus GATA sequence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Malik et al., 2001</xref>), is expressed in granule cells in mouse but not human (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1D</xref>). A previous study has found that while human mutations in the GATA binding domain of <italic>TRPS1</italic> cause defects in bone development, these phenotypes are not completely recapitulated in the mouse model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Malik et al., 2002</xref>). Although there are no reports of neurological phenotypes in the mosue model, our results suggest that changes in the pattern of transcription factor expression between mouse and human may contribute to discrepancies in phenotypes between mouse models and human disease.</p><p>Taken together, these data demonstrate that nuclear RNA-seq data can be employed to accurately assess cell-type specific gene expression in rodent and human brain, and they allow several important conclusions regarding gene expression in the nervous system. First, gene expression in the brain is highly conserved in specific cell types across species. Accordingly, most abundant and cell-specific markers of well characterized cell types are shared between rodent and human brain. Second, despite this shared identity, there are a significant number of genes in each cell type whose expression is not conserved between species. This group of genes does not generally conform to known GO categories, and in some cases, they are expressed in other brain regions. Third, cell-type and species-specific expression can reflect altered regulation of adjacent genes within a locus, or selective expression of functionally related yet distinct members of a given gene family. Finally, cell-type specific changes in the expression of transcription factors may impact the expression of downstream genes. Although the consequences of these gene expression changes will have to be interrogated in future studies, our data demonstrate that important differences in gene expression in specific CNS cell types occur between species and suggest that they may result in functionally important differences in the biochemical functions of even the most classically defined rodent and human cell types.</p></sec><sec id="s2-9"><title>Identification of clinically relevant SNPs that are located in putative cell-type specific gene regulatory regions</title><p>To assist in interpreting the functional relevance of non-coding SNPs from GWAS studies, we overlapped the coordinates of clinically relevant SNPs from the NHGRI-EBI GWAS catalog with the cell-type specific regulatory regions identified from our human ATAC-seq data (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp7">Supplementary file 7</xref>). We found 767 and 1381 SNPs that are located in accessible regions associated with granule and basket neurons respectively. Of these, 163 and 363 SNPs are located in regions that are differentially accessible in granule and basket neurons. Although further work is required to confirm that these SNPs are functionally significant, these results may provide insight into the mechanism by which SNPs contribute to human disease. For example, while many SNPs in <italic>SNCA</italic>, the gene that encodes alpha-synuclein, have been strongly associated with both familial and sporadic Parkinson's disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Campêlo and Silva, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Stefanis, 2012</xref>), less is known about the mechanism by which non-coding SNPs in <italic>SNCA</italic> contribute to disease risk. We found that <italic>SNCA</italic> is expressed at higher levels in granule neurons relative to basket neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1E</xref>); correspondingly, we identified seven regions around the <italic>SNCA</italic> gene that are preferentially accessible in granule neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1E</xref>) and may regulate <italic>SNCA</italic> expression in <italic>cis</italic>. These putative regulatory regions contain two SNPs that have previously been linked to Parkinson's - rs356182 and rs2736990. Interestingly, the GG genotype of rs356182, which has been associated with a tremor-dominant, slower-progressing form of Parkinson's, is also associated with lower levels of <italic>SNCA</italic> expression in the cerebellum but not in any other brain regions including substantia nigra, caudate, and frontal cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Cooper et al., 2017</xref>). Because a major challenge of these studies is in determining whether identified SNPs are themselves functionally significant or whether they are merely linked to a functional SNP, the ability to determine which SNPs reside in cell-type specific regulatory regions may enable the generation of testable hypotheses for how GWAS derived SNPs contribute to human diseases.</p></sec><sec id="s2-10"><title>Nuclear profiling of three cell types isolated from 16 postmortem human brains</title><p>Given the genetic heterogeneity of human populations, the variations in human tissue processing times, and the difficulties cited in previous studies of total RNAs isolated from human tissue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">McCall et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib104">Webster, 2006</xref>), we were interested in determining sources of variability across samples from different individuals. Since differences in cellular composition can confound analyses at the tissue level (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Jaffe and Irizarry, 2014</xref>), we applied our methodology to analyze cell-type specific gene expression in an additional 14 human brain samples. In total, we obtained samples from 16 control donors, roughly equally split between genders (seven males and nine females), and across ages (four individuals each in the following age groups: 20–30, 40–50, 60–70, 80–90 years) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">5A</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref>). We prepared nuclei from all 16 samples and stained them using antibodies against ITPR1 and NeuN – a staining strategy that allowed us to purify in a single sort nuclei from three different cell types: granule cells, basket cells, and total glia (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">5A</xref>). We noticed that, although the staining pattern varied slightly between samples, we could easily distinguish the ITPR1- NeuN+ population containing granule cells and the ITPR1- NeuN- population containing total glia. The only exceptions were the glial populations from samples WC and WO in which the ITPR1- NeuN- population did not separate well from the ITPR1- NeuN+ population (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>). Gene expression analysis of these two samples revealed that these two sorts failed to effectively separate granule cells from glia, and they were excluded from further analysis. Although the population containing basket cells appeared to be highly variable across individuals, for most of the samples, we could easily identify and gate for a distinct ITPR1+ NeuN population that was well separated from other nuclei. In some individuals (e.g. WC and KE) where this population was less distinct, we gated based on where this population appeared in other samples while taking care to avoid auto-fluorescent ITPR1+ NeuN+ and glial ITPR1- NeuN- nuclei. Consequently, our analysis included 46 human datasets: 16 from granule cells, 16 from basket cells, and 14 from glia. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>, RNA-seq analysis of these datasets demonstrate that the isolated populations are highly specific, as each sample is enriched for the appropriate markers for that cell type, and depleted for markers of other cerebellar cell types. As expected, only samples from females express the X-inactive specific transcript (<italic>XIST</italic>), while only male samples express Y chromosome genes such as <italic>KDM5D</italic>. Pairwise Pearson correlation coefficients between biological replicates for each cell type are between 0.98 and 1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>).

Although the cerebellar samples characterized here were obtained from normal controls, differences in gender, age, and the time between death and tissue preservation (autolysis time or postmortem delay interval) might influence the expression data we obtained. We first analyzed the effect of postmortem delay (PMD) as a potential source of technical variability that can complicate biological interpretations of the data. We found that only a few genes significantly change with PMD: 12 across all samples, four in granule cells, one in basket cells, and one in glia (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1A</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp8">Supplementary file 8</xref>).

The remaining genes appear to increase in only a few samples with intermediate PMDs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1B</xref>).

As expected, we found that the majority of gender-specific genes resided on the X or Y chromosomes, with expression of X-chromosome genes enriched in female samples and Y-chromosome genes enriched in male samples. Of the 27 genes exhibiting gender-specific differential expression (adjusted p-value&lt;0.01, baseMean &gt;50), seven are located on the X chromosome, 14 are on the Y chromosome, and six on autosomes. Interestingly, gender-specific genes can be more differentially expressed in some cell types than in others. For example, we identified Glycogenin 2 Pseudogene 1 (<italic>GYG2P1</italic>) as a male-enriched gene across all samples, although it is clearly more male-enriched in basket cells than granule cells and glia (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>). This is not due to mis-mapped reads as a result of duplication, as Glycogenin 2 (<italic>GYG2</italic>) is expressed only in glia and does not exhibit gender-specific expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1D</xref>).

To address this issue, we examined the effects of age on gene expression in each of the three cerebellar cell types. We performed differential expression analysis using age as a numerical variable to find genes that significantly change with age in all samples, or specifically in granule cells, basket cells, or glia. We found 274 significant genes in granule cells, 139 in basket cells, 31 in glia, and 42 that are significant across all samples regardless of cell type (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1A</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp8">Supplementary file 8</xref>). These genes are about equally split between those that increase in expression and those that decrease in expression with age (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>, S9G). Interestingly, only a few genes significantly change with age in more than one cell type. For example, the 42 genes that are identified as significantly changed with age across all cell types appear heterogeneous (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>), and most of these do not reach significance when tested in each cell type individually (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1G</xref>). Finally, while as expected we observe high correlation between age and expression when we examine aging genes in their respective cell type, there is only a modest correlation when we examine these genes in other cell types (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1H</xref>). For example, the Pearson's correlation between age and the expression of the 274 granule aging genes in granule neurons is 0.76, but only 0.42 and 0.32 when expression of these genes is examined in basket neurons and glia. These data suggest that the specific molecular consequences of aging, at least in the cerebellum, are different between cell types.</p><p>Despite differences in the genes impacted by aging in each cell type, it remained possible that the cellular processes altered by these changes are related between cell types. To test this hypothesis, we performed GO analysis on the genes that are up- or down-regulated with age in each cell type. We did not find significant GO categories for any group of aging up-regulated genes, nor did we find significant GO categories for the aging down-regulated genes from the all cell types group. However, we found that the genes down-regulated with age in all three individual cell types, despite containing different specific genes, were enriched for synaptic genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D,E</xref>). Our finding that genes encoding synaptic components decline in expression with age is consistent with previous findings that axons and dendrites atrophy in the brains of older individuals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Burke and Barnes, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Dickstein et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Freeman et al., 2008</xref>). However, our data extend these observations to establish that this general process impacts distinct genes in each cell type, as might be expected from the distinct protein compositions of synapses or synapse-related functions in each cell type. Although further studies are necessary to determine whether these principles hold for other regions of the brain, our findings argue that a deeper understanding of neurological aging requires examination of defined cell types rather than whole tissue.</p></sec><sec id="s2-14"><title>Other factors</title><p>To identify inter-individual variability in gene expression that may not be explained by clinical factors, we performed principal component analysis separately for each cell type (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>).

Here we report a robust strategy for cell-type specific expression and epigenetic profiling of human postmortem brain that incorporates features of several prior protocols for single cell or population-based studies of CNS cell types. We demonstrate that antibodies against cell specific ER or membrane proteins can often be used to sort isolated nuclei, increasing substantially the candidate antibodies that can be employed for this purpose. We report highly accurate and comprehensive cell-type specific gene expression profiling of neurons and glia from mouse, rat, and human brains. Using this methodology, we find that even classically defined, cerebellar cell types differ between mouse and human by expression of hundreds of orthologous genes. Species specific expression is confirmed by analysis of single nucleus transcriptome data from the same mouse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Saunders et al., 2018</xref>) and human (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Lake et al., 2018</xref>) cell types, and by ATAC-seq assays demonstrating that active expression is accompanied by enhanced chromatin accessibility. Interestingly, genes expressed in human but not mouse granule neurons are expressed frequently in other regions of the mouse brain. Analysis of cell-type specific data from sixteen human postmortem brains reveals that the specific molecular consequences of aging differ between cell types, although in each case, expression of genes involved in synapse development and maintenance is diminished. Finally, we report the induction of a robust and cell-type specific molecular response of unknown etiology in granule cells from three of sixteen donors. Taken together, the experiments we present document a precise methodology for comprehensive analysis of specific cell types in rodent and human brains, and demonstrate that this approach can provide an improved avenue for investigation of molecular events associated with human cell type function and dysfunction.</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>Species and cell type specific gene expression in the mammalian brain</title><p>Although a consensus definition of cell type has yet to emerge for the mammalian CNS, a recent evolutionary model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Arendt, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Arendt et al., 2016</xref>) is helpful for consideration of the data we have generated here. According to this model, the specific characteristics of homologous cell types can vary as long as they remain defined by a distinctive, shared regulatory apparatus. For example, granule cell or astrocyte gene expression profiles can vary between species, or even in individual cells of a type, without losing their cell type identity. This definition can accommodate both functional changes in cell types between species and altered expression of genes within the cell type due to mutations in <italic>cis</italic>-regulatory sequences. Our data document important differences in the expression of orthologous genes in each cell type between rodent and human brains. Hundreds of these differences are cell type specific and, in some cases, these genes remain expressed in other regions of the brain. We believe these data are exciting and provocative. They demonstrate that the fine-tuned biochemistry of homologous human and mouse CNS cell types is likely to differ significantly, and they argue strongly that differences in gene expression profiles cannot be used as the defining criterion for cell type identity between species.</p><p>The results presented here contribute three additional insights into mammalian brain evolution. First, while they are consistent with previous published examples of <italic>cis</italic>-regulatory sequence divergence as a mechanism of evolution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Maricic et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Prud'homme et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib106">Weyer and Pääbo, 2016</xref>), the lack of highly enriched GO categories for most of the cell specific events we have documented suggests that regulatory sequence changes are major drivers of phenotypic variation between homologous cell types in mammalian brains. This is consistent with the evolutionary model presented above, since it allows substantial evolution of the functional properties of the cell while maintaining the core regulatory complex (CoRC) that defines a given cell type (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Arendt et al., 2016</xref>). Second, the expression differences we have documented are large, and we have restricted our analysis to high confidence orthologous genes. Our data, therefore, complement a previous study of progenitor cells that reported substantive changes in the expression of human genes that lack mouse orthologues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Florio et al., 2015</xref>). We find also that changes in gene expression between species are accompanied by changes in promoter chromatin accessibility, and that DNA sequences at putative regulatory regions around species-enriched genes are less conserved that for unchanged genes. While our work is consistent with previous studies showing that the evolution of promoters is slower than for other regulatory elements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bae et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">De la Torre-Ubieta et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib101">Villar et al., 2015</xref>), our finding suggest that promoter evolution also plays an important role in regulation of cell-type specific gene expression. We note that in mouse enriched granule cell expressed genes, the preferential occurrence of GATA motifs in the gene body and mouse specific expression of the atypical GATA binding factor <italic>Trps1</italic> suggest also that differential transcription factor expression and regulatory domains within genes may contribute to divergent transcription between species. Taken together, these datasets predict that the expressed differences between mouse and human cell types are extensive, cell-type specific, and phenotypically important.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Molecular phenotyping of human CNS cell types</title><p>Recent advances in technologies for human genome sequencing and analysis have led to an astounding increase in our knowledge of the complex genetic causes of human psychiatric and neurological disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Burguière et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Hinz and Geschwind, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib102">Vorstman et al., 2017</xref>). In some cases, recreation of the causative mutations in the mouse genome has resulted in experimental models that are sufficiently accurate for investigation of molecular basis of the disorder (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Lombardi et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Lyst and Bird, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Orr, 2012</xref>), and they have led to the discovery of unexpected features of the disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Baker et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Guy et al., 2007</xref>). In other cases, informative animal models remain elusive (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Lavin, 2013</xref>), and investigation of molecular mechanisms of disease difficult (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Biton et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Medina and Avila, 2014</xref>). Here we present data for three cerebellar cell types in sixteen human brain samples. All samples were obtained from unaffected subjects that received a neuropathological diagnosis of ‘normal adult brain’. The correlation coefficients between samples (r = 0.98–1.0) indicated that the data are extremely reproducible, and that the impact of PMD on the expression profile of nuclear RNAs is minor. Initial indications that gender and age impact gene expression differently in CNS cell types are interesting, and they suggest that nuclear profiling is sufficiently accurate for detailed investigation of both sexually dimorphic human behaviors and the aging of specific brain circuitry. An exciting possibility, for example, is that comparative analysis of human brains may provide critical insight into the impacts of aging on cell types that are selectively vulnerable into late-onset human disorders.</p><p>One of the most intriguing findings we present is that cerebellar granule cells from three brain samples exhibit robust induction of a set of 224 genes containing many immediate early genes, and that are the set is enriched for GO categories (protein folding/refolding, apoptosis, transcriptional response to stress, response to external stimuli, ATPase activity, etc.) that indicate a shared, acute response to an unknown physiological stimulus or an unexpected and robust event occurring during sample processing. As stated above, no correlation with PMD and no induction of glial markers indicative of stroke or brain damage is evident in our data. Although activity dependent gene expression changes have been characterized extensively in cultured mouse granule cells, the response identified in these three human samples is overlapping but distinctive. While we do not wish to speculate on the cause of this response, our data demonstrate that careful comparative studies of cell specific datasets from control samples is an important feature of experimental design for comparative analysis of molecular events associated with responses to adverse genetic or environmental events.</p><p>Finally, our data provide additional examples of the importance of epigenetic mapping in specific cell types as a complement to gene expression analysis. In particular, the use of ATAC-seq mapping (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Buenrostro et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Chen et al., 2016</xref>) of putative regulatory domains for specific CNS cell types confirms that actively expressed genes contain accessible chromatin domains. The lack of these domains in a gene that is not transcribed in the homologous cell type from another species demonstrates that lack of expression reflects complex mechanisms that establish a repressed domain of chromatin proximal to the gene. Although our data do not identify the specific regulatory domains associated with these changes in expression, precedent from studies of enhancer evolution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib101">Villar et al., 2015</xref>) suggest that further investigation of differentially accessible in these genes can lead to a mechanistic understanding of species specific gene expression.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Concluding remarks</title><p>The driving force for development of an accurate and efficient non-genetic method for characterization of the molecular properties of defined CNS cell types is to enable direct investigation of human biology. Given the tremendous explosion of studies identifying the genetic causes of human disease and the demonstrations in both animal models and humans that these can include lesions that involve simple changes in gene dosage, exploration of details of cell types in normal and affected brains is imperative. We believe comparative analysis of human cell type specific data with that obtained in experimental systems is an important approach toward advancing our understanding of the large variety of human disorders that impact CNS circuits.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th>Reagent type (species) <break/>or resource</th><th>Designation</th><th>Source or reference</th><th>Identifiers</th><th>Additional information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Strain (<italic>M. musculus</italic>)</td><td>NeuroD1 EGFP-L10a</td><td>(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Doyle et al., 2008</xref>)</td><td>RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/IMSR_JAX:030262">IMSR_JAX:030262</ext-link></td><td/></tr><tr><td>Strain (<italic>M. musculus</italic>)</td><td>Pcp2 EGFP-L10a</td><td>(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Doyle et al., 2008</xref>)</td><td>RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/IMSR_JAX:030267">IMSR_JAX:030267</ext-link></td><td/></tr><tr><td>Strain (<italic>M. musculus</italic>)</td><td>Sept4 EGFP-L10a</td><td>(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Doyle et al., 2008</xref>)</td><td>RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/IMSR_JAX:030271">IMSR_JAX:030271</ext-link></td><td/></tr><tr><td>Strain (<italic>M. musculus</italic>)</td><td>Glt25d2 EGFP-L10a</td><td>(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Doyle et al., 2008</xref>)</td><td>RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/IMSR_JAX:030257">IMSR_JAX:030257</ext-link></td><td/></tr><tr><td>Strain (<italic>M. musculus</italic>)</td><td>Ntsr1 EGFP-L10a</td><td>(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Doyle et al., 2008</xref>)</td><td>RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/IMSR_JAX:030264">IMSR_JAX:030264</ext-link></td><td/></tr><tr><td>Strain (<italic>M. musculus</italic>)</td><td valign="bottom">Wild type</td><td valign="bottom">Jackson labs</td><td valign="bottom">RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/IMSR_JAX:000664">IMSR_JAX:000664</ext-link></td><td valign="bottom"/></tr><tr><td>Antibody</td><td>anti-NeuN</td><td>Abcam</td><td>RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/AB_2532109">AB_2532109</ext-link></td><td>Rabbit monoclonal;

RNA from fixed nuclei were purified using the Qiagen RNeasy FFPE kit with the following modifications – after Proteinase K digestion, RNA was spun at max speed for 15 min. The supernatant was removed and incubated at 65°C for 30 min, 70°C for 30 min, and 80°C for 15 min. An on-column DNase digestion was performed in place of the in-solution DNAase digestion. RNA quantity was determined using the Qubit RNA HS Assay kit and RNA quality was determined using Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer with RNA 6000 Pico chips. Purified RNA was converted to cDNA and amplified using the Nugen Ovation RNA-seq System V2. cDNA was fragmented to an average size of 250 bp using a Covaris C2 sonicator with the following parameters: intensity 5, duty cycle 10%, cycles per burst 200, treatment time 120 s. Libraries were prepared using the Illumina TruSeq DNA LT Library Prepartion Kit or the NEBNext Ultra DNA Library Prep Kit for Illumina with NEBNext Multiplex Oligos for Illumina. The quality of the libraries was assessed using the Agilent 2200 TapeStation system with D1000 High Sensitivity ScreenTapes. Libraries were sequenced at The Rockefeller University Genomics Resource Center on the Illumina HiSeq 2500 machine to obtain 50 bp single-end reads or on the Illumina NextSeq 500 to obtain 75 bp paired-end reads.

The nuclei isolation protocol (I) is adapted from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Kriaucionis and Heintz (2009)</xref> with slight changes to the percentages of iodixanol in the density gradient, spin speed, and spin times. Nuclei fixation and staining (II) is based generally on protocols for intracellular staining of cells for flow cytometry. Flow cytometry analysis/sorting (III) is performed as usual except that the nucleic acid labeling fluorophore DyeCycle Ruby is added to distinguish single nuclei from aggregates. Preparation of libraries for ATAC-seq (IV) is adapted from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Chen et al. (2016)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Buenrostro et al., 2015</xref>. RNA isolation (<bold>V</bold>) uses Qiagen FFPE kits with modifications. cDNA production (VI) uses Nugen’s Ovation RNAseq V2 kit.

The protocol here will describe how to do this using the NEB Ultra II DNA Library Prep Kit for Illumina with NEBNext Multiplex Oligos for Illumina, although I have also had success using Illumina’s TrueSeq kits as well as off-the-shelf enzymes from NEB along with oligos from IDT.</p><p>Modifications should be made depending on whether sorted nuclei are to be used for analysis or RNA isolation (use buffers for RNA).

The slides were cooled to room temperature and then washed with PBS. Immunofluorescence was performed by blocking for 30 min in IF Block Buffer (3% BSA in PBS with 0.1% TritonX-100), incubated with primary antibody overnight, washed three times with PBS, incubated with secondary antibody for one hour, washed with PBS, stained with DAPI solution (1 ug/mL in PBS) for 15 min, washed two times with PBS, and coverslipped with Prolong Diamond mounting media. For some samples, Tyramide signal amplification was performed as follows: slides were incubated with secondary antibody conjugated to horseradish peroxidase for 1 hr, washed three times with PBS, incubated with Cy3 in Amplification Buffer from the TSA Cyanine three detection kit for 10 min, washed with PBS, and DAPI stained as above. All steps were performed at room temperature. Slides were imaged on a Zeiss LSM700 confocal microscope using the same acquisition settings for mouse and human slides.

Refseq or ENSEMBL gene model annotations for whole genes were downloaded using the UCSC Table Browser tool. While ENSEMBL annotates more genes than Refseq (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib112">Zhao and Zhang, 2015</xref>), we found that visually, our mouse and human RNA-seq data better matches Refseq than ENSEMBL gene models. Because of this, for within species comparisons for mouse and human, we used Refseq annotations. Rat gene models are incompletely annotated by both Refseq and ENSEMBL, but as fewer genes are missing in the ENSEMBL annotation, we chose this annotation for within species comparisons. For comparative analysis across species, we used the ENSEMBL annotation for all species in order to match the list of orthologous transcripts that we obtained from ENSEMBL. The following parameters were used in addition in addition to the default in featureCounts: for paired-end data, fragments are counted instead of reads (-p), chimeric fragments are not counted (-C). For comparative analysis across species, reads are allowed to be assigned to more than one matched meta-feature (-O) in order to avoid problems when genes overlap in one species but not in another. For within-species comparisons, reads that map to more than one matched meta-feature are not counted (default).</p></sec><sec id="s4-22"><title>Genome/gene annotations</title><p><table-wrap id="inlinetable4" position="anchor"><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th valign="top">Purpose</th><th valign="top">Program</th><th valign="top">Species</th><th valign="top">Annotations</th><th valign="top">Source</th><th valign="top">Genome</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td valign="top">Genome alignment</td><td valign="top">STAR/Bowtie2</td><td valign="top">Mouse</td><td valign="top">ENSEMBL</td><td valign="top">ENSEMBL</td><td valign="top">mm10</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Genome alignment</td><td valign="top">STAR/Bowtie2</td><td valign="top">Rat</td><td valign="top">ENSEMBL</td><td valign="top">ENSEMBL</td><td valign="top">rn6</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Genome alignment</td><td valign="top">STAR/Bowtie2</td><td valign="top">Human</td><td valign="top">ENSEMBL</td><td valign="top">ENSEMBL</td><td valign="top">hg38</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Read quantification</td><td valign="top">featureCounts</td><td valign="top">Mouse</td><td valign="top">Refseq</td><td valign="top">UCSC</td><td valign="top">mm10</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Read quantification</td><td valign="top">featureCounts</td><td valign="top">Rat</td><td valign="top">ENSEMBL</td><td valign="top">UCSC</td><td valign="top">rn6</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Read quantification</td><td valign="top">featureCounts</td><td valign="top">Human</td><td valign="top">Refseq</td><td valign="top">UCSC</td><td valign="top">hg38</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Ortholog read quantification</td><td valign="top">featureCounts</td><td valign="top">Mouse</td><td valign="top">ENSEMBL</td><td valign="top">ENSEMBL</td><td valign="top">mm10</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Ortholog read quantification</td><td valign="top">featureCounts</td><td valign="top">Rat</td><td valign="top">ENSEMBL</td><td valign="top">ENSEMBL</td><td valign="top">rn6</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Ortholog read quantification</td><td valign="top">featureCounts</td><td valign="top">Human</td><td valign="top">ENSEMBL</td><td valign="top">ENSEMBL</td><td valign="top">hg38</td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap></p></sec><sec id="s4-23"><title>Generation of ortholog annotations</title><p>Because we were interested in differences in highly conserved cell types, we only wanted to study differences in high confidence orthologs. Schematics for generating annotations for mouse-rat- human orthologs, and mouse-human orthologs are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">2A</xref> respectively. In both cases, we downloaded a list of orthologous transcripts from the ENSEMBL BioMart (release 88). First, we removed any annotation that contained a low confidence pair (ENSEMBL orthology confidence = 0). Next, we removed duplicate annotations as well as any orthologs that were not strictly 1:1, which we defined as transcript that is annotated to be orthologous to more than one transcript in another species. To avoid any differential expression simply due to changes in gene length, we filtered out any genes that change in length by more than two-fold across any species. Additionally, as we were not interested in examining small RNAs, we also filtered out genes smaller than 1 kb in genome length (including untranslated regions). Finally, because we were interested in gene level rather than transcript level differences, we used the annotation for the longest transcript as the gene annotation. Because the rat genome is incompletely annotated, the list of orthologous genes between mouse and human contains around 3,000 more genes than the list of orthologous genes between mouse, rat, and human.</p></sec><sec id="s4-24"><title>Gene count normalization, differential expression analysis, and principal components analysis</title><p>Raw gene count tables were loaded into R and normalization and differential expression analysis was performed using DESeq2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Love et al., 2014</xref>). For age and PMD, numerical covariates were used for modeling. Statistically significant genes were defined as having an adjusted p-value of less than 0.01. Fold change cutoffs were not used unless otherwise noted. The rlog function was used to generate normalized counts for downstream analysis (e.g. heatmaps, clustering). A modified version of the plotPCA function was used to perform principal components analysis and to return both scores and loadings. Analysis of samples from mouse and human revealed no significant batch effects (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>). Additionally, no significant differences in GC content between the RNAseq libraries (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1D</xref>), or relationships between changes in gene expression and gene length or GC content were observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-25"><title>Hierarchical clustering</title><p>Hierarchical clustering was performed using normalized gene counts produced by the rlog function from DESeq2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Love et al., 2014</xref>). Unless specified, the top 250 most variable genes across samples, as computed by the rowVars function, were used for clustering. We use the most variable genes instead of all genes for clustering because in our experience, for comparisons of related cell types such as neuroglia, the most variable genes are the most informative for defining the different functions between cell types. Additionally, our finding that gene expression between different cell types is highly correlated (r = 0.91–0.94 for mouse cerebellar cell types, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>) suggests that clustering using all genes might dilute the strong but relatively few gene expression differences between cell types. This is especially true for comparisons across species - although we tried to compile an annotation consisting of only high confidence orthologous genes, it is possible that small differences in annotation across species can accumulate especially over genes that are expressed at low levels in both species. Default parameters (Euclidean distance and complete linkage) were used with the dist and hclust functions to produce clusters.</p></sec><sec id="s4-26"><title>Specificity index algorithm</title><p>The specificity index (SI) algorithm was previously developed in the lab to find genes that are specific in a dataset of interest as compared to other datasets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Dougherty et al., 2010</xref>). Because the previous algorithm was designed for microarray data, we adapted it to accept RNA-seq data as input. We have also added a feature that incorporates information from biological replicates for calculations. In our implementation, FPKMs are calculated from raw counts to avoid biases toward long genes, and genes less than 1 kb are excluded to avoid biases from extremely short genes. Next, FPKM values are logged and log<sub>10</sub>(FPKM) values are bottomed out at 0 to avoid biases from long, non-expressed genes. To take into account sample replicates, we calculate the mean and standard deviation for all genes within a cell type. SI values are calculated as described previously, but instead of using mean gene expression values as input, we randomly sample from a normal distribution with the mean and standard deviation of gene expression. This process is performed 1000 times and final ranks are averaged across all iterations. R code containing this algorithm can be found at: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/xu-xiao/non_transgenic_cell_type_profiling">https://github.com/xu-xiao/non_transgenic_cell_type_profiling</ext-link>; copy archived at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/elifesciences-publications/non_transgenic_cell_type_profiling">https://github.com/elifesciences-publications/non_transgenic_cell_type_profiling</ext-link> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib108">Xu, 2018</xref>). For analysis of the distribution of highly specific genes in the mouse cerebellum, images for each gene from the Allen Mouse Brain Atlas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Lein et al., 2007</xref>) were examined. Genes that were not in the Atlas at the time of analysis, or genes that showed no staining in any region of the brain were excluded from analysis. The percentage of genes showing proper distribution for the cell type analyzed were calculated.</p></sec><sec id="s4-27"><title>GO analysis</title><p>Significant differentially expressed genes were split into up- and down-regulated (or mouse and human enriched) genes and gene ontology enrichment analysis for each group was performed using clusterProfiler (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib109">Yu et al., 2012</xref>). Significant ontologies were defined as having a q-value of less than 0.01 (default). <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp5">Supplementary file 5</xref> contains all GO analysis results, including significant ontologies from any of the three domains (biological process, molecular function, cellular component). For simplicity of visualization, only biological process ontologies were used. Network based CNET plots were generated using the cnetplot function.</p></sec><sec id="s4-28"><title>Comparison with single nuclei RNA-seq (sNuc-Seq) data</title><p>For analysis of sequencing depth and number of genes detected, we compared our data to mouse single nuclei RNA-seq (sNuc-Seq) data from (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Habib et al., 2016</xref>), which was generated using the Smart-seq2 platform. Because Smart-seq2 generates libraries from full length cDNA, we were able to directly compare these datasets to our bulk nuclear profiles for the same cell types, by downloading raw sequence files (GSE85721), aligning to the mm10 genome, and generating raw counts against mouse Refseq whole gene annotation as described above. We obtained sNuc-Seq data for 17 astrocytes, eight oligodendrocytes, and 7 OPCs. Log transformed transcripts per million (TPMs) were calculated for both sNuc-Seq and our nuclear profiles as described by (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Habib et al., 2016</xref>) except that lengths for the whole gene instead of transcripts (exons only) were used for normalization. To explore the effect of sequencing depth on the number of genes detected, the number of mapped reads for single nuclei data were extracted using samtools flagstat. We next used samtools view to randomly downsample our nuclear data to 50, 100, 200, 300, 400, 500, 600, 800, 1,000, and 1200 thousand reads. We regenerated gene counts using the downsampled data and calculated TPMs. Using the same threshold as (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Habib et al., 2016</xref>), we considered a gene to be expressed if it has a log<sub>2</sub>(TPM + 1)&gt;1.1.</p><p>For expression analysis of species-enriched genes, we downloaded mouse cerebellar single nuclei RNA-seq data from (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Lake et al., 2018</xref>) and human cerebellar single cell RNA-seq data from (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Saunders et al., 2018</xref>). Because the libraries generated in these studies are different from our libraries (e.g. Lake et al. used PolyA selection on their nuclear RNA and Saunders et al. uses RNA from whole cells), we used author provided count matrices (files described in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>) rather than reprocessing their data. We also used author provided cluster annotations. We used Seurat in R to produce violin plots and to obtain normalized counts. Genes detected in fewer than three cells and cells with fewer than 300 or more than 5000 detected genes were omitted. We used global scaling to normalize the gene expression measurements for each cell by the total expression, multiplied by a scale factor of 10,000, and log-transform the result. Normalized expression was used for violin plots. For ECDF plots, for each SN-seq defined cell type, we extracted normalized expression for human-enriched, mouse-enriched, or housekeeping genes (genes obtained from species comparative analysis, as described above) in all samples corresponding to that cell type. For each gene, mean expression across samples or proportion of samples with expression above 1 log<sub>2</sub>(TPM) were calculated plotted.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>We thank members of the Heintz lab for helpful discussion, suggestions, and improvements.

Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Senior Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>In this manuscript, the authors expand the repertoire of FACS-based nuclear isolation for cell-type specific gene expression studies by using antibodies against plasma membrane proteins and ER proteins (in addition to nuclear proteins) to purify nuclei from populations of neurons and non-neuronal cells from rodent and human cerebellum. They compare their FANS data against a genetically-based nuclear sorting method and they make cross-species comparisons to validate the utility of the specific antibody combinations. Finally they use this FANS method to purify specific cell types from human cerebellum for RNAseq and ATACseq, and perform comparative studies to assess gene expression differences with respect to biological features (i.e. age, sex) of the samples. They argue that this method will enhance utility of FACS-based nuclear isolation of specific cell types from brain tissue of species (e.g. rat, human) for which genetic tagging is not feasible. They demonstrate this by comparing cerebellar cell type gene expression from 16 postmortem human brains.</p><p>The manuscript contains high quality data and we agreed with the authors that the idea of applying additional antibodies to FACS methods for species that are not amenable to genetic tagging (especially human) has the potential to be useful in ways that may lead to other discoveries in the future. However none of the findings of the manuscript or the approach itself are entirely novel. In addition the reviewers engaged in a long and productive discussion about the likely impact of this study as compared with single cell sequencing analyses in light of the heterogeneity that is likely to exist within each of the FANS purified populations. We all felt that some additional experimental evidence and substantial changes in the text of the manuscript would be needed to address these concerns, yet in the end we concluded that the manuscript provides a great platform for the discussion of the value of single cell versus population methods.</p><p>With these ideas in mind, we hope the authors will be able to revise the article in the areas suggested below to maximize its impact to the field.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p><italic>1) Redirect to the Tools and Resources section of the journal.</italic> </p><p>Because the datasets are the central part of the manuscript more than the conclusions, we suggest the manuscript be directed to the &quot;Tools and Resources&quot; section of the journal, because this article fits well the description of offering &quot;substantial improvements and extensions of existing technologies&quot; as well as having the &quot;potential to facilitate experiments that address problems that to date have been challenging or even intractable.&quot;</p><p><italic>2) Address analytical consequences of heterogeneity in the populations isolated by FANS.</italic></p><p>The reviewers discussed at length the possibility that heterogeneity within the purified populations could confound some of the outcomes of the analysis. For example, if the population of cells the authors call &quot;astrocytes&quot; based on their FANS profile in mice are actually comprised of more than one cell type and the population of &quot;astrocytes&quot; purified by FANS from human are also comprised of more than one cell type that overlaps but is not identical to the population from mouse, then these populations will be said to have species-specific gene expression that may instead simply reflect the differential FANS enrichment of portions of a heterogeneous cell population. The text of the manuscript needs to be adapted to more directly address this alternative explanation of the data throughout (not just for this experiment). In addition, some additional experimental data should be added to address these concerns. Ideally, the authors could directly compare bulk sequencing from FANS purified cells with scRNA-seq of the same purified population to get a measure of heterogeneity within the purified populations for experiments that provide key conclusions in the study. However we appreciate that this experiment may be beyond the scope of the current study, and agree that it is not necessary for revision of the manuscript (though it would be a great service to the community discussion if the authors were able to perform this comparison). Alternatively, the authors could use a follow up experimental validation of some of the conclusions of the comparative part of the study. This should go beyond the few obvious examples (totally cell-type or species-specific genes) because presumably the bioinformatic differences assessed at the statistical level are driven by differences in the levels of expression of sets of genes. We ask the authors to determine what data they feel can be presented to best address this concern, which was a major point of the reviewers' discussion during the review process.</p><p><italic>3) Enhance information on validation of the FACS antibodies.</italic></p><p>More details need to be provided regarding the specificity and reactivity of the antibodies chosen by the authors. For example, what quantitative or experimental guidance was used to select the antibody dilutions used for FANS? Given the authors' description of the variable detection of NeuN protein (but not RNA) in the mouse and rat cerebellar neural subtypes, this may be a consequence and could have significant implications for the purity, and relative homogeneity of their enriched populations. Furthermore, given the variable nature of cross-species reactivity of antibodies, differences in antibody affinities for subpopulations of cell types such as astrocytes could underlie the apparent differences in gene expression by species as suggested above.</p><p><italic>4) Strengthen the depth of the ATAC-seq data.</italic></p><p>Given that this is one of the more novel sections of the manuscript, the authors should deepen the ATAC-seq analyses. First, because the isolation of nuclei involves formaldehyde fixation (1% PfA for 8 min at room temperature), which is not widely used in ATAC-seq preparations, it is important to experimentally validate whether data quality of cell-type-specific ATAC-seq using fixed nuclei is comparable to standard ATAC-seq assays using unfixed nuclei. For instance, the authors can perform a pair-wise comparison between fixed and unfixed nuclei isolated from mouse cerebellum, so we can assess the data quality of the cell-type specific ATAC-seq data generated from fixed nuclei. Second, the authors can deepen the computational analysis of FANS-based ATAC-seq datasets. For instance, the authors should cross-reference all cell-type-specific ATAC-seq peaks with annotated genomic features (promoters, intergenic regions and gene bodies). Also, TF motifs enriched at these cell-type-specific open chromatin regions should be analyzed and reported. Lastly, it would be good if the authors could discuss the value of the putative cell-type-specific gene regulatory regions (ATAC-seq peaks) in human cerebella to investigators studying human diseases and identifying SNPs or DNA variants (within non-coding regions). Cross-referencing these two data sets might help pinpoint variants of functional significance.</p><p><italic>5) Walk back conclusions of the stress section.</italic></p><p>The final section on the induction of stress responses does not significantly contribute to the study as written and is not experimentally testable. One possible alternative explanation is that induction of IEGs could have arisen from tissue processing (as has been reported in other studies such as PMID 29230054) rather than prior to death. In fact, given the nice effort of this manuscript in discussing the technical details of the methods, this would likely be a better use of this section than speculation about the use of IEG profiles to propose possible pathological insults not evident from the medical information provided with these brains. Another possibility is that the data could arise from trying too hard to find statistical patterns in the data. The entire 'stress' analysis is predicated on the observation that three samples expressed high levels of a single gene. The authors use this justification to cluster these samples together and look for differential genes between this group and the remaining samples. Would the authors find a similar number of differentially expressed genes if they were to shuffle the sample labels and bootstrap this analysis using random sets of three samples?</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.37551.041</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p></disp-quote><p>1) Redirect to the Tools and Resources section of the journal.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Because the datasets are the central part of the manuscript more than the conclusions, we suggest the manuscript be directed to the &quot;Tools and Resources&quot; section of the journal, because this article fits well the description of offering &quot;substantial improvements and extensions of existing technologies&quot; as well as having the &quot;potential to facilitate experiments that address problems that to date have been challenging or even intractable.&quot;</p></disp-quote><p>This is fine with us.

We ask the authors to determine what data they feel can be presented to best address this concern, which was a major point of the reviewers' discussion during the review process.</p></disp-quote><p>In response to the reviewers’ request that we directly compare our data to single nucleus data from the same cerebellar cell types, we have provided an extensive comparative analysis of our data with published snRNAseq data from mouse (Saunders et al., 2018) and human (Lake et al., 2018) cerebellum. This was possible because we focused in the original manuscript (and in this comparison) on very highly and differentially expressed orthologous genes, allowing direct comparison despite the reduced sensitivity of ssRNAseq data. These additional data are presented in Figures 3—figure supplement 2 and 3, and they allow several additional points to be made in the extensively revised section “Cross-species comparison reveals cell-type and species specific genes”. First, and most important, the species specific changes in expression we observed in our data are also evident in the re-analysis of the mouse and human ssRNAseq data. We provide direct measurements of expression of a variety of these genes from the published single nuclei data (Figure 3—figure supplement 3A). Furthermore, plots of mean expression level and proportion of expressing nuclei confirm quantitatively that the species specific expression of the entire class is also evident in the single nucleus data. Second, the differences between mouse and human expression cannot have arisen in our data as a consequence of the sorting of different cell populations because lack of expression in either human or mouse is observed for all categories of cell types that arose in clustering the single cell datasets (Figure 3—figure supplement 3C, D). This is also evident for specific examples in the plots presented in Figure 3—figure supplement 3A and the additional data presented in Figure 4—figure supplement 2. Third, we find that Lake et al. have misinterpreted their single nucleus data to include two populations of Purkinje cells. The expression profiles we have generated, and the expression of classical markers for these cell types, establish that these clusters are actually cerebellar interneurons rather than Purkinje cells. We do not note this error to criticize the published data. Rather, proper classification of the single nucleus data was necessary for us preform the direct comparisons that have been included in this revision.</p><p>3) Enhance information on validation of the FACS antibodies.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>More details need to be provided regarding the specificity and reactivity of the antibodies chosen by the authors.

We have tried to make to clear that although gated populations do not look exactly the same by FACS in the three species, they are nonetheless distinct and reproducible across experiments within the same species.</p><p>In regards to purity, we rigorously validate that each sample contains the expected markers for the target cell type and does not contain markers for other cell types. We hope that the examples of this validation (e.g. Figures 1C, 1D, 1B, Figure 2—figure supplement 1B, Figure 5B), the high correlation between samples containing the same cell type (e.g. Figures 1G, Figure 2D, Figure 5C), and our ability to identify genes including known markers that are highly specific to each cell type using the specificity index (Figures 2E, Figure 2—figure supplement 1A, Supplementary file 3) are indicative of the high purity of our sorts.</p><p>Finally, in regards to the differences in species gene expression, we hope that our additional experiments as described in response to point 2 sufficiently addresses this issue.</p><p>4) Strengthen the depth of the ATAC-seq data.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Given that this is one of the more novel sections of the manuscript, the authors should deepen the ATAC-seq analyses.

The 2016 publication from these groups does fairly extensive validation showing that fixation (1% PFA for 10 minutes at room temperature) does not affect tagmentation efficiency and that data generated from fixed cells are comparable to standard conditions using living cells (R = 0.93). Our Materials and methods section already cites this paper and contains the version of protocol for fixed nuclei. We have updated it to make it clear that we are using the modified rather than standard protocol, have also added a sentence to the Results section to clarify this point.</p><p>To strengthen the depth of the ATAC section of the paper, we have performed several additional analyses, and added additional figures (Figure 4—figure supplement 1, Figure 4—figure supplement 2D-E) and tables (Supplementary files 5-7). These include:</p><p>A) Annotation of all ATAC peaks, including differentially accessible peaks between granule and basket neurons, with genomic features (Supplementary file 5, Figure 4—figure supplement 1A).</p><p>B) Validated that cell-type specific ATAC-seq derived regulatory regions is associated with cell-type specific gene expression. This was performed in two ways:</p><p>- From genes that were identified to by RNA-seq be differentially expressed between granule and basket neurons, analysis of ATAC coverage over promoters and gene bodies (Figure 4—figure supplement 1B, C).</p><p>- From regions that were identified by ATAC-seq to be differentially accessible between granule and basket neurons, analysis of expression of genes associated with different classes of peaks (Figure 4—figure supplement 1D).</p><p>- Motif analysis in each cell type of either all peaks or differentially accessible peaks (Supplementary file 6, Figure 4—figure supplement 2D). From this analysis, we identified GATA motifs in regions that are differentially accessible in mouse granule neurons, and a GATA transcription factor that is expressed in mouse but not human granule neurons.</p><p>- Cross-referencing of human ATAC peak regions with NHGRI-EBI GWAS SNP catalog (Supplementary file 7, Figure 4—figure supplement 2E). Mainly, this analysis can serve as a reference for investigators studying human diseases, although we have highlighted an interesting example of a SNP associated with Parkinson's.</p><p>5) Walk back conclusions of the stress section.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The final section on the induction of stress responses does not significantly contribute to the study as written and is not experimentally testable. One possible alternative explanation is that induction of IEGs could have arisen from tissue processing (as has been reported in other studies such as PMID 29230054) rather than prior to death. In fact, given the nice effort of this manuscript in discussing the technical details of the methods, this would likely be a better use of this section than speculation about the use of IEG profiles to propose possible pathological insults not evident from the medical information provided with these brains. Another possibility is that the data could arise from trying too hard to find statistical patterns in the data. The entire 'stress' analysis is predicated on the observation that three samples expressed high levels of a single gene. The authors use this justification to cluster these samples together and look for differential genes between this group and the remaining samples. Would the authors find a similar number of differentially expressed genes if they were to shuffle the sample labels and bootstrap this analysis using random sets of three samples?</p></disp-quote><p>We have rewritten this section to deemphasize the stress response and instead use it as an example of gene expression changes that are not explained by clinical data. We have added the possibility that these changes may arise due to agonal factors or tissue processing. Finally, we performed resampling to show that the number of genes that are differentially expressed in the three individuals are in the top 1% of the distribution of any random set of three samples (see Figure 7—figure supplement 1).</p></body></sub-article></article>
