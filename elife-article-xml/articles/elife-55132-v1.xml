diversity of biological functions despite sharing a common mechanochemical cycle. Motors are adapted to their function, in part, by tuning the thermodynamics and kinetics of steps in this cycle. However, it remains unclear how sequence encodes these differences, since biochemically distinct motors often have nearly indistinguishable crystal structures. We hypothesized that sequences produce distinct biochemical phenotypes by modulating the relative probabilities of an ensemble of conformations primed for different functional roles. To test this hypothesis, we modeled the distribution of conformations for 12 myosin motor domains by building Markov state models (MSMs) from an unprecedented two milliseconds of all-atom, explicit-solvent molecular dynamics simulations. Comparing motors reveals shifts in the balance between nucleotide-favorable and nucleotide-unfavorable P-loop conformations that predict experimentally measured duty ratios and ADP release rates better than sequence or individual structures. This result demonstrates the power of an ensemble perspective for interrogating sequence-function relationships.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>energy

rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>) perform an extraordinary diversity of biological functions despite sharing a common mechanochemical cycle. For example, myosin-II motors power muscle contraction, whereas myosin-V motors engage in intracellular transport. This diversity is in part due to differences in myosins’ tails and light chain-binding domains, which influence properties like localization and multimerization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Krendel and Mooseker, 2005</xref>). However, some of this diversity is encoded in the motor domains themselves (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Greenberg et al., 2016</xref>). These differences stem from variations in the tunings of the thermodynamics and kinetics of the individual steps of the myosins’ conserved mechanochemical cycle, which couples ATP hydrolysis to actin binding and the swing of a lever arm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">De La Cruz and Ostap, 2004</xref>).</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>The conserved myosin motor domain fold across a diverse phylogeny of motors.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>), A crystal structure (PDB ID 4PA0) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Winkelmann et al., 2015</xref>) of <italic>Homo sapiens</italic> β-cardiac myosin motor domain as an example of the conserved myosin motor domain fold. We note the structural elements most relevant to our work here (loop 1, in purple backbone sticks, and the P-loop, in orange sticks), along with the actin binding region (blue spheres). For orientation, we include the location of the lever arm (black line) and, to indicate the active site, the estimated location of ADP (yellow sticks). (<bold>B</bold>) The phylogenetic relationship the various myosin motor domains examined in this work. Except MYH11, all genes are from <italic>Homo sapiens</italic>. Gene names in blue indicate high duty ratio motors and red indicates low duty ratio. Common protein names are indicated as parentheticals to the left of each gene name. Phylogenetic relationships were inferred from the sequence of the motor domain using <italic>k</italic>-mer distances (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Edgar, 2004a</xref>).</p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-55132-fig1-v1.tif"/></fig><p>Two important and highly variable parameters for motor function are the rate of ADP release, which sets the speed of movement along actin, and the duty ratio, which is the fraction of time a myosin spends attached to actin during one full pass through its mechanochemical cycle. For example, in muscle, myosin-II motors are arranged into multimeric arrays called thick filaments and the individual motors typically have a strong preference for the actin free state (i.e. low duty ratio). These motors quickly detach after pulling on the actin filament to avoid creating drag for other motors in the array, much as a rower quickly removes their oar from the water to minimize drag. In contrast, individual myosin-Va motors have high duty ratios (i.e. prefer the actin-bound state), helping them to processively walk along actin filaments in intracellular transport. Similarly, the speed of myosin movement along actin (in the absence of opposing forces) is set by the rate of ADP dissociation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">De La Cruz and Ostap, 2004</xref>), and it varies by four orders of magnitude from ~0.4 s<sup>−1</sup> for non-muscle myosin-IIb (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Nagy et al., 2013</xref>) to &gt;2800 s<sup>−1</sup> for myosin-XI (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Ito et al., 2007</xref>).</p><p>Unfortunately, inferring the relationship between a motor’s sequence and its biochemical properties is not trivial. For example, one cannot simply predict the duty ratio or ADP release rate of a motor based on phylogeny. Myosin-V family members contain both high duty ratio motors, like myosin-Va, (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">De La Cruz et al., 1999</xref>) and low duty ratio motors, like myosin-Vc (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Takagi et al., 2008</xref>). Similarly, ADP release rates within the myosin-II family vary from ~0.4 s<sup>−1</sup> (non-muscle myosin-IIb) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Nagy et al., 2013</xref>) to &gt;400 s<sup>−1</sup> (extraocular myosin-II) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bloemink et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Johnson et al., 2019</xref>). Insertions and deletions in the myosin motor domain sequence also convey useful, but typically incomplete, information. For instance, pioneering biochemical work <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Sweeney et al., 1998</xref> demonstrated a correlation between the length of loop 1 and ADP release rates in myosin-II motors. However, this observation does not explain how other myosin isoforms that have virtually the same loop 1 lengths have ADP release rates that differ by an order of magnitude (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Deacon et al., 2012</xref>). It is also difficult to predict the effects of mutations implicated in human disease, as the effects cannot be easily predicted from the location of the mutation. For example, in human β-cardiac myosin, an A223T mutation causes a dilated cardiomyopathy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Ujfalusi et al., 2018</xref>) while an I263T mutation has the opposite effect, resulting in a hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Tesson et al., 1998</xref>), despite being separated by less than 6 Å (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Planelles-Herrero et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>Structural studies have provided detailed pictures of many key states in the mechanochemical cycle, but have yet to enable the routine prediction of a motor’s biochemical properties from its sequence. For example, high-resolution structures have illuminated many shared features of myosin motor domains, such as the lever arm swing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Fischer et al., 2005</xref>) and conformational rearrangements associated with changes in nucleotide binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Coureux et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Rayment et al., 1993</xref>). They have also revealed the strain-sensing elements of myosin-I motors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Greenberg et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Mentes et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Shuman et al., 2014</xref>) and the binding modes of many small molecules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Allingham et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Planelles-Herrero et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Winkelmann et al., 2015</xref>). However, the structures of motor domains with vastly different biochemical properties are often nearly indistinguishable. Similarly, computer simulations have begun to reveal aspects of motor function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Blanc et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Chinthalapudi et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Hashem et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Powers et al., 2019</xref>). However, simulating an individual motor domain (~700 residues) is a huge computational expense, so most simulation studies have been based on less than a microsecond of data. Thus, adding binding partners like actin to simulate the full mechanochemical cycle and infer properties like duty ratio is currently infeasible, especially if one wanted to compare multiple isoforms to infer sequence-function relationships.</p><p>Here, we investigate the possibility that the distribution of structures that an isolated motor domain explores correlates with its biochemical properties, allowing the prediction of sequence-function relationships. This hypothesis was inspired by a growing body of work showing that protein dynamics encode function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Henzler-Wildman and Kern, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Knoverek et al., 2019</xref>), even in the absence of relevant binding partners (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Bowman and Geissler, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Hart et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Porter et al., 2019a</xref>). In the case of myosin, we reasoned that as sequence changes modulate motors’ preferences for different states of the mechanochemical cycle, they likely also have a systematic effect on the distribution of conformations explored by the motor, even in the absence of binding partners. Therefore, comparing the distribution of conformations that isolated motor domains sample in solution should reveal signatures of their biochemical differences.</p><p>To test this hypothesis, we ran an unprecedented two milliseconds of all-atom, explicit solvent molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of twelve myosin motors with diverse but well-established biochemical properties (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Tables 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2">2</xref>). Such simulations are adept at identifying excited states, which are lower probability conformational states that are often invisible to other structural techniques. Indeed, our simulations reveal a surprising degree of conformational heterogeneity, particularly in the highly conserved P-loop (or Walker A motif), a common structural element for nucleotide binding that is highly conserved across myosin motor domains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Saraste et al., 1990</xref>). Because of its high conservation, we reasoned that the P-loop would report on the conformation of the nucleotide binding site while still being comparable between motors with otherwise differing sequences. To enable quantitative comparisons, we constructed Markov state models (MSMs) from the MD data for each motor. MSMs are network models of protein free energy landscapes composed of many conformational states and the probabilities of transitioning between these states. They are a powerful means to capture phenomena far beyond the reach of any individual simulation by integrating information from many independent trajectories (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bowman et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Chodera and Noé, 2014</xref>). Analyzing our MSMs, we find they capture sufficient information about myosin motor domains’ thermodynamics and kinetics to produce reasonable estimates of duty ratio and ADP release rates. Thus, MD and MSMs constitute a powerful platform for identifying relationships between the sequence of individual motor domains and their mechanochemical cycles.</p><table-wrap id="table1"

and discussion</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>In simulation, the P-loop adopts conformational states that are rare in crystal structures</title><p>We reasoned that any differences between myosin motor domains in nucleotide handling—ADP release rate or duty ratio, for instance—must somehow be manifest at the active site to have an effect. The P-loop is a highly conserved element of the myosin active site that plays an important role in interacting with the phosphates of the ATP substrate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Gulick et al., 1997</xref>). Consequently, we reasoned that the P-loop would report on the conformation of the nucleotide binding site while still being comparable between motors whose sequences differ elsewhere in the protein. To assess the degree of conformational heterogeneity captured by crystal structures, we first analyzed structures deposited in the PDB (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). We queried the PDB (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Berman et al., 2000</xref>) for myosin motor domains (see Materials and methods), yielding 114 crystal structures. Using sequence alignments (see Materials and methods) we identified the P-loop in each of these models and computed the backbone root mean square deviation (RMSD) of each of these models to a reference structure (β-cardiac myosin, PDB ID 4PA0) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Winkelmann et al., 2015</xref>). We found very little structural diversity among crystal structures, which rarely sample any conformations with P-loop backbone RMSD &gt;0.6 Å away (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>).</p><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>The P-loop conformational distribution observed in silico is substantially broader than the distribution found among crystal structures.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) The number of crystal structures (<italic>y</italic>-axis) as a function of P-loop RMSD to 4PA0 (<italic>x</italic>-axis).

These simulations of human β-cardiac myosin (<italic>Hs MYH7</italic>) were performed in the actin-free, nucleotide-free state for roughly a quarter-millisecond in all-atom explicit-solvent detail used to construct an MSM (see <italic>Methods</italic>). All simulations were conducted using the same force fields and conditions that we have previously used to analyze other systems’ conformational distributions, including β-lactamases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bowman et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Porter et al., 2019a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Zimmerman et al., 2017</xref>), <italic>E. coli</italic> catabolite activator protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Singh and Bowman, 2017</xref>), Ebola virus nucleoprotein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Su et al., 2018</xref>), and G-proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Sun et al., 2018</xref>). Then, using the MSM, we computed the distribution of backbone RMSDs of the P-loop relative to the reference crystal structure.</p><p>In contrast to the relative uniformity among crystal structures, simulations revealed extensive conformational heterogeneity in the P-loop (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). Where crystal structures rarely sampled conformations with RMSD &gt;0.6 Å, in simulation we observe broad sampling (i.e. high-probability density) in regions from 0.2 Å RMSD all the way to ~1.5 Å RMSD from the starting structure. Only 10 of 114 (9%) crystal structures’ conformations were &gt;0.6 Å RMSD from the reference conformation, whereas fully 58% of the distribution observed in silico is above 0.6 Å RMSD from the reference conformation. These results suggest our simulations may provide mechanistic insight not previously accessible from crystal structures alone.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Simulations suggest that the nucleotide-free motor explores distinct nucleotide-favorable and nucleotide-unfavorable states</title><p>We reasoned that P-loop conformations identified by our simulations might have important implications for motors’ nucleotide handling. For example, modulating the relative probabilities of these conformations would provide a facile mechanism by which sequence variation might tune the mechanochemical cycle.</p><p>To assess the nucleotide compatibility of the P-loop conformations we observe in simulation, we sought to systematically compare these conformations with crystal structures with and without nucleotide. To do this, we built a map of P-loop conformational space using the dimensionality reduction algorithm Principal Components Analysis (PCA) to learn a low-dimensional representation of the pairwise interatomic distances between P-loop atoms that retains as much of the geometric diversity in the input as possible (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplements 1</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">3</xref>, and Materials and methods for details) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Shlens, 2014</xref>). We then projected the states of our MSM built from our MYH7 simulations onto principal components (PCs) one and three to visualize the free energy surface sampled by our simulations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>, green level sets). Principal component two chiefly reported on geometric differences between low-probability confirmations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>). Using the same PCA, we then projected each crystal structure’s P-loop conformation into the PC1/PC3 space, plotting each as a point (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>, points). Points labeled with PDB IDs represent crystal structures with P-loops &gt;0.6 Å backbone RMSD away from the reference structure 4PA0 used above. We also classified each structure (see Materials and methods) as nucleotide-bound (yellow points) or nucleotide-free (purple points). Then, we compared the frequency at which nucleotide-bound and nucleotide-free P-loop conformations were found in various conformations.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig3" position="float"><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>Excited P-loop states are less compatible with nucleotide than the states preferred in crystal structures.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) The β-cardiac whole-motor MSM-derived P-loop conformational space projected onto PCs 1 and 3 reveals two distinct free energy basins (green level sets).

Error bars represent the 95% confidence interval of 1000 bootstrap realizations. (<bold>C</bold>) The re-orientation of the S180 backbone carbonyl accounts for the split between upper and lower basins. Points represent P-loop conformations from each state in the β-cardiac whole-motor MSM projected onto the same PCs as in panel A.

Surrounding the model, insets show example configurations of the P-loop in sticks colored to match the state they represent. State A is associated with a conformation of the S180 (pink sticks) carbonyl bond vector (white arrow) directed away from the nucleotide binding pocket, whereas states B-D are associated with the opposite orientation of the S180 backbone carbonyl bond vector. The A state conformation is the conformation found in most crystal structures.

Once the distribution of P-loop conformations is projected onto two PCs (the green level sets in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>), we observe two broad minima in the P-loop conformational landscape. We refer to these apparent minima as the upper and lower basin for brevity but recognize that other minima may exist and be obscured by the projection of a high-dimensional space into a low-dimensional space. The lower basin (&lt;0.6 Å RMSD from the reference structure) contains 91% of crystal structures (104/114) and, because 80% (84/105) of these structures are bound to nucleotide, it is highly likely to represent a nucleotide-compatible conformation. In contrast, despite being populated roughly equally in simulation, regions outside the lower basin (≥0.6 Å RMSD) contain only 9% (10/114) of crystal structures. And, because only one (11%) of these structures is nucleotide bound, these regions are significantly depleted in nucleotide-bound structures (odds ratio = 0.03, p&lt;1.3×10<sup>−5</sup> by Fisher’s exact test), strongly implying that they are less or not at all nucleotide compatible. Interestingly, this single exception (PDB ID 2Y8I, <italic>Dictyostelium discoideum</italic> myosin-II G680V) is a highly perturbed motor that has been shown to have low ATPase activity, low motility and a disordered allosteric network (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Kinose et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Patterson et al., 1997</xref>, p.), potentially contributing to its aberrant conformation.</p><p>To characterize the structural differences between nucleotide-favorable and nucleotide-unfavorable states captured in the simulations, we coarse-grained our MSM into a model with just five states, called A-E. We used hierarchical clustering to group the thousands of states explored by <italic>Hs</italic> MYH7 into five states based only on their P-loop conformations (see Materials and methods). Then, using the assignment of each frame from our simulations to one of these five states, we fit a five-state MSM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>, node sizes indicate equilibrium probabilities, arrow weights indicate transition probabilities). The most probable single state is the A state (49%), which encompasses the entire lower basin and, as we will see below, appears to form favorable interactions with nucleotide based on the conformation of the P-loop. The excited, apparently nucleotide-disfavoring conformations in the upper basin are split into 3 states, B-D, which together account for 50% of the equilibrium probability. Thus, β-cardiac myosin spends about equal time in nucleotide-favorable (state A) and nucleotide-unfavorable states (states B-D) in simulations. Finally, state E (1%, too low to be seen clearly in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>), involves a condensation of the P-loop into an extension of the HF helix, similar to the crystal structure 4L79 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Shuman et al., 2014</xref>). The reduced number of states in this MSM allowed us to inspect a small number of high-probability conformations near the mean of each P-loop state, which we took as exemplars of each of the five P-loop states.</p><p>Comparing the states of our MSM reveals that the dominant geometrical difference between nucleotide-favorable and nucleotide-unfavorable P-loop states is the orientation of the peptide bond between S180 and G181 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). In the nucleotide-favorable state A (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>, lower right inset), the S180 backbone carbonyl (shown in pink sticks with a white arrow) is oriented away from the phosphates of the nucleotide, enabling the nucleotide to bind to the active site. In contrast, nucleotide-disfavoring states (labeled B-D in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>) orient the S180 backbone carbonyl toward the phosphate groups of the nucleotide. This positions the carbonyl oxygen in a way that appears to sterically clash with the phosphates of nucleotide. It also orients the negative end of the carbonyl bond’s electric dipole toward the nucleotide binding site and the negatively charged phosphates of ADP and ATP. Taken together, our observations about the geometry of the excited, nucleotide-disfavoring state in the upper basin are consistent with a lowered capacity for nucleotide binding.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>The balance between nucleotide-favorable and nucleotide-unfavorable P-loop states predicts duty ratio</title><p>We reasoned that motors with a higher probability of adopting nucleotide-favorable P-loop conformations in isolation are likely to have an increased affinity for nucleotide and, therefore, spend more time in nucleotide-bound states of the mechanochemical cycle. Our reasoning is that motors that prefer nucleotide-favorable P-loop conformations in isolation pay a lower energetic cost to adopting these same nucleotide-favorable conformations when they form a complex with nucleotide. Supporting this logic, it has been observed that, absent load, a large free energy difference between ADP-bound and nucleotide-free states is associated with a low duty ratio (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bloemink and Geeves, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Nyitrai and Geeves, 2004</xref>). Thus, we hypothesized that a preference for the nucleotide-favorable A state should correlate with low duty ratio.</p><p>To test if differences in the probability of excited states encodes information about duty ratio, we simulated an additional seven myosin isoforms of differing duty ratio for a total of ~2 ms of aggregate simulation in all-atom, explicit solvent detail. Specifically, we simulated four human low duty ratio myosin motor domains (from myosin-II genes MYH13, MYH7, MYH10, and myosin-I gene MYO1B) and four human high duty ratio myosin motor domains (from genes MYO5A, MYO6, MYO7A, and MYO10), for between 125 and 325 µs each (see Materials and methods). These motors were selected because extensive kinetic characterization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bloemink et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">De La Cruz et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">De La Cruz et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Deacon et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Homma and Ikebe, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Lewis et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Nagy et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Watanabe et al., 2006</xref>) has revealed very diverse kinetic tuning, providing a robust test of our hypotheses. Because no crystal structure of the human sequence was available for any of these proteins except MYH7, homology models were built in each case and used as starting points for simulations (see Materials and methods and <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>). To allow for direct comparisons between motors, we used the same PCA and state definitions as described above for MYH7.</p><p>As expected, high duty ratio motors have a stronger in silico preference for nucleotide-favoring P-loop states than low duty ratio motors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref> shows an example of this effect on the P-loop conformational distributions of high duty ratio motor MYO6 and low duty ratio motor MYH7. The low duty ratio motor explores both upper and lower basins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>, left) while the high duty ratio motor strongly prefers the lower basin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>, right). Provocatively, when motors are crystallized without ligand, only motors with low unloaded duty ratios have been crystallized with P-loops outside the nucleotide-favorable conformation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>, red and blue points). Of 29 unliganded crystal structures, 8/20 (40%) of low duty ratio motors’ P-loops crystallized outside the A state, whereas 0/9 (0%) high duty ratio motors’ P-loops crystallized outside state A (p&lt;0.034 by Fisher’s exact test, see Materials and methods).</p><fig id="fig4" position="float"><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><title>The free energy landscape of the P-loop encodes duty ratio.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Free energy landscapes implied by whole-motor domain MSMs in the PC1/PC3 plane demonstrate that the upper basin is well sampled by an example low duty ratio motor (MYH7, left) and poorly sampled by an example high duty ratio motor (MYO6, right).

Decreased stability of the nucleotide-favorable conformation in these low duty ratio motors could explain this observation.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>Simulations predict ADP release rates better than loop 1 length does by capturing sequence-specific effects</title><p>Because ADP release allows a motor to adopt nucleotide-incompatible P-loop conformations, we reasoned that the rate at which a motor can transition to these conformations in silico might correlate with in vitro ADP release kinetics. While we expect a correlation, we acknowledge that the absolute rates will almost certainly differ, since the rates themselves likely differ in the presence and absence of nucleotide. To test for a correlation, we first focus on data sets that examine several motors under the same experimental conditions. Identical conditions are important because in vitro biochemical rates depend strongly on experimental conditions such as salt and temperature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Chizhov et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">De La Cruz and Ostap, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Lewis et al., 2012</xref>).

A notable exception, however, was the myosin with wild-type loop 1, which had an ADP release rate more than three times faster than predicted by the length-based model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>). This deviation from a purely length-driven ADP release rate led these authors to hypothesize that there must also be sequence-specific effects of loop 1 on ADP release rate.

We selected the alanine mutant (<italic>Gg</italic> MYH11-ala) because it, with just five mutations, shifted the wild-type loop in line with the length-only model proposed by Sweeny et al. Then, we selected the extreme points that were well fit by the loop length-only model: the loop 1 deletion (<italic>Gg</italic> MYH11-∆loop1) and the construct using the loop 1 from <italic>Xenopus</italic> non-muscle myosin (<italic>Gg</italic> MYH11-xeno). We simulated these four constructs for 6–16 µs each beginning from a homology model (see Materials and methods and Table S1) and built whole-motor MSMs which, as before, were used to compute five-state P-loop MSMs. Each P-loop MSM contains a parameter P(A→B) which captures the probability that a conformation in state A transitions to state B within a fixed period of time (known as the lag time of the model). We then compared P(A→B) to ADP release rates measured in vitro for these four constructs.</p><p>As expected, there is a strong positive relationship (Pearson’s R = 0.99) between the P(A→B) fit by our MSMs and in vitro ADP release rate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>). This is stronger than the equivalent correlation for the length-based model (Pearson’s R = 0.72). Importantly, the rank order of the four isoforms is correct, whereas using a loop 1 length-only model dramatically underestimates the ADP release rate for the wild-type motor. Rank order is used because, as noted above, the timescales of the transition (mean first passage times from state A to B are on order of 5–500 nanoseconds) are not directly comparable to experimentally measured values because nucleotide is absent in the simulations. Together, the fact that the sequence change is small (only five residues differ between wild type and the alanine mutant) and the change is distant (~25 Å) from the P-loop indicate that our model is exquisitely sensitive to sequence, even at sites distant from the active site.</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>P-loop kinetics in silico correlate with ADP release rates across conditions</title><p>To further assess the generalizability of our model, we considered several additional datasets that relax constraints placed on data sets in the previous section. First, we relaxed the constraint that motors differ by just one structural element (loop 1). Specifically, we considered several skeletal myosin isoforms, including MYH7 and MYH13 that Johnson et al (35) studied under the same conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D and E</xref>, yellow points). These motor domains are an interesting case because, at 80% sequence identity, their sequences differ much more than Sweeney et al’s constructs, and these differences are distributed throughout the protein. Crucially, and despite having roughly the same loop 1 length, their ADP release rates differ by about an order of magnitude (59 s<sup>−1</sup> vs 400 s<sup>−1</sup>). Owing to the fact that Johnson et al’s data were collected under different experimental conditions than Sweeny et al’s data (5 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub> at 25°C vs 1 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub> at 20°C with different light chains), we only expect a general trend to hold, since motors’ properties are very sensitive to magnesium, temperature, and light chain identity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Chizhov et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Heissler and Sellers, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Lewis et al., 2012</xref>). Second, we assessed the trend in two human non-muscle motor domains, MYO1B and MYH10 with measurements carried out under different conditions. Notably, because they both release ADP very slowly, they test our model’s capacity to evaluate very slow ADP release rates.</p><p>Consistent with our expectations, and despite the diverse experimental conditions, we still observe a reasonable correlation between P(A→B) and ADP release across all data sets (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>, Pearson’s R = 0.75). This dramatically improves on the length-based model (Pearson’s R = 0.14). Importantly, under the matched experimental conditions for MYH7 and MYH13 we still find the correct order of ADP release rates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>, yellow points), suggesting that this method generalizes well to the larger phylogenic distances between myosin isoforms. Furthermore, MYO1B and MYH10 are correctly identified as very slow releasers of ADP, although the point estimates appear to be quite noisy. MYH10 is known to be exquisitely sensitive to light chains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Heissler and Sellers, 2014</xref>), so it is not surprising that it is one of the greatest outliers given that we did not include these in our simulations.</p></sec><sec id="s2-6"><title>Structural models provide insight into the mechanism by which sequence influences P-loop conformational distributions</title><p>Even though the sequences of motors’ P-loops are identical, their conformational distributions differ.

We then compared them between motors to understand how their presence or absence might bias the balance between A and B states for each motor. While an exhaustive analysis is beyond the scope of this work, we have highlighted two examples of such interactions in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>.</p><fig id="fig6" position="float"><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><title>Examples of specific P-loop interactions that appear to modulate stability of specific P-loop states.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) MYO6, a high duty ratio motor, features an interaction between the backbone carbonyl oxygen of S153 (analogous to S180 in MYH7) and the side chain amide group of K670 on the switch-II loop. Myosin-IIs (MYH13, MYH7, and MYH10) feature an isoleucine at this position, eliminating this A state-stabilizing interaction. (<bold>B</bold>) In MYO6, the sidechain of K670 interacts tightly with the S153 backbone, whereas in MYH7, there is virtually no direct interaction between the homologous positions (S180 and I674). This presumably leads to a stabilization of state A in MYO6, contributing to its preference for the A state over the B state. An approximate cutoff distance for interaction, 3 Å, is marked as a vertical line. (<bold>C</bold>) In MYH7, a low duty ratio motor with a high relative B state probability permits interaction between the backbone carbonyl oxygen of S242 and the sidechain hydroxyl group of S180. This geometry is permitted by a small alanine sidechain at position 463. (<bold>D</bold>) When the P-loop is in state B, the sidechain hydroxyl group of S180 hydrogen bonds with the backbone carbonyl oxygen of S242 in MYH7, whereas MYO7A’s homologous positions do not interact in either state. This interaction presumably increases the relative probability of the B state relative to the A state and could in part account for MYH7’s higher propensity to adopt this excited conformation. The reference distance 3 Å is marked as a vertical line.</p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-55132-fig6-v1.tif"/></fig><p>First, we observed that the A state of the P-loop in the high duty ratio motor MYO6 is stabilized by an interaction between the backbone carbonyl oxygen of the P-loop serine (homologous to S180 in MYH7) and the sidechain amide group of the switch-II residue K670 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>). A notable difference occurs in the low duty ratio myosin-II motors in our study (MYH13, MYH7, and MYH10), all of which feature an isoleucine at this position (MYH7 I674). Thus, where the strong interaction between the lysine sidechain and P-loop backbone stabilizes the nucleotide-compatible A state in MYO6, this interaction does not exist at all in MYH7, presumably destabilizing this state. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref> shows that the sidechain of I674 in MYH7 almost never forms a direct interaction (distance &lt;0.35 nm) with S180 even in P-loop state A, whereas K670 of MYO6 almost always does when the P-loop occupies the A state. We propose that the substitution of an aliphatic residue at this position in myosin-II motors destabilizes the nucleotide-favoring A state, leading to an increased preference for the nucleotide-disfavoring B state, ultimately resulting in a lower predicted duty ratio. Notably, however, many other low duty ratio myosin classes, such as MYO1B which we simulated here and correctly identify as a low duty ratio motor, feature a lysine at this position, implying that this substitution may be a peculiar innovation limited to myosin-IIs.</p><p>Second, we also observed that the B state of the P-loop in the low duty ratio motor MYH7 is stabilized by an interaction between the backbone carbonyl oxygen of S242 (in the Switch-I loop) and the S180 sidechain hydroxyl group (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>), but that this interaction does not occur in the high duty ratio motor MYO7A (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>). This interaction is specific to the nucleotide-disfavoring B state of MYH7 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>), and hence presumably stabilizes that P-loop state in MYH7 relative to MYO7A. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>, this interaction in MYH7 requires the Switch-I loop to move ‘inwards,’ toward the peptide bond between G464 and A463, with which it also sometimes interacts. At the position homologous to A463, however, the high duty ratio motor MYO7A features a phenylalanine (F439). We propose that the bulky, aromatic sidechain in MYO7A (F439) prevents the Switch-I loop from engaging the P-loop serine’s sidechain, whereas the small aliphatic one (<italic>MYH7</italic>’s A463) does not. On net, this leads to a lower overall preference for the nucleotide-disfavoring B state in MYO7A and thus a higher overall duty ratio prediction. Interestingly, MYO6 has an alanine at this position, indicating that this substitution is not strictly required for high duty ratio.</p><p>These examples demonstrate how physically realistic, atomically detailed models can provide mechanistic insight into how sequence variation modulates specific interactions to alter a protein’s function. Of course, there are many interactions at play, and consideration of multiple interactions is necessary to fully explain duty ratio. Therefore, a successful pipeline for predicting duty ratio predictions will probably require additional molecular dynamics simulations for any new variant. Specifically, we suggest that a fruitful design strategy would be to select mutations based on logic like that outlined above, then to simulate the newly designed sequences to check that they behave as intended (in silico), and then to perform experimental tests of these predictions. Such an approach has proved powerful in past applications to other proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Hart et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Zimmerman et al., 2017</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-7"><title>Conclusions</title><p>In this work, we used computer simulations of isolated myosin motor domains to predict the in vitro ADP release rate and duty ratio of unloaded myosin motors. To do this, we identified systematic shifts in the distribution of conformations that a motor explores that correlate with changes in biochemistry, rather than by directly simulating the biochemical processes themselves, which would have been prohibitively expensive. While binding partners (actin and nucleotide, for instance) and structural elements outside the motor domain almost certainly affect the distribution of conformations, our results demonstrate that it is nevertheless possible to extract reasonable estimates for at least some unloaded biochemical properties from only the isolated motor domain’s conformational distribution. The ability of the isolated motor domain’s fluctuations to predict these parameters likely stems from a link between the isolated and bound conformational distributions. In other words, because the motor domain active site must adopt certain key conformations during its functional interactions with binding partners (i.e. nucleotide and actin), it is nearly guaranteed to at least transiently sample those conformations even in the absence of those binding partners. Importantly, our simulations only require a reasonable homology model as a starting point, so our methods should be applicable to a broad range of motor variants, including mutations implicated in disease.</p><p>Given the high degree of structural conservation of the myosin motor domain, it was not previously possible to directly predict the duty ratio or kinetics for a given myosin isoform from the sequence or structure of a motor domain alone. Our studies demonstrate that the duty ratio and the rate of ADP release are not captured by a single structural element, but rather by the distribution of conformations that the motor explores in solution. Throughout our simulations, we observed that the distribution of P-loop conformations is sensitive to relevant sequence changes, both large and small, throughout the myosin motor domain. Presumably, these changes are allosterically propagated through the myosin motor domain through complex networks of coupled motions. Thus, capturing the difference between the wild-type and alanine-substituted chicken gizzard myosins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>), for instance, required the model to capture the allosteric perturbation induced by a change of a few dozen atoms in a molecule of ~12,500 atoms at a distance of ~25 Å (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Meanwhile, classifying the duty ratio of diverse myosin motors requires the P-loop to integrate signals from across the molecule into a single overall conformational preference. This underscores a key advantage of physics-based simulations, which is the ability to represent these allosteric networks by modeling in detail the complex, nonlinear couplings throughout the molecule.</p><p>One tantalizing interpretation of the excited states of the P-loop we observe in silico is that they may be related to the biochemically-observed ‘open’ and ‘closed’ states that nucleotide-free myosin motors populate in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Geeves et al., 2000</xref>). In our simulations, we see that the P-loop fluctuates between conformations that are nucleotide-compatible and conformations that probably are not. In biochemical experiments, at least some myosin isoforms in the nucleotide-free actin-bound state fluctuate between a state that binds nucleotide and a state that does not. It has also been shown that the equilibrium between these two biochemical states (K<sub>α</sub>), correlates with duty ratio and the transition rate from the nucleotide binding incompetent state to the nucleotide binding competent state (k<sub>+α</sub>) correlates with the ADP release rate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bloemink and Geeves, 2011</xref>). Similarly, we showed that the equilibrium between nucleotide-favorable and nucleotide-disfavorable conformations predicted duty ratio, while the rate of transition predicted ADP release rate. A simple explanation for these similarities is that there may be a correspondence between these biochemical states and the structural states that we observe in our MSMs in silico.</p><p>Finally, our results highlight the general capacity of computational modeling to link sequence and function. One immediate application of our work here is to estimate in silico the biochemical parameters of new or difficult-to-study myosins. In the near term, constructing such models could help us learn more about the atomic basis for healthy functional diversity in myosin motors, and how small changes can give rise to malfunction and disease. Indeed, in the coming years it may prove possible to use these models as a tool for studying patient-specific mutations by understanding the atomic basis for diseases caused by dysfunction of myosin motors or to aid in developing therapeutics. Finally, because we find no reason to believe our approach’s applicability is limited to myosin motors, we expect the techniques we have presented here to be of use for any protein where the physics that maps sequence to biochemistry is not straightforward.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s3-1"><title>Preparation of homology models</title><p>For simulations, the initial structure of each myosin motor domain was prepared by first obtaining the full-length protein’s sequence from PubMed Protein, trimming the sequence down to include only the motor domain using crystal structure 4PA0 of MYH7 as a guide, and submitting that sequence to SWISS-MODEL for homology modeling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Waterhouse et al., 2018</xref>).

Specifically, we plotted: 4DBP, 2MYS, 3I5H, 2Y0R, 2BKH, 6I7D, 1DFK, 1OE9, 3I5I, 2OS8, 4P7H, 5V7X, 4ZLK, 1MNE, 1FMV, 2AKA, 3MYL, 2EC6, 4L79, 3L9I, 2BKI, 2Y9E, 1KK7, 1W8J, 2 × 51, 4PA0, 4PD3, 3I5G, and 1SR6. Based upon previous biochemical experiments, myosin-Is and IIs were assumed to have low duty ratios. Myosin-VIs were assumed to have high duty ratio. Myosin-Va and Vb from all organisms were assumed to have high duty ratios and Myosin-Vc was assumed to have a low duty ratio. <italic>Plasmodium falciparum</italic> MyoA (6I7D) has been shown to have a high duty ratio (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Robert-Paganin et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>Myosin class was inferred as follows. Where a roman numeral was given in the PDB description (e.g. Myosin-II) this classification was used. Otherwise, if ‘muscle’ or ‘striated’ was appeared in the PDB polymerDescription field, the myosin was classified as a myosin-II. Finally, in the absence of other indicators, myosins from <italic>Doryteuthis pealeii</italic>, <italic>Placopecten magellanicus</italic>, and <italic>Argopecten irradians</italic> were classified as Myosin-IIs, and myosins from <italic>Plasmodium falciparum</italic> were classified as Myosin-XIVs.</p></sec><sec id="s3-12"><title>Visualization</title><p>Proteins structures were visualized and rendered with PyMOL.

their mechanochemical properties&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by José Faraldo-Gómez as the Senior/Reviewing Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Senior Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>This work provides important insights into a question of broad significance in molecular biophysics, namely how the functional mechanisms of proteins emerge from their structural dynamics. The authors carry out extensive molecular dynamics simulations of several myosin motor domains to probe the conformational distribution of the nucleotide binding site. The results are used to construct the free energy landscape and kinetics for the transition between different metastable states in the general framework of Markov State models (MSM). The underlying hypothesis is that the intrinsic free energy landscape of the binding site (or the P-loop, in particular) in the absence of nucleotide contributes to explain the nucleotide binding properties of the motor domain. In this perspective, key properties of the motor domain that are correlated with functional features, such as duty ratio, are encoded in sequence. The hypothesis is supported by the observed correlation between experimentally measured (in previous literature) duty ratios and ADP release rates with the computed free energy difference between the two key basins, which correlate with the nucleotide compatible and nucleotide-free structural states. Overall, the study is a good demonstration of how extensive, state-of-the-art MD simulations can be used to capture somewhat subtle yet mechanistically relevant features in complex molecular systems. It is easy to envisage how a similar methodology could be used to probe other biological problems that involve shift of populations among different structural states. The work is also a good illustration of how to leverage information from homology modeling, i.e. through a systematic analysis of general mechanistic features in a family or collection of models, as opposed to detailed aspects specific of given protein, likely to be beyond the accuracy of such models.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The analysis provided points towards a specific peptide bond whose dynamics causes the backbone carbonyl oxygen of S180 to point either towards the nucleotide binding site or away from it. It would be of great interest to provide an experimentally testable hypothesis by predicting a mutation that specifically determines the conformational preference of this peptide bond, thereby shifting the activity either up or down for a particular myosin.</p><p>2) In Figure 4B, the authors claim the error bars are too small to be seen. This is surprising given that the underlying data for each point is a few microseconds of MD simulation. The authors should carefully explain and justify their error analysis. If the MD data is fragmented into, say, 10 parts, do the MSM deduced from each fragment yield indistinguishable free-energy difference values? Showing some trajectories in which the system switches between basins might help make this point also.</p><p>3) In the whole-motor Markov models, a lag time of only ~1 ns (Table 2) does not seem immediately intuitive. This choice requires some kind of rationale and, ideally, data to support it.</p><p>4) The authors indicate that phylogeny relationships were used to infer duty ratios. This approach needs justification and validation, if indeed it was actually used in the data shown – in which case inferred values should be noted (not the same as a measurement).</p><p>5) In their analysis, the authors identify an interesting mutation distant from the active site that nevertheless affects the ADP off rate, for which the transition rate P(A-&gt;B) is taken as proxy. Do the simulations provide insight into how this distant mutation alters the barrier for the A-&gt;B transition?</p><p>6) Given that the identified thermodynamic (duty ratio) and kinetic (ADP off rate) functional readouts point towards the same A-B transition, do the data allow to speculate whether the two are inherently linked to each other or whether they might have evolved independently?</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.55132.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The analysis provided points towards a specific peptide bond whose dynamics causes the backbone carbonyl oxygen of S180 to point either towards the nucleotide binding site or away from it.

In particular, we identify two examples of changes to the sequence of the myosin motor active site that appear to modulate the probability of the A and B states of the P-loop, presumably shifting the balance of these two states for particular motors one way or the other.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) In Figure 4B, the authors claim the error bars are too small to be seen.

In the case of Figure 4B (the figure in question), each point is based on ~250 µs. We have clarified this point in the text:</p><p>“Error in simulated free energy differences were estimated by jackknife resampling of trajectories and were too small to be visualized as error bars. Aggregate simulation times are listed in Table 2 and were between 126 µs and 323 µs for each point.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) In the whole-motor Markov models, a lag time of only ~1 ns (Table 2) does not seem immediately intuitive. This choice requires some kind of rationale and, ideally, data to support it.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree this is an important issue. We have therefore noted in the Materials and methods section:</p><p>“… Lag times were chosen by the implied timescales test…”</p><p>This is a standard practice in the field, in which one examines the slowest relaxation rates as a function of the lag time used. If the state definitions are sufficient to satisfy the Markov assumption, then these “implied timescales” will become invariant with respect to the lag time. In our case, this invariance is achieved by lag times of 1 ns and greater.</p><p>In addition, much previous work on this type of question has also used lag times on the order of ~1 ns (see, for example, Zimmerman et al., 2017; Singh and Bowman, 2017; Sun et al., 2018; Porter et al., 2019a).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) The authors indicate that phylogeny relationships were used to infer duty ratios. This approach needs justification and validation, if indeed it was actually used in the data shown – in which case inferred values should be noted (not the same as a measurement).</p></disp-quote><p>This is a crucial point and we thank the reviewers for noting this ambiguity. To clarify this, we have added the following to the text:</p><p>“For each of the human myosin motors we simulated, an experimental duty ratio is available for either human or a vertebrate relative (e.g. cow, chicken) motor. Thus, wherever numerical duty ratios are reported (e.g. Figure 4B), these biochemical measurements are used.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) In their analysis, the authors identify an interesting mutation distant from the active site that nevertheless affects the ADP off rate, for which the transition rate P(A-&gt;B) is taken as proxy. Do the simulations provide insight into how this distant mutation alters the barrier for the A-&gt;B transition?</p></disp-quote><p>We are very interested in this question. Our preliminary results suggest the mechanism is nontrivial, however, and we plan to address the allostery between the active site and loop 1, as well as between these regions and other sites, such as the actin binding interface, converter domain, and relay helix in future work.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) Given that the identified thermodynamic (duty ratio) and kinetic (ADP off rate) functional readouts point towards the same A-B transition, do the data allow to speculate whether the two are inherently linked to each other or whether they might have evolved independently?</p></disp-quote><p>This is a fascinating question! On one hand, because the ADP off rate sets the rate of actin detachment, and duty ratio is the balance between actin attachment and detachment, there is an inextricable link between duty ratio and actin detachment. On the other hand, it is well-known (e.g. De La Cruz and Ostap, 2009) that duty ratio (thermodynamics) and ADP release (kinetics) appear to be under independent selective pressure. In fact, surprisingly, the fastest-releasing known myosin is a high duty ratio myosin.</p></body></sub-article></article>
