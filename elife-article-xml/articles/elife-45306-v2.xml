Especially, the light–dark cycle strongly affects development. Several studies have reported that circadian disruption by light-at-night affects weight gain in vertebrates during early neonatal or posthatch life (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Brandon et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Mann et al., 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Rozenboim et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Takahashi et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Yang et al., 2015</xref>). In addition, previous studies have demonstrated that a light–dark cycle promotes better brain development than does constant light or constant darkness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Bakkum et al., 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Brooks et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Dulcis and Spitzer, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Li et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Ohta et al., 2006</xref>). However, little is known about the molecular mechanisms that control how environmental light conditions affect brain development.</p><p>The neuroendocrine system has a critical role in brain development in vertebrates, and its disruption induces abnormal development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Gore, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">León-Olea et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Walker and Gore, 2017</xref>). In the cerebellum, neuroestrogen promotes Purkinje dendritic growth, spinogenesis, and synaptogenesis during neonatal life (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Haraguchi et al., 2012a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Sakamoto et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Sasahara et al., 2007</xref>). The pituitary adenylate cyclase-activating polypeptide (PACAP) protects cerebellar granule cells from apoptosis through the inhibition of caspase-3 activity during development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Falluel-Morel et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Vaudry et al., 2003</xref>). Thyroid hormones regulate differentiation of neural cells, synaptogenesis, and myelination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bernal, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Koibuchi and Chin, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Pasquini et al., 1967</xref>). Therefore, for normal cerebellar development, the developmental stage-specific action of various hormones is essential.</p><p>Multiple studies have suggested a link between light-at-night-induced circadian disruption and disruption of the neuroendocrine system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Fonken and Nelson, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Fonken et al., 2010</xref>). In the brain, disruption of the neuroendocrine system is caused by exposure to light-at-night (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Fonken et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Navara and Nelson, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Reppert and Weaver, 2002</xref>). Thus, previous studies have suggested that exposure to inappropriate lighting during early life disrupts hormone synthesis and causes abnormal development of the brain during early life. However, the molecular mechanisms that modulate the expression of hormones depending on light conditions during early life are still incompletely understood.</p><p>Recently, we have demonstrated that the pineal gland, a photosensitive organ, actively produces a variety of steroids in birds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Haraguchi et al., 2012a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Hatori et al., 2011</xref>). Importantly, pineal allopregnanolone (ALLO), a major pineal steroid, has been shown to prevent the death of cerebellar Purkinje cells by suppressing apoptosis in chicks during development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Haraguchi et al., 2012a</xref>). Thus, we hypothesized that pineal ALLO synthesis depends on environmental light conditions to mediate cerebellar development during early posthatch life.</p><p>To test our hypothesis, we investigated whether light stimuli are involved in the development of the cerebellum via pineal ALLO activity using chicks, an excellent model for studying the effects of light stimuli because chicks show a marked response to changing light conditions.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Light-at-night-induced disruption of diurnal variation in pineal ALLO synthesis, followed by Purkinje cell death during early posthatch life</title><p>To investigate whether light conditions are involved in pineal ALLO synthesis in newly hatched male chicks, the chicks were incubated under either a 12 hr light–12 hr dark (LD) cycle, constant light (LL), or a 12 hr light–12 hr dark cycle followed by exposure to light for 1 hr from zeitgeber time (ZT) 14 (light-at-night) for 1 week. The mRNA expression of 5α-reductase (srd5a), a steroidogenic enzyme catalyzing the formation of ALLO, showed a marked diurnal change and was high during dark times (ZT16) in the pineal glands of LD chicks (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref>). In contrast to the LD chicks, the LL chicks showed consistently low srd5a mRNA levels in the pineal glands (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1b</xref>).

Cerebellar anterior lobe is the region that is the most vulnerable to the reduction of ALLO in the cerebellum (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Haraguchi et al., 2012a</xref>). Compared with LD conditions, LL (lobule IV, p=0.0027; lobule V, p=0.0304) and light-at-night (lobule III, p=0.0129; lobule IV, p=0.0011; lobule V, p=0.0136) conditions increased the number of Purkinje cells that expressed active caspase-3 in lobules III-V of cerebellar vermis on posthatch day 7 (P7) male chicks (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2c,d</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3</xref>). Active caspase-3 positive cells were also increased in lobule IV of female chicks by light-at-night (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1a</xref>). After 2 weeks of incubation of all groups under an LD cycle, the effects of light conditions during early life on Purkinje cell number were investigated. Compared with LD conditions, LL (lobule III, p=0.0001; lobule IV, p=0.0005) and light-at-night (lobule III, p&lt;0.0001; lobule IV, p&lt;0.0001; lobule V, p=0.0205) conditions decreased the number of Purkinje cells in lobules III-V of cerebellar vermis at P21 chicks (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2e,f</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3</xref>). Purkinje cell numbers were also decreased in lobule IV of female chicks by light-at-night (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1b</xref>).

However, modern life induces chronic circadian disruption through artificial light and such disruption is associated with a decline in mental and physical health (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Kantermann and Roenneberg, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Wu et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Smarr et al., 2017</xref>). The most potent cue in circadian rhythm disruption is inappropriately timed bright light (<italic>e.g.</italic>, light-at-night). To understand the influences of light-at-night, as a model of modern life induced chronic circadian disruption, on mental and physical health in humans, many studies have been conducted using laboratory mice. However, it is important to bear in mind that laboratory mice are mainly nocturnal animals, while humans are diurnal. Thus, in this study we used birds to provide a diurnal animal model to understand the influence of light-at-night on the development of the cerebellum in mammals including humans.</p><p>Autism spectrum disorder is a complex neurodevelopmental disorder. Autism spectrum disorder is characterized by early-onset difﬁculties in social interaction, repetitive behavior, and verbal and non-verbal communication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Lai et al., 2014</xref>). A number of neurobiological hypotheses have been put forward to account for autism behaviors that implicate neural and network abnormalities in the cerebellum that include the cerebellar vermis area (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Piochon et al., 2014</xref>). Therefore, chronic circadian disruption by artificial light may involve autism spectrum disorder by decreasing the number of Purkinje cells in the vermis area by light-at-night. Further studies are needed to investigate the connection between a decrease in Purkinje cells caused by light-at-night and autism spectrum disorder.</p><p>Light-at-night-induced circadian disruption alters the synthesis and secretion of various hormones, such as melatonin (a pineal hormone) and cortisol (an adrenal steroid hormone), particularly in vertebrates, including humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Klein, 2006</xref>). These disruptions of the synthesis and release of hormones by inappropriate timed bright light increase the risk of breast cancer, prostate cancer, obesity, diabetes, and depression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Kantermann and Roenneberg, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Shi et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Smarr et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Wu et al., 2011</xref>). Circadian disruptions by bright light have also been shown to affect the health of infants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Mann et al., 1986</xref>). Inappropriate light conditions reduce weight gain in preterm infants in a newborn nursery via circadian disruption of hormone synthesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Brandon et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Mann et al., 1986</xref>). Bright light can be a stress factor. It has been shown that stress in the early life of rats delays development and accounts for a number of abnormalities in the brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Ellenbroek et al., 2005</xref>). As part of the organization process, natural apoptotic cell death occurs in rodents and birds just after birth and around the second postnatal week (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Prakash and Wurst, 2006</xref>). In the human brain, the developmental processes of proliferation and migration are generally finalized after 24 weeks of gestation, but apoptotic cell death, synaptogenesis, and neuronal differentiation take place up until the three year of life (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Huppertz-Kessler et al., 2012</xref>). Thus, previous and present studies have both suggested that inappropriate lighting disrupts hormone synthesis and causes abnormal development of the brain during early life (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11">Figure 11</xref>).</p><fig id="fig11" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.45306.029</object-id><label>Figure 11.</label><caption><title>A schematic model of the effect of pineal ALLO on Purkinje cell survival during the first week posthatch under LD or light-at-night conditions.</title><p>(Left panel) A schematic model of normal development of the cerebellum under LD during the first week posthatch (that is early posthatch life-stage).

Following this, increased amounts of caspase-3 facilitated the apoptosis of Purkinje cells in the cerebellum.</p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-45306-fig11-v2.tif"/></fig><p>We previously reported that the pineal gland is an important steroidogenic organ, and pineal ALLO may have an important role in the prevention of Purkinje cell death for the normal development of the cerebellum (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Haraguchi et al., 2012a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Hatori et al., 2011</xref>). The pineal gland of vertebrates responds to light via direct and indirect mechanisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Klein, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Maronde and Stehle, 2007</xref>) and has important roles in the circadian organization of vertebrates. However, the influence of light-at-night on the production of pineal ALLO has yet to be elucidated. In this study, we demonstrated that light-at-night-induced circadian disruption abolished the diurnal rhythm of pineal ALLO synthesis. In addition, the disruption of diurnal variations of pineal ALLO-induced Purkinje cell death in the developing cerebellum of chicks. These results suggest that the disruption of diurnal variations of pineal ALLO causes a constant low level of pineal ALLO synthesis, which induces the death of Purkinje cells during development. A number of studies have found that stage-specific actions of various hormones are essential for normal cerebellar development. For instance, thyroid deficiency during the perinatal periods has been shown to cause significant impairments to the structural development and organization of the brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bernal, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Koibuchi and Chin, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Pasquini et al., 1967</xref>). PACAP has important roles in the regulation of the cell cycle by enhancing cellular survival and by enhancing or inhibiting cellular proliferation and differentiation in the developing cerebellum (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Falluel-Morel et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Vaudry et al., 2003</xref>). Cytochrome P450 aromatase knock-out (ArKO) mice exhibited decreased Purkinje dendritic growth, spinogenesis, and synaptogenesis, and these changes were rescued by injection of estradiol into the cerebellum (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Haraguchi et al., 2012a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Sasahara et al., 2007</xref>). Thus, a delicate balance is necessary for the proper development of the brain. It seems reasonable that the diurnal rhythm of pineal ALLO synthesis and its release under LD conditions are essential for the normal development of the cerebellum during early life (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11">Figure 11</xref>).</p><p>In the developing cerebellum, PACAP was expressed not only by Purkinje cells but also by the cells of the molecular layer. However, mPRα, a receptor for ALLO, was only expressed in Purkinje cells. This result suggested that pineal ALLO mainly affects the Purkinje cells through mPRα in the developing cerebellum (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11">Figure 11</xref>). PACAP secreted from Purkinje cells affects the PAC1-expressing Purkinje and granule cells. In Purkinje cells, PACAP mediates the neuroprotective effects of ALLO in the developing cerebellum of chicks (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11">Figure 11</xref>). However, the effect of PACAP on granule cells is unclear in the developing cerebellum of chicks, although the neuroprotective effects of PACAP on cerebellar granule cells have been reported in mammals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Vaudry et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Vaudry et al., 2003</xref>).</p><p>Several lines of evidence indicate that ALLO has neuroprotective effects in the developing and mature brain and in neurodegenerative diseases, including Parkinson’s, Alzheimer’s, and Huntington’s disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Griffin et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Irwin and Brinton, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Melcangi and Panzica, 2014</xref>). Numerous studies have found that ALLO exerts its various physiological functions through the GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors in the brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Belelli and Lambert, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Guennoun et al., 2015</xref>); however, the results of the present study show that GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors did not mediate the neuroprotective effects of ALLO in developing Purkinje cells in chicks during early life. Other studies have also suggested that GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors do not contribute to the neuroprotective effects of ALLO. Recent investigations have suggested that ALLO binds to mPRs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Pang et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Schumacher et al., 2014</xref>). Thus, we investigated whether mPRs can function as a receptor for ALLO to mediate the neuroprotective action of ALLO in the cerebellum. The results showed that ALLO had an important role in developing Purkinje cells through the mPRα mechanism in chicks during early life.</p><p>The neuroprotective mechanisms of ALLO are poorly understood, although numerous studies have found that ALLO prevents apoptotic neuronal cell death in the brain of vertebrates. In contrast to ALLO, the neuroprotective mechanisms of PACAP are well documented. The neurotrophic effects of PACAP are mediated through the cAMP/PKA signaling pathway and involve the ERK MAP kinase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Vaudry et al., 2000</xref>). Caspase-3 is also a key enzyme involved in the neuroprotective action of PACAP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Vaudry et al., 2000</xref>). We previously reported that the neuroprotective action of pineal ALLO was associated with a reduction in caspase-3 activity during the early stage of cerebellar development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Haraguchi et al., 2012a</xref>). In this study, we showed that PACAP expression showed clear diurnal changes in the developing cerebellum. Previously, PACAP levels in the brain have been shown to undergo daily variations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Józsa et al., 2001</xref>). Here, we showed that Px decreased the expression of PACAP in the developing cerebellum. In addition, previous studies have also reported that the expression levels of PACAP in the brain were affected by Px (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Somogyvári-Vigh et al., 2002</xref>). These previous findings are in agreement with the present findings indicating that PACAP, a neuroprotective hormone, mediated the neuroprotective action of ALLO during early life.</p><p>Histone modifications store epigenetic information that mainly controls heritable states of gene expression. Environmental factors affect the developing brain through epigenetic mechanisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bale, 2015</xref>). In this study, we demonstrated that light-at-night and pineal ALLO changed the repressive mark (H3K9me3) of the <italic>Adcyap1</italic> gene promoter in the developing cerebellum. Our results indicated that inappropriate light conditions induced an abnormal epigenetic status in the developing cerebellum, which suggests that light conditions and pineal hormones have important roles in brain development via epigenetic regulation of hormone genes.</p><p>In conclusion, our results show that light-at-night-induced circadian disruption led to cerebellar Purkinje cell death through pineal ALLO-dependent mechanisms during early posthatch life (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11">Figure 11</xref>). Thus, the results suggest that modern nighttime artificial light exposure also affects development of the human brain.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th>Reagent type <break/>(species) or <break/>resource</th><th>Designation</th><th>Source or reference</th><th>Identifiers</th><th>Additional <break/>information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Cell line (<italic>Cercopithecus aethiops</italic>)</td><td>COS-7</td><td>JCRB</td><td>Cat# JCRB9127 <break/>RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/CVCL_0224">CVCL_0224</ext-link></td><td/></tr><tr><td>Recombinant DNA reagent</td><td>membrane progesterone receptor α (mPRα)-Histag</td><td>This study</td><td/><td valign="bottom">Materials and methods subsection ‘Conformation of the specificity of mPRα antisera’</td></tr><tr><td>Antibody</td><td>Anti-Cleaved Caspase-3 (Asp175) , <break/>(Rabbit polyclonal)</td><td>Cell Signaling Technology</td><td>Cat# 9661, <break/>RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/AB_2341188">AB_2341188</ext-link></td><td>1:300, IHC</td></tr><tr><td>Antibody</td><td>Anti-Calbindin D-28k, <break/>(Mouse monoclonal)</td><td>Swant Swiss antibodies</td><td>Cat# 300, <break/>RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/AB_10000347">AB_10000347</ext-link></td><td>1:1000, IHC</td></tr><tr><td>Antibody</td><td>Anti-Pituitary adenylate cyclase-activating polypeptide (PACAP), <break/>(Chicken polyclonal)</td><td><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Nakamachi et al., 2018</xref></td><td>doi: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.peptides.2018.03.006">10.1016/j.peptides.2018.03.006</ext-link></td><td>1:100, IHC</td></tr><tr><td>Antibody</td><td>Anti-membrane progesterone receptor α (mPRα),(Rabbit polyclonal)</td><td>This study</td><td/><td>Materials and methods subsection ‘Conformation of the specificity of mPRα antisera’; Against Goldfish mPRα aa 19–34 and53–66; 1:100, IHC</td></tr><tr><td>Antibody</td><td>Anti-ADCYAP1R1 (PAC1), <break/>(Mouse monoclonal)</td><td>Santa Cruz Biotechnology</td><td>Cat# sc-100315, <break/>RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/AB_1126992">AB_1126992</ext-link></td><td>1:100, IHC</td></tr><tr><td>Antibody</td><td>Anti-trimethyl-Histone H3 (Lys9), <break/>(Rabbit polyclonal)</td><td>Merck Millipore</td><td>Cat# 07–442, <break/>RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/AB_310620">AB_310620</ext-link></td><td>1:50, ChIP</td></tr><tr><td>Antibody</td><td>Anti-trimethyl-Histone H3 (Lys27), <break/>(Rabbit polyclonal)</td><td>Merck Millipore</td><td>Cat# 07–449, <break/>RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/AB_310624">AB_310624</ext-link></td><td>1:50, ChIP</td></tr><tr><td>Antibody</td><td>Anti-trimethyl-Histone H4 (Lys20), <break/>(Rabbit polyclonal)</td><td>Merck Millipore</td><td>Cat# 07–463, <break/>RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/AB_310636">AB_310636</ext-link></td><td>1:50, ChIP</td></tr><tr><td>Antibody</td><td>Anti-Mouse IgG (H+L), F(ab’)<sub>2</sub> Fragment, Alexa Fluor 555 Conjugate</td><td>Cell Signaling Technology</td><td>Cat# 4409, <break/>RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/AB_1904022">AB_1904022</ext-link></td><td>1:1000, IHC</td></tr><tr><td>Antibody</td><td>Anti-rabbit IgG (H+L), F(ab')<sub>2</sub> Fragment, Alexa Fluor 488 Conjugate</td><td>Cell Signaling Technology</td><td>Cat# 4412, <break/>RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/AB_1904025">AB_1904025</ext-link></td><td>1:1000, IHC</td></tr><tr><td>Peptide, recombinant protein</td><td>Chicken PACAP</td><td>This study</td><td/><td/></tr><tr><td>Commercial assay kit</td><td>SimpleChIP plus sonication chromatin IP kit</td><td>Cell Signaling Technology</td><td>Cat# 56383</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Chemical compound</td><td>Allopregnanolone</td><td>Cayman Chemical</td><td valign="bottom">16930, CAS RN: 516-54-1</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Chemical compound, drug</td><td>Fluorescein-labeled allopregnanolone</td><td>This study</td><td>CAS RN: 2294937-67-8</td><td>Materials and methods subsection ‘Fluorescein-labeled ALLO synthesis’</td></tr><tr><td>Software, algorithm</td><td>GraphPad Prism6</td><td>GraphPad Software</td><td>RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/SCR_002798">SCR_002798</ext-link></td><td/></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap><sec id="s4-1"><title>Animals</title><p>Domestic chickens (<italic>Gallus gallus</italic>) of both sexes at various ages were used in this study.

Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the evaluation has been overseen by K VijayRaghavan as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Alanna J Watt. The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>The study by Haraguchi et al. represents an important and interesting contribution to our understanding of the role of circadian rhythm in brain development. This work builds upon the authors' previous findings that pineal gland-derived ALLO hormone modulated Purkinje cell survival in the developing cerebellum of quail chicks (Haraguchi et al., 2012). Here, the authors use a light-at-night (LAN) paradigm combined with RT-PCR, competition assays, knock-downs with siRNA and IHC, to show that 1 hour of light at night reduces the expression of the pineal-derived hormone ALLO. They then go on to show downstream mechanisms for the neuroprotective action of ALLO: they identify the mPRalpha receptor through which ALLO appears to act, and show that this alters the expression of the neuroprotective hormone PACAP. Finally, they demonstrate that although PACAP can alter Purkinje cell survival during later development, its expression in the cerebellum decreases during development because of changes in histone modification levels at the adcyap1 gene promoter.</p><p>Though this study is interesting and thorough, the reviewers made several critical suggestions, which need to be satisfactorily addressed before the manuscript can be accepted for publication at <italic>eLife</italic>.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The extent of Purkinje neuron loss due to light-at-night in the current study seems to be small (Figure 1H). As it stands, it looks like there is a clear effect on pineal ALLO synthesis, but only a marginal effect on Purkinje cell survival. Small changes are not necessarily unimportant as even a decrease of 10% of cerebellar Purkinje cells could still have a big impact on cerebellar function. This raises two questions: one, if there are lobule-specific differences in Purkinje cell loss as seen in Haraguchi et al., 2012 with pinealectomy, and two if these small changes persist into adulthood and lead to cerebellar deficits. To delineate if there are lobule-specific differences, authors should provide lobule-specific counts of PNs after light-at-night. Such lobule-specific differences could potentially be quite interesting in terms of light regulation of Purkinje neuron survival. To see if these changes persist into adulthood, authors should look at counts at fully adult stages as well.</p><p>2) Data presentation: Throughout the manuscript data are presented as bar graphs showing mean+/- sem. It is now standard practice to show the scatter of the data with a suitable measure of central tendency depending on the shape of the distribution. Further, data in Figure 1G, H (and elsewhere in the paper, e.g. Figure 3B-E) are represented as relative to controls. It would be informative to have an indication of the actual number of cells. If necessary, this can be normalized to the total number of cells (or total fluorescence of a nuclear indicator) in each section.</p><p>3) The statistical analysis of the data is insufficient. It is not clear if the data are normal and normality tests were done, but a one-way ANOVA has been used. The authors should not take p&lt;0.05 to indicate that their hypothesis is true. The statement by APA (Wasserstein, R. L. &amp; Lazar, N. A. The ASA's Statement on p-Values: Context, Process, and Purpose. The American Statistician 70, 129-133 (2016)) should be consulted as to what the p-value can and cannot be used for. It is suggested that the authors use Gardner-Altman estimation plots (e.g. see <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.estimationstats.com/">estimationstats.com</ext-link>), and provide an indication of the size of the effect of the different treatments.</p><p>4) The authors should include example representative images for caspase-3 positive cells and Purkinje cells in Figure 2, so that the reader can evaluate these findings themselves.</p><p>5) Why were male chicks used exclusively? In previous studies by these authors, results were shown to be similar in both male and female chicks. These results will be stronger if they are confirmed in females. At minimum, a justification for the exclusive use of male animals should be provided.</p><p>6) Why has this particular light-at-night paradigm been used? It would be useful if the paradigm were described in the Materials and methods section (it is currently not mentioned there at all) and a brief discussion of the generalizability of this light-at-night paradigm could be included in the Discussion.</p><p>7) At what time was the ALLO injection given? The Materials and methods section mentions that vehicle only injections were done but it is not clear if the 'control' is vehicle-only or uninjected animals. Both conditions must be shown, with raw cell counts.</p><p>8) The authors go into some detail delineating the timeline of the action of light at night during development. However, it is hard to understand how this is believed to correspond to human (or mammalian) development, so it would be useful to discuss this more directly in the Discussion.</p><p>9) The second and third sentences of the Introductory paragraph could use some rewriting as they are only loosely connected to the rest of the text. &quot;In particular, light conditions affect development during early life; therefore, it is not surprising that life evolved on this planet&quot;) is not logically sound.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were requested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Light-at-night exposure affects brain development through pineal allopregnanolone-dependent mechanisms&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>.

I recommend publication.</p><p>In particular, I welcome the in-depth lobule-specific analyses that the authors have added, which shows the specificity of the effect to anterior lobules (which are closest to the pineal gland).

I thank the authors for taking this concern seriously and for putting in the work to address it.</p><p>I think several of the changes made, including to analyses, representation of data, and to writing (e.g. removing difficult-to-understand abbreviations) have greatly strengthened the paper as well.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>The authors have addressed all comments regarding data presentation and analysis.</p><p>However, the Introduction of the revised manuscript is still illogical, with several statements that do not fit well. The meaning behind the third sentence (&quot;It is not surprising that.…&quot;) is unclear. This sentence should be deleted. The reference to weight gain does not fit with the theme of development/maturation of the brain. Fagiolini et al., 2009, refer to the influence of stress, acting via the placenta, on the epigenome of the embryo. The notion of &quot;environment&quot; in this case is different from a stimulus that acts directly on a sensory system of the post-hatch/post-natal animal.</p><p>The Introduction would be clearer if the authors define what is meant by &quot;development&quot; in this manuscript.

We agree with the reviewer that the decrease in Purkinje cell numbers in our study is small to lead to a change in cerebellar functions related to movement coordination, motor learning, or timing, etc. We think that the decrease of Purkinje cell number by light-at-night affects cerebellar non-motor functions but not motor functions. The cerebellum is also involved in autism spectrum disorder. Thus, we added several sentences in the Discussion section as follows:</p><p>“Circadian rhythms are present in almost all plants and animals. […] Further studies are needed to investigate the connection between a decrease in Purkinje cells caused by light-at-night and autism spectrum disorder.”</p><p>In addition, according to the reviewers' comments, we have provided lobule-specific counts of Purkinje cell numbers after light-at-night (please see the new Figures 2, 3, 5-7). Furthermore, the following information is added in the Materials and methods section as follows: “The number of calbindin-immunoreactive cell bodies of Purkinje cells was counted in each lobule at P21 or P70. […] The number of Purkinje cells in the vermis area was calculated from 10 sections (20-μm thickness, every three sections in the vermis area) per animal.” and “Parasagittal cerebellar sections of chicks at P7 were examined by immunostaining with an antibody against cleaved caspase-3 (Asp175; #9661; Cell Signaling Technology, Danvers, MA) to detect apoptotic cells immunoreactive to the active form of caspase-3 as described previously (Haraguchi et al., 2012a). The number of cleaved caspase-3-positive Purkinje cells in the vermis area was calculated from 10 sections (20-μm thickness, every three sections in the vermis area) per animal.”</p><p>Furthermore, we have performed an additional experiment to investigate whether the decrease in Purkinje cell numbers by light-at-night during the posthatch period persists into adulthood. In adulthood, Purkinje cell numbers were also decreased in lobules III, IV, and V by light-at-night.
