The most common membrane constriction system in prokaryotes is based on the tubulin homologue FtsZ, whose filaments in <italic>E. coli</italic> are anchored to the membrane by FtsA and enable the formation of the Z-ring and divisome. The precise architecture of the FtsZ ring has remained enigmatic. In this study, we report three-dimensional arrangements of FtsZ and FtsA filaments in <italic>C. crescentus</italic> and <italic>E. coli</italic> cells and inside constricting liposomes by means of electron cryomicroscopy and cryotomography. In vivo and in vitro, the Z-ring is composed of a small, single-layered band of filaments parallel to the membrane, creating a continuous ring through lateral filament contacts. Visualisation of the in vitro reconstituted constrictions as well as a complete tracing of the helical paths of the filaments with a molecular model favour a mechanism of FtsZ-based membrane constriction that is likely to be accompanied by filament sliding.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.04601.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.04601.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.04601.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Cell division is the process by which new cells are made. It is therefore vital for the growth and development, and the regeneration and repair of damaged tissues. When bacterial and animal cells divide, they must constrict their membrane inwards to split a single cell into two. In most bacteria, this constriction is guided by a ring-like structure that contains filaments of a protein called FtsZ. During cell division, this structure forms around the inside edge of the cell and when it contracts, it pulls the membrane inwards and causes the cell to constrict and eventually divide.</p><p>In recent years, this arrangement of FtsZ filaments has been intensively investigated, giving rise to various theories about how it is made and how it works: for example, some recent studies suggested that FtsZ does not form a continuous ring. Nevertheless, many details about the cell division process remain unknown.</p><p>Szwedziak, Wang et al. have now investigated this protein ring in two species of bacteria by turning to advanced forms of microscopy to closely observe its structure and how it works. This included mapping the ring in three dimensions. Contrary to earlier reports that the FtsZ ring is discontinuous, in both a bacterium called <italic>Caulobacter crescentus</italic> and another called <italic>Escherichia coli,</italic> the ring forms a continuous shape made up of overlapping filaments.</p><p>Szwedziak, Wang et al. then increased the levels of two of the ring's main components: the FtsZ protein that forms the filaments and a protein that anchors these filaments to the cell membrane. This caused the modified cells to constrict and divide at extra sites, which resulted in the formation of abnormally small cells. These findings suggest that these two ring components by themselves are able to generate both the structures and force required for cell constriction. This is supported by the fact that when they were introduced into artificial cell-like structures, these proteins spontaneously self-organised into rings and triggered constriction where they formed.</p><p>Szwedziak, Wang et al. propose that constriction only starts once the FtsZ protein forms a closed ring and that the ring's overlapping filaments slide along each other to further decrease its diameter and constrict the cell. The degree of filament overlap likely also increases with constriction, requiring filaments to be shortened to maintain sliding. This shortening, along with sliding, could provide a mechanism by which to drive the constriction process.</p><p>This work will be followed by even more detailed studies in order to understand the process of bacterial cell division at the atomic scale and how the cell's wall is reshaped during the process. In the long run, intricate knowledge of how a bacterial cell divides might enable the design of new classes of antibiotics targeting the molecular machinery involved.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.04601.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.04601.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author keywords</title><kwd>bacterial cytoskeleton</kwd><kwd>cytokinesis</kwd><kwd>cell division</kwd><kwd><italic>C. crescentus</italic></kwd><kwd>FtsZ</kwd><kwd>electron tomography</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>E. coli</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000265</institution-id><institution>Medical Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>U105184326</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Szwedziak</surname><given-names>Piotr</given-names></name><name><surname>Wang</surname><given-names>Qing</given-names></name><name><surname>Bharat</surname><given-names>Tanmay A M</given-names></name><name><surname>Tsim</surname><given-names>Matthew</given-names></name><name><surname>Löwe</surname><given-names>Jan</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100004440</institution-id><institution>Wellcome Trust</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>095514/Z/11/Z</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Szwedziak</surname><given-names>Piotr</given-names></name><name><surname>Wang</surname><given-names>Qing</given-names></name><name><surname>Löwe</surname><given-names>Jan</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The architecture of the bacterial cytokinetic ring in cells and in artificial liposome reconstitutions has been described using electron microscopy, leading to a mechanism of constriction.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Membrane dynamics during cytokinesis are some of the most fundamental processes in biology, yet are poorly understood at the molecular and mechanistic level. During prokaryotic cell division the cell membrane and the cell envelope constrict, eventually leading to cell separation. In most bacteria and archaea, this is guided by a ring structure containing the bacterial tubulin homologue FtsZ protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bi and Lutkenhaus, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Löwe and Amos, 1998</xref>), which polymerises in a GTP-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Mukherjee and Lutkenhaus, 1994</xref>). During constriction, the FtsZ ring decreases in diameter through an unknown mechanism. The C-terminal tail of FtsZ links it to other components of the divisome, an ensemble of many proteins that facilitates essential functions during the cell division process, most importantly remodelling of the cell envelope. Components of the divisome engage in cell wall synthesis (PBPs), synchronisation with chromosome dimer resolution (FtsK), lipid II cell wall precursor flipping (FtsW or MurJ), and many components currently have no known function (reviews: <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Adams and Errington, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Lutkenhaus et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>In <italic>Escherichia coli</italic>, binding of the FtsZ tail to ZipA and possibly more importantly to FtsA anchor the FtsZ ring to the membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Pichoff and Lutkenhaus, 2007</xref>). FtsA is a bacterial actin-like protein that forms domain-swapped, canonical actin-like protofilaments that are membrane associated through FtsA's C-terminal amphipathic helix (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Pichoff and Lutkenhaus, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Szwedziak et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">van den Ent and Löwe, 2000</xref>). Several cellular regulatory processes influence the onset and progression of cell division through mechanisms that directly act on FtsZ. For example, SulA is induced during the SOS stress response and sequesters monomers, stopping FtsZ polymerisation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chen et al., 2012</xref>). In <italic>E. coli,</italic> both nucleoid occlusion and the oscillating, pole-protecting MinCDE system contain components that inhibit FtsZ function within the ring directly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bernhardt and de Boer, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Dajkovic et al., 2008</xref>).</p><p>Although progress has been exhilarating over that past 20 years or so, some of the most fundamental questions still remain: what happens during FtsZ ring constriction? How are the filaments arranged in the ring? What drives constriction?</p><p>Many different models have been proposed for the mechanism of FtsZ-based constriction (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Erickson, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Erickson et al., 2010</xref>). Essentially, three different approaches have been taken to validate the models: in vivo imaging of FtsZ constrictions using fluorescently labelled proteins. Electron cryotomography of frozen hydrated cells without labelling and, thirdly, in vitro reconstitution experiments with pure, fluorescently labelled proteins. The most recent results emanating from those studies are that the rings appear to show strong fluorescence intensity variations that may suggest that the FtsZ ring is discontinuous (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Holden et al., 2014</xref>). Equally, tomography data have been interpreted to show scattered individual FtsZ filaments, some precise distance away from the membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Li et al., 2007</xref>). Reconstitution experiments with FtsZ and FtsA showed dynamic behaviour and liposome constrictions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Osawa and Erickson, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Loose and Mitchison, 2014</xref>). However, obtaining detailed molecular and mechanistic information regarding the FtsZ ring, particularly the arrangement of individual filaments and subunits within a constricting Z-ring, has remained a formidable challenge.</p><p>In this study, we obtained high-resolution images of the FtsZ ring in <italic>Caulobacter crescentus</italic> and <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> by means of electron cryotomography. Furthermore, we reconstituted a minimal constriction force-generating system from purified components in vitro, encapsulating <italic>Thermotoga maritima</italic> FtsA (TmFtsA) and FtsZ (TmFtsZ) in liposomes of sizes corresponding to those of a bacterial cell. We produced images and three-dimensional maps of filaments arranging themselves into ring structures around the liposome perimeters that coincided with constriction sites. The observed FtsZ ring architectures in <italic>C. crescentus</italic> and <italic>E. coli</italic> cells and in liposomes favour a mechanism of FtsZ-based cell membrane constriction that is accompanied by filament sliding, as was proposed previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Lan et al., 2009</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Single-layered and continuous FtsZ ring in unmodified <italic>C. crescentus</italic> cells</title><p>We started out by visualising division sites in an unmodified <italic>C. crescentus</italic> strain (NA1000/CB15N) because the thin <italic>Caulobacter</italic> cells are most suitable for electron cryotomography. When a log-phase culture was plunge-frozen and imaged, many dividing cells could be found. At the division sites, a series of dots arranged in a single line were found (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, top). Careful analysis of cellular tomograms (<xref ref-type="other" rid="media1">Video 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, bottom) revealed that the dots were in fact 2D projections of filamentous structures encircling the cell and likely forming a continuous ring, disrupted in the images at the top and bottom by the missing wedge of the tomography method. The filaments were at a distance of 15 ± 2 nm from the inner membrane (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>), as previously reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Li et al., 2007</xref>). The long-standing problem of the missing wedge in electron tomography caused by our current inability to tilt the specimen much beyond 65° (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, bottom, white triangle, see also <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref> for more details on the missing wedge problem related to this study) makes it impossible to follow features all the way around the cell's perimeter. It is important to note, however, that the protein filaments are visible and uninterrupted everywhere the missing wedge allows it, as can be gauged from the disappearance of the cell membrane and envelope (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A,B</xref>). We could detect the filamentous rings in 20 out of 28 dividing cells after tomography. Of the 8 without obvious filamentous structures, the division had progressed too far in 3 and 5 were of poor quality because of the cell's orientation with respect to the tilt axis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). Hence, the finding of complete rings is supported by the fact that perfect coincidence of any hypothetical gaps in constricting rings with the missing wedges in all of the analysed tomograms, found after all in entirely random orientations, would be remarkably implausible.<fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.04601.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>FtsZ forms bands of filaments completely encircling <italic>C. crescentus</italic> and <italic>E. coli</italic> division sites, as visualised by electron cryotomography.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) <italic>C. crescentus</italic> NA1000/CB15N division site with filaments near the inner membrane IM (top panel, black dots highlighted by arrow, see also <xref ref-type="other" rid="media1">Video 1</xref>).

(b) Removing the C-terminal FtsA-interacting helix and replacing it with a membrane-targeting sequence (mts) from MinD protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hu and Lutkenhaus, 2003</xref>) shortened the distance from the IM to 10 nm. No constrictions of the cells were observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1I</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1—figure supplement 4D</xref>). Therefore, despite it having been used in earlier studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Osawa et al., 2008</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Osawa and Erickson, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Loose and Mitchison, 2014</xref>), we agree with previous findings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Osawa et al., 2008</xref>) that this construct is non-functional in vivo and we did not include it in our subsequent in vitro investigations below.

(d) Finally, removing most amino acids between the C-terminal FtsA-interacting helix and the globular body of FtsZ caused a minicell phenotype. Because of their size, minicells produce tomograms of higher quality and it was possible to determine the longitudinal subunit repeat of the filaments to be around 4 nm, very close to the expected value of 4.2 nm for FtsZ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1K and L</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1—figure supplement 4G</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Erickson et al., 1996</xref>).

First, TmFtsZ and TmFtsA were added to pre-formed liposomes so that the proteins remained on the outside (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1A</xref>). Reactions containing liposomes and proteins, as indicated, were vitrified and imaged by conventional 2D transmission electron cryomicroscopy. When no protein was added, the liposomes appeared as almost perfect circles (spheres in projection) and the bilayers were clearly visible as a double line, 5 nm apart (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>, top, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2D</xref>). The addition of TmFtsA alone led to the formation of an additional layer, probably consisting of only partly polymerised protein, and no strong deformations were observed. TmFtsZ alone did not cause deformations or generation of an additional layer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2B</xref>). But when both TmFtsA and TmFtsZ were added, two extra layers, in addition to the liposome bilayer, became visible (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). Particularly in the presence of nucleotide, strong negative curvature was induced, leading to deformations of the liposomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1A</xref>). As was suggested previously, the co-polymerisation of FtsZ and FtsA will lead to bending and curvature because the subunit repeat lengths of FtsZ and FtsA are roughly 4 and 5 nm, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2A</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Szwedziak et al., 2012</xref>). We propose that the subunit repeat mismatch causes some deformations from the outside of the liposomes, especially when FtsZ polymerisation-inducing GMPCPP is present so that long filaments are formed that will exert more mechanical force.</p></sec><sec id="s2-8"><title>Incorporating FtsA and FtsZ on the inside of liposomes leads to spontaneous constrictions</title><p>Since TmFtsZ and TmFtsA induce negative membrane curvature, we concluded that in order to reconstitute the actions of these proteins correctly, we needed to incorporate them on the inside of liposomes. For this, CHAPS detergent-solubilised <italic>E. coli</italic> lipid extract was mixed with the proteins at high concentrations and then diluted many-fold. Lowering of the detergent concentration by dilution led to spontaneous liposome formation with most of the proteins on the inside. We demonstrated with a time-lapse experiment that liposomes did not form around pre-existing FtsZ scaffolds since we observed that most liposomes were initially perfectly spherical and that they deformed over a 30-min period, after which most of them were heavily misshapen (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2C,E</xref>).</p><p>The liposomes were then analysed by transmission electron cryomicroscopy. Amazingly, when both TmFtsZ and TmFtsA were included on the inside of liposomes, clear constriction sites appeared and these occurred only when supported by filaments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C–G</xref>). The liposomes were around 300 nm in diameter, similar to that of a small bacterial cell. The protein filaments were arranged into three distinct structures: arcs that were mostly single filaments, presumably formed by the co-polymerisation of TmFtsZ and TmFtsA, showing the characteristic curvature caused by the repeat mismatch (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Szwedziak et al., 2012</xref>); spirals with decreasing curvature that appeared in perfectly spherical areas of the liposomes; and rings of filaments, appearing as bands in projection, formed around liposome constriction sites, with varying diameters. It is very important to note that constrictions only appeared where there were rings of filaments. Filaments within the liposomes had very different curvatures, for example in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>, filaments seemed to go round the liposome at a very large diameter, compared to the ones in the constriction zone further to the left.</p><p>When the constriction sites were imaged at higher magnification, it became possible to discern the TmFtsA and TmFtsZ filaments end-on (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3H–J</xref>). The FtsA filaments were again sandwiched between the liposome membrane and the FtsZ filaments, just as in the images obtained with <italic>E. coli</italic> cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C,G</xref>). The architecture is easily explained with TmFtsA-binding to the inside of the liposome membrane via its amphipathic helix, presumably polymerising, and FtsZ polymerising on top of FtsA, binding to it via its C-terminal FtsA-binding peptide (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Pichoff and Lutkenhaus, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Szwedziak et al., 2012</xref>). Nucleotide presence had some influence on the appearance of these constricted liposomes as GTP addition produced the most bilobed liposomes. Constriction itself, however, was largely nucleotide hydrolysis independent since not adding any nucleotide produced constrictions as well, and they appeared even tighter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>). Therefore, despite not being strictly required for constriction, we believe that the nucleotide only has an influence on the appearance thereof and this might be due to the fact that FtsZ forms much longer filaments with polymerisation-inducing GTP added and this would enable the filaments to span larger liposomes when the process starts. Given that TmFtsZ is a hyperthermophilic protein, significant hydrolysis of GTP to GDP is not expected.</p></sec><sec id="s2-9"><title>Detailed architecture of the liposome constrictions revealed in three dimensions by electron cryotomography</title><p>Next, we employed electron cryotomography to image the liposomes in three dimensions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="other" rid="media4 media5 media6 media7 media8 media9 media10">Videos 4–10</xref> ). Because the samples only contained lipid and two proteins, contrast was very high in the resulting tomograms (<xref ref-type="other" rid="media4 media5">Video 4 and 5</xref>), making it possible to represent the volume data without segmentation, as single-threshold surfaces or as volume renderings (<xref ref-type="other" rid="media6 media7 media8 media9 media10">Video 6–10</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Figure 4–source data 1</xref> PyMOL session file).

Note that the liposome was only deformed where the ring was located (and where it unfortunately touched the carbon grid at the top right). More examples in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>, bottom and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref> show the same overall architecture, with the same mix of filament architectures (also <xref ref-type="other" rid="media6 media7 media8 media9 media10">Videos 6–10</xref>). The TmFtsAZ rings were between 30 and 90 nm in diameter, when we looked at several different liposomes, and the filaments were on average 7.8 nm apart (n = 16) laterally (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B,C</xref>) as compared to 6.8 nm seen in <italic>E. coli</italic> cells (within doublets). Because contrast was very high, the ring of filaments could be traced in most tomograms all around the inside of the liposome and this revealed that the filaments were not totally equidistant and often came into contact. This was also true for the in vivo situation in <italic>C. crescentus</italic> (<xref ref-type="other" rid="media1">Video 1</xref>) where the distance between the filaments (grey arrow) changes around the ring. The rings were always closed, continuous without gaps, with some possibly consisting of one double filament forming a helix (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="other" rid="media6">Video 6</xref>) and others containing several shorter filaments in a helix-like arrangement (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref> stereo view and <xref ref-type="other" rid="media10">Video 10</xref>). When the filaments were investigated end-on, they appeared to always be arranged close to 90° with respect to the liposome membrane tangent (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>), which was also observed for the filaments in cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C,G</xref>).

Middle: during constriction, the ring develops into two helical spirals, leading to forces pushing membrane inwards, and this might explain how abscission is accomplished since membranes will presumably not fuse while the protein filaments are in between (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref> bottom right and <xref ref-type="other" rid="media9">Video 9</xref> for an example of this in liposomes).

While it is currently not obvious which of these or if a combination of the three mechanisms drives constriction, it seems clear to us that constriction, at least in the liposome reconstitution experiments, requires filaments to slide past each other as is depicted in two dimensions. Since also unmodified wild-type cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>) show closed continuous rings at division sites, we would assume the same holds true in vivo. Filament sliding can also explain the spirals on lipid monolayers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>) and spirals in the dome-like structures with liposomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>).

Given that the filament architectures observed here in <italic>C. crescentus</italic> and <italic>E. coli</italic> and in constricting liposomes are so similar, we would suggest that the model we propose should be valid for both in vitro and in vivo, at least at some primordial level. FtsA forms (partial) filaments between the membrane and FtsZ filaments, and the filaments together encircle the constriction site while forming a single-layered small band of filaments. The entire structure is slightly helical, and shorter filaments overlap to form a continuous, closed ring.</p><p>By imaging completely unmodified cells, utilising recent advances in cryo-EM and acquiring tomograms of cells parallel to the tilt axis, we concluded that the FtsZ ring in cells is most likely continuous, probably made of shorter overlapping filaments. Previous analysis of <italic>C. crescentus</italic> cells by cryo-ET also showed that the FtsZ ring consists of overlapping filaments inside the inner membrane, although not all cells showed continuous rings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Li et al., 2007</xref>). Equally, results obtained with super resolution fluorescence microscopy techniques (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Holden et al., 2014</xref>) showed punctuated fluorescence, possibly indicating non-continuous rings. We think it is important to point out that fluorescence microscopy only images the labelled species and intensity fluctuations within the ring may have arisen from using non-functional GFP fusions and/or their over-expression. Or fluctuations coming from overlapping filaments may have been over-emphasised during image analysis because of very low signal-to-noise. Unfortunately, currently, cellular tomography data are too weak to be able to trace individual filaments and their ends with confidence, so we have no direct evidence from our in vivo data for the length of individual FtsZ filaments making up continuous rings.</p><p>Given a continuous ring, at least in the in vitro situation, with no GTP turnover (or no added nucleotide) there is no filament shortening, meaning constriction requires the filaments to slide along each other as the ring decreases in diameter and the membrane deforms. That opposing forces from the filaments and the membrane surface are at work is most evident from the fact that the rings were always perfectly round, in contrast to the rest of the liposomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>, middle, <xref ref-type="other" rid="media10">Video 10</xref>).</p><p>In this context, the filament spirals that form shallow ‘dome’ structures in some of the liposomes and on flat monolayers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3 fig4">Figures 3A and 4A</xref>, top and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>) are most revealing. They appear to be the result of sliding and condensation and show decreasing filament curvature, but do not deform the lipid membrane. This can be explained because the constriction force, which acts in the plane of the spirals, will not exert any force on the membrane since it is tangential (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>, right). In contrast, if the filaments form a ring around the volume of the liposome (in the middle, not at the poles), the constriction force is perpendicular to the membrane and will lead to the membrane being pulled in (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>, left).</p><p>Since in this model force generation is dependent on a closed ring, the system becomes self-regulating since constriction will only commence after a complete ring has formed. If the cell is too large or not enough FtsZ is available, constriction will not begin. It is important to note that only a closed, continuous ring is required, but it may consist of a number of shorter, overlapping filaments (as it did in the liposome reconstitutions, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Where is the energy coming from for sliding and constriction?</title><p>What drives constriction of the closed rings and filament sliding? We propose three possible mechanisms that may even act in concert: (a) maximising filament overlap via sliding, (b) increasing repeat mismatch, and (c) repeated filament shortening through nucleotide turnover.<list list-type="simple"><list-item><p>A. When the overlap between the filaments that are attracted to each other increases, more and more binding energy is produced. This has been proposed before to be theoretically sufficient for the constriction process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Lan et al., 2009</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>). The lateral spacing of 6.5–8 nm between filaments we report here is slightly larger than the thickness of FtsZ filaments and presumably also FtsA filaments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Matsui et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Szwedziak et al., 2012</xref>). Previous in vitro work reported an interfilament distance of 5 nm using FtsZ-mts; however, this was after negative staining and dehydration and no constrictions were observed, possibly due to lateral interactions being too tight (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Milam et al., 2012</xref>). In <italic>C. crescentus</italic> cells, the lateral spacing between filaments was found to be 9.3 nm previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Li et al., 2007</xref>)(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Li et al., 2007</xref>) and we report here distances of ∼7.8 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>) in <italic>C. crescentus</italic> and ∼6.8 nm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>) in <italic>E. coli.</italic> AFM using only FtsZ, but observing spiral condensation, provided an even larger distance of 12 nm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Mingorance et al., 2005</xref>). All of these measurements are averages with large variances. One may conclude that the filaments in the FtsZ ring interact transiently and direct contact is localised to only a few small regions within the ring at a time. This could facilitate the constriction process since the filaments have to be free to slide. It was suggested previously that instead of forming many intermolecular solid bonds, which would lead to avidity and a barrier to sliding, an attractive force over a longer distance would keep the filaments apart while interacting (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Hörger et al., 2008</xref>). This is more akin to the liquid state of matter, where many transient homotypic interactions, counteracted by thermal motion, lead to a fluid situation without absolute order but still keeping the molecules together.</p></list-item><list-item><p>B. The second possible driver of constriction comes from the repeat length mismatch of FtsA and FtsZ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Szwedziak et al., 2012</xref>). Although it is evident from our data that the curvature of individual filaments can not deform liposomes significantly from the inside, the decreasing diameter of the ring accompanied by increasing membrane curvature might enable more and more FtsA to be added, until an optimum curvature of the system has been achieved (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2</xref>); this could provide additional energy and would also explain why FtsA exists at all and FtsZ is not directly attached to the membrane.</p></list-item><list-item><p>C. Why does FtsZ hydrolyse GTP then? We speculate that when constriction starts at large diameters (1 µm in <italic>E. coli</italic>), longer GTP-induced FtsZ filaments are needed to reach reliably around the cell in order to produce overlap for the ring and 'force engagement' to start the process. However, increasing overlap, developing as the constriction progresses, might lead to a kinetic barrier of sliding through avidity and the filaments would then have to be shortened. Formally this provides a third possible driver of constriction, at least for large constriction distances.</p></list-item></list></p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Dynamics of the FtsZ ring are essential for its function</title><p>Continual depolymerisation and re-polymerisation through nucleotide turnover by FtsZ and/or FtsA, as shown in vivo by FRAP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Stricker et al., 2002</xref>), might also ensure that the ring never reaches a highly condensed state and FtsZ monomer-sequestering inhibitors such as SulA remain able to stop the process at any time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chen et al., 2012</xref>). However, it has been reported that the GTP hydrolysis-deficient FtsZ(D212G) mutant generates prominent constrictions of tubular liposomes in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Osawa and Erickson, 2011</xref>) and functions in cell division in <italic>E. coli</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bi and Lutkenhaus, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Trusca et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Osawa and Erickson, 2006</xref>). Furthermore, the use of non-hydrolysable GTP analogues did not impair the formation of condensed FtsZ structures on mica (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Hörger et al., 2008</xref>). Taken together with our result that constriction of liposomes may in principle be independent of GTP hydrolysis, these data question the alternative idea of force generation by filament bending upon GTP hydrolysis as has been suggested previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Lu et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Erickson et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Li et al., 2013</xref>). We suggest that nucleotide binding/hydrolysis is required solely for filament growth/shrinkage as these are essential to maintain the dynamic state of the FtsZ ring in cells.</p><p>Taken together, we envisage that in vitro liposome constrictions and in vivo cell division quite possibly utilise a different set of energetic drivers (a–c); for example, GTP hydrolysis was not required in vitro but clearly plays a role in vivo. And of course, it is likely that the cell wall synthesis in the periplasm, guided by the Z-ring through the divisome, provides additional force in cells. So far, wall-less bacterial L-forms have not shed light on this interdependence of cell wall synthesis and the FtsZ ring since artificial L-forms were found to divide by blebbing, most likely a mechanism that is not actively supported by cellular machinery (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Leaver et al., 2009</xref>). FtsZ-based cell division is not functioning in these L-forms and we suggest this may be because L-forms are too large for Z-rings to close, given the amounts of FtsAZ present.</p></sec><sec id="s3-4"><title>How to perform abscission?</title><p>The described FtsZ filament arrangement might also provide a solution to the abscission problem: how do the membranes fuse at the end of division when the protein filaments are in between? <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>, middle shows how an intermediate between the rings and the domes (as is present in the liposome constriction shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>, bottom right and <xref ref-type="other" rid="media9">Video 9</xref>) may explain abscission, since the protein ring would normally be in the way of membrane fusion/fission at the end. The change from a flat band of filaments towards the helical spirals enables inward force to be developed on each side of the constriction, with a helical spiral on each side. The spirals observed in the dome-like structures might even be remnants of such liposome abscission events, although we have no evidence for this (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>, right). It remains to be seen if FtsZ is involved in final abscission since it has recently been reported that FtsZ might leave the septum earlier (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Söderström et al., 2014</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3-5"><title>Similarities to other membrane remodelling systems</title><p>It is important to mention that membrane constriction with ESCRT-III and dynamin filaments has also been suggested to involve sliding helical filaments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Roux et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Guizetti et al., 2011</xref>) and similar arrangements to those depicted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>, right were predicted for the ESCRT-III system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Fabrikant et al., 2009</xref>).</p><p>Finally, our reconstitution of cell division can easily be adapted to include other cell division proteins, such as the division site selection mechanism MinCDE, nucleoid occlusion, FtsZ cross-linkers such as ZapA, and many more middle and outer divisome components.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Plasmids and strains</title><p>Plasmids used in this work are listed in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2-data">Supplementary File 1A</xref>. <italic>E. coli</italic> DH5α was used for cloning. <italic>Caulobacter crescentus</italic> NA1000/CB15N and <italic>E. coli</italic> B/r H266 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Trueba and Woldringh, 1980</xref>) were used for cellular electron cryotomography.</p></sec><sec id="s4-2"><title>Cellular tomography sample preparation</title><p><italic>Caulobacter crescentus</italic> was grown overnight in PYE medium at 30°C.

Your article has been favorably evaluated by Richard Losick (Senior editor), Werner Kühlbrandt (Reviewing editor), and 3 reviewers, one of whom, Ethan Garner, has agreed to share his identity.</p><p>The reviewers found that this paper gives some of the best images of FtsZ rings attained thus far, both in vivo and in vitro. There are also number of findings of importance in this work that could shift the current perception of how bacteria divide.</p><p>A number of the findings described in this paper have recently been published by others, in particular the reconstitution of constriction of FtsA and FtsZ inside vesicles, and spirals of FtsZ / FtsA on lipid bilayers. While the preliminary publications of these results is unfortunate, and could be interpreted as stealing some of the authors’ “thunder”, the reviewers do not feel the authors should be penalized for this, as their manuscript puts all these observations into a more coherent interpretation than the previous studies, as well as showing high-resolution images.</p><p>The reviewers therefore find that with some modifications, in particular to the discussion, this paper should be suitable for <italic>eLife</italic>. The Reviewing editor has assembled the following comments to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>1) The text states that “the filaments are ... uninterrupted everywhere the missing wedge allows it”, but one reviewer noted filaments apparently terminating inside the visible region (as assessed by the extent of the adjacent membranes) in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1C</xref> (bottom), 1F (right bottom), 1H (bottom), <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1–figure supplement 2</xref> panels B (right bottom) and D (left bottom), <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1–figure supplement 3</xref> panels B (bottom) and E (left and right top), <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1–figure supplement 4</xref> panels B (bottom). That is actually about half the filaments shown in the figures. This claim should therefore be re-examined and clarified. The text further claims that the lack of complete rings in several cells could be explained by their orientation with respect to the tilt axis. A single sentence should be added simply listing the angular orientations of the cells with and without apparently complete rings so readers can see how consistent the trend is. Representative tomographic volumes should be deposited in a suitable database upon publication.</p><p>2) Previous electron cryotomography from the Jensen lab and high-resolution fluorescence imaging of GFP-FtsZ from at least 3 labs support an often-discontinuous Z ring. The contrast between the authors result and the current literature view is hardly addressed and should be discussed more fully.</p><p>3) The results for the in vitro reconstitution of FtsZ and FtsA in lipid vesicles are quite beautiful and the quality of the images is impressive. The question is what they mean; in other words does this reconstitution of FtsA and FtsZ filaments in vitro have any significance to cell division in vivo? One of the reviewers doubts it, because there may not be enough FtsA in the cell to make a continuous filament. Please address this issue.</p><p>4) The authors' data supports an idea that “filament sliding” could be powering division. This is a historic model in the field. The model presented by the authors is slightly different from previous sliding models, and they should explain these differences clearly.</p><p>5) The authors need to explain how their filament-sliding model agrees with the dynamics that have been observed in vivo and in vitro. The authors state that the filaments should slide against each other, and also acknowledge that the filaments turn over.</p><p>6) The authors propose that membrane constriction is driven by “repeated filament shortening through nucleotide turnover”, and on first pass, this would appear to fit with the rapid recoveries observed in vitro. But, on closer inspection, this becomes hard to reconcile with other observations:</p><p>First, if there are very few long filaments in the cell, and filaments exchange at the ends, how can the filaments constantly turn over at the rapid rate that has been observed in vitro and in vivo?</p><p>Second, if the filaments are both long, and turn over at the ends, why do Z-rings recover from all positions equally after photobleaching? If the filaments are long, going around the cell, and recovering from polymerization/depolymerisation at the ends, the rings should recover from the sides, not all over the bleached length.</p><p>7) How do the authors reconcile “sliding” with both the in vitro observations of Loose (see “The bacterial cell division proteins FtsA and FtsZ self-organize into dynamic cytoskeletal patterns”, Martin Loose and Timothy J. Mitchison) and the single-molecule tracking of FtsZ (see “Investigating Intracellular Dynamics of FtsZ Cytoskeleton with Photoactivation Single-Molecule Tracking”, Lili Niu Ji Yu)? The in vitro loose work shows that the filaments slide, but the monomers within filaments are immobile, i.e. the filaments are treadmilling, not “sliding”. Similarly, photoactivated FtsZ has shown monomers to be immobile in vivo, also in line with turnover by treadmilling, with static monomers in the filament. The authors need to address these points.</p><p>8) Why do the authors assume the sliding must occur between protfilaments? Could it not also occur between filament pairs?</p><p>9) The authors should discuss how simple protein crowding of non-filamentous proteins alone can induce bending or tubulation (see “Steric confinement of proteins on lipid membranes can drive curvature and tubulation”, Stachowiak JC1, Hayden CC, Sasaki DY; “Membrane bending by protein-protein crowding.” Stachowiak JC1, Schmid EM, Ryan CJ, Ann HS, Sasaki DY, Sherman MB, Geissler PL, Fletcher DA, Hayden CC). This “bending” by protein crowding could give rise to constrictive forces similar to (or in addition to) constriction resulting from FtsA-induced curvature. This “crowding effect”, driven by depletion interactions would push the filaments together. These depletion interactions could be very strong in vivo, due to the crowded nature of the cell.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.04601.030</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>1) The text states that “the filaments are ... uninterrupted everywhere the missing wedge allows it”, but one reviewer noted filaments apparently terminating inside the visible region (as assessed by the extent of the adjacent membranes) in</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1"><italic>Figures 1C</italic></xref> <italic>(bottom), 1F (right bottom), 1H (bottom),</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2"><italic>Figure 1–figure supplement 2</italic></xref> <italic>panels B (right bottom) and D (left bottom),</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3"><italic>Figure 1–figure supplement 3</italic></xref> <italic>panels B (bottom) and E (left and right top),</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4"><italic>Figure 1–figure supplement 4</italic></xref> <italic>panels B (bottom).

We agree that the <italic>E. coli</italic> data is weaker (because the cells are much thicker). However we strongly believe that <italic>E. coli</italic> also contains a continuous ring, as the architecture of the Z-ring between two species of gram-negative bacteria sharing the same cell division proteins would be expected to be retained. We would argue that the rings sometimes appear to be non-continuous in WT <italic>E. coli</italic> tomograms simply because the tomograms and images are not as good as for <italic>Caulobacter</italic> (much more noise, as is obvious from the images) and this was in fact the reason why we employed <italic>Caulobacter</italic> in the first place.</p><p>Please also note in this context that when over-expressed, the Z-ring is definitely continuous and these septa lead to normal divisions as far as we can tell.</p><p>To soften our conclusions somewhat, we have added the following text: “Based on these observations we concluded that <italic>E. coli</italic> Z-rings were, like in <italic>C. crescentus</italic>, probably continuous and consisted of single-layered bands that are 5-10 filaments wide.”</p><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref> Panel C shows the effect of different orientations of cells with respect to the tilt axis and the reader is referred to this section in the main text.</p><p>As for database submission, we have deposited the following two most important datasets from our work, EMDB numbers now also included in the manuscript: EMD-2814 – Caulobacter tomogram, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>; EMD-2815 – FtsAZ liposome reconstitution tomogram, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4 fig5">Figure 4A, 5A</xref>, <xref ref-type="other" rid="media10">Video 10</xref>.</p><p><italic>2) Previous electron cryotomography from the Jensen lab and high-resolution fluorescence imaging of GFP-FtsZ from at least 3 labs support an often-discontinuous Z ring. The contrast between the authors result and the current literature view is hardly addressed and should be discussed more fully</italic>.</p><p>A paragraph addressing these issues has been added: “By imaging completely unmodified cells, utilising recent advances in cryo-EM and acquiring tomograms of cells parallel to the tilt axis we conclude that the FtsZ ring is most likely continuous, made of shorter overlapping filaments. Previous analysis of <italic>C. crescentus</italic> cells by cryo-ET also showed that the FtsZ ring consists of overlapping filaments inside the inner membrane, although not all cells showed continuous rings {<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Li et al., 2007</xref>, EMBO J, 26, 4694-708}. Equally, results obtained with super resolution fluorescence microscopy techniques (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Holden et al., 2014</xref>) showed punctuated fluorescence, possibly indicating non-continuous rings. We think it is important to point out that fluorescence microscopy only images the labelled species and intensity fluctuations within the ring may have arisen from using non-functional GFP fusions and/or their over-expression. Or fluctuations coming from overlapping filaments may have been over-emphasised during image analysis because of very low signal-to-noise.”</p><p><italic>3) The results for the in vitro reconstitution of FtsZ and FtsA in lipid vesicles are quite beautiful and the quality of the images is impressive. The question is what they mean; in other words does this reconstitution of FtsA and FtsZ filaments in vitro have any significance to cell division in vivo? One of the reviewers doubts it, because there may not be enough FtsA in the cell to make a continuous filament. Please address this issue</italic>.</p><p>We do think that the <italic>in vitro</italic> architecture is similar and relevant to what happens <italic>in vivo</italic>. The fact that there is not enough FtsA to make a continuous filament (at least at the onset of the constriction) is part of our model where a continuous FtsAZ co-filament is possible only at later stages where the membrane curvature allows it (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4–figure supplement 2</xref>). FtsZ and FtsA will co-polymerise, until the repeat mismatch makes that energetically unfavourable at a given bending angle (curvature). This 'desire' to continue to polymerise leads to further bending and we would propose that there will first be short stretches of FtsA that then elongate when fully constricted (panel 1F might show a bit of FtsA filaments, actually, since there are additional filaments at 8 nm distance from the membrane).</p><p><italic>4) The authors' data supports an idea that “filament sliding” could be powering division. This is a historic model in the field. The model presented by the authors is slightly different from previous sliding models, and they should explain these differences clearly</italic>.</p><p>We are not sure which paper the reviewers refer to. The sliding model is at length discussed in (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Erickson, 2009</xref>) and this is/was cited so we do not have to discuss all the various historical models at length.</p><p><italic>5) The authors need to explain how their filament-sliding model agrees with the dynamics that have been observed in vivo and in vitro. The authors state that the filaments should slide against each other, and also acknowledge that the filaments turn over</italic>.</p><p>Yes, we propose that the FtsZ ring made of short overlapping filaments stays in accordance with the dynamics that have been observed by others, as this will enable the filaments to grow and shrink. Already discussed in the manuscript text. Filaments are free to depolymerise/polymerise as long as the ring remains continuous (because otherwise no force can be applied to the membrane). This is a self-selecting principle, of course, and one of the attractive features of our model. A whole paragraph in the Discussion section is devoted to this problem and has been slightly modified to increase clarity.</p><p><italic>6) The authors propose that membrane constriction is driven by “repeated filament shortening through nucleotide turnover”, and on first pass, this would appear to fit with the rapid recoveries observed in vitro. But, on closer inspection</italic>, <italic>this becomes hard to reconcile with other observations:</italic></p><p><italic>First, if there are very few long filaments in the cell</italic>, <italic>and filaments exchange at the ends, how can the filaments constantly turn over at the rapid rate that has been observed in vitro and in vivo?</italic></p><p><italic>Second, if the filaments are both long, and turn over at the ends, why do Z-rings recover from all positions equally after photobleaching? If the filaments are long, going around the cell, and recovering from polymerization/depolymerisation at the ends, the rings should recover from the sides, not all over the bleached length</italic>.</p><p>We do not envisage that there are long filaments going round cells. Unfortunately, the cellular tomograms do not have enough resolution to elucidate this with confidence; when looking along the long cell axes, several filaments are viewed in projection so starts and ends cannot be determined. And in the perpendicular orientation, signal is definitely too low to identify individual filaments.</p><p>We propose that there might be many short overlapping filaments forming a ring, producing many ends, enough for the dynamics to appear continuous. Recovery of ring-sub fragments after bleaching may also happen because of sliding and many ends of short filaments enable recovery everywhere.</p><p><italic>7) How do the authors reconcile “sliding” with both the in vitro observations of Loose (see “The bacterial cell division proteins FtsA and FtsZ self-organize into dynamic cytoskeletal patterns”, Martin Loose and Timothy J. Mitchison) and the single-molecule tracking of FtsZ (see “Investigating Intracellular Dynamics of FtsZ Cytoskeleton with Photoactivation Single-Molecule Tracking”, Lili Niu Ji Yu)? The in vitro loose work shows that the filaments slide, but the monomers within filaments are immobile, i.e. the filaments are treadmilling, not “sliding”. Similarly, photoactivated FtsZ has shown monomers to be immobile in vivo, also in line with turnover by treadmilling, with static monomers in the filament. The authors need to address these points</italic>.</p><p>We think it is correct to state that filament treadmilling cannot lead to constriction (because subunits do not move), unless end-tracking is involved, which no known component in the system performs. So we think it is telling that in the mentioned work no constriction was observed, in contrast to the work presented here.</p><p>The <italic>in vivo</italic> tracking is a difficult experiment and, again, fluorescently labelled FtsZ was used. It may well be that that protein was non-functional (and this is what was tracked) but we agree that similar experiments need to be investigated in the future. We plan to do this with our liposomes, where small chemical dyes may be employed, mitigating problems with large fusion proteins.</p><p><italic>8) Why do the authors assume the sliding must occur between protfilaments? Could it not also occur between</italic> <italic>filament pairs?</italic></p><p>Yes, this is possible and <italic>in vivo</italic> we often observed filaments that were associated into doublets and the sliding could of course occur between such filament pairs. This has not been discussed further because it does not change the model and requires more knowledge about FtsZ/FtsA filament doublet formation.</p><p><italic>9) The authors should discuss how simple protein crowding of non-filamentous proteins alone can induce bending or tubulation (see “Steric confinement of proteins on lipid membranes can drive curvature and tubulation”, Stachowiak JC1, Hayden CC, Sasaki DY; “Membrane bending by protein-protein crowding.” Stachowiak JC1, Schmid EM, Ryan CJ, Ann HS, Sasaki DY, Sherman MB, Geissler PL, Fletcher DA, Hayden CC). This “bending” by protein crowding could give rise to constrictive forces similar to (or in addition to) constriction resulting from FtsA-induced curvature. This “crowding effect”, driven by depletion interactions would push the filaments together. These depletion interactions could be very strong in vivo, due to the crowded nature of the cell</italic>.</p><p>This is a very attractive idea. However, it is not clear if this is still valid for proteins acting on negatively curved membranes (e.g., inside cells/liposomes). Also, if this was the case then FtsA (which is the membrane anchor here) itself would trigger significant membrane deformations from the outside and, at least in our hands, one really needs FtsZ to observe the tubulation. No action taken since there are many theoretical studies published with many different ideas, which makes this more suitable for a future review, we would suggest.</p></body></sub-article></article>
