Those affected developmentally stagnate and regress – during which they lose some of their previously acquired skills and develop an array of physical impairments.</p><p>Mutations in a gene called <italic>Mecp2</italic> on the X chromosome cause most cases of Rett Syndrome. Mice that lack the <italic>Mecp2</italic> gene develop symptoms similar to those seen in people with Rett Syndrome, and so such “<italic>Mecp2</italic> null” mice are often used to study the disorder.</p><p>Microglia, the resident immune cells of the central nervous system, have been implicated in the development of Rett Syndrome. Introducing microglia that carry the <italic>Mecp2</italic> gene into <italic>Mecp2</italic> null mice has been shown to reduce several disease-associated abnormalities. However, exactly how microglia contribute to these changes remains unknown. In addition, a more recent report failed to reproduce these findings, and instead obtained results suggesting that microglia do not affect the development of Rett syndrome.</p><p>Schafer et al. now use the mouse visual system as a model to determine if and how microglia contribute to the development of Rett Syndrome. Like many other brain regions, the developing visual system initially has a surplus of connections between neurons, or synapses, which are subsequently pruned back. Schafer et al. previously showed in the developing visual system of early postnatal (5 days after birth) control mice (who express the Mecp2 gene) that microglia contribute to this pruning by engulfing and eliminating a subset of these excessive synaptic connections. The new experiments by Schafer et al. show that another wave of microglia-mediated synaptic pruning occurs in 40-day-old juvenile control mice.</p><p>Because <italic>Mecp2</italic> null mice begin to display features of Rett Syndrome when they’re about 40 days old, Schafer et al. tested whether the microglia of these animals inappropriately prune synaptic connections. While this process occurred normally in neonatal and juvenile <italic>Mecp2</italic> null mice, microglia began to excessively engulf cells in <italic>Mecp2</italic> null mice when they were around 56 days old. Unexpectedly, deleting or reintroducing the <italic>Mecp2</italic> gene solely in the microglia of these mice had little effect on pruning activity of the microglia, and failed to affect Rett-syndrome-like symptoms in the mice.</p><p>Taken together, the data presented by Schafer et al. suggest how microglia contribute to the final stages of Rett Syndrome: by dismantling circuits of neurons that are rendered vulnerable by the loss of the <italic>Mecp2</italic> gene in other cell types.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.15224.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.15224.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>microglia</kwd><kwd>Rett Syndrome</kwd><kwd>Mecp2</kwd><kwd>synapse</kwd><kwd>engulfment</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100007429</institution-id><institution>Nancy Lurie Marks Family Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Postdoctoral Fellowship</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Schafer</surname><given-names>Dorothy P</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000025</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Mental Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>K99MH102351</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Schafer</surname><given-names>Dorothy P</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000025</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Mental Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R00MH102351</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Schafer</surname><given-names>Dorothy P</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>NIH-P30-HD-18655;

Early on these neurological deficits often have autistic-like features and are accompanied by an array of somatic impairments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chahrour and Zoghbi, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Zoghbi, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Lombardi et al., 2015</xref>). Since the discovery that mutations in the transcriptional regulator Methyl-CpG-binding protein 2 (<italic>Mecp2</italic>) underlie the vast majority of RTT cases, studies in mouse models of RTT have implicated virtually every resident brain cell type (neurons and glia) in the disorder (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Amir et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Guy et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">McGann et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Lyst and Bird, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Li, 2012</xref>). However, it remains unclear which cell types primarily contribute to each phenotype and how these vastly different cell types work in concert with each other to initiate and propagate the disorder.</p><p>Microglia, the brain resident myeloid-derived cell, are among the most recent cell types implicated in RTT pathogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Derecki et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Cronk et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Jin et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Maezawa and Jin, 2010</xref>). However, the data have been a subject of increasing controversy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Wang et al., 2015</xref>). The initial study by Derecki et al. transplanted wild-type (WT) bone marrow (BM) into an irradiated mouse model of RTT, <italic>Mecp2</italic> null mouse (<italic>Mecp2<sup>-/y</sup>(Mecp2<sup>tm1.1Jae/y</sup>)</italic>)prior to phenotypic symptom onset (~4 weeks of age) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Derecki et al., 2012</xref>). When WT BM-derived microglia-like cells engrafted the CNS, many RTT-like phenotypes were arrested and lifespan was significantly increased. While data suggested that phagocytic activity of microglia may be disrupted in <italic>Mecp2 </italic>null mice, it remained unclear precisely how microglia were contributing to the disorder. In a follow-up study, these data were replicated using a more specific, tamoxifen-inducible Cre driver on a <italic>Mecp2</italic> null background (<italic>Cx3cr1<sup>Cr</sup></italic><sup>eER</sup><italic>; Mecp2<sup>lox–stop/y</sup></italic>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Cronk et al., 2015</xref>). In addition, RNAseq analysis revealed abnormalities in glucocorticoid signaling, hypoxia responses, and inflammatory responses in peripheral macrophages and resident brain microglia isolated from <italic>Mecp2 </italic>null mice. While these data support a role for myeloid-derived MeCP2 in RTT phenotypes and pathology, another recent study demonstrated little to no effect of re-introducing MeCP2 into myeloid cells by BM chimerism in three different RTT mouse models (<italic>Mecp2<sup>tm1.1Jae/y</sup>, Mecp2<sup>LucHyg/y</sup></italic> and <italic>Mecp2<sup>R168X/y</sup> </italic>mice), or by genetic expression of MeCP2 in hematopoietic cells (including microglia) in a MeCP2 null background (<italic>Vav1-Cre; Mecp2<sup>LSL/Y</sup></italic>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Wang et al., 2015</xref>). Thus, it remains unclear if and how microglia, specifically, contribute to pathogenesis.</p><p>Recent work in the healthy, developing CNS has demonstrated a surprising new role for microglia in synaptic circuit remodeling and maturation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Schafer et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Tremblay, 2011a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">2011b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Salter and Beggs, 2014</xref>). Among the functions at developing synapses, we recently showed in the retinogeniculate system that microglia contribute to the process of removing excess synapses by phagocytosing less active or ‘weaker’ presynaptic inputs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Schafer et al., 2012</xref>). Importantly, disrupting microglial phagocytic activity resulted in sustained increases in synapse density and connectivity into adulthood. In the current study, we hypothesized that microglia-mediated synaptic remodeling were abnormal in mouse models of neurodevelopmental disorders associated with aberrant brain wiring and chose RTT to test this hypothesis. In many different RTT mouse models, synaptic circuit dysfunction can be detected often prior to presentation of significant phenotypic abnormalities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Zoghbi, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Banerjee et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Dani et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Dani and Nelson, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Nguyen et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Wood et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Noutel et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Moretti et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Medrihan et al., 2008</xref>). This includes work in the retinogeniculate system where decreases in single fiber synaptic strength are detected at early stages of disease followed by changes in structural circuits at late phenotypic stages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Noutel et al., 2011</xref>). In addition, studies assessing synapse density in postmortem human and mouse brain tissue have identified abnormalities, including reductions in synapse number (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Nguyen et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Chapleau et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Fukuda et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Jiang et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Stuss et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Xu et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chao et al., 2007</xref>).</p><p>Here, using the retinogeniculate system, we examined the interactions between microglia and synapses before, during, and after the onset of phenotypic regression in the <italic>MeCP2 </italic>null mouse (<italic>Mecp2<sup>tm1.1Bird/y</sup></italic>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Guy et al., 2001</xref>). Furthermore, we use Cre-lox technology to specifically ablate or express <italic>Mecp2 in</italic> microglia and determine whether these cells play a causative role in the structural and functional synaptic abnormalities. Our data demonstrate that microglia play a role in pathogenesis of synapses by excessively engulfing presynaptic inputs at end stages of disease in the visual system; however, this effect is largely secondary and independent of microglia-specific loss of Mecp2 expression.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Microglia engulf presynaptic inputs during a newly identified wave of synaptic refinement in the healthy, late-juvenile retinogeniculate system</title><p>The retinogeniculate system, a classic model for studying multiple waves of developmental synapse refinement, is comprised of retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) residing in the retina that project to relay neurons in the lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN) of the thalamus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Guido, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Hong and Chen, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Huberman, 2007</xref>). We previously established that microglia contribute to early phase synapse refinement by engulfing, thereby eliminating, presynaptic inputs at P5 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Schafer et al., 2012</xref>).

We hypothesized that microglia were contributing to this late phase refinement by transiently engulfing synapses between P30 and P60. We first confirmed a reduction in retinogeniculate synapses in the late, juvenile brain of WT mice by immunolabeling P30-P60 LGN with antibodies against the RGC-specific presynaptic protein vesicular glutamate transporter 2 (VGlut2), and the postsynaptic protein Homer1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). There was a significant reduction in the density of RGC-specific synapses (VGlut2/Homer1-positive) and a reduction in VGlut2-positive terminal size between P30 and P60 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A–F</xref>). This was in contrast to VGlut1-positive corticocortical synapses, which remain unchanged (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1G–I</xref>). To determine whether microglia contribute to late phase synaptic remodeling in the late, juvenile brain and establish a baseline to assess whether these interactions are disrupted in phenotypic <italic>Mecp2</italic> null mice, we next used our established assay to monitor microglia-synapse interactions in the retinogeniculate system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Schafer et al., 2012</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">2014</xref>). One day prior to analysis, RGC inputs were labeled by injection of anterograde dye into both eyes, cholera toxin conjugated to Alexa dye 594 or 647 (CTB-594 or CTB-647), which is resistant to lysosomal degradation. Microglia were labeled by either genetic expression of EGFP (<italic>Cx3CR1<sup>EGFP/+ </sup></italic>mice) or by immunohistochemistry using an antibody specific to the microglia-marker, Iba-1. Lysosomes that are specific to and within microglia were labeled with an antibody against CD68. Similar to previously published work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Schafer et al., 2012</xref>), microglia preferentially engulfed RGC inputs within the LGN at P5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>) compared to older ages. However, our new data revealed a second wave of engulfment that occurred in the juvenile brain specifically at P40, which is downregulated by P50 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A–B</xref>) and accompanied by a transient increase in lysosomal content within microglia (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). Together with recent work demonstrating decreases in RGC arbor size and bouton numbers between P30 and P60 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Hong et al., 2014</xref>), our work suggests that microglia contribute to this fine-scale refinement by engulfing RGC presynaptic inputs at P40.<fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.15224.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Microglia transiently engulf retinogeniculate presynaptic inputs in the juvenile P40 brain consistent with late stage synapse refinement.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Representative surface rendered microglia (green) and engulfed retinogeniculate inputs (red) from P30, P40, and P60 LGN.

In addition, to measure lysosomal content, microglia were labeled with anti-CD68.

Consistent with engulfment being specific to synaptic compartments, we observed no significant RGC death in the retina or LGN (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>) and we observed no changes in engulfment of other neuronal compartments including NeuN-positive somas or MAP2-positive dendrites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>). In addition and in contrast to previously published reports (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Cronk et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Jin et al., 2015</xref>), we observed no significant changes in morphology (as measured by volume of the cell) or density of microglia, indexes of the gross, overall reactive state of these cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E–F</xref>). However, our analyses were restricted to microglia within the LGN, a region that was not analyzed previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Cronk et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Jin et al., 2015</xref>).

Cre-lox experiments demonstrate that microglia-specific loss of <italic>Mecp2</italic> expression does not induce excessive engulfment or synapse loss and, similarly, gain of microglia-specific <italic>Mecp2</italic> expression in a null background also has little effect on attenuation of these parameters.

Furthermore, this process was dependent upon neural activity whereby microglia preferentially engulfed less active or ‘weaker’ presynaptic inputs. It is unknown whether this late phase presynaptic input engulfment is dependent upon complement or activity. Given that CR3 and C3 (the ligand for CR3) decrease over development and C3, in particular, is very low/undetectable in the juvenile brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Schafer et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Stevens et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Stephan et al., 2013</xref>), it is likely that another mechanism underlies microglia-synapse interactions in juvenile animals.

Our data offer significant insight into these unanswered questions. We demonstrate that microglia excessively engulf presynaptic inputs in the <italic>Mecp2</italic> null LGN concomitant with loss of structural retinogeniculate-specific synapses in the same region. These data are in contrast to previously published work that has suggested microglial phagocytic activity is decreased compared to WT mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Derecki et al., 2012</xref>). However, this discrepancy can be explained by differences in experimental design used to measure phagocytic activity. Assays used to measure phagocytosis in previous work were in vitro in response to the addition of UV-irradiated neural precursor cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Derecki et al., 2012</xref>), a context that is very different from assessing engulfment of presynaptic inputs in the retinogeniculate system in vivo. In the same study, annexin V was administered in vivo to block phagocytic activity in <italic>Mecp2</italic> null mice with WT BM-derived cells (<italic>Mecp2<sup>LSL/y</sup>/Lysm<sup>Cre</sup></italic>), which resulted in failure of <italic>WT</italic> BM-derived cells to attenuate phenotypes in <italic>Mecp2<sup>LSL/y</sup> </italic>mice. However, it is unclear where and how annexin V is acting given that phagocytosis was not directly assayed in vivo and the <italic>Lysm<sup>Cre</sup></italic> induces expression in many myeloid-derived cell types besides microglia. Indeed, this same group published findings that loss of <italic>Mecp2</italic> primarily affects peripheral myeloid-derived cell numbers and gene expression early in disease and only later affects microglia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Cronk et al., 2015</xref>). Going forward, it will be important to understand the contribution of these peripheral cell types to disease phenotypes.</p><p>To address whether microglia were primary or secondary to synapse loss, we used Cre-lox technology to specifically express or ablate <italic>Mecp2</italic> in microglia. In doing so, we demonstrate that synapse loss and excessive engulfment in <italic>Mecp2</italic> null mice are largely independent of microglial-specific loss of <italic>Mecp2</italic> expression. This is inconsistent with data in which re-expression of <italic>Mecp2</italic>in myeloid-derived cells (including microglia) attenuates several behavioral phenotypes and cell loss in <italic>Mecp2</italic> null mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Derecki et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Cronk et al., 2015</xref>).

Furthermore, our data are consistent with the newest report from a different group that re-expression of <italic>Mecp2 </italic>in myeloid cells (including microglia) does not attenuate phenotypes in <italic>Mecp2</italic> null or mutant mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Wang et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>While our data suggest that microglia are largely secondary responders to synapses rendered vulnerable by loss of Mecp2 in other CNS cell types, the significance of excessive synaptic engulfment to disease progression is still unknown. The molecular mechanism driving secondary engulfment of synapses in <italic>Mecp2</italic> null mice and whether modulating this excessive engulfment results in attenuation of synapse loss are also unknown. Complement-dependent phagocytic signaling is one mechanism by which microglia have been shown to engulf synapses in the healthy brain, a pathway which is also dysregulated in disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Schafer et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Stephan et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Chung et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Hong et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Lui et al., 2016</xref>).

Finally, we demonstrate that microglia are largely secondary responders in two mouse models of RTT (<italic>Mecp2</italic> null and <italic>Mecp2<sup>LSL/y</sup></italic>).

The discrepancy may result from difference in paradigms used to express <italic>Mecp2</italic>. For example, in our study, we induced recombination with tamoxifen in <italic>Cx3cr1<sup>CreER/+</sup>;Mecp2<sup>LSL/y</sup> </italic>mice at P21-P25 and assessed phenotypes at ≥P78. This paradigm results in purely microglia-specific expression of <italic>Mecp2</italic> due to ongoing hematopoiesis that replaces peripheral <italic>Mecp2</italic>-null cells with WT cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Goldmann et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Yona et al., 2013</xref>). In contrast, Cronk, Derecki et al. induced recombination in these same mice at 9 weeks (~P63) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Cronk et al., 2015</xref>. This late tamoxifen administration may be necessary to observe significant effects on phenotypes and may result from expression of <italic>Mecp2</italic> in peripheral myeloid cells. Furthermore, previous work by this same group demonstrated a significant attenuation of phenotypic regression in <italic>Mecp2 null</italic> mice after BM transplantation at P28 and engraftment with WT myeloid cells by ~P84 or with Cre mediated recombination (<italic>Lysm<sup>Cre</sup></italic>) in myeloid cells from birth <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Derecki et al., 2012</xref>. These paradigms also affect <italic>Mecp2</italic> expression in peripheral immune cells. Thus, we speculate that these divergent results may be due to differences in peripheral myeloid-derived cell-specific <italic>Mecp2</italic> expression, which is intriguing and worthy of future investigation. It should also be noted that we did not measure the entire panel of phenotypic abnormalities (breathing, open field, etc.) or survival so it is unknown if our results differ in these contexts. Finally, it is unclear how recently published data using a similar BM chimerism strategy but a different Cre mouse (Vav1-Cre) resulted in contradictory results and is also worthy of follow-up investigation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Wang et al., 2015</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3-4"><title>Summary</title><p>There have been conflicting reports regarding if and how microglia contribute to phenotypes in mouse models of RTT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Derecki et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Cronk et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Wang et al., 2015</xref>).

Taken together with previously published data that single fiber strength decreases during early stages of phenotypic regression in the <italic>Mecp2</italic> null retinogeniculate system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Noutel et al., 2011</xref>), we propose that microglia dismantle neural circuits in the late phenotypic <italic>Mecp2</italic> null brain by engulfing synapses previously rendered vulnerable and weakened by loss of <italic>Mecp2</italic> expression in, most likely, neurons.

Briefly, both eyes were injected with the same fluorophore-conjugated tracer (either cholera toxin β subunit conjugated to Alexa dye 594 (CTB-594) or 647 (CTB-647) (Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA). Mice were then sacrificed 24 hr later. Brains were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA; EMS, Hatfield, PA) for 3–4 hrs and 40 µm thick sections were prepared. Sections were further immonstained with antibodies against Iba-1 (Wako Chemicals, Richmond, VA) and/or CD68 (AbD Serotec, Raleigh, NC) to measure lysosomal content as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Schafer et al., 2012</xref>). For analysis of non-synaptic material, adjacent brain sections were immunolabeled with antibodies against Iba-1 (Wako Chemicals, Richmond, VA), NeuN (EMD Millipore, Darmstadt, Germany), and MAP2 (EMD Millipore, Darmstadt, Germany).

Two LGN sections were imaged per animal and 4-63x fields of view were collected from the dorsal and ventral regions of each dLGN (8 fields of view total per animal). Images were subsequently processed in Image J (NIH) and analyzed using Imaris software (Bitplane, Zurich, Switzerland) as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Schafer et al., 2012</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">2014</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-3"><title>Synapse density quantification</title><p>Synapses were quantified similar to previously published work with modifications (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Schafer et al., 2012</xref>).

Tissue sections 15 or 40 µm) were subsequently prepared and immunostained for synaptic proteins. Antibodies included anti-Homer1 (Synaptic Systems GmbH, Goettingen, Germany), anti-Vesicular Glutamate Transporter 2 (VGlut2; EMD Millipore, Darmstadt, Germany), and anti-VGlut1 (EMD Millipore, Darmstadt, Germany) followed by appropriate, species-specific secondary antibodies conjugated to Alexa dyes (Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA). Immunostained sections were imaged with a 63x Zeiss pan-Apochromat oil, 1.4 NA objective on a Zeiss LSM 700 Laser Scanning Confocal equipped with diode lasers (405, 488, 555 and 633 nm) and Zen image acquisition software (Carl Zeiss, Oberkochen, Germany). Alternatively, sections were imaged with a Leica SP8 X confocal (Wetzlar, Germany) equipped with multiple laser lines (405, 458, 488, 496, 514, and 470–670 nm white light) using a HC PL APO 63x/1.40 oil CS2 or a HC PL APO 40x/1.10 W motCORR (only 40 µm-thick sections) objective and LasX software. To maintain consistency across animals, the most medial dLGN sections were chosen for imaging. A total of 3 confocal z-stacks (1 µm spacing) were then collected from dorsal, medial, and ventral regions of the dLGN section. For each z-stack, (2 confocal planes with the most robust DAPI staining were subsequently chosen and analyzed for blind analysis using Image J software (NIH, Bethesda, MD). As a result, a total of 6 single confocal planes were analyzed for each animal. Fluorescent images of pre and/or postsynaptic markers were separated and thresholded blind. Density of thresholded pre and/or postsynaptic markers were calculated using the measure particles function where a puncta size was defined and maintained for all analyses across animals for each marker (VGlut2 = 0.2-infinity; Homer1 = 0.1-infinity; VGlut1 = 0.1-infinity). The colocalization of puncta was quantified subsequently using the Image Calculator function applied to thresholded pre and postsynaptic images. The size and area of each puncta were recorded and then the total puncta area and average puncta size were calculated for each animal. The synapse or terminal densities were calculated by taking the total puncta area and dividing it by the total area of the field of view. The puncta density and puncta size were averaged across fields for each animal.</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>Quantification of cell number and cell death</title><p>Samples were prepared and imaged similar to methods described for engulfment and synapse density quantification (see above).

Sections were then immunostained with a rabbit antibody directed against the C-terminus of Mecp2 (a generous gift from M.

Sections were then washed and HRP-conjugated rabbit and Alexa fluor-conjugated rat antibodies were added to the sections for 1–2 hr at room temperature. Sections were subsequently washed and an Alexa-fluor conjugated anti-HRP antibody was added overnight at 4 degrees. After the overnight incubation, sections were mounted and imaged. It should be noted that several other Mecp2 antibodies and staining conditions were attempted, but only this antibody and condition enabled us to detect Mecp2 protein even in WT microglia. Two 63x fields of view were collected in the lateral, medial, and ventral portions of the LGN per animal (3 animals per condition) and images were assessed for Mecp2-positive microglia.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Genomic DNA extraction for validating loss or gain of Mecp2 expression</title><p>Sorted cells were lysed and digested in TES buffer (10 mM Tris buffer, pH = 8, 5 mM EDTA, 0.1 M NaCL, 0.5% SDS and 100 ug PK) overnight in 56°C.

Once those issues are cleared though, this paper would make a valuable contribution to the field.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic></p><p>MECP2 mutations in humans cause majority of the Rett Syndrome cases, an X-linked neurodevelopmental disorder with severe intellectual and motor phenotypes. Previous studies suggested that the function of this gene in microglia is critically impaired in the disease. Moreover, rescue of some of the disease phenotypes in Rett model mice was observed, following bone marrow transplantation after irradiation. However, other studies did not replicate these findings, making it unclear whether microglial <italic>Mecp2</italic> function is involved in Rett syndrome pathogenesis.</p><p>This manuscript by Dr. Schafer and colleagues investigate the function of <italic>Mecp2</italic> gene specifically in microglial synaptic pruning using the mouse retinogeniculate system.</p><p>The manuscript starts with the demonstration of a previously uncharacterized early adult pruning event that occurs around P40 in the wildtype mouse geniculate. They find that synaptic pruning, measured as the engulfment of labeled RGC terminals, is unaffected in P5-P50 <italic>Mecp2</italic> KO mice compared to WT. But in <italic>Mecp2</italic>-KO mice (that are older than 56 days) there is enhanced axonal terminal engulfment and lysosomal content in microglia. They then use global null and conditional loss- or gain-of-function alleles of <italic>Mecp2</italic> in combination with CX3CR1-CreER to specifically silence or rescue the expression of <italic>Mecp2</italic> in microglia. They find that manipulations of <italic>Mecp2</italic> expression in microglial have little effect on excessive engulfment, structural and functional visual circuit defects, or other general phenotypes associated with <italic>Mecp2</italic>-function. Based on these results the authors conclude that microglial contribution to Rett syndrome is likely to be secondary after the loss of <italic>Mecp2</italic> function in other CNS cell types.</p><p>The article is well-written, and the reported experimental data provide compelling evidence in support of the authors' conclusions. Use of multiple genetic approaches in combination with rigorous analysis of microglial phenotypes is impressive. However, the manuscript currently does not present any evidence for effective <italic>Mecp2</italic> gene manipulation using CX3CR1-CreER. Without such evidence we cannot exclude the possibility that the observed minimal phenotypes are due to ineffective manipulation of <italic>Mecp2</italic> expression in microglia by CX3CR1-CreER. Moreover, there are several other concerns with regards to how the synapses were quantified, which are detailed below. The authors should provide new data and analyses to address these concerns.</p><p>1) Lack of evidence showing effective modification of <italic>Mecp2</italic> gene in microglia by CX3CR1-CreER. CX3CR1-CreER transgenic mouse line was thoroughly characterized and confirmed as a good tool to silence gene expression in microglia. However, (as with any Cre line used in a conditional gene manipulation paradigm) the authors should demonstrate that using their tamoxifen injection paradigm, in their brain region of interest, the microglial expression of <italic>Mecp2</italic> is altered. Without such assurance it is hard to exclude that ineffective <italic>Mecp2</italic> manipulation in microglia in general or the geniculate microglia in particular leads to the observed weak phenotypes. Considering how controversial this particular field is, the authors should provide this crucial control so their results are fully supported. Effectiveness of this manipulation in multiple animals should be demonstrated to be able to exclude the possibility of variability between individual mice.</p><p>2) Quantification of synapse number in the geniculate. The authors use an imaging-based technique to estimate geniculate synapses. This technique, the quantification of co-localized pre and postsynaptic protein signals, is appropriate; however, the provided images show that homer staining is very dense and potentially mostly not synaptic. At the resolution and magnification of the provided images it is hard to conclude whether VGlut2 and homer are truly co-localizing or is it just pure chance. Also the materials and method section describing how this quantification was done is not detailed. Where in geniculate did the pictures originate? It is important that the images were acquired from the same area in different animals so they could be comparable. How were the images acquired? Was the analysis performed on single optical sections or maximum projections? Also VGlut1 synapses were quantified as well, but no representative images are provided, so it is hard to evaluate the quality of staining on which that analysis was based.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>In this paper Schafer and colleagues investigate the role of microglia in the Rett syndrome (<italic>Mecp2</italic> null mouse). They first focus on the pruning role of microglia and find that this is normal at the onset of the disease but it increases at later stages. They also demonstrate that gain and -most importantly- loss of the <italic>Mecp2</italic> gene in microglia has little effect on engulfment and on characteristic Rett phenotypes. Thus, the main conclusion here is that microglia cannot be considered major contributors in Rett pathology.</p><p>This is clearly a &quot;non-discovery&quot; but it is an important one because it resolves conflicting reports on this matter. The controversy is exemplified but the clashing titles of the two major publications on this topic: &quot;Wild-type microglia arrest pathology in a mouse model of Rett syndrome&quot; (Derecki et al. Nature 2015) and &quot;Wild-type microglia do not reverse pathology in mouse models of Rett syndrome&quot; (Wang et al. Nature 2015). Thus, I believe the work of Schafer and colleagues to be of value and to deserve publication in a rigorous and respected journal.</p><p>There are few points, however, that need to be clarified and better demonstrated.</p><p>1) The authors show that at later stages <italic>Mecp2</italic> microglia have more phagosomes containing pre-synaptic inputs. This increase can be explained by active synaptic remodeling but also by engulfment of neurons within the <italic>Mecp2</italic> brain. They exclude the latter by comparing the number of neurons and nuclei in wildtype and <italic>Mecp2</italic> null. Considering the large number of cells in the brain this cannot be considered a sensitive method and needs to be backed up by a direct visualization and quantification of neuronal (non-synaptic) material in microglia. If microglia are involved in active synaptic remodeling they should not show increased -generic- neuronal markers in their phagosomes. This point is critical also considering that in <italic>Mecp2</italic> null microglia there 3 times more lysosomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). Considering that only a smaller fraction contains synaptic material (compare graph in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref> with <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>) the authors should exclude that these vesicles contain non-synaptic material resulting from the engulfment of entire neurons.</p><p>2) Throughout this paper the authors write that microglia at later stages in the <italic>Mecp2</italic> null mouse remove weaken synapses. That microglia can remove weaken synapses was shown by Schafer and colleagues in their 2012 Neuron paper. Here, however, they give no evidence that in <italic>Mecp2</italic> microglia remove weaker synapses. They should remove these statements or provide evidence for this.</p><p>3).Please, note that in. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref> the postsynaptic protein Homer1 is visible at P30 (iii) but not at P60 (iii) nevertheless the staining is quantified in E.</p><p>4) In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref> it is written that engulfment of presynaptic inputs is significantly increased over old ages. Judging from the graph the opposite is true.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Additional data files and statistical comments):</italic></p><p>The authors have stained <italic>Mecp2</italic> and wild-type with an anti-activated-Caspase 3 antibody.

One major issue was that attaining enough RNA or protein from microglia isolated from the LGN for qPCR or western blot was not technically feasible and/or required a large amount of animals from lines of mice that do not reproduce well. As a result, we attempted immunohistochemistry on our existing tissue (from engulfment and synapse analysis experiments) to detect <italic>Mecp2</italic> protein in LGN microglia. For several weeks we tried many different antibodies and staining conditions and were never able to detect <italic>Mecp2</italic> protein even in wild-type microglia (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Author response image 1</xref> for a subset of attempts). This is likely due to very low expression of <italic>Mecp2</italic> in microglia (Zhang et al. J. Neurosci 2014). However, we finally achieved success using a non-commercially available rabbit <italic>Mecp2</italic> antibody developed by and obtained from Dr. Michael Greenberg. Using this antibody directed against the C-terminus of <italic>Mecp2</italic> combined with antigen retrieval and HRP amplification (Ballas et al. Nat Neurosci2009), we were able to detect low levels of <italic>Mecp2</italic> protein in 40-50% of wild-type LGN microglia and <italic>Mecp2</italic> expression was either lost with recombination in <italic>Cx3CR1<sub>CreER/WT</sub>;Mecp2<sub>fl/y</sub></italic>+TAM or <italic>Cx3CR1<sub>CreER/WT</sub>;Mecp2<sub>LSL/y</sub></italic>+Oil mice or gained in <italic>Cx3CR1<sub>CreER/WT</sub>;Mecp2<sub>LSL/y</sub></italic>+TAM mice (see new Figures: <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>). In addition, we performed other experiments to show sufficient recombination including analysis of efficiency and specificity of tdTomato expression following tamoxifen injection in <italic>Cx3CR1<sub>CreER/WT</sub></italic>;Rosa26-tdTomato mice (see new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>).

Also VGlut1 synapses were quantified as well, but no representative images are provided, so it is hard to evaluate the quality of staining on which that analysis was based.</italic></p><p>The main conclusion of this part of the paper is that we see changes in presynaptic inputs and thus a decrease in structural synapses (juxtaposed pre and postsynaptic elements). There is no significant change in the postsynaptic (or even extrasynaptic) Homer immunoreactivity. We have updated the manuscript to better clarify this point and included quantification of Homer immunoreactivity (see updated <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). In addition, the representative images in the original manuscript (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>) were maximum intensity projections as we felt this most fully demonstrated the loss of presynaptic inputs (the main conclusion). However, this was at the expense of postsynaptic staining appearing relatively non-specific and dense. Given that the analysis was actually performed on single confocal planes, we modified this figure to include single planes which better show co- localization (see updated <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>).</p><p>The reviewer also raises questions regarding the synaptic localization of Homer. We originally chose Homer given that, out of all postsynaptic markers, it gave us the most consistent and strong signal to noise. Interestingly, retinogeniculate synapses represent &lt;10% of presynaptic inputs in the LGN (Bickford et al. J Comp Neurol2009). We have noted this in the revised manuscript. Thus, while it is appreciated that some Homer immunoreactivity could be extrasynaptic, our data are consistent with a large proportion of Homer immunoreactivity as postsynaptic and colocalized with other non- RGC (non-VGlut2 positive) terminals. This is demonstrated by increased co-localization of Homer/VGlut1 versus Homer/ VGlut2 (see updated <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Author response image 2</xref>). We have also included <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Author response image 3</xref> demonstrating that VGlut2 terminals also co- localize with another postsynaptic marker, anti-PSD-95, to a similar degree as Homer. Furthermore, to address whether colocalization occurs purely by chance, we rotated the VGlut2 channel 90 degrees and performed co-localization analysis. This analysis demonstrates that there is higher cumulative probability of colocalization in correctly oriented VGlut2/Homer or VGlut2/PSD-95 images as compared to those in which the VGlut2 channel was rotated (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Author response image 3</xref>).<fig id="fig7" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.15224.016</object-id><label>Author response image 2.</label><caption><title>VGlut1-containing synapses are more abundant than VGlut2- containing synapses within the dLGN.</title><p>Quantification of the density of VGlut1 or VGlut2 immunoreactive puncta colocalized with Homer.

Briefly, for each animal, 3 confocal z stacks were taken in the same regions of the dLGN. Then, 2 planes out of each z-stack were chosen blindly based on the most abundant DAPI staining for analysis. As a result, a total of 6 images were analyzed in nearly identical locations were analyzed across animals.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic> </p><p> <italic>There are few points, however, that need to be clarified and better demonstrated.</italic> </p><p><italic>1) The authors show that at later stages Mecp2 microglia have more phagosomes containing pre-synaptic inputs. This increase can be explained by active synaptic remodeling but also by engulfment of neurons within the Mecp2 brain. They exclude the latter by comparing the number of neurons and nuclei in wildtype and Mecp2 null. Considering the large number of cells in the brain this cannot be considered a sensitive method and needs to be backed up by a direct visualization and quantification of neuronal (non-synaptic) material in microglia. If microglia are involved in active synaptic remodeling they should not show increased -generic- neuronal markers in their phagosomes. This point is critical also considering that in Mecp2 null microglia there 3 times more lysosomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). Considering that only a smaller fraction contains synaptic material (compare graph in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref> with <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>) the authors should exclude that these vesicles contain non-synaptic material resulting from the engulfment of entire neurons.</italic></p><p>We appreciate the reviewers comment and have done more analysis of engulfment of non- synaptic material including NeuN immunoreactive neuron cell somas and Map2-immunoreactive somato-dendritic domains within the LGN (see updated <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>). We do not observe an increase in engulfment of these neuronal compartments as compared to presynaptic input engulfment. This is consistent with our data and previously published work demonstrating no neuronal cell death in the mouse models of Rett Syndrome or in human patients (reviewed in Chahrour and Zoghbi Neuron 2007; Banerjee et al. Front Psychiatry 2012). This reviewer does raise an interesting point as to what exactly, if anything, occupies these remaining lysosomes. While outside the scope of the current manuscript, this would be an interesting future direction.</p><p><italic>2) Throughout this paper the authors write that microglia at later stages in the Mecp2 null mouse remove weaken synapses. That microglia can remove weaken synapses was shown by Schafer and colleagues in their 2012 Neuron paper. Here, however, they give no evidence that in Mecp2 microglia remove weaker synapses. They should remove these statements or provide evidence for this.</italic></p><p>We suggest that microglia engulf weakened synapses. This is based on previous electrophysiology demonstrating an overall weakening of retinogeniculate synapses by P30 (Noutel et al. Neuron 2011), a timepoint preceding any significant signs of engulfment. While we still suggest this as a possibility in the manuscript, we have toned down the language and removed this from the overall conclusions.</p><p><italic>3) Please, note that in. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref> the postsynaptic protein Homer1 is visible at P30 (iii) but not at P60 (iii) nevertheless the staining is quantified in E.</italic></p><p>These data do appear in our pdf version of the manuscript, which was downloaded for review at <italic>eLife</italic>. It should be noted that the Homer staining pattern does differ across ages (soma and small puncta staining at P30 versus only puncta staining at P60). This point was raised by Reviewer 1 and it may have some biological significance and differences in extrasynaptic (somatic) versus synaptic (small puncta) homer localization.</p><p><italic>4) In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref> it is written that engulfment of presynaptic inputs is significantly increased over old ages. Judging from the graph the opposite is true.</italic></p><p>We apologize. This was poorly written. We modified the figure legend to better reflect that, as the reviewer correctly points out, engulfment is higher at P5 and P40 versus P60.</p><p> <italic>Reviewer #2 (Additional data files and statistical comments):</italic> </p><p> <italic>The authors have stained Mecp2 and wild-type with an anti-activated-Caspase 3 antibody.
