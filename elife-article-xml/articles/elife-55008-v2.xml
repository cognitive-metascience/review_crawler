Here, we revise this hypothesis, applying fluctuation analysis to resolve Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals otherwise obscured during large Ca<sup>2+</sup> elevations. We find the rising phase of global Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals is punctuated by a flurry of puffs, which terminate before the peak by a mechanism involving partial ER Ca<sup>2+</sup> depletion. The continuing rise in Ca<sup>2+</sup>, and persistence of global signals even when puffs are absent, reveal a second mode of spatiotemporally diffuse Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling. Puffs make only small, transient contributions to global Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals, which are sustained by diffuse release of Ca<sup>2+</sup> through a functionally distinct process. These two modes of IP<sub>3</sub>-mediated Ca<sup>2+</sup> liberation have important implications for downstream signaling, imparting spatial and kinetic specificity to Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent effector functions and Ca<sup>2+</sup> transport.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>ip3 receptor</kwd><kwd>calcium signaling</kwd><kwd>calcium imaging</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000057</institution-id><institution>National Institute of General Medical Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R37 GM048071</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Parker</surname><given-names>Ian</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Cell-wide Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals that regulate numerous cellular functions comprise dual Ca<sup>2+</sup> release modes through IP<sub>3</sub> receptors, punctate transients mediated by clustered receptors and spatiotemporally diffuse release through functionally distinct receptors.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Cytosolic Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals generated by the liberation of Ca<sup>2+</sup> ions sequestered in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) through inositol trisphosphate receptor (IP<sub>3</sub>R) channels regulate ubiquitous cellular processes as diverse as gene transcription, secretion, mitochondrial energetics, electrical excitability and fertilization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Clapham, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Berridge et al., 2000</xref>). Cells achieve such unique repertories of Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent functions by generating a hierarchy of cytosolic Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals with markedly different spatial scales and temporal durations, ranging from brief, localized Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients called puffs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Parker and Yao, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Yao et al., 1995</xref>) to larger and more prolonged Ca<sup>2+</sup> elevations that engulf the cell. Global elevations in cytosolic Ca<sup>2+</sup> typically last several seconds and may appear as waves that propagate throughout the cell (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Woods et al., 1986</xref>). They can recur as oscillations with periods between a few seconds and a few minutes, and are thought to encode information in a ‘digital’ manner, whereby increasing stimulus strength results predominantly in an increase in frequency rather than amplitude (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Parekh, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Smedler and Uhlén, 2014</xref>). Puffs, on the other hand, are tightly localized elevations in cytosolic Ca<sup>2+</sup> generated by stationary clusters containing small numbers of IP<sub>3</sub>Rs, which last only tens or a few hundreds of milliseconds and remain restricted within a few micrometers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bootman et al., 1997a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Parker et al., 1996</xref>).</p><p>The patterning of cellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals evoked by IP<sub>3</sub> is largely determined by the functional properties of the IP<sub>3</sub>Rs and by their spatial arrangement in the ER membrane. Crucially, the opening of IP<sub>3</sub>R channels is regulated by cytosolic Ca<sup>2+</sup> itself, in addition to IP<sub>3</sub>. Low concentrations of Ca<sup>2+</sup> increase the open probability of the channel whereas high concentrations favor a closed state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Parker and Ivorra, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Iino, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bezprozvanny et al., 1991</xref>). This biphasic modulation of IP<sub>3</sub>Rs by Ca<sup>2+</sup> leads to the phenomenon of Ca<sup>2+</sup>-induced Ca<sup>2+</sup> release (CICR). Ca<sup>2+</sup> diffusing from one open channel may thus trigger the opening of adjacent channels, with self-reinforcing CICR countered by Ca<sup>2+</sup> feedback inhibition. The clustered distribution of IP<sub>3</sub>Rs further shapes the extent of this regenerative process. CICR may remain locally restricted to a single cluster, containing from a few to a few tens of functional IP<sub>3</sub>Rs, to produce a puff; whereas it is proposed that a global response is generated by successive cycles of CICR and Ca<sup>2+</sup> diffusion acting over longer spatial ranges to recruit successive puff sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bootman et al., 1997a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Parker et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Berridge, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Bootman and Berridge, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Callamaras et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Dawson et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Marchant, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Marchant et al., 1999</xref>). However, the transition between these modes remains an area of active investigation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Rückl and Rüdiger, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Miyamoto and Mikoshiba, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Sneyd et al., 2017a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Sneyd et al., 2017b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Rückl et al., 2015</xref>), and recent theoretical simulations have questioned whether Ca<sup>2+</sup> released through puff activity is alone sufficient to propagate global cytosolic Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Piegari et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>Here, we examined the nature of Ca<sup>2+</sup> liberation through IP<sub>3</sub>Rs during global cellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals, asking whether this accords with the widely-accepted ‘building block’ model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bootman et al., 1997a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Parker et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Berridge, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Bootman and Berridge, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Marchant, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Marchant et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Mataragka and Taylor, 2018</xref>) in which global signals are constructed by the summation of coordinated, pulsatile activation of Ca<sup>2+</sup> release at puff sites; or whether global signals also involve an additional mode of Ca<sup>2+</sup> liberation that is more homogeneous in space and time. Although Ca<sup>2+</sup> puffs are often evident during the initial rising phase of global Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bootman et al., 1997a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Bootman and Berridge, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Marchant, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Marchant et al., 1999</xref>), a challenge in answering this question arises because puffs become obscured as the overall cytosolic Ca<sup>2+</sup> level continues to increase. To reveal and monitor temporally rapid and spatially confined Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients (puffs) during even large amplitude global Ca<sup>2+</sup> elevations we developed image processing and analysis routines to analyze local fluctuations in Ca<sup>2+</sup> fluorescence signals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Ellefsen et al., 2019</xref>). We applied these routines to Ca<sup>2+</sup> recordings obtained both by total internal reflection fluorescence (TIRF) microscopy to resolve signals arising near the plasma membrane, and by lattice light-sheet (LLS) microscopy to acquire optical sections through the cell interior. We find that rapid flurries of Ca<sup>2+</sup> puffs accompany the rising phase of global Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals evoked by photoreleased IP<sub>3</sub> and by agonist stimulation of the IP<sub>3</sub> signaling pathway, but these rapidly terminate before the peak of the response through a mechanism regulated by ER Ca<sup>2+</sup> store content. The punctate liberation of Ca<sup>2+</sup> via transient, localized Ca<sup>2+</sup> puffs contributes only a small fraction of the total Ca<sup>2+</sup> liberated during global Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals, which are instead sustained by diffuse Ca<sup>2+</sup> liberation through a functionally distinct mode of release. These two modes of IP<sub>3</sub>-mediated Ca<sup>2+</sup> release will likely selectively activate different populations of effectors; those positioned close to the IP<sub>3</sub>R clusters that mediate puffs and which respond to brief, repetitive transients of [Ca<sup>2+</sup>], and others that respond to a more sustained, spatially diffuse elevation of bulk cytosolic [Ca<sup>2+</sup>].</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Fluctuation processing of Ca<sup>2+</sup> images highlights transient signals</title><p>Our central question was whether IP<sub>3</sub>-evoked Ca<sup>2+</sup> liberation during cell-wide Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals arises through coordinated activation of pulsatile, spatially -localized events, analogous to the local Ca<sup>2+</sup> puffs observed with weaker IP<sub>3</sub> stimulation or after loading cells with EGTA to suppress global signals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Dargan and Parker, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Smith et al., 2009</xref>). To better visualize and identify transient, localized Ca<sup>2+</sup> events occurring during the course of larger, global elevations of Ca<sup>2+</sup>, we developed an image processing algorithm to highlight and quantify temporal fluctuations of the Ca<sup>2+</sup> fluorescence signal. We previously described the use of pixel-by-pixel power spectrum analysis of temporal Ca<sup>2+</sup> fluctuations for this purpose (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Swaminathan et al., 2020</xref>), but this is computationally intensive and unfeasible for large data sets. Here, we adopted a faster approximation, by first temporally band-pass filtering image stacks and then calculating the standard deviation (SD) of the fluorescence fluctuations at each pixel over a running time window (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Ellefsen et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>The conceptual basis of the algorithm is illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> (see also <xref ref-type="video" rid="fig1video1">Figure 1—video 1</xref>). WT HEK293 cells were loaded with the fluorescent Ca<sup>2+</sup> indicator Cal520 and imaged by TIRF microscopy during global cytosolic Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals. The panels in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref> show Cal520 fluorescence of individual image frames of a HEK cell captured before (i) and after (ii-v) photorelease of i-IP<sub>3</sub>, an active, metabolically stable analog of IP<sub>3</sub>. Photoreleased i-IP<sub>3</sub> evoked a widespread increase in fluorescence throughout the cell that peaked within about 5 s, during which time several transient, local ‘hot spots’ were evident. These are visible in <xref ref-type="video" rid="fig1video1">Figure 1—video 1</xref> but are not readily apparent in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref> because of the extended grey scale required to encompass the peak global fluorescence signal. To illustrate the activity at local hot spots, we monitored fluorescence from regions of interest (ROIs) centered on 24 sites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). Traces from these sites showed progressive, large fluorescence increases above the baseline, with small, superimposed transients (puffs) during the rising phase. To better discriminate these localized signals, we high-pass (1 Hz) filtered the image stack, pixel-by-pixel, to strip out the slow increase in global fluorescence. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref> shows mean power spectra averaged from the 24 sites during image sequences (5 s) acquired before (control; blue trace) and immediately following (red trace) photorelease of i-IP<sub>3</sub>. The control, baseline spectrum showed substantially uniform power across all frequencies above the applied 1 Hz high-pass filter, compatible with the dominant noise source arising from ‘white’ photon shot noise. Strikingly, the spectrum obtained during the rise of the global Ca<sup>2+</sup> signal showed much greater power at frequencies between about 1–20 Hz as compared to the control spectrum, rolling off at higher frequencies to a noise floor determined by photon shot noise. We thus developed an approach to isolate the low-frequency fluctuations attributable to transient Ca<sup>2+</sup> puffs, while subtracting the photon shot noise that would arise in linear proportion to the overall fluorescence intensity.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Fluctuation analysis of Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals.</title><p>(<bold>A–D</bold>) Records from a single WT HEK cell loaded with Cal520 and stimulated by photorelease of i-IP<sub>3</sub> to evoke a global Ca<sup>2+</sup> elevation.

The resulting image stack was then processed by a running boxcar window (160 ms) that, for each pixel, calculated the standard deviation (SD) of the fluorescence signal at that pixel throughout the duration of the window.

Lastly, the algorithm corrected for photon shot noise by subtracting a scaled measure of the square root of fluorescence intensity at each pixel. If measurements were in terms of numbers of detected photons, the SD would equal the square root of the intensity; however, that was not the case for our records because of considerations including the camera conversion factor and the filtering applied to the image stack.

A flurry of transient events at these sites peaked during the rising phase of the global Ca<sup>2+</sup> response to photoreleased i-IP<sub>3</sub> but had largely subsided by the time of the maximal global Ca<sup>2+</sup> elevation. Even though the global Ca<sup>2+</sup> level then stayed elevated for many seconds the mean SD signals at these regions remained low. Measurement of the SD signal derived from a ROI encompassing the entire cell (yellow trace, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>) closely tracked the aggregate kinetics of the individual puff sites.</p><p>To further validate the fluctuation analysis algorithm, we examined a situation where cytosolic [Ca<sup>2+</sup>] was expected to rise in a smoothly graded manner, without overt temporal fluctuations or spatial heterogeneities. For this, we imaged Cal520 fluorescence by TIRF microscopy in HEK293 3KO cells in which all IP<sub>3</sub>R isoforms were knocked out (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Alzayady et al., 2016</xref>). We pipetted an aliquot of ionomycin (10 μl of 10 µM) into the 2.5 ml volume of Ca<sup>2+</sup>-free bathing solution at a distance from the cell chosen so that the diffusion of ionomycin evoked a slow liberation of Ca<sup>2+</sup> from intracellular stores to give a fluorescence signal of similar amplitude (8.3 ΔF/F<sub>0</sub>) and kinetics to that evoked by photoreleased i-IP<sub>3</sub> (6.9 ΔF/F<sub>0</sub>) in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A,C</xref>. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref> shows snapshots of ‘raw’ fluorescence captured before (i) and during (ii-v) application of ionomycin.

Measurements from 24 randomly located ROIs (squares in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>) showed only smooth rises in fluorescence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1H</xref>). Mean spectra from these regions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1I</xref>) displayed flat, substantially uniform distributions of power across all frequencies, consistent with photon shot noise increasing in proportion to the mean fluorescence level. Notably, SD signals from local ROIs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1J</xref>, superimposed black traces) and from a ROI encompassing the entire cell (yellow trace) showed no increase in fluctuations beyond that expected for photon shot noise.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Temporal fluctuations reflect spatially localized Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals</title><p>The SD image stacks generated by the temporal fluctuation algorithm showed transient hot spots of Ca<sup>2+</sup> release associated with temporal fluctuations. However, the SD signal could also include temporal fluctuations in fluorescence that were spatially blurred or uniform across the cell. To determine whether these contribute appreciably, or whether the SD signal could be taken as a good reporter of localized puff activity, we developed a second algorithm to reveal spatial Ca<sup>2+</sup> variations in Cal520 fluorescence image stacks (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref>).</p><p>Ca<sup>2+</sup> image stacks were first temporally bandpass filtered as described above. The algorithm then calculated, frame by frame, the difference between strong and weak Gaussian blur functions (respective standard deviations of about 4 and 1 μm at the specimen), essentially acting as a spatial bandpass filter to attenuate high spatial frequencies caused by pixel-to-pixel shot noise variations and low-frequency variations resulting from the spread of Ca<sup>2+</sup> waves across the cell, while retaining spatial frequencies corresponding to the spread of local Ca<sup>2+</sup> puffs. The resulting spatial SD images were remarkably similar to images generated by the temporal fluctuation analysis routine (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3A</xref>), and traces of mean cell-wide temporal and spatial SD signals during Ca<sup>2+</sup> elevations matched closely (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3B–E</xref>).

However, it has been difficult to definitively test this ‘building block’ model because puffs become obscured by the large global Ca<sup>2+</sup> elevations; and recent theoretical simulations have questioned whether the summation of Ca<sup>2+</sup> released through coordinated puff activity at multiple sites is alone sufficient to propagate global cytosolic Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Piegari et al., 2019</xref>). Here, we addressed this topic by analyzing temporal and spatial fluctuations in Ca<sup>2+</sup> image data to resolve local Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients during global signals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Swaminathan et al., 2020</xref>). Our main conclusion is that global Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals involve two modes of Ca<sup>2+</sup> liberation through IP<sub>3</sub>Rs: ‘punctate’ release as a flurry of transient, local events, and a more sustained, ‘diffuse’ release mode.</p><p>As with any new approach, we first needed to validate the ability of our algorithm to faithfully report local Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients during even large global Ca<sup>2+</sup> elevations, when resolution may be impaired by factors including the dynamic range of the indicator dye and by increased photon shot noise at high fluorescence levels. A particular concern was whether the indicator (Cal520) we used for most experiments may have approached saturation, thus ‘clipping’ the signals to artifactually suppress the temporal SD signal and giving a false impression that puff activity terminates as the Ca<sup>2+</sup> level and fluorescence rise during global signals. Several lines of evidence convincingly argue that this is not the case. Notably: (i) maximal, saturating signals evoked by ionomycin (~19 ΔF/F<sub>0</sub>) were much higher than mean peak IP<sub>3</sub>-evoked fluorescence signals (~7 ΔF/F<sub>0</sub>), and puff activity began to decline as fluorescence rose above ~2 ΔF/F<sub>0</sub>; (ii) we observed patterns of puff activity using the low affinity indicator fluo-8L (K<sub>d</sub>1.86 µM) that closely matched those obtained with Cal520 (K<sub>d</sub>320 nM) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>); (iii) we were able to resolve instances of local puff activity even at the peak of IP<sub>3</sub>-evoked global fluorescence elevations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>); (iv) the kinetics of puff activity were closely similar in cell lines individually expressing single IP<sub>3</sub>R isoforms, despite large differences in the amplitudes of the global Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>); (v) the onset and termination of puff activity during the rise of IP<sub>3</sub>-mediated global Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals were little altered when the initial basal Ca<sup>2+</sup> level was elevated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A,B</xref>) or, conversely, when the global Ca<sup>2+</sup> rise was attenuated by buffering with cytosolic EGTA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C,D</xref>). Finally, the suppression of punctate Ca<sup>2+</sup> liberation throughout all phases of IP<sub>3</sub>-evoked Ca<sup>2+</sup> responses when ER Ca<sup>2+</sup> stores were partially depleted (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>) strongly supports our proposal that Ca<sup>2+</sup> liberation can arise in a diffuse manner, independent of local puff events.</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>Puff activity during global Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals</title><p>In agreement with previous findings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bootman et al., 1997a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Marchant et al., 1999</xref>) our fluctuation analyses reveal flurries of puffs during the initial rise of IP<sub>3</sub>-mediated global Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals. However, although puff activity was evident during the initial foot of the response and peaked early during the rising phase, it then subsided during the later portion of the rising phase, with few or no transient, local Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals evident by the time of the peak. Notably, overall Ca<sup>2+</sup> levels continued to rise after puffs had largely ceased, and cytosolic Ca<sup>2+</sup> remained elevated for several seconds in the face of rapid removal from the cytosol, during which time Ca<sup>2+</sup> fluctuations were largely suppressed.</p><p>This ‘noise-free’ component of the fluorescence signal cannot be attributed to slow diffusion of Ca<sup>2+</sup> liberated as puffs to fill in spaces between release sites. Diffusion would be rapid (e.g. mean time of ~300 ms to diffuse 5 μm assuming an effective diffusion coefficient of 20 μm<sup>2</sup> s<sup>−1</sup>). In any case, the average fluorescence signal would not be expected to increase appreciably if the total amount of Ca<sup>2+</sup> in the imaging volume remained constant. Utilizing lightsheet imaging we further excluded the possibility that the continuing rise in near-plasmalemmal Ca<sup>2+</sup> observed by TIRF imaging might arise through diffusion of Ca<sup>2+</sup> over longer distances after liberation at sites in the cell interior. Finally, as noted previously, the observation of large global Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals in the absence of detectable fluorescence fluctuations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>) definitively points to a mode of Ca<sup>2+</sup> liberation that is independent of puff activity.</p><p>By deriving the time course of cumulative Ca<sup>2+</sup> liberation during global responses we estimated that puffs contribute only ~41% of the initial Ca<sup>2+</sup> flux that drives the peak of the Ca<sup>2+</sup> response, and an even smaller proportion (~15%) of the cumulative flux during its entire time course. Thus, a second component of continuous, spatially diffuse release of intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> is responsible for generating and sustaining a large part of whole-cell Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals. These two components are further discriminated by procedures that selectively promoted either puff activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Dargan and Parker, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Smith et al., 2009</xref>) (by cytosolic loading of slow Ca<sup>2+</sup> buffers), or global Ca<sup>2+</sup> elevations in the absence of localized Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients (by partial depletion of ER Ca<sup>2+</sup> store content). We term these two modes of IP<sub>3</sub>-mediated Ca<sup>2+</sup> release as ‘punctate’ (discontinuous in time and space) and ‘diffuse’ (smoothly varying in time and space).</p><p>Small elevations of [Ca<sup>2+</sup>] promote opening of IP<sub>3</sub>R channels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Iino, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bezprozvanny et al., 1991</xref>) and increase puff frequency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Yamasaki-Mann et al., 2013</xref>). The accelerated puff activity during the foot and initial upstroke of the global Ca<sup>2+</sup> signal is thus likely a consequence of a rising basal cytosolic Ca<sup>2+</sup> level, resulting both from the puffs themselves and from diffuse Ca<sup>2+</sup> liberation. This positive feedback of cytosolic Ca<sup>2+</sup> to promote opening of IP<sub>3</sub>Rs is inherently regenerative, so it is imperative that mechanisms exist to ‘put out the fire’. Our results illuminate at least two mechanisms, acting across different time scales, to terminate punctate Ca<sup>2+</sup> liberation through IP<sub>3</sub>Rs. Individual puffs terminate rapidly as IP<sub>3</sub>R channels close within tens of ms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Parker et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bootman et al., 1997b</xref>) via stochastic inhibition by high local Ca<sup>2+</sup> levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Shuai et al., 2008</xref>) and potential allosteric interactions between clustered IP<sub>3</sub>Rs at a puff site (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Wiltgen et al., 2014</xref>). However, during the rising phase of a global Ca<sup>2+</sup> signal, each IP<sub>3</sub>R cluster may generate a flurry of repeated puffs - indicating that although the fast-inhibitory processes that terminates individual puffs recovers quickly, a slower process terminates the flurry. This does not appear to result from IP<sub>3</sub>Rs becoming inactivated by the rise of bulk cytosolic Ca<sup>2+</sup>, because we found puff flurries were not suppressed by prior Ca<sup>2+</sup> elevations, and still terminated normally during global responses when cytosolic Ca<sup>2+</sup> levels were attenuated by buffering with EGTA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C,D</xref>). Instead, our observations that partial depletion of ER Ca<sup>2+</sup> stores suppressed puff activity during global Ca<sup>2+</sup> responses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>) implicate the depletion of luminal Ca<sup>2+</sup> as a dominant mechanism responsible for terminating the local signals; analogous to the central role of luminal Ca<sup>2+</sup> depletion in terminating the Ca<sup>2+</sup> sparks mediated by ryanodine receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Stern et al., 2013</xref>). Although individual puffs appear not to affect luminal ER [Ca<sup>2+</sup>] (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Lock et al., 2018</xref>), it is plausible that ER depletion may occur during the rapid flurries of puffs evoked at multiple sites during the rising phase of global signals. A related question is whether the Ca<sup>2+</sup> depletion is locally confined to the ER around puff sites and arises through Ca<sup>2+</sup> released by the puffs themselves, or whether diffuse Ca<sup>2+</sup> liberation causes global ER Ca<sup>2+</sup> depletion throughout a luminally continuous ER network (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Okubo et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Park et al., 2000</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Two functionally distinct modes of IP<sub>3</sub>R-mediated Ca<sup>2+</sup> liberation</title><p>The two modes of Ca<sup>2+</sup> liberation we describe – punctate and diffuse – might, in principle, arise from two functionally and physically distinct populations of IP<sub>3</sub>Rs, or through functional regulation of the clustered IP<sub>3</sub>Rs underlying puffs such that they switch from a pulsatile to continuous mode of release. At present, we cannot discriminate between these mechanisms, but favor the former for congruence with studies revealing two distinct populations of IP<sub>3</sub>Rs in terms of their spatial distributions and motilities. A small (~30%) fraction of the IP<sub>3</sub>Rs in a cell are stationary (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Thillaiappan et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Smith et al., 2014</xref>), grouped in small clusters that are anchored at fixed sites predominantly near the plasma membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Smith et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Lock et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Thillaiappan et al., 2017</xref>), whereas the majority of IP<sub>3</sub>Rs are distributed throughout the bulk of the cytoplasm and are motile within the ER membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Thillaiappan et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Smith et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Tateishi et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Gibson and Ehrlich, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Ferreri-Jacobia et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Fukatsu et al., 2004</xref>).

Signaling information is encoded in the amplitude and frequency of these Ca<sup>2+</sup> oscillations, which may have periods ranging widely from a few seconds to minutes. Classical studies illustrate how different frequencies of Ca<sup>2+</sup> oscillations activate distinct targets, including the selective activation of NFkB in Jurkat T cells by low frequencies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Dolmetsch et al., 1998</xref>), and the frequency-dependent control of gene expression in RBL mast cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Li et al., 1998</xref>). However, signaling information is not restricted to frequency and amplitude components of bulk cytosolic Ca<sup>2+</sup> elevations, and numerous findings implicate a component of spatial Ca<sup>2+</sup> profiling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Smedler and Uhlén, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Dupont et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Berridge et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Thul et al., 2009</xref>).

The two modes of IP<sub>3</sub>-evoked Ca<sup>2+</sup> liberation we describe are, therefore, likely to selectively activate different populations of effectors; those positioned close to the IP<sub>3</sub>Rs at puff sites that experience brief, repetitive transients of high local [Ca<sup>2+</sup>], and others that respond to a more sustained, spatially diffuse elevation of bulk cytosolic [Ca<sup>2+</sup>].</p><p>Based on a close juxtaposition of stationary IP<sub>3</sub>R clusters to ER-plasma membrane junctions where STIM and Orai interact to induce store-operated Ca<sup>2+</sup> entry (SOCE) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Thillaiappan et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Thillaiappan et al., 2019</xref>), it has been proposed that local depletion of ER Ca<sup>2+</sup> content at puff sites might rapidly and selectively activate SOCE, without requiring substantial overall loss of the ER Ca<sup>2+</sup> that is necessary to sustain numerous ER functions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Thillaiappan et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Thillaiappan et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Taylor and Machaca, 2019</xref>). On the other hand, we previously reported puffs to be unaffected by removal of extracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Lock et al., 2018</xref>), and we show that patterning of local puff activity during IP<sub>3</sub>-evoked global Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals is unaffected by the presence or absence of Ca<sup>2+</sup> in the bath solution. Thus, influx of extracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> does not appear to contribute acutely to the initial flurry of puffs or to the rapid rise in global Ca<sup>2+</sup>, although the more prolonged decay phase of the Ca<sup>2+</sup> signal in Ca<sup>2+</sup>-containing medium points to a slower activation of SOCE. The relative contributions of local puffs vs. diffuse Ca<sup>2+</sup> liberation in activating SOCE remain to be determined. Another example of proximate Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling is the close tethering between ER and mitochondria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Giorgi et al., 2009</xref>) that underlies a rapid shuttling of Ca<sup>2+</sup> released through IP<sub>3</sub>Rs to the mitochondrial matrix (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Csordás et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Filadi and Pozzan, 2015</xref>), such that Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients within a signaling microdomain, rather than the bulk cytosolic Ca<sup>2+</sup> signal, regulate mitochondrial bioenergetics and induction of autophagy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Cárdenas et al., 2010</xref>).

Our description of two modes of IP<sub>3</sub>-mediated Ca<sup>2+</sup> liberation thus raises questions regarding their respective roles in downstream signaling. Is organellar Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling via structurally defined nanodomains restricted to the predominantly peripheral ER contact sites where puffs originate, or might a separate population of IP<sub>3</sub>Rs that mediate diffuse Ca<sup>2+</sup> liberation also transmit their signals via restricted domains?</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Cell culture and loading</title><p>HEK293 wild-type (WT) cells were kindly provided by Dr. David Yule (University of Rochester).

HeLa cells (#CCL-2) purchased from ATCC (Manassas, VA) were characterized by STR profiling and certified free of mycoplasma prior to distribution. HEK WT, 3KO, and single IP<sub>3</sub>R isoform-expressing cell lines were cultured in Eagle’s Minimum Essential Medium (EMEM; ATCC #30–2003), and HeLa cells were cultured in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle Medium (DMEM; #11965092) from Thermo Fisher Scientific (Waltham, MA). Both EMEM and DMEM were supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (#FB-11) from Omega Scientific (Tarzana, CA).

Fluorescence images were acquired with an Evolve EMCCD camera (Photometrics; Tucson, AZ) with a bit depth of 16 bits, using 2 × 2 binning for a final field at the specimen of 128 × 128 binned pixels (one binned pixel = 0.53 µm) at a rate of ~125 frames s<sup>−1</sup>. Image data were streamed to computer memory using Metamorph v7.7 (Molecular Devices; San Jose, CA) and stored on hard disk for offline analysis.</p><p>Lattice light-sheet imaging was performed using a home-built system as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Ellefsen and Parker, 2018</xref>). Images were acquired with an Andor Zyla 4.2 sCMOS camera (Oxford Instruments; Abingdon, England) from a single, diagonal light-sheet slice (512 × 256 pixels, one pixel = 0.11 µm) at 100 frames s<sup>−1</sup> and 16 bit depth. Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals were imaged in Cal520-loaded cells for several seconds following photorelease of i-IP<sub>3</sub> by a flash from a 405 nm laser diode, utilizing 473 nm laser fluorescence excitation and a 510–560 nm bandpass emission filter. A 562 nm laser and 590 nm long-pass filter were used to image the plasma membrane stained with Cell Mask Deep Red. Images were streamed to disk using MicroManager (Vale Lab UCSF; San Francisco, CA).</p></sec><sec id="s4-3"><title>Photo-uncaging and local application of agonist</title><p>Photorelease of i-IP<sub>3</sub> was evoked by UV light from a xenon arc lamp filtered through a 350–400 nm bandpass filter and introduced by a UV-reflecting dichroic in the light path to uniformly illuminate the field of view. The amount of i-IP<sub>3</sub> released was controlled by varying the flash duration, set by an electronically controlled shutter (UniBlitz; Rochester, NY). The same system was used for photolysis of NP-EGTA (i.e. caged Ca<sup>2+</sup>). For the local delivery of solutions to cells during imaging, glass micropipettes were prepared from borosilicate glass capillary filaments (1.5 mm x 0.86 mm, O.D. x I.D.) using a micropipette puller (Sutter Instruments; Novato, CA) to produce tip diameters of ~1–2 µm. Micropipettes were positioned above the cell understudy with local delivery controlled using a pneumatic picospritzer. The delivery of micropipette contents and the duration and intensity of the UV-flash were empirically adjusted to evoke rapid rises in whole-cell cytosolic Ca<sup>2+</sup> levels.</p><p>All imaging was performed while cells were bathed in HBSS containing 2 mM Ca<sup>2+</sup> or zero Ca<sup>2+</sup>-HBSS containing 0.3 mM EGTA and no added Ca<sup>2+</sup>.</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>Image analysis</title><p>Image data imported in16 bit integer MetaMorph stk or multi-plane TIF format were processed using a script written in Flika (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://flika-org.github.io">http://flika-org.github.io</ext-link>), a freely available open-source image processing and analysis software in the Python programming language (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Ellefsen et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Ellefsen et al., 2014</xref>). All internal processing and data output were performed using 64 bit floating-point arithmetic.</p><p>To analyze and derive movies representing the pixel-by-pixel standard deviation (SD) of <italic>temporal</italic> fluctuations in fluorescence of the Ca<sup>2+</sup> indicator dye we used a custom Flika script as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Ellefsen et al., 2019</xref>). In brief, following subtraction of camera black offset level, the raw image stack from the camera was first spatially filtered by a Gaussian blur function with a standard deviation (sigma) of 2 pixels (~1 μm at the specimen). The python package (skimage) used to perform this function applies a two-dimensional Gaussian blur with a specified standard deviation (sigma) out to a range of 4 sigma. To attenuate high-frequency photon shot noise and slow changes in baseline fluorescence, it was then temporally filtered with a bandpass Butterworth filter with low and high cutoff frequencies of 3 and 20 Hz. A running variance of this temporally filtered movie was calculated, pixel by pixel, by subtracting the square of the mean from the mean of the square of a moving 20 frame (160 ms) boxcar window of the movie. The running standard deviation was calculated by taking the square root of the variance image stack to create a standard deviation (SD) stack. Finally, to remove the mean predicted photon shot noise which increases in linear proportion to the mean fluorescence intensity, the SD stack was corrected, pixel-by-pixel, by subtracting the square root of a running mean of the spatially filtered fluorescence movie multiplied by a scalar constant; derived as illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>.</p><p>We also applied a second FLIKA script to analyze <italic>spatial</italic> fluctuations in Ca<sup>2+</sup> image stacks. For this, black-level subtracted image stacks were first temporally band-pass filtered as before, and then new image stacks were derived by taking the difference of weak (sigma two pixel) and stronger (sigma eight pixel) Gaussian blur functions. Essentially, this functioned as a spatial bandpass filter, attenuating high frequencies caused by pixel-to-pixel shot noise variations and low frequency variations resulting from spread of Ca<sup>2+</sup> waves across the cell, while retaining spatial frequencies corresponding to the spread of local Ca<sup>2+</sup> puffs. Next, for each frame, we calculated the spatial variance among pixels within an imaging field, took the square root to obtain a measure of the spatial SD signal and subtracted the predicted increase in spatial shot noise with increasing fluorescence. Finally, we derived traces showing the average spatial fluctuations across a region encompassing the entire cell within a moving boxcar window of 160 ms (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref>).</p><p>The scripts used to perform temporal and spatial fluctuation analysis are presented as <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file

It has been widely assumed that Ca<sup>2+</sup> released by these events recruits further Ca<sup>2+</sup> puffs (by Ca<sup>2+</sup>-induced Ca<sup>2+</sup> release) to give global Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals. It has, however, been difficult to examine this hypothesis because as Ca<sup>2+</sup> puffs become more frequent, it becomes impossible to resolve them from background signal. The present work applies an elegant noise analysis method (the principles of which were described in a recent short report from the group in Cell Calcium) to assess the subcellular heterogeneity of Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals evoked by IP3. The results are both unexpected and important in that they suggest that most cytosolic Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals are not associated with the noise expected from Ca<sup>2+</sup> puffs. The results convincingly challenge prevailing dogma by suggesting that Ca<sup>2+</sup> puffs contribute only a small fraction the cytosolic Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals evoked by IP3, with the remainder likely arising from openings of single IP3Rs.

What follows is the decision letter after the first round of review.]</p><p>Thank you for submitting your work entitled &quot;Inositol trisphosphate mediated Ca2+ spikes arise through two temporally and spatially distinct modes of Ca2+ release&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and a Senior Editor. The following individuals involved in review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Colin W Taylor (Reviewer #1); Grant Hennig (Reviewer #3).</p><p>Our decision has been reached after consultation between the reviewers. Based on these discussions and the individual reviews below, we regret to inform you that your work will not be considered further for publication in <italic>eLife</italic>.</p><p>The reviewers agreed that your work is interesting and has the potential to be quite important, but there were major concerns with the SD approach, on which most of the presented findings hinge, involving the dynamic range of the Ca<sup>2+</sup> indicators and the spatial and temporal Ca<sup>2+</sup> release patterns.</p><p>The first concern is that after uncaging or after the addition of agonists, the cytoplasmic background fluorescence in cells increases to a seemingly very high level. As punctate release events are only observed when background levels are low to moderate, it brings into question whether the Ca<sup>2+</sup> indicators have become saturated at peak cytoplasmic background Ca<sup>2+</sup> levels (the author's have previously assessed a variety of Ca<sup>2+</sup> indicators with Kd values in the 150-400nM range). This would make it essentially impossible to resolve punctate events, even though punctate release events may still be occurring – akin to &quot;signal clipping&quot;. While SD analysis may provide some additional resolution in situations with narrow dynamic fluorescence ranges, it still depends on the indicator having some dynamic range. This concern needs to be carefully addressed so that readers are confident that the presented findings are accurate and biological.</p><p>Some ways that could be used to examine the potential dynamic range issue of the indicators include:</p><p>• use a ratiometric indicator (Fura) to estimate actual cytoplasmic Ca<sup>2+</sup> levels during uncaging/agonists which could be compared to Kd/saturation mM of Cal-520 and GCamP etc.</p><p>• pharmacologically limit the increase in cytoplasmic Ca<sup>2+</sup> using low/moderate levels of EGTA (to preserve the dynamic range of the indicator) and examine whether punctate release patterns are still reduced after uncaging etc.</p><p>• purposefully increase cytoplasmic Ca<sup>2+</sup> levels to near maximum with ionomycin then initiate an uncaging event to see puncate release sites can still be resolved (temporally synchronized release).</p><p>• use quantitative shape analysis (not ROIs) of transient bright regions at high cytoplasmic Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentrations. At these levels where there is extremely limited dynamic range and greater shot noise, noise aggregates and punctate release sites will appear similar – but they can be separated using perimeter:area ratios (high for noise aggregates), or Gaussian fitting (better for release sites). This will require no Gaussian filtering of the data and some form of deconvolution to reduce the smoothing of objects due to Z-smear (where appropriate).</p><p>The second concern is discussed adequately in the reviews below, but questions whether the SD approach can detect synchronous, widespread puffs/ release events, or high frequency puffs/release events that appear and behave like changes in cytoplasmic background. It would be useful to the reader to see how different duration timespans affect the variance signal (which is currently tailored for the timecourse of individual puffs), to assess what range of Ca<sup>2+</sup> behaviors are included or filtered by varying the space/time variance parameters.</p><p>Without additional information to address the major concerns of the reviewers, it is not possible to assess whether the work represents a sufficient advance to warrant publication in <italic>eLife</italic>.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic></p><p>Parker's pioneering work established that the initial responses to low concentrations of IP3 comprise Ca<sup>2+</sup> puffs, wherein a few IP3Rs within an immobile cluster almost simultaneously open to evoke a local and short-lived cytosolic Ca<sup>2+</sup> signal.

It has, however, been difficult to examine this hypothesis because as Ca<sup>2+</sup> puffs become more frequent, it becomes impossible to resolve them from background signal. The present work applies an elegant noise analysis method (the principles of which were described in a recent short report from the group in Cell Calcium) to assess the subcellular heterogeneity of Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals evoked by IP3.

The results convincingly challenge prevailing dogma by suggesting that Ca<sup>2+</sup> puffs contribute only a small fraction the cytosolic Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals evoked by IP3, with the remainder likely arising from openings of single IP3Rs. The rigour and significance of the work justify publication in <italic>eLife</italic>; none of my comments should detract from that recommendation.</p><p>1) Figure 1 provides compelling evidence that noise decreases as the IP3-evoked Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals develop and that a comparable increase in global cytosolic [Ca<sup>2+</sup>] evoked by ionomycin is “noise-free”, as expected for homogenous Ca<sup>2+</sup> release. My understanding is that after some filtering and spatial blurring, most analyses calculate the SD for each pixel as a 160-ms (ie 20 frames) boxcar average. The original view posits that a global Ca<sup>2+</sup> signal reflects most Ca<sup>2+</sup> puff sites firing very frequently (perhaps 20 or so sites active at each instant), each spreading a µm or more from its source. Might this cause elevations in cytosolic [Ca<sup>2+</sup>] that are less noisy than the infrequent Ca<sup>2+</sup> puffs observed initially, because each pixel would be influenced by Ca<sup>2+</sup> reaching it from several puffs? It's perhaps too tall an order to require quantitative simulation of this on SD measurements, but it would be helpful to have the authors consider the issue explicitly.</p><p>2) From results in Figure 5, the authors propose that loss of Ca<sup>2+</sup> from the ER causes puffs to terminate without appreciably abrogating the global increase in cytosolic [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]. That proposal would align with a long-standing, but contentious, suggestion that luminal Ca<sup>2+</sup> supports IP3R activity, but it seems difficult to align with other work from this lab:</p><p>A paper from this lab and under review with <italic>eLife</italic> (Mak et al) proposes that luminal Ca<sup>2+</sup> inhibits IP3R activity, such that loss of ER Ca<sup>2+</sup> would be expected to enhance Ca<sup>2+</sup> puffs.</p><p>Substantial evidence, much of it form this lab, indicates that individual Ca<sup>2+</sup> puffs do not detectably affect ER luminal [Ca<sup>2+</sup>], since steps during the falling phase of a Ca<sup>2+</sup> puff (reflecting channel closures) are of fixed amplitude. It is not thereby clear that the flurry of puff activity would cause the loss of ER Ca<sup>2+</sup> proposed to terminate Ca<sup>2+</sup> puffs.</p><p>The authors should discuss both issues.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>In this manuscript, Lock and Parker expand the ongoing work in the Parker lab to examine the temporal and spatial properties and their regulation of Ca<sup>2+</sup> release by the inositol trisphosphate receptor (IP3R) Ca<sup>2+</sup> release channel. They use HEK and HeLa cells to examine by TIRF microscopy (the primary approach here, and previously used extensively by this group) and light sheet microscopy, and a heavy dose of image processing abd fluctuation aanlyses, to address the issue of the sources of Ca<sup>2+</sup> release and their mechanisms of transitioning from discrete Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals, referred to as puffs, to global ones.</p><p>They find that IP3-mediated Ca<sup>2+</sup> release is associated with a flurry of noisy events during the rising phase of the global Ca<sup>2+</sup> signal that terminates before the peak of the global Ca<sup>2+</sup> signal is achieved. They suggest that the noisy events are Ca<sup>2+</sup>-release events from IP3R clusters, i.e. Ca<sup>2+</sup> puffs, on a background of IP3R-mediated more diffuse release. Using procedures to partially deplete Ca<sup>2+</sup> stores, they conclude also that the Ca<sup>2+</sup> puffs terminate because of depletion of the ER stores, although they cannot determine whether it represents local or global store depletion, whereas the diffuse release, from what they consider to be a separate population of IP3R from those in the Ca<sup>2+</sup>-puff inducing clusters, continue to release Ca<sup>2+</sup>. By measuring the rate of cytoplasmic Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentration relaxation following a pulse of cytoplasmic Ca<sup>2+</sup>, they calculate the relative contributions of Ca<sup>2+</sup> puffs (punctate release) and diffuse release during the rising phase and during the entire Ca<sup>2+</sup> transient.</p><p>This is an elegant analysis and an interesting set of studies, and an not least of all because they address and challenge a major model of IP3-mediated local and global Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling (mostly developed by Parker); and because they address a conundrum in the field regarding the role and existence of &quot;silent&quot; IP3Rs that are localized throughout the cell but were previously (Parker; Taylor) considered to not participate. Here, the suggestion is that in addition to active IP3R in clusters near the plasma-membrane, these other IP3R channels might indeed be active and contribute to the diffuse release that continues after puffs have stopped firing.</p><p>I have a few comments that might suggest that the authors could clarify a few points.</p><p>1) Why aren't local release events observed in the raw ratio images, as Parker has described many times?</p><p>2) Figure 3—figure supplement 1 shows the sites with high standard deviation (SD) to be rather large, ~10 uM, a size that is inconsistent with the size of clusters of ~15 IP3R that generate the Ca<sup>2+</sup> puffs. Rather their size suggests to me that these are entire regions of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) that are near the plasma membrane in the TIRF evanescent field. If this is the case, are the authors selecting small sites within the large &quot;contact&quot; sites for the SD analyses? And, I would think that there is a &quot;global&quot;/homogenous signal at these sites that is contributed by Ca<sup>2+</sup> that has diffused into these &quot;contact&quot; sites. This might also be consistent with the observation that the TIRF-detected high-SD signal terminates before the peak signal is achieved, because the peak is contributed by slow Ca<sup>2+</sup> diffusion that persists after release has terminated.</p><p>3) The authors describe an inverted U relationship between the amplitude of the SD signal and the amplitude of the global response. What does it mean?</p><p>4) The authors conclude that elevated cytoplasmic Ca<sup>2+</sup> doesn't inhibit the IP3R as a primary mechanism to terminate Ca puffs. Why doesn't it inhibit?</p><p>5) The authors examine the decay in cytoplasmic Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentration after an elevation. They refer to this as sequestration. I'm not sure of their meaning. Although they suggest that the kinetics can be described by a single exponential, there must be at least two processes involved: sequestration by the ER, and extrusion by the plasm membrane Ca<sup>2+</sup> pump. Indeed, in the discussion they use the phrase &quot;efflux rate from the cytoplasm&quot;. I think what the authors mean to suggest in the sequestration away from the cytoplasm. If so, this should be stated more clearly.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic></p><p>In this manuscript, the authors present a method that enables some resolution and measurement of small, punctate Ca<sup>2+</sup> events in the context of global cytoplasmic Ca<sup>2+</sup> levels. While previous studies used pharmacological tools to largely prevent global changes in Ca<sup>2+</sup> in order to better reveal small discrete Ca<sup>2+</sup> release events, the current study uses a variety of software routines that utilize fluorescence variance changes – from which punctate and global Ca<sup>2+</sup> event behaviors are derived from. The authors surmise that punctate and global Ca<sup>2+</sup> events are likely produced by 2 separate populations of IP3Rs. The experimental manipulations to investigate depletion of stores, Ca<sup>2+</sup> entry, IP3R channel KO etc are well thought out and appropriate – but some concerns remain as to the ability of the authors to resolve puffs once background/cytoplasmic Ca<sup>2+</sup> levels reach a certain intensity.</p><p>The use of signal variance to isolate different components of mixed fluorescence signals relies on those components having distinct (and variable) spatio-temporal signatures. However, if Ca<sup>2+</sup> release events reach a steady state, then the variance technique becomes essentially useless. This is my main concern with some of the conclusions drawn from the analysis.</p><p>The ability to detect puffs is greatest during low background conditions, but the as global Ca<sup>2+</sup> levels increase, the ability to detect puffs is hampered by i) closing of the max difference between background and puff sites and ii) an increase in the amplitude of shot noise that may start to mimick fast and small puff events. To resolve between genuine puff events, that are inherently Gaussian (1-2 µm) and random noise aggregates that occur during high background levels, is difficult – but is made worse by applying Gaussian filters to the data that reshape noise aggregates into more Gaussian shapes. Employing shape analysis before smoothing (perimeter:area ratios) is an effective way of resolving puffs (low P:A – smooth circles) even when surrounded by noise aggregates of equal intensity and size (high P:A – leafy looking). This may assuage some doubts as to the authors ability to resolve punctate events once background/global levels have reached moderate to high levels.</p><p>Similarly, the use of user-placed (or randomly positioned) ROIs based on visual inspection of bright spots in the videos is subjective and can heavily bias results to what the user wants to show. Many &quot;hot spots&quot; don't appear to have ROIs drawn over them and some ROIs appear to be sampling the same site. Small ROIs are more sensitive to spatial shifts in the position of the underlying fluorescent sites. The &quot;flickering&quot; variance may be a function of out-of-sync release events from a number of channels/clusters covered by each ROI. When these channels syncronize (in the open position?) or fluorescence sites increase in size, this will dramatically reduce the signal variance, even though puffs may still be occurring.</p><p>The shape of the cell and the distance and size of the cytoplasm located away from the evanescent field can dramatically affect the blurring of the background (cytoplasmic signal). How do the authors discriminate between &quot;global&quot; cytoplasmic changes and large puff sites that are heavily blurred being out of focus (see Figures 1 and 7). This effect still remains using lightsheet imaging.</p><p>The pixel resolution used during TIRF imaging was 0.5µm and is unlikely to fully resolve individual puffs, especially after smoothing. This may bias analysis to release events that are comprised of multiple channel clusters.</p><p>The use of black level subtraction can normalize absolute intensity levels, but does not compensate for the higher shot noise in areas with high static background. Was this taken into account?</p><p>Gaussian blur is reported as 2 pixels (in text) but as an SD of 2 pixels in the Materials and methods. What was the actual kernel size in pixels (3x3, 5x5?) and the SD.</p><p>Random ROIs were used for HEK cells devoid of IP3Rs. What does the data look like if the authors select the brightest spots in the 3KO video – or use random ROIs in controls?</p><p>Figure 3—figure supplement 3C appears to show a stochastic build up of high frequency events correlated to baseline increases – until background fluorescence levels may start to swamp out the ability to resolve small punctate events.</p><p>[Editors’ note: further revisions were suggested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for choosing to send your work entitled &quot;Inositol trisphosphate mediated Ca2+ spikes arise through two temporally and spatially distinct modes of Ca2+ release&quot; for consideration at <italic>eLife</italic>. Your letter of appeal has been considered by a Senior Editor and the reviewers, and we are prepared to consider a revised submission.</p><p>The reviewers have also provided additional feedback below after reading your rebuttal to hopefully better convey the technical concerns.</p><p>Specific points:</p><p>1) Indicator Saturation/Clipping concerns:</p><p>In your rebuttal, you state (i) that &quot;…maximal signal evoked by ionomycin is&gt;2 fold higher than peak IP3-evoked fluorescence signals&quot;</p><p>However, in Figure 1, the maximum raw signal during uncaging (1C) and after ionomycin (1F) looks exactly the same – both topping out at 8500 a.u – and suggests that IP3-stimulated Ca<sup>2+</sup> release may be reaching levels that saturate the dye. Similarly, the large areas that show uniform white intensity (Figure 1, image v) are either due to: i) over zealous contrast/brightness adjustment, ii) indicator saturation @ max or iii) camera chip saturation (clipping). Assuming reasonable contrast adjustment and digitizing in 16-bits? (please add digitizer bit depth in Materials and methods), this suggests that saturation is still occurring. As none of the results figures presented data in absolute intensity values and used relative a.u. or F/F0 ratios which can give different &quot;max levels&quot; depending on the F0, it is hard for a reviewer to determine what the actual peak/max levels are and if indicator saturation was reached.</p><p>The importance of indicator saturation and/or Ca<sup>2+</sup> release uniformity is magnified in using variance as the primary measure to resolve Ca<sup>2+</sup> release events. Large, saturated areas have essentially no variance (after subtracting shot noise), and could dramatically underestimate SD values and obscure Ca<sup>2+</sup> events. In a similar fashion, simultaneous firing of multiple puffs throughout a cell could also be difficult to interpret, as one would lose the ability to spatially discriminate individual events. This, also, would reduce SD values and make it hard to distinguish between cytoplasmic and &quot;punctate&quot; events.</p><p>While the use of Fluo8L, which has a much larger dynamic range in response to Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentrations goes some way to assuage concerns over indicator saturation, Ca<sup>2+</sup> levels may still be saturating this dye given the nature of the abrupt IP3-induced Ca<sup>2+</sup> release. Out of curiosity, what does an IP3-uncaging event look like in a cell treated with ionomycin?</p><p>If the saturated/clipped regions from your recordings were dynamically filtered out using image processing and SD/intensity recalculated in parts of the cell in which the indicator is presumably unsaturated, this would help to allay saturation concerns on SD measurements.</p><p>2) Figure 1, ROIs</p><p>Towards the end of the rebuttal (&quot;Summarizing key points…&quot;), where you indicate the attention drawn to subjectively-placed ROIs was based on a &quot;misconception&quot;, then one has to question ROIs were used at all. ROIs do illustrate important features of the Ca<sup>2+</sup> release events, such as an apparent reduction in intensity variability in traces that reach near-maximal intensity (see first point).</p><p>3) 2 populations of IP3Rs…</p><p>Concerning point v) Figure 4 (we think you meant Figure 6), if potential methodological concerns are addressed – and indeed the punctate responses do drop out as global levels rise – the concluding statement that: &quot;Our findings of a diffusive mode of Ca<sup>2+</sup> liberation implicate a second population of IP3Rs with properties distinct from those clustered at puff sites&quot; is too strong a statement given the evidence presented.</p><p>We think there needs to be experiments/analysis to show that punctate and global Ca<sup>2+</sup> responses can be unrelated for this to be the case. In most examples presented the pattern of punctate release events appear to correlate with changes in cytoplasmic/global Ca<sup>2+</sup>.</p><p>For example, in Figure 2, the rate and amplitude of the SD events appears to be mirrored in the shape of the global responses. In E (puce color), the abrupt increase in SD is reflected as a sharp transition in global Ca<sup>2+</sup> from baseline. In F (blue) the ramping up of SD events is reflected as a more gradual, sloping increase in global Ca<sup>2+</sup>. These relationships are illustrated nicely in G.</p><p>The maximum slope of global Ca<sup>2+</sup> increases seems to occur at the point of maximum SD events. See Figure 4, Figure 5G and H (albeit de-amplified), Figure 6, Figure 8 (A: see 2 peaks in SD reflected in 2 steps in rate of Ca<sup>2+</sup> intensity, like in Figure 3—figure supplement 3).</p><p>To disprove that there is just one population of IP3Rs, comparisons of the rate change of SD and global fluorescence should show little (or highly variable) correlation strength. Cumulative integration of SD and cumulative global fluorescence signals (akin to Ca<sup>2+</sup> mass / SD mass) followed by regression, cross-correlation (with ∆ time offsets) and/or inflection analysis would be appropriate to examine those potential relationships. Performing this analysis on specific regions in cells to elucidate any potential zone-of-influence between punctate and global Ca<sup>2+</sup> characteristics.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.55008.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p>[Editors’ note: The authors appealed the original decision.

Our original submission already included several lines of evidence indicating that fluorescence signals were well below the saturating level, even at the peak of large IP<sub>3</sub>-evoked responses. However, these data may not have been presented with sufficient clarity. We describe below our arguments and call out specific figures and places in the text where they are presented in our revised manuscript.</p><p>i) The maximal, saturating signals evoked by ionomycin were substantially higher than peak IP<sub>3</sub>-evoked fluorescence signals, and suppression of puff activity occurred at yet lower levels (paragraph two of subsection “Ca<sup>2+</sup> puff activity terminates during the rising phase of global Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals”). See also the sample traces we show in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig1">Author response image 1</xref>.</p><fig id="respfig1"><label>Author response image 1.</label><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-55008-resp-fig1-v2.tif"/></fig><p>ii) We observed the same patterns of Ca<sup>2+</sup> liberation using the low affinity indicator fluo-8L (Kd 1.86 µM) as compared to Cal520 (Kd 320 nM) which we used for the majority of our experiments (Figure 3—figure supplement 2).</p><p>iii) We were able to resolve instances of local puff activity even at the peak of IP<sub>3</sub>-evoked global fluorescence increases (Figure 3—figure supplement 1).</p><p>iv) Puff activity (SD signal) in cells exclusively expressing type 1 IP<sub>3</sub>R was suppressed during the rising phase of global Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals and followed a similar pattern to WT cells, even though the magnitude of the peak fluorescence increase was &lt;40% of that in WT cells (Figure 6).</p><p>v) The onset and termination of puff activity during the rise of IP<sub>3</sub>-mediated global Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals were little altered when the initial basal Ca<sup>2+</sup> level was elevated (Figure 4A,B) or, conversely, when the global Ca<sup>2+</sup> rise was attenuated by buffering with cytosolic EGTA (new Figure 4C,D).</p><p>vi) The suppression of punctate Ca<sup>2+</sup> liberation throughout all phases of IP<sub>3</sub>-evoked Ca<sup>2+</sup> responses evoked when ER Ca<sup>2+</sup> stores are partially depleted (Figure 5) strongly supports our proposal that Ca<sup>2+</sup> liberation can arise in a diffuse manner that sustains Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals after puff activity terminates during the rising phase of the response.</p><p>We thus conclude that the termination of puff activity during IP<sub>3</sub>-evoked signals reflects the physiological functioning of IP<sub>3</sub>Rs and is not an artifact of indicator saturation.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Some ways that could be used to examine the potential dynamic range issue of the indicators include:</p><p>• use a ratiometric indicator (Fura) to estimate actual cytoplasmic Ca<sup>2+</sup> levels during uncaging/agonists which could be compared to Kd/saturation mM of Cal-520 and GCamP etc.</p></disp-quote><p>We do not feel this approach is appropriate, with problems including uncertainties in determining the K<sub>d</sub> of both Fura-2 and Cal520 in the cytosolic environment. Further, accurate calibration of Fura-2 signals could be impaired because Fura-2 itself may be nearly saturated; especially given that the affinity of Fura-2 is higher than Cal520. Instead, we believe our approach of comparing the peak amplitude of IP<sub>3</sub>-evoked Cal520 signals with the maximal (saturating) amplitude evoked by ionomycin provides a more direct and convincing evidence that IP<sub>3</sub>-evoked Cal520 signals were well below saturation.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>• pharmacologically limit the increase in cytoplasmic Ca<sup>2+</sup> using low/moderate levels of EGTA (to preserve the dynamic range of the indicator) and examine whether punctate release patterns are still reduced after uncaging etc.</p></disp-quote><p>This is a good suggestion. Thank you! We performed this experiment (luckily before our lab was shut down in response to the Covid19 crisis!) and incorporate the new data as Figure 4C,D. Our results show the same pattern of SD activity in EGTA loaded cells as in non-loaded cells – i.e. puff activity ceased before the peak of the global IP<sub>3</sub>-evoked Cal520 signal even though the peak amplitude of the global signal was much (~40%) lower than in control, non-EGTA-loaded cells (paragraph two subsection “Ca<sup>2+</sup> puffs do not terminate because of rising cytosolic Ca<sup>2+</sup> during cell-wide elevations.”).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>• purposefully increase cytoplasmic Ca<sup>2+</sup> levels to near maximum with ionomycin then initiate an uncaging event to see puncate release sites can still be resolved (temporally synchronized release).</p></disp-quote><p>Although performed for a different purpose, our experiments (Figure 4A,B) using photorelease from caged Ca<sup>2+</sup> (rather than ionomycin) to elevate cytosolic [Ca<sup>2+</sup>] prior to evoking an IP<sub>3</sub>-mediated response already address this issue. Our results showed that puff activity was still triggered even with prior [Ca<sup>2+</sup>] elevations to levels (Cal520 DF/F<sub>o</sub> of 6-8) at which puffs are suppressed during the rising phase of IP<sub>3</sub>-evoked responses beginning from baseline cytosolic [Ca<sup>2+</sup>].</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>• use quantitative shape analysis (not ROIs) of transient bright regions at high cytoplasmic Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentrations.

My understanding is that after some filtering and spatial blurring, most analyses calculate the SD for each pixel as a 160-ms (ie 20 frames) boxcar average.</p></disp-quote><p>We now include data (Figure 1—figure supplement 1) illustrating how the SD signal is affected by varying parameters for spatial filtering and boxcar averaging.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The original view posits that a global Ca<sup>2+</sup> signal reflects most Ca<sup>2+</sup> puff sites firing very frequently (perhaps 20 or so sites active at each instant), each spreading a µm or more from its source. Might this cause elevations in cytosolic [Ca<sup>2+</sup>] that are less noisy than the infrequent Ca<sup>2+</sup> puffs observed initially, because each pixel would be influenced by Ca<sup>2+</sup> reaching it from several puffs? It's perhaps too tall an order to require quantitative simulation of this on SD measurements, but it would be helpful to have the authors consider the issue explicitly.</p></disp-quote><p>We interpret the essence of this concern as to whether the continued, “noise-free” rise in cytosolic Ca<sup>2+</sup> after puff activity ceases might arise as Ca<sup>2+</sup> released during puffs diffuses into spaces between puff sites – i.e. that all the Ca<sup>2+</sup> released during global responses originally derives from puffs. Perhaps the strongest argument supporting a distinct, “diffuse” mode of release comes from our experiments with partial depletion of ER Ca<sup>2+</sup> content (Figure 5), where we show Ca<sup>2+</sup> responses that arise in the absence of detectable puff activity. Moreover, a simple calculation indicates that Ca<sup>2+</sup> diffusion would be too fast to account for the continuing smooth rise in Ca<sup>2+</sup>. Assuming a value of D = 20 mm<sup>2</sup> s<sup>-1</sup> for the effective diffusion coefficient of Ca<sup>2+</sup>, the mean time t for a Ca<sup>2+</sup> ion to diffuse midway between puff sites separated by 10 mm ( d =10/2 mm) would be about 300 ms (t = d<sup>2</sup>/4D). In contrast, global Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals typically continued to rise and were maintained for several seconds in the face of SERCA uptake after puff activity ceases (Figure 8). We had further addressed this issue in the context of whether Ca<sup>2+</sup> diffusing from release sites deep in the cell interior might underlie the noise-free rise observed by TIRF imaging, but our lightsheet imaging indicated this was not the case (Figure 7).</p><p>We now explicitly discuss this issue in the revised manuscript (paragraph two subsection “Puff activity during global Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals”).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) From results in Figure 5, the authors propose that loss of Ca<sup>2+</sup> from the ER causes puffs to terminate without appreciably abrogating the global increase in cytosolic [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]. That proposal would align with a long-standing, but contentious, suggestion that luminal Ca<sup>2+</sup> supports IP3R activity, but it seems difficult to align with other work from this lab:</p><p>A paper from this lab and under review with eLife (Mak et al) proposes that luminal Ca<sup>2+</sup> inhibits IP3R activity, such that loss of ER Ca<sup>2+</sup> would be expected to enhance Ca<sup>2+</sup> puffs.</p></disp-quote><p>The proposal in the Mak et al. paper does not appear to be incompatible with our model. The proposed luminal regulation of IP<sub>3</sub>R activity would create a positive feedback loop, such that any local depletion of ER Ca<sup>2+</sup> would speed Ca<sup>2+</sup> liberation through puffs and more rapidly terminate that liberation if local stores at puff sites became more completely emptied. We prefer not to include discussion of this point at present, as the Mak et al. paper is not yet published.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Substantial evidence, much of it form this lab, indicates that individual Ca<sup>2+</sup> puffs do not detectably affect ER luminal [Ca<sup>2+</sup>], since steps during the falling phase of a Ca<sup>2+</sup> puff (reflecting channel closures) are of fixed amplitude. It is not thereby clear that the flurry of puff activity would cause the loss of ER Ca<sup>2+</sup> proposed to terminate Ca<sup>2+</sup> puffs.</p><p>The authors should discuss both issues.</p></disp-quote><p>Findings of uniform step decrements of Ca<sup>2+</sup> during the falling phase of puffs do suggest that there is little decline of ER Ca<sup>2+</sup> during individual puffs evoked at relatively low frequency. However, it is plausible that ER depletion may occur during the rapid flurries of puffs evoked at multiple sites during the rising phase of global signals. We now incorporate discussion of this point (paragraph four subsection “Puff activity during global Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals”).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2:</p><p>[…]</p><p>I have a few comments that might suggest that the authors could clarify a few points.</p><p>1) Why aren't local release events observed in the raw ratio images, as Parker has described many times?</p></disp-quote><p>Local release events are indeed present in the raw ratio images. They are not readily visible in the figures because the grey scale range was adjusted to encompass the much higher fluorescence levels during global responses, and because puffs in the HEK cells we used for most experiments are smaller than in cell lines such as SHSY-5Y and HeLa. We now include a note in the text (Results paragraph two) to clarify the point for readers who may also have this question.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Figure 1—figure supplement 1 shows the sites with high standard deviation (SD) to be rather large, ~10 uM, a size that is inconsistent with the size of clusters of ~15 IP3R that generate the Ca<sup>2+</sup> puffs. Rather their size suggests to me that these are entire regions of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) that are near the plasma membrane in the TIRF evanescent field. If this is the case, are the authors selecting small sites within the large &quot;contact&quot; sites for the SD analyses? And, I would think that there is a &quot;global&quot;/homogenous signal at these sites that is contributed by Ca<sup>2+</sup> that has diffused into these &quot;contact&quot; sites. This might also be consistent with the observation that the TIRF-detected high-SD signal terminates before the peak signal is achieved, because the peak is contributed by slow Ca<sup>2+</sup> diffusion that persists after release has terminated.</p></disp-quote><p>All of our SD analyses (excepting Figure 1, where we show small regions of interest for purposes of illustrating the technique) were done using regions of interest encompassing the entire cell. There is thus no issue of “selecting small sites … for the SD analyses”. We now emphasize this point more clearly in the manuscript (subsection “Fluctuation analysis reveals a transient flurry of puffs during global Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals”).</p><p>Please see our response to major point #1 of reviewer #1 regarding whether the peak is contributed by slow Ca<sup>2+</sup> diffusion that persists after release has terminated.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) The authors describe an inverted U relationship between the amplitude of the SD signal and the amplitude of the global response. What does it mean?</p></disp-quote><p>We show plots of amplitude of the SD signal and the amplitude of the global response as a convenient means of summarizing and depicting the relationship between these parameters in a time-independent manner. As described in the manuscript we originally thought the inverted U relationship might correspond to the “bell-shaped curve” of Ca<sup>2+</sup> dependence of activation of IP<sub>3</sub>Rs. However, further experiments (Figure 4, now incorporating new data) indicated that is not the case. Our interpretation (Discussion, subsection “Puff activity during global Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals”) is that the cytosolic Ca<sup>2+</sup> signal is an inverse mirror of the local ER Ca<sup>2+</sup> store level, and that the decline in SD signal arises as puff activity declines owing to falling ER store content.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) The authors conclude that elevated cytoplasmic Ca<sup>2+</sup> doesn't inhibit the IP3R as a primary mechanism to terminate Ca puffs. Why doesn't it inhibit?</p></disp-quote><p>Although high cytosolic [Ca<sup>2+</sup>] would be expected to inhibit opening of IP<sub>3</sub>R channels, a likely explanation is simply that depletion of ER Ca<sup>2+</sup> stores is the more dominant mechanism to terminate puff activity during global signals. This interpretation is buttressed by new data we present (Figure 4C,D), demonstrating that puffs still terminate even when the global cytosolic Ca<sup>2+</sup> elevation is substantially reduced by loading with EGTA.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) The authors examine the decay in cytoplasmic Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentration after an elevation. They refer to this as sequestration. I'm not sure of their meaning. Although they suggest that the kinetics can be described by a single exponential, there must be at least two processes involved: sequestration by the ER, and extrusion by the plasm membrane Ca<sup>2+</sup> pump. Indeed, in the discussion they use the phrase &quot;efflux rate from the cytoplasm&quot;. I think what the authors mean to suggest in the sequestration away from the cytoplasm. If so, this should be stated more clearly.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that our use of the term “sequestration” was imprecise. We have replaced it by terms such as “removal from the cytosol”. Our experimental data fit well to a single exponential process, likely because sequestration by the ER is much faster than loss across the plasma membrane (e.g. Figure 5H)</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3:</p><p>[…] The experimental manipulations to investigate depletion of stores, Ca<sup>2+</sup> entry, IP3R channel KO etc are well thought out and appropriate – but some concerns remain as to the ability of the authors to resolve puffs once background/cytoplasmic Ca<sup>2+</sup> levels reach a certain intensity.</p><p>The use of signal variance to isolate different components of mixed fluorescence signals relies on those components having distinct (and variable) spatio-temporal signatures. However, if Ca<sup>2+</sup> release events reach a steady state, then the variance technique becomes essentially useless. This is my main concern with some of the conclusions drawn from the analysis.</p></disp-quote><p>By the statement “Ca<sup>2+</sup> release events reach a steady state” we interpret the reviewer to mean that Ca<sup>2+</sup> release through the IP<sub>3</sub>Rs that mediate puffs becomes continuous; i.e. that some or all of the IP<sub>3</sub>R channels remain open all the time, resulting in a “noise-free” signal. If this indeed occurs, we believe it is valid and useful to regard such continuous release as a mode distinct from the transient puffs. The issue, then, is whether the same IP<sub>3</sub>Rs underlie puffs and continuous release, or whether these modes arise from separate populations of IP<sub>3</sub>Rs. Although we favor the notion that distinct populations of IP<sub>3</sub>Rs mediate the two modes of Ca<sup>2+</sup>, we now explicitly discuss the possibility the two modes may instead arise through a switch of the same IP<sub>3</sub>Rs from one form of regulation to another (Discussion and see response to similar query of reviewer #1).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The ability to detect puffs is greatest during low background conditions, but the as global Ca<sup>2+</sup> levels increase, the ability to detect puffs is hampered by i) closing of the max difference between background and puff sites and ii) an increase in the amplitude of shot noise that may start to mimick fast and small puff events. To resolve between genuine puff events, that are inherently Gaussian (1-2 µm) and random noise aggregates that occur during high background levels, is difficult – but is made worse by applying Gaussian filters to the data that reshape noise aggregates into more Gaussian shapes. Employing shape analysis before smoothing (perimeter:area ratios) is an effective way of resolving puffs (low P:A – smooth circles) even when surrounded by noise aggregates of equal intensity and size (high P:A – leafy looking). This may assuage some doubts as to the authors ability to resolve punctate events once background/global levels have reached moderate to high levels.</p></disp-quote><p>Use of shape analysis is an interesting suggestion; but developing, verifying and applying appropriate algorithms and software would incur a substantial time delay. We feel that the data we already present convincingly demonstrate that the fall in SD signal during the rising phase of global Ca<sup>2+</sup> responses truly represents a decline in puff activity, not a failure to detect puffs in the face of elevated Ca<sup>2+</sup>levels. Notably; (i) Puff activity (SD signal) was still observed in response to IP<sub>3</sub> activation when the basal cytosolic Ca<sup>2+</sup> was substantially elevated by prior photorelease of Ca<sup>2+</sup> (Figure 4A,B). (ii) We now include new data showing that puff termination follows similar kinetics when peak global Ca<sup>2+</sup> elevations were reduced by EGTA buffering (Figure 4C,D). Moreover, we present additional evidence in our rebuttals to concerns of the other reviewers that our ability to detect puffs at elevated Ca<sup>2+</sup> levels may have been impaired by limited dynamic range of the indicator.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Similarly, the use of user-placed (or randomly positioned) ROIs based on visual inspection of bright spots in the videos is subjective and can heavily bias results to what the user wants to show. Many &quot;hot spots&quot; don't appear to have ROIs drawn over them and some ROIs appear to be sampling the same site. Small ROIs are more sensitive to spatial shifts in the position of the underlying fluorescent sites. The &quot;flickering&quot; variance may be a function of out-of-sync release events from a number of channels/clusters covered by each ROI. When these channels syncronize (in the open position?) or fluorescence sites increase in size, this will dramatically reduce the signal variance, even though puffs may still be occurring.</p></disp-quote><p>We show SD traces from small, subcellular ROIs only in Figure 1, for the purpose of better illustrating the basis of our technique.

The experiment in Figure 1F,H was done under conditions deliberately chosen to evoke a Ca<sup>2+</sup> fluorescence signal matching the amplitude and kinetics of the IP<sub>3</sub>-evoked signal in Figure 1A,C. Our intent was to compare the output of our SD analysis routine with signals of similar size where punctate release was either present or absent. For this purpose, we delivered a small aliquot of ionomycin at a distance (determined by trial and error) from cells imaged in zero Ca<sup>2+</sup> solution, so that the slow diffusion and dilution of ionomycin evoked gradual release of Ca<sup>2+</sup> from intracellular stores.</p><p>Separately, we used ionomycin to determine the saturating fluorescence of the indicator by complete bath exchange of medium containing high (10 mM) calcium with ionomycin.

Instead, we follow the widely used practice of expressing data as ΔF/F0 values to normalize for these factors.
