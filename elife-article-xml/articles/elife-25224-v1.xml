pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.25224.001</object-id><p>There has been a longstanding debate on whether original fear memory is inhibited or erased after extinction. One possibility that reconciles this uncertainty is that the inhibition and erasure mechanisms are engaged in different phases (early or late) of extinction. In this study, using single-session extinction training and its repetition (multiple-session extinction training), we investigated the inhibition and erasure mechanisms in the prefrontal cortex and amygdala of rats, where neural circuits underlying extinction reside. The inhibition mechanism was prevalent with single-session extinction training but faded when single-session extinction training was repeated. In contrast, the erasure mechanism became prevalent when single-session extinction training was repeated. Moreover, ablating the intercalated neurons of amygdala, which are responsible for maintaining extinction-induced inhibition, was no longer effective in multiple-session extinction training. We propose that the inhibition mechanism operates primarily in the early phase of extinction training, and the erasure mechanism takes over after that.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.25224.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.25224.001</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>fear extinction</kwd><kwd>lateral amygdala</kwd><kwd>prefrontal cortex</kwd><kwd>basal nucleus of amygdala</kwd><kwd>amygdala intercalated neurons</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd>Rat</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004085</institution-id><institution>Ministry of Education, Science and Technology</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Brain Korea 21 Research Fellowship</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>An</surname><given-names>Bobae</given-names></name><name><surname>Kim</surname><given-names>Jihye</given-names></name><name><surname>Park</surname><given-names>Kyungjoon</given-names></name><name><surname>Song</surname><given-names>Sukwoon</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Korea Brain Research Institute Basic Research Program</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>17-BR-03</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Lee</surname><given-names>Sukwon</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100003725</institution-id><institution>National Research Foundation of Korea</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>NRF-2016R1A2B3009854</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Choi</surname><given-names>Sukwoo</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100003725</institution-id><institution>National Research Foundation of Korea</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>NRF-2016R1E1A2020520</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Choi</surname><given-names>Sukwoo</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Ministry of Public Safety and Security</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>MPSS-Fire Fighting Safety-2016-86</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Choi</surname><given-names>Sukwoo</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The inhibition mechanism of fear extinction operates primarily in the early phase of extinction training, and the erasure mechanism takes over after that.</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>eLife Digest</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Fear extinction is defined as a lessening of conditioned fear responses following extinction training, during which subjects are exposed to repetitive presentations of conditioned stimuli (CS) alone (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Pavlov, 1927</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bouton, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Myers and Davis, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Nader et al., 2013</xref>). Previous studies have provided numerous lines of evidence for the inhibition mechanism of fear extinction by which extinction training produces a new memory that inhibits the original fear memory stored in the lateral amygdala (LA) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Maren and Quirk, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">LeDoux, 2014</xref>). The neural circuits underlying the inhibition mechanism of fear extinction have been identified in the prefrontal cortex, the basolateral amygdala, the LA, and intercalated neurons (ITC) of the amygdala (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Milad and Quirk, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Chhatwal et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Herry et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Likhtik et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Lin et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Amano et al., 2010</xref>). In contrast, strong evidence is also available for the existence of the erasure mechanism through which a fear memory encoded in the LA is erased (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Rescorla and Wagner, 1972</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Lin et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Kim et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Dalton et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Mao et al., 2013</xref>). However, whether the original fear memory is inhibited or erased after extinction is still a subject of debate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Quirk et al., 2010</xref>). To resolve these issues, the relative contribution of each mechanism to fear extinction needs to be determined.</p><p>Intriguingly, the inhibition mechanisms were studied and characterized at molecular and cellular levels mostly using single-session extinction training (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Milad and Quirk, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Chhatwal et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Herry et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Likhtik et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Lin et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Amano et al., 2010</xref>). In contrast, the erasure mechanism has been supported by previous studies using both single- and multiple-session extinction training (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Rescorla and Wagner, 1972</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Lin et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Kim et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Dalton et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Mao et al., 2013</xref>). These findings provide a hint that the inhibition mechanism is involved primarily in the early phase of extinction training. Furthermore, NMDA receptor activity in the LA has been reported to be involved selectively in single-session extinction training, but not subsequent relearning of extinction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Laurent et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Laurent and Westbrook, 2008</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">2010</xref>). Prefrontal activity has been shown to be required for the recall of initial extinction training, but not gradual extinction over days (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Lebrón et al., 2004</xref>). Thus, these previous studies suggest that single- and multiple-session extinction may involve different mechanisms in distinct neural circuits.</p><p>In this study, we determined the relative contribution of the inhibition and erasure mechanisms during single-session and multiple-session extinction training. We assessed the previously characterized key signatures of the inhibition mechanism observed after single-session extinction training: (1) enhanced CS-evoked activity in the prefrontal cortex upon extinction recall (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Milad and Quirk, 2002</xref>), (2) appearance of ‘extinction neurons’ in the basal amygdala (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Herry et al., 2008</xref>), (3) enhanced inhibitory tones in LA neurons following fear extinction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Chhatwal et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Lin et al., 2009</xref>), (4) enhanced excitatory synaptic efficacy at input synapses onto ITC neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Amano et al., 2010</xref>), and (5) requirement of these ITC cells for extinction recall (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Likhtik et al., 2008</xref>). We confirmed the presence of all 5 signatures of inhibitory learning for extinction after single-session extinction training. These key signatures disappeared when single-session extinction training was repeated. On the other hand, the erasure mechanism (depotentiation of conditioning-induced synaptic potentiation at LA synapses) appeared to become more active when single-session extinction training was repeated.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>CS-evoked responses of the infralimbic cortex neurons</title><p>The infralimbic cortex (IL) is thought to be involved in suppressing conditioned fear outputs via its connectivity with the amygdala inhibitory neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Sotres-Bayon and Quirk, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Quirk and Mueller, 2008</xref>), when extinction is recalled (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Quirk et al., 2000</xref>).

Single unit activities of a total of 72 neurons in the IL of 19 rats were recorded stably across the entire behavioral training (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A,B</xref>).

In the successful extinction recall group (which included rats with lower freezing than the upper 99% confidence interval of freezing in post-Ext1; n = 14 rats; black in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>), strong excitatory activities of the IL appeared during post-Ext1 (<italic>F</italic><sub>4,220</sub> = 3.346, p=0.0319, p&lt;0.05 for post-Ext1 vs. Hab, Repeated measures one-way ANOVA followed by Newman-Keuls post-test; black in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E,F</xref>), consistent with a previous report (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Milad and Quirk, 2002</xref>). Intriguingly, this transient appearance of neuronal activity quickly disappeared during the subsequent sessions (p&gt;0.05 for post-Ext2, post-Ext3 vs. Hab; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E,F</xref>) and even during the Ext2 (black in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C</xref>). In contrast, in the poor extinction recall group (which included rats with higher freezing than the upper 99% confidence interval of freezing in post-Ext1; n = 5 rats; gray in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>), CS-evoked activities of IL neurons were largely unchanged throughout conditioning, subsequent extinction training sessions, and recall test (<italic>F</italic><sub>4</sub>,<sub>60</sub> = 0.2742, p=0.7918, Repeated measures one-way ANOVA; gray in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E,F</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C</xref>). Histological verification revealed that all the recorded cells were located within the anterior part of the IL (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>). In addition, we further performed detailed analysis on individual single-units in all recordings and found a subpopulation of cells displaying transient activities associated with post-Ext1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2A,B</xref>). These findings indicate that the transient increase in IL neuronal activity is only found in single-session extinction training but not in multiple-session extinction training.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>‘Extinction neurons’ in the basal nucleus of the amygdala</title><p>Having established that IL neurons are no longer involved in fear extinction after multiple-session extinction training, we then determined whether downstream target neurons of IL neurons show the same activity pattern as the IL neurons during multiple-session extinction training.

An obvious solution to this problem is to distinguish cellular erasure in a given structure (that is, amygdala) from brain-wide erasure of the entire memory. The return of fear after multiple session extinction simply indicates that the original memory is still present in some structures or circuits. Consistently, previous findings have shown that fear memory traces are distributed in multiple brain regions, such as the prefrontal cortex and associated cortical areas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Frankland et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Corcoran and Quirk, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Do-Monte et al., 2015b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Senn et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Kitamura et al., 2017</xref>). Alternatively, erased cellular traces at amygdala synapses after multiple session extinction may be reconstructed through a metaplastic mechanism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Lee et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Maren, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Clem and Schiller, 2016</xref>).</p><p>To investigate the underlying mechanisms of fear extinction, we and others in the present and previous studies have performed a series of experiments in which molecular and cellular correlates in the neural circuit of interest are monitored and manipulated during single- or multiple-session extinction training (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Milad and Quirk, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Herry et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Likhtik et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Amano et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Lin et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Kim et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Dalton et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Mao et al., 2013</xref>). Correlates for the inhibition mechanism for fear extinction, which are active during single-session extinction training, abruptly disappear after multiple-session extinction training (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">5</xref>). Likewise, cell-type specific ablation of ITC cells, which impairs extinction recall after single-session extinction training, is no longer effective after multiple-session extinction training (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). By contrast, a correlate for the erasure mechanism (that is, depotentiation at LA synapses) persists with single and multiple-session extinction training (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). Consistently, manipulation of LA synaptic depotentiation using GluA2-3Y (a peptide blocker of GluA2-containing AMPAR internalization) attenuates fear extinction persistently with single and multiple-session extinction training (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Kim et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Dalton et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Mao et al., 2013</xref>). Additionally, molecular and structural markers (GluA1 &amp; 2, mGluR1 and dendritic spines) of the erasure mechanism persist throughout multiple-session extinction training (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Kim et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Hong et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Lai et al., 2012</xref>) Together, all these findings can be nicely fitted into one scenario that as multiple-session extinction training proceeds, the original fear memory is transiently inhibited in the early phase of extinction training whereas the erasure of fear memory persistently supports all the phases of extinction training (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>).</p><p>It is quite striking that the inhibition mechanisms in various brain regions (that is, prefrontal cortex, Ba, LA and ITC) disappear in concert after multiple-session extinction training (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">5</xref>). Indeed, Ba ‘extinction neurons’, LA interneurons and ITC cells receive excitatory inputs from the IL (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Herry et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Amano et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Rosenkranz and Grace, 2002</xref>, but see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Likhtik et al., 2005</xref>) (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>). Based on these functional connections, we propose that the IL orchestrates the inhibition mechanisms in various brain regions via synaptic connections; hence, the disappearance of the IL-based inhibition mechanism leads to the loss of other inhibition mechanisms. In support of this hypothesis, we found individual IL cells that were similar to ‘extinction neurons’ in the Ba (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2B</xref>). Thus, the disappearance of IL responsiveness to the CS after multiple-session extinction training may lead to the complete loss of the inhibition mechanisms. Alternatively, Ba ‘extinction neurons’ may play a critical role in orchestrating the inhibition mechanisms in various brain regions, by initially triggering the whole circuit for the inhibition mechanisms. Ba ‘extinction neurons’ send inputs to IL neurons, and inactivation of this connection impairs fear extinction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Senn et al., 2014</xref>). Furthermore, the present study has shown that the latencies of CS-responses of Ba ‘extinction neurons’ are faster than those of IL ‘extinction neurons’ (see the legend in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>). It would be very interesting in future studies to examine how multiple-session extinction training results in the disappearance of IL or Ba responsiveness to the CS. The disappearance of IL or Ba activity during the course of long-term learning is reminiscent of other known phenomena in which original neural pathways are no longer used in a certain form of learning when the learning is repeated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Poldrack et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Kelly and Garavan, 2005</xref>).</p><p>The present results suggest that fear memory inhibition represents a transient mechanism for the early phase of extinction training contrary to what most researchers studying extinction believe. This conclusion will have a tremendous impact on the current understanding of both neural circuits and mechanisms underlying fear extinction. Furthermore, the vast majority of the previous findings in the field may also need to be reinterpreted because many of these previous findings have been made based solely on the inhibition mechanism of extinction. For example, CS-evoked activity of IL neurons, which is known to underlie extinction recall, may also indeed be required for triggering depotentiation of conditioning-induced synaptic potentiation at LA synapses: prefrontal neurons send excitatory drive onto LA principal neurons and proper depolarization is required for depotentiation induction at LA synapses (Likhtik et al., 2005; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Kim et al., 2007</xref>). A recent study has indeed shown that the IL also plays a critical role during extinction training (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Do-Monte et al., 2015a</xref>).</p><p>When more CSs are presented during single-session extinction training, extinction of the conditioned fear is stronger. However, this relationship is valid for only a certain number of consecutive CSs, and any extra CSs turn out to be ineffective for inducing further extinction. Therefore, to achieve stronger extinction with more CSs, resting periods should be present between CS exposures (that is, multiple-session extinction training). Intriguingly, the resting periods between CSs vary from tens of minutes to days as shown in the present and past studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bouton, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Kim et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">An et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Mao et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Lee et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Zelikowsky et al., 2013</xref>). It will be crucial but extremely difficult to determine how the duration of the resting periods affects the pattern of changes in extinction mechanisms (that is, the inhibition and erasure mechanisms) during extinction training. In addition, conditioning strength (that is, the number of CS-US presentation, the strength of US etc.) may impact the dynamics of subsequent extinction training, and thus, it may also affect the pattern of changes in extinction mechanisms. In light of this, caution should be given to the comparisons across the experiments shown in different figures as we used a different conditioning parameter in each figure. Taken together, there certainly exist some boundary conditions (that is, the duration of the resting periods between extinction sessions and conditioning strength) for inducing a conversion of the extinction mechanisms.</p><p>The present findings have far-reaching implications for the clinical application of basic research based on fear extinction because multiple-session extinction training in animals better represents human exposure therapy that requires repeated treatment for days or weeks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Foa et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Nader et al., 2013</xref>). In fact, from a mechanistic point of view, exposure therapy in humans shows similar patterns to the results obtained in the present study. Enhanced prefrontal activity and reduced amygdala activity are observed during the therapy, whereas the enhanced prefrontal activity returns to baseline and the reduced amygdala activity persists after the therapy (see Figure 1 of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Quidé et al., 2012</xref>). Thus, previous findings concerning the inhibition mechanisms of fear extinction may be more applicable to the early phase of exposure therapy, resulting in only transient effects, whereas a more persistent therapeutic effect of exposure therapy could result from targeting the cellular and molecular changes after multiple-session extinction training. Taken together, the present findings set a new standard for drug development to treat fear/anxiety-related disorders.</p><p>At present, the mechanisms which underlie this apparent extinction of the inhibition mechanisms during multiple-session extinction training are unclear. Ironically, just as extinction has been proposed to be mediated by both erasure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Rescorla and Wagner, 1972</xref>) and inhibition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bouton, 1988</xref>), the apparent extinction of the inhibition mechanisms may also be mediated by erasure or second round of inhibition. It is indeed a theoretically and clinically intriguing question to see if the apparent extinction of the inhibition mechanisms also relapses just like extinction of original conditioned fear.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Subjects</title><p>4–8 week-old Male Sprague-Dawley rats were individually housed under an inverted 12 hr light/dark cycle (lights off at 09:00) and were provided with food and water ad libitum.

Anesthesia was maintained with isoflurane (1–1.5%) in O<sub>2</sub> and either angled fixed-wire electrodes were bilaterally implanted into the infralimbic cortex (IL, 2.9 mm anterior to bregma, 1.2 to 1.5 mm lateral to midline, and 4.2 to 4.6 mm deep from the cortical surface) or fixed-wire electrodes were implanted into the basal amygdala (Ba, 2.85 mm anterior to bregma, 5.0 to 5.1 mm lateral to midline, and 8.8 mm deep from the cortical surface). The electrodes consisted of 8 individually insulated nichrome microwires (50 μm outer diameter, impedance 0.5–1 MΩ at 1 kHz; California Fine Wire, Grover Beach, CA) contained in a 21 gauge stainless steel guide cannula. The implant was secured using dental cement (Vertex-dental, Zeist, Netherlands). An analgesic (Metacam, Boehringer Ingelheim, Germany) and an antibiotic were also applied. After 6–7 days of recovery, the rats were first habituated to the context and the CS in context A. On day 1, rats were exposed to 5 presentations of the CS to determine basal IL neural responses to the CS (Hab). The CS was a 30 s 4 kHz pure tone for the IL recordings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Milad and Quirk, 2002</xref>) and a series of 27 7.5 kHz pure tone pips (200 msec duration repeated at 0.9 Hz, 85 dB sound pressure level) for the Ba recordings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Herry et al., 2008</xref>). Fear conditioning (Cond) was conducted by pairing the CS with a mild electric foot shock (0.5 mA, 0.5 s, 5 CS/US pairings; inter-trial interval: 80–120 s). The first extinction training took place 8 hr after conditioning in context B (Ext1), in which rats were presented with 20 non-reinforced CS presentations. Two additional extinction sessions were conducted the following day (Ext2, 3). The first 5 CSs of each extinction session were considered as the retention of the previous training (post-Cond, post-Ext1, post-Ext2). On day 3, the behavioral and neuronal outcomes of three extinction sessions were observed in a short 5 CSs test session (post-Ext3). Throughout the behavioral sessions, neural activity was acquired using a Plexon MAP system, and data analysis was performed using Offline Sorter (OFS, Plexon, Dallas, TX). Briefly, all waveforms were plotted in a principal component space and clusters consisting of similar waveforms were defined automatically and manually. Single unit isolation was graded using two statistical parameters, J3 and the Davies-Bouldin validity metric (DB). A high J3 and low DB value indicated a compact, well-separated unit cluster, and neurons with a low grade were discarded. The long-term stability of a single-unit isolation was determined using Wavetracker (Plexon), in which the principal components of a unit recorded from different sessions were compared, and the linear correlation values (r) between the template waveforms obtained over the entire set of behavioral sessions were also compared. Only stable units (r &gt; 0.97) were considered for further analysis. Different analysis strategies have been utilized to examine the effects of extinction training on CS-evoked neuronal responses in the IL and Ba. To investigate the effects of extinction training on IL cells, CS-evoked neural activities were normalized using a standard z-score transformation (bin size, 100 msec) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Milad and Quirk, 2002</xref>). Unit responses were normalized to the firing rates of four pre-tone bins. Z-score peri-event time histograms (PETHs) of averaged CS-responses were constructed for each neuron and averaged for every CS. The mean z-values of 0–400 msec following CS-onset from the first 5 CSs of each session were compared throughout the course of behavioral training. To examine the effects of extinction training on Ba cells, CS-evoked neural activities were normalized using a standard z-score transformation (bin size, 20 msec) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Herry et al., 2008</xref>). Unit responses in the first 5 CSs, consisting of 135 pips, were first averaged and normalized to the baseline (firing rates of 500 msec preceding the tone). Z-score PETHs of averaged CS-responses were constructed for each neuron and then averaged for every CS. The mean z-values of 0–100 msec following CS-onset from the first 5 CSs of each session were compared throughout the behavioral training. A neuron was determined as CS-responsive if it showed significant excitatory/inhibitory responses within 100 msec following CS-onset compared to the baseline (unpaired <italic>t</italic> test, p&lt;0.05). At the end of the experiments, the rats were anesthetized with urethane (1 g/kg, i.p.) and electrolytic lesions were made by passing a current (10 μA, 5–20 s) through the recording microwires, from which discrete units were identified to identify location of the microwires. The animals were then transcardially perfused with 0.9% saline solution and 10% buffered formalin. The brains were removed and post-fixed overnight. Coronal sections (90 μm thick) were obtained using a vibroslicer (NVSL; World Precision Instruments, Sarasota, FL) and stained with cresyl violet.

One or two additional extinction sessions (Ext2,3) were conducted in the post-Ext2 and post-Ext3 groups, respectively. Extinction 2 and 3 involved 15 non-reinforced CS presentations.

The internal solution contained (in mM) 100 cesium gluconate, 0.6 EGTA, 10 HEPES, 5 NaCl, 20 TEA, 4 Mg-ATP, 0.3 Na-GTP and 3 QX314 with the pH adjusted to 7.2 with CsOH and the osmolarity adjusted to approximately 297 mmol kg<sup>−1</sup> with sucrose. For EPSC recording, Picrotoxin (100 μM) was included in the recording solution to isolate excitatory synaptic transmission and block feed-forward GABAergic inputs to the principal neurons. For mIPSC recordings, TTX (1 µM) NBQX (10 µM) and D-AP5 (50 µM) was added in the recording solution to isolate inhibitory synaptic currents and 5 mM CsCl was added to the internal solution to observe anionic current in resting membrane potential. Infrared differential interference contrast-enhanced visual guidance was used to select neurons that were 3–4 cell layers below the surface of the 300 μm-thick slices, which were maintained at 32 ± 1°C. The neurons were voltage clamped at −70 mV, and the solutions were delivered to the slices via a peristaltic pump (REGLO Digital, Ismatech, Germany) at a flow rate of 1.3 ml min<sup>−1</sup>. The pipette series resistance was monitored throughout each experiment, and the data were discarded if the value changed by &gt;20%. The whole-cell recordings were obtained using pipettes with resistances of 3.5–4.5 MΩ. The whole-cell currents were filtered at 1 kHz, digitized at up to 20 kHz, and stored on a microcomputer (Clampex 8, 9, 10 software, Molecular Devices, CA, USA). The Ba inputs to ITC neurons were stimulated using a concentric bipolar electrode (CBAEC75; FHC Inc., ME, USA), which was placed approximately 500 μm ventrolateral to the Ba-CeA border and centered on the lateromedial extent of the CeA nucleus. Thalamic afferents to the LA were stimulated using the same bipolar electrode, which was placed on the midpoint of the trunk between the internal capsule and the medial boundary of the LA. The cell was stimulated at a frequency of 0.067 Hz. The AMPA/NMDA ratio was calculated as the average peak amplitude at −70 mV over the average current amplitude obtained 50 msec after the stimuli at +50 mV.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Surface biotinylation and western blotting analysis of the β2 and γ2 subunits of GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors</title><p>Surface biotinylation and western blotting analysis were performed as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Mao et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Lin et al., 2009</xref>). LA areas were microdissected from 400-μm-thick brain slices and pooled (three to four pieces per rat). The pooled slices were incubated with ACSF containing 0.5 mg/ml sulfo-NHS-LC-biotin (Pierce, Rockford, IL, USA) for 30 min on ice. Next, the slices were rinsed in TBS buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, and 150 mM NaCl) to quench the biotin reaction and sonicated briefly in homogenizing buffer (1% Triton X-100, 0.1% SDS, 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.3 M sucrose, 5 mM EDTA, 2 mM sodium pyrophosphate, 1 mM sodium orthovanadate, 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 20 µg/ml leupeptin, and 4 µg/ml aprotinin). After sonication, the samples were centrifuged at 14,000 rpm for 30 min at 4°C and the supernatant was obtained. Protein concentration in the soluble fraction was then measured using a Bradford assay, with bovine serum albumin as the standard. To harvest biotinylated proteins, the same amount of proteins among the groups (400 µg) were reacted with 50 µl of 50% Neutravidin agarose (Pierce, Rockford, IL, USA) for 16 hr at 4°C and washed four times with homogenizing buffer. The bound protein was resuspended in 30 µl of SDS sample buffer and boiled. The biotinylated protein was resolved in a 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel (Mini-PROTEAN precast gels, Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA, USA), blotted electrophoretically onto a polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF) membrane, and blocked for 1 hr in PBS buffer (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA) containing 5% BSA and 0.1% Tween-20 (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA). We confirmed equal loading of the proteins based on densitometric quantification of silver-stained band profiles obtained from gels pre-run with small aliquots of the loaded samples (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Lee et al., 2013</xref>). The isolated biotinylated proteins were subsequently analyzed by immunoblotting with antibodies. Different membranes were used for immunoblotting with a polyclonal antibody to β2 (1:500, RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/AB_177524">AB_177524</ext-link>, AB5561, Merck Millipore, Darmstadt, Germany) and a polyclonal antibody to γ2 (1:500, RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/AB_92164">AB_92164</ext-link>, AB5954, Merck Millipore, Darmstadt, Germany). Then, each membrane was reblotted with a monoclonal antibody to pan-cadherin (surface protein control; 1:1,000, RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/AB_476826">AB_476826</ext-link>, C1821, Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA). The immunoblot was probed with a horseradish peroxidase–conjugated secondary antibody (donkey antibody to rabbit IgG: 1:5,000, RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/AB_10015282">AB_10015282</ext-link>, 711-035-152; donkey antibody to mouse IgG: 1:5,000, RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/AB_2340770">AB_2340770</ext-link>, 715-035-150; Jackson ImmunoResearch) for 1 hr and detected using an ECL-based immunoblotting detection system (Chemi-Doc; Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA, USA). The relative optical densities of the bands were quantified using the Image Lab software (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA, USA). The optical densities of the GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor subunit and cadherin bands in the post-Cond, post-Ext1, and post-Ext3 groups were normalized with respect to the naïve control group in each experiment.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Biochemical lesions</title><p>The rats were first habituated to context A, in which they were placed without any disturbance for 20 min. On day 1, fear conditioning (Cond) was conducted by pairing the CS with a mild electric foot shock (0.4 mA, 1 s, 4 CS/US pairings; inter-trial interval: 100 s) that co-terminated with the CS. The CS was a 30 s 4 kHz pure tone (85 dB sound pressure level). The following day, extinction training took place in context B. Two additional extinction sessions were conducted to investigate the effects of extensive extinction training on ITC activity. Twenty-four hours after the last extinction session, the rats with ≤15% freezing at the end of the first extinction session were anesthetized with sodium pentobarbital and secured in a stereotaxic frame (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Likhtik et al., 2008</xref>). Bilateral infusions of either μ-opioid receptor (μOR) agonist conjugated to saporin (D-Sap, 9 pmol/0.3 μl/hemisphere; 0.01 μl/min) or the same volume and concentration of a scrambled peptide conjugated to saporin (B-Sap, control; Advanced Targeting systems, San Diego, CA) were administered through a micro-syringe (30 gauge) to the intercalated amygdala cells (ITC) at 2.65 mm posterior, 4.75 mm lateral, and 8.65 mm deep from bregma. The syringe tip faced the anterior portion of the brain. Ten minutes elapsed between the end of the infusion and the removal of the micro-syringe to minimize diffusion along the needle tract. After 7 days of recovery, extinction recall was tested in context B. At the end of the experiments, the rats were anesthetized with urethane and transcardially perfused to reveal μOR immunoreactivity. The brains were removed and post-fixed overnight. The amygdala-containing sections (60 μm thick) were obtained from a region 2.0–3.0 posterior to bregma using a vibroslicer (NVSL; World Precision Instruments) and stored in PBS. The sections were incubated in 1% sodium borohydride for 30 min, washed three times in PBS and pre-incubated in a blocking solution (10% goat serum, 1% BSA, 0.3% Triton-X100 in PBS). Then, sections were incubated in a primary antibody solution containing μOR antibody (ImmunoStar, 1:2000) and NeuN antibody (Millipore, 1:2000) in 1% goat serum, 1% BSA, and 0.3% Triton-X100 in PBS for 1 hr, followed by incubation in a cocktail of the fluorescent secondary antibodies (Merck, 1:500) for 2 hr. Cell counting was conducted as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Likhtik et al., 2008</xref>) with slight modifications. The sections were examined under confocal microscopy (Nikon). The contour areas that were stained for μOR and located between the basolateral amygdala complex and the central amygdala (CeA) were defined as ITC regions. In a 1-in-4 series of sections, the regions of interest (ROI) were systematically sampled (ITC counting frame, 25 × 25 μm; grid size, 45 × 43 μm; CeA, counting frame, 35 × 35 μm; grid size, 115 × 115 μm), and NeuN-positive cells in the ROI areas were counted. The brain sections showing the highest and the lowest averaged fluorescence were considered to be outliers and were not included in the cell counting. The optical dissector height was 10 μm.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>Statistical significance was tested by Mann-Whitney <italic>U</italic> test for comparison of two groups, and by Friedman test or Kruskal-Wallis <italic>H</italic> test for comparison of three or more groups.

Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Timothy Behrens as the Senior Editor. The following individuals involved in review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Marta A Moita (Reviewer #1); Gregory Quirk (Reviewer #2).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission. The reviewers think the study is novel and interesting but suggest that the authors test memory relapse after multiple session extinction or change the language in text. They also have questions about the definition of BLA fear and extinction neurons, and suggest that the definition may condition the result, and that maybe the behavior of other neurons should be analyzed/presented.</p><p>Attached below are the point-by-point comments of the reviewers.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic></p><p>In this study Choi and colleagues address the important and under-explored issue of whether fear extinction learning over multiple sessions results in inhibition of the learned tone-shock association or erasure of the association. To do so, they characterize the changes of several neural signatures of extinction learning across multiple days. As a result, the authors convincingly show that the neural correlates of inhibition are transient and that the neural correlates of the initial association gradually decrease with extinction training. In addition, killing cells from the intercalated cell masses, implicated in inhibitory control of conditioned freezing, disrupted single session but not multiple session extinction. The authors thus argue that inhibitory mechanisms of extinction are transient and that multiple sessions of extinction lead to erasure of the initial tone-shock association. These findings have important implications to our understanding of extinction learning and its potential application to therapeutic strategies for anxiety disorders.</p><p>1) Freezing expression relapse</p><p>Although the results are solid, and the multiple approaches used all point to a coherent picture of the processes underlying fear extinction over multiple sessions, I feel that at the behavioral level this study falls short of demonstrating the transition from inhibition to erasure. A simple behavioral experiment would address this issue. I would suggest that the authors run one group of animals that would undergo the multiple extinction session protocol as reported (habituation, conditioning and extinction sessions), but would undergo a fear renewal test (where rats are placed in a third context and tones are played) after the first and last extinction session. A second group of rats would only undergo the renewal test after the last extinction session (this additional group is necessary as the renewal test after the first extinction session may change the dynamics of extinction). If the authors are right, rats should freeze in the renewal test after the first but not the last extinction session.</p><p>The authors argue for looking at the neural correlates of extinction rather than at behavior, since according to a previous study (Lee 2013) freezing in response to the tone during renewal may not necessarily reflect the expression of the original memory of the tone-shock association. In this previous study it is shown that fear extinction induces metaplasticity in amygdala neurons and that during renewal there is low-threshold potentiation of thalamo-amygdala synapses, through a mechanism that differs on a molecular level from initial learning of tone-shock association. However, as the authors discuss in that study, it is possible that this form of potentiation corresponds in essence to a reconstruction of the original memory trace.</p><p>Ultimately whether rats freeze to the tone in a different context after multiple session extinction is very relevant to our understanding of the processes occurring during extinction learning. In addition, for translational purposes it is relevant to know whether multiple session extinction leads to fear expression relapse or not, regardless of whether fear expression is controlled by a reconstructed memory or a new one.</p><p>2) Definition of fear and extinction neurons in amygdala.</p><p>If I understood correctly fear neurons are defined as neurons that respond to the tone-CS selectively during the post-Cond session and extinction neurons those that respond selectively during the post-Ext1 session (table in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>). According to this table, 14 neurons showed responses to the CS during the post-Cond session. Of these 14 cells, 8 responded specifically in that session (corresponding to the 8 fear neurons reported). Conversely, another 14 cells responded to the tone CS- specifically during the post-Ext1 session, of which 6 were selective to that session (corresponding to the 6 extinction neurons reported). It follows that by definition the 8 fear neurons do not respond to the CS after the post-Cond session and that the 6 extinction neurons do not respond to the CS after the post-Ext1 session. That is, the very definition of fear and extinction neurons imposes a particular temporal dynamics to their response patterns. What happens to the remaining 6 CS-responsive neurons of the post-Cond session that are not responsive only in that session? What about the 8 remaining non-selective CS-responsive neurons of post-Ext1 session? Since the main point of the paper is to show a transient inhibitory mechanisms of extinction accompanied by a sustained erasure of the CS-US association, I feel it is crucial to clarify this point.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>This is an impressive study that tackles a long-standing debate in fear research, namely, is extinction of conditioned fear due to inhibition or erasure of the original fear memory? There are approximately 6 key studies using various techniques that support the inhibition hypothesis, published over the past 15 years in high-impact journals. The authors take the unusually thorough approach of replicating each of these key findings, and then extending the studies to include additional extinction training. For early extinction, they replicate all 6 findings (!), which is itself impressive and a significant contribution to the field. However, in all cases, these inhibitory signals dissipate with further extinction training, suggesting a non-inhibition mechanism for late extinction. They also replicate their previous depotentiation of thalamic inputs to LA, and argue that this is consistent with erasure as the enduring mechanism.</p><p>The experiments are very clearly designed and even replicate the style of data presentation in the original studies. Their hypothesis that both inhibition (early) and erasure (late) are involved, integrates the prior studies and arrives at a novel conclusion regarding the amount of extinction training. This has clinical implications, given the use of prolonged extinction as a therapy for anxiety disorders. I have some suggestions (relatively minor) for improvements.</p><p>1) The idea that prolonged extinction triggers erasure runs into the problem that conditioned fear has been shown to relapse or be brought back even after prolonged extinction. The authors are aware of this and make a (somewhat unconvincing) case in the Introduction that return of fear is not a good measure of inhibition vs. erasure. This is also a problem for the Discussion, when discussing prolonged extinction (PE) therapy for PTSD. If prolonged extinction always triggered erasure, then patients would never relapse (but they do).</p><p>An obvious solution to this problem is to distinguish cellular erasure in a given structure from brain-wide erasure of the entire memory. The return of fear after prolonged extinction simply indicates that the original memory is still present in some structures or circuits. That is not inconsistent with the demonstration of erasure in thalamo-amygdala projections. The problem arises when one mistakenly concludes that the amygdala is the only site of fear storage in the brain. The authors may want to incorporate this interpretation into their manuscript.</p><p>2) The authors hypothesize that the IL drives erasure via downstream projections to the BLA. While this may be true, the reverse is also possible as the projections are reciprocal. Support for this idea comes from a recent study showing that extinction neurons in BLA project to extinction neurons in IL, and silencing this projection impairs extinction (Senn et al., 2014). It would seem that the authors can address this issue here by comparing the latencies of tone response in IL and BLA extinction neurons.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic></p><p>An et al. nicely demonstrated that single-session extinction training induces the inhibition of fear memory as previously described, whereas repeated single-session extinction training leads to the erasure mechanism of fear memory. Indeed, they clearly showed that inhibitory responses to fear at the molecular and circuit levels disappeared when single-session extinction training was repeated. The experiments were well designed and the results are clear.</p><p>I have major concerns as follows:</p><p>1) I could not find description of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E,F</xref> in the Results section.

In previous studies, however, conditioned fear has been shown to return even after multiple session extinction (Bouton, 2002; An et al., 2011; Zelikowsky et al., 2013; Lee et al., 2013). Thus, the demonstration of erasure at amygdala synapses seems to be inconsistent with the return of fear after multiple session extinction.</p><p>In the original manuscript, to reconcile with this apparent discrepancy, we had proposed that the return of fear may not necessarily reflect the expression of the original memory of the tone-shock association. Rather, it may be due to metaplastic changes in the amygdala which are independent of the original fear memory trace (Lee et al., 2013; Maren, 2015; Clem and Schiller, 2016). However, as suggested by the reviewer, this metaplastic change may also reflect reconstruction of the original fear memory trace. Thus, we have removed the argument from the Introduction section.</p><p>Instead, based on the reviewers’ suggestions, we have proposed in the revised manuscript that cellular erasure in a given structure can be distinguished from brain-wide erasure of the entire memory. The return of fear after multiple session extinction simply indicates that the original memory is still present in some structures or circuits, consistent with previous findings that fear memory traces are distributed in multiple brain regions including the prefrontal cortex and associated cortical areas (Frankland et al., 2004; Corcoran and Quirk, 2007; Sacco and Sacchetti, 2010; Do-Monte et al., 2015; Senn et al., 2014; Kitamura et al., 2017).</p><p><italic>2) Definition of fear and extinction neurons in amygdala.</italic></p><p><italic>If I understood correctly fear neurons are defined as neurons that respond to the tone-CS selectively during the post-Cond session and extinction neurons those that respond selectively during the post-Ext1 session (table in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>). According to this table, 14 neurons showed responses to the CS during the post-Cond session. Of these 14 cells, 8 responded specifically in that session (corresponding to the 8 fear neurons reported). Conversely, another 14 cells responded to the tone CS- specifically during the post-Ext1 session, of which 6 were selective to that session (corresponding to the 6 extinction neurons reported). It follows that by definition the 8 fear neurons do not respond to the CS after the post-Cond session and that the 6 extinction neurons do not respond to the CS after the post-Ext1 session. That is, the very definition of fear and extinction neurons imposes a particular temporal dynamics to their response patterns. What happens to the remaining 6 CS-responsive neurons of the post-Cond session that are not responsive only in that session? What about the 8 remaining non-selective CS-responsive neurons of post-Ext1 session? Since the main point of the paper is to show a transient inhibitory mechanisms of extinction accompanied by a sustained erasure of the CS-US association, I feel it is crucial to clarify this point.</italic></p><p>We appreciate the reviewer’s careful comment. Fear and extinction neurons in the Ba were defined with single-session extinction (Herry et al., 2008). Neurons that developed CS-responses following fear conditioning and lost the responses following the first extinction session are defined as ‘fear neurons’ (n = 8). Neurons that developed CS-responses after the first extinction session are defined as ‘extinction neurons’ (n = 6). In the present study, fear and extinction neurons were simply tracked during multiple-session extinction.</p><p>As suggested by the reviewer, we additionally examined the remaining CS-responsive neurons of post-Cond (or post-Ext1 session) that were not selectively responsive in that session (Author response <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">images 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">2</xref>). We first examined how 6 non-selective neurons which responded to the CS in the post-Cond session behave throughout the training sessions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Author response image 1</xref>). We found that 5 neurons show increased CS-responses following fear conditioning and decreased after extinction training (n = 5; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Author response image 1A,B</xref>), similar to fear neurons, but the changes in CS-responsiveness were not statistically significant (Friedman test, χ<sup>2</sup> = 8.3, <italic>P</italic> = 0.0805).

To address the reviewer’s question, we obtained and compared response latencies of IL or Ba extinction neurons to the CS. CS-response latencies of Ba extinction neurons varied from 20 to 80 msec and the averaged CS-response latency of Ba extinction neurons was 43.33 msec ± 9.545 (s.e.m). IL extinction neurons responded to the CS with latencies ranging from 100 to 400 msec and the averaged CS-response latency of IL extinction neurons was 211.1 msec ± 42.31 (<italic>U</italic> = 0.0000, <italic>P</italic> = 0.0016, Mann-Whitney test). The fact that the latencies of CS-responses of Ba extinction neurons are faster than those of IL extinction neurons and the synaptic input of Ba extinction neurons to IL neurons is critical for fear extinction (Senn et al., 2014) suggests that Ba extinction neurons may trigger the inhibition mechanisms, initially via their connection to IL. Accordingly, we have added this to the Discussion section.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic></p><p><italic>[…] I have major concerns as follows:</italic></p><p><italic>1) I could not find description of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E,F</xref> in the Results section.
