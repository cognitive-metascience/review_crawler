pathway. The SLC1A5 function involves finely tuned orchestration of two domain movements that include the substrate-binding transport domain and the scaffold domain. Here, we present cryo-EM structures of human SLC1A5 and its complex with the substrate, L-glutamine in an outward-facing conformation. These structures reveal insights into the conformation of the critical ECL2a loop which connects the two domains, thus allowing rigid body movement of the transport domain throughout the transport cycle. Furthermore, the structures provide new insights into substrate recognition, which involves conformational changes in the HP2 loop. A putative cholesterol binding site was observed near the domain interface in the outward-facing state. Comparison with the previously determined inward-facing structure of SCL1A5 provides a basis for a more integrated understanding of substrate recognition and transport mechanism in the SLC1 family.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>SLC1A5</kwd><kwd>ASCT2</kwd><kwd>glutamine transporter</kwd><kwd>solute carrier</kwd><kwd>cryo-EM</kwd><kwd>outward-facing conformation</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><funding-statement>YD and EPC are members of the SGC, (Charity ref: 1097737) funded by AbbVie, Bayer Pharma AG, Boehringer Ingelheim, the Canada Foundation for Innovation, Genome Canada, GlaxoSmithKline, Janssen, Lilly Canada, Merck &amp; Co., Novartis, the Ontario Ministry of Economic Development and Innovation, Pfizer, São Paulo Research Foundation-FAPESP and Takeda, as well as the Innovative Medicines Initiative Joint Undertaking ULTRA-DD grant 115766 and the Wellcome Trust 106169/Z/14/Z.

Among the solute carrier family 1 (SLC1) sub-family, it is the only one that is competent to transport glutamine, and it serves as the primary transporter of glutamine in cancer cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Fuchs and Bode, 2005</xref>). Inhibition of SLC1A5 glutamine transport by small molecules and shRNA-mediated SLC1A5 knockdown have been shown to decrease endometrial cancer cell growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Marshall et al., 2017</xref>). Similarly, SLC1A5 inhibition and knockdown suppressed mTORC1 signaling and induced rapid cell death in breast cancer cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">van Geldermalsen et al., 2016</xref>). In addition, SLC1A5 <sup>-/-</sup> mice are deficient in T cell receptor-mediated activation of the metabolic kinase mTORC1 and as a result exhibit improved clinical scores in experimental autoimmune animal models of multiple sclerosis and colitis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Nakaya et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>The structure and function of SLC1 transporters have been studied using bacterial aspartate transporter homologues Glt<sub>PH</sub> from <italic>Pyrococcus horikoshii</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Yernool et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Boudker et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Reyes et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Georgieva et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Akyuz et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Ji et al., 2016</xref>), Glt<sub>TK</sub> from <italic>Thermococcus kodakarensis</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Jensen et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Guskov et al., 2016</xref>), human glutamate transporter SLC1A3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Canul-Tec et al., 2017</xref>) and glutamine transporter SLC1A5 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Garaeva et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Garaeva et al., 2019</xref>). All these transporters form a trimer of independently functioning protomers that uses an elevator mechanism to carry amino acids across membranes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Akyuz et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Erkens et al., 2013</xref>). Each protomer has a scaffold domain and a movable transport domain which slides and carries the solute. Glt<sub>PH</sub> structures have been reported in both the outward- and the inward-facing states (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Boudker et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Reyes et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Akyuz et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Verdon et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Verdon and Boudker, 2012</xref>). Crystal structures of unbound and substrate-bound Glt<sub>TK</sub> have also been reported in the outward-facing conformation. The crystal structures of SLC1A3 were determined with competitive and allosteric inhibitors in the outward-facing conformation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Canul-Tec et al., 2017</xref>). Crystallographic studies of SLC1A3 required mutation of nearly 25% of its primary sequence suggesting the inherent technical challenges with this gene family (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Canul-Tec et al., 2017</xref>). Recently, the cryo-EM structures of SLC1A5 in complex with glutamine or inhibitor were reported in the inward-facing state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Garaeva et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Garaeva et al., 2019</xref>). To gain insights into structural features that permit substrate recognition in an outward-facing state, using an antibody fragment as a fiducial marker we have solved the cryo-EM structures of the unliganded transporter and its complex with glutamine at 3.5 and 3.8 Å resolution, respectively.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>Our full-length SLC1A5 construct showed high expression and stability. (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). The presence of affinity tags used for purification did not affect the sodium-dependent glutamine uptake when HAP1 SLC1A5 knock-out cells were transiently transfected with full-length SLC1A5 but the observed transport activity was low, compared to the background. To assist structural determination, we generated its complex with a commercially available cKM4012 Fab fragment. It is reported that KM4012 antibody isolated through a cell-based screen inhibited glutamine-dependent cancer cell growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Suzuki et al., 2017</xref>). The purpose of the Fab was to serve as a fiducial marker for particle alignment. Negative-stain electron microscopy revealed that one molecule of Fab was bound to each protomer of a SLC1A5 homotrimer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). The three-fold symmetry was broken due to the dynamic nature of each Fab and protomer. Single-particle electron cryo-microscopy (cryo-EM) analysis without imposing any symmetry restraint resulted in a facile three-dimensional reconstruction at an overall resolution of 3.5 Å (Fourier shell correlation (FSC) = 0.143 criterion; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>). The highly flexible Fab fragments were masked out to maximize the structural quality of SLC1A5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplements 2</xref>,<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">3</xref>).

In the inward-facing state (PDB: 6GCT), this 1.5 turn α-helix in ECL3 merges into TM6 which extends the length of TM6 by about 9.5 Å (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2a,c</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Garaeva et al., 2018</xref>).

Simultaneously, to compensate the movement of the transport domain and the conformational changes of TM6, the N-terminus of TM3 unwinds by approximately 1.5 turns and extends the TM2-3 loop in the cytoplasmic space (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2b–c</xref>).

The structurally symmetrical TM3 and TM6 serve as a platform which holds the core region of the transport domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2c</xref>).

The density was sufficient to dock the L-Gln molecule (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3a</xref>). The Gln binding pocket is formed by two oppositely oriented reentrant loops (HP1 and HP2), TM7 and TM8 of the transport domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3a–b</xref>). The HP2 loop in the unliganded structure is in an open conformation providing a direct access to the binding site. Upon Gln binding, HP2 loop acts as a gatekeeper and comes close to the serine-rich HP1 loop to shield the substrate from the extracellular surface (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3a</xref>). Furthermore, the substrate binding interaction is maintained between the two states of SLC1A5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3c</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Garaeva et al., 2018</xref>). Both α-amino and α-carboxylate groups of the substrate appear to be anchored by the carbonyl backbone of Ser351, the amide backbone and the sidechain of Ser353 in the HP1 loop and can be further stabilized by sidechains of Asp464 and Asn471 in TM8 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3b</xref>). Importantly, the Nε2 of the substrate, L-Gln, is within hydrogen bond distance to the sidechain of Asp464 in TM8.

Mutation of Cys467 to Ala in SLC1A5 showed significant increase in K<sub>m</sub> for Gln (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Scalise et al., 2018</xref>). The corresponding residue in all glutamate transporters of the SLC1 family is a conserved bulkier Arg residue (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s5">Figure 1—figure supplement 5</xref>). In SLC1A3, the Arg residue with its guanidinium group forms a hydrogen bond with the carboxylate group of the substrate Asp, and a favorable cation-π interaction with a Tyr residue (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3d</xref>). As a result of the smaller amino acid at this location, SLC1A5 has an additional side cavity involving Phe393, Val436, Ala433, Val463 and Asp464, whereas no such cavity is present in SLC1A3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3b,d</xref>). Besides the difference in the pocket size and shape, Arg in place of the Cys will lead to steric clashes with the Gln substrate in SLC1A5. The critical role of the Cys467 in SLC1A5 for substrate specificity was further supported by an equivalent mutation of threonine in SLC1A4 (Thr459) to a cysteine, resulting in alteration to L-Gln binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Scopelliti et al., 2018</xref>) and inhibition by Cys modifying reagents in proteoliposome assays (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Pingitore et al., 2013</xref>). Since the structure of SLC1A4 is unknown, we attempted to generate a model for SLC1A4 by replacing Cys with a threonine. Unfortunately, none of the three rotamers available for threonine can be satisfactorily accommodated because of steric clashes with backbone carbonyl atoms. This suggests that SLC1A4 must have a slightly different local conformation around the substrate binding site. Regardless of the local conformation that SLC1A4 adopts in this region, the side chain hydroxyl group of Thr459 (analogous to Cys467 in SLC1A5) is unlikely to form a productive hydrogen bonding interaction with the glutamine substrate and this could explain why the former transports only fewer amino acids. Ala390, a conserved residue in neutral amino acid transporters, SLC1A4 and SLC1A5, does not form any contact with the Gln substrate and could tolerate small neutral amino acid substrates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3b</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s5">Figure 1—figure supplement 5</xref>).

Based on the shape of the density and the presence of cholesteryl hemisuccinate (CHS) during purification, we assigned this density to CHS. Using an unbiased lipidomics approach, CHS was detected as a major component in the sample used for cryo-EM. The identity of CHS was further confirmed by mass spectrometry using commercially available CHS as a reference (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>).</p><p>The cryo-EM density supports a specific binding site for CHS in the outward-facing SLC1A5 conformation. Electron density suggests that CHS binds inside a hydrophobic pocket formed by TM3, TM4a, TM4c and TM7 from one protomer, as well as TM5 from the adjacent protomer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplements 2</xref>,<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">3</xref>). The putative lipid density was also observed in the inward-facing state of SLC1A5, located in a hydrophobic pocket formed by TM3, TM4a, TM4c, and HP2a from one protomer, and TM5 from the adjacent protomer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Garaeva et al., 2018</xref>). Docking a CHS molecule in this putative density shows that the corresponding location is similar to that of the outward-facing state despite different pocket shape between two conformational states (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>). Remarkably, the specific CHS-binding site in SLC1A5 overlaps with the UCPH<sub>101</sub> allosteric binding site reported in SLC1A3 structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Canul-Tec et al., 2017</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s4">Figure 3—figure supplement 4</xref>). The highly lipophilic UCPH<sub>101</sub> binds in the outward-facing conformation and blocks the movement of the transport domain relative to the scaffold domain. Additional putative lipid density was reported previously in the inward-facing state of SLC1A5, located between the transport and scaffold domains within the same protomer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Garaeva et al., 2018</xref>).

Our cryo-EM structures of unbound and substrate-bound SLC1A5 revealed that HP2 is the extracellular gate that controls entry of the substrate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Boudker et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Canul-Tec et al., 2017</xref>). As a gatekeeper, HP2 in the closed conformation is near the serine-rich HP1, shielding the substrate from the extracellular surface (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3a</xref>). The structure of the unliganded form of SLC1A5 provides an example for the HP2 loop in an open conformation and serves as a useful starting model for designing competitive inhibitors such as TBOA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Boudker et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Colas et al., 2015</xref>). The opening of the HP2 loop increases the accessible surface area, exposing a previously unidentified cryptic pocket which could accommodate a large inhibitor that could specifically target the open conformation. In contrast, the closed conformation of HP2 has a small binding site, limiting the size of the inhibitors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Colas et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Singh et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>The availability of the three-dimensional structure of SLC1A5 in its outward-facing conformation open several paths forward for the development of drugs. The structure could be used for example identification of chemical leads by virtual screening methods. Secondly, generating additional structures with lead molecules based on substrate-analogs could provide a strong structure-based drug design platform for medicinal chemistry optimization of compound potencies. One important aspect of drug discovery is the need to engineer selectivity of lead compounds for the specific target in a given family. This is especially true for modulators of SLC1A5 where dialing out off-target activities against other closely-related sub-family members is highly desirable. Historically, this has been an area of strength for structure-based design. Structures have also been incredibly useful for optimization of ADME properties of compounds which is a critical element in the overall drug discovery process.

These structures are an early example of the value that cryo-EM may bring to structure-based drug design.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th>Reagent type (species) <break/>or resource</th><th>Designation</th><th>Source or <break/>reference</th><th>Identifiers</th><th>Additional <break/>information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td valign="top">Antibody</td><td valign="top">Mouse monoclonal Anti-SLC1A5</td><td valign="top">Creative Biolabs Inc</td><td valign="top">TAB-1010CLV</td><td>1 ml, 1 mg/ml</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Strain, strain background (<italic>Homo sapiens</italic>)</td><td valign="top">HEK293S GnTI<sup>-</sup> cells</td><td valign="top">ATCC</td><td valign="top">CRL-3022 <break/>RRID: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/CVCL_A785">CVCL_A785</ext-link></td><td/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Recombinant DNA reagent</td><td valign="top">pcDNA3.1<sup>+</sup></td><td valign="top">Life Technologies</td><td valign="top">V79020</td><td/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Chemical compound, drug</td><td valign="top">Opti-MEM reduced serum media</td><td valign="top">Life Technologies</td><td valign="top">31985062</td><td/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Strain, strain background (<italic>Homo sapiens</italic>)</td><td valign="top">HAP1 SLC1A5 knock out cells</td><td valign="top">Horizon Discovery</td><td valign="top">HZGHC005452c002</td><td/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Chemical compound, drug</td><td valign="top">Iscove’s modified Dulbecco’s medium</td><td valign="top">Gibco</td><td valign="top">12440</td><td/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Chemical compound, drug</td><td valign="top">Cell dissociation buffer</td><td valign="top">Gibco</td><td valign="top">13151</td><td/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Chemical compound, drug</td><td valign="top">Fetal bovine serum</td><td valign="top">Gibco</td><td valign="top">16000044</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Software, algorithm</td><td>MotionCorr2 1.1.0</td><td><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Zheng et al., 2017</xref></td><td><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://msg.ucsf.edu/em/software/motioncor2.html">http://msg.ucsf.edu/em/software/motioncor2.html</ext-link></td><td/></tr><tr><td>Software, algorithm</td><td>Relion v 2.0</td><td><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Kimanius et al., 2016</xref></td><td><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www2.mrc-lmb.cam.ac.uk/relion/">https://www2.mrc-lmb.cam.ac.uk/relion/</ext-link></td><td/></tr><tr><td>Software, algorithm</td><td>Phenix 1.14</td><td><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Adams et al., 2010</xref></td><td><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://phenix-online.org/">http://phenix-online.org/</ext-link></td><td/></tr><tr><td>Software, algorithm</td><td>Coot 0.8.9.1</td><td><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Emsley and Cowtan, 2004</xref></td><td><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www2.mrc-lmb.cam.ac.uk/personal/pemsley/coot/">https://www2.mrc-lmb.cam.ac.uk/personal/pemsley/coot/</ext-link></td><td/></tr><tr><td>Software, algorithm</td><td>Pymol 2.0</td><td>Schrodinger LLC</td><td><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://pymol.org/2/">https://pymol.org/2/</ext-link></td><td/></tr><tr><td>Software, algorithm</td><td>Chimera 1.12</td><td><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Pettersen et al., 2004</xref></td><td><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.cgl.ucsf.edu/chimera/">https://www.cgl.ucsf.edu/chimera/</ext-link></td><td/></tr><tr><td>Software, algorithm</td><td>Gctf</td><td><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Zhang, 2016</xref></td><td><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.mrc-lmb.cam.ac.uk/kzhang/">https://www.mrc-lmb.cam.ac.uk/kzhang/</ext-link></td><td/></tr><tr><td>Software, algorithm</td><td>cisTem</td><td><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Grant et al., 2018</xref></td><td><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://cistem.org/">https://cistem.org/</ext-link></td><td/></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap><sec id="s4-1"><title>Protein expression</title><p>The gene encoding SLC1A5 was cloned into pcDNA3.1<sup>+</sup> (Life Technologies) where it was fused to a C-terminal His10-Flag affinity double tag separated by TEV protease cleavage site.

SLC1A5KO cells were transiently transfected by static electroporation using a MaxCyte STX system. Viable cells (10<sup>6</sup> per mL) were transfected with 1.0 µg of pcDNA3.1 (empty vector) or with 1 µg of either pcDNA3.1-FL-SLC1A5 or pcDNA3.1-FL-SLC1A5-TEV-His-Flag using the OC-100 or OC-400 processing assembly (electroporation cell) and conditions specified by the vendor. Transfected cells were then cultured at 37°C in a humidified environment in 5% carbon dioxide. After 24 hr, transfected cells were removed flasks and frozen for later use. Glutamine uptake was determined by measuring the incorporation of radio-labeled glutamine into SLC1A5KO cells transfected with the indicated DNA.

In order to overcome an orientation bias, n-octyl-β -d-glucopyranoside (BOG, Anatrace) was added to the sample prior freezing. Cryo grids were loaded into a Titan Krios transmission electron microscope (ThermoFisher Scientific) operating at 300 keV with a Gatan K2 Summit direct electron detector. Images were recorded with SerialEM in super-resolution mode with a super resolution pixel size of 0.543 Å and a defocus range of 1.2 to 2.5 μm. Data were collected with a dose rate of 5 electrons per physical pixel per second, and images were recorded with a 10 s exposure and 250 ms subframes (40 total frames) corresponding to a total dose of 42 electrons per Å<sup>2</sup>.

A total of 743,525 particles were then extracted using Relion 2.0 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Scheres and Chen, 2012</xref>) with a box size of 224 pixels. The 2D, 3D classification and refinement were performed with Relion 2.0.

After selecting particle coordinates, per-particle CTF estimation was refined using the program Gctf (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Zhang, 2016</xref>). One set of 170,751 particles was then submitted to 3D auto-refinement. All 3D classifications and 3D refinements were started from a 60 Å low-pass filtered version of an ab initio map generated with VIPER (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Penczek et al., 1994</xref>). The particles were re-centered using the refined particle offsets before being re-extracted, followed by parameter conversion and final Auto_Refine in cisTEM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Grant et al., 2018</xref>). Auto_Refine in cisTEM, using a soft binary mask that removed the micelle and Fab regions, yielded the final reconstruction at 3.5 Å global resolution, improving the resolution by ∼0.3 Å. The global resolution was evaluated using conventional Fourier Shell Correlation analysis. Prior to visualization, all density maps were sharpened by applying different negative temperature factors (−15,–30, and −50 Å<sup>2</sup>) using automated procedures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Rosenthal and Henderson, 2003</xref>), along with the half maps, were used for model building.

Fab signals subtraction followed by refinements with/without C3 symmetry operation did not improve the resolutions for both the SLC1A5-cKM4012 (Fab) and SLC1A5-cKM4012 (Fab)_Gln complexes. The reason could be the Fab-bound SLC1A5 is perhaps pseudo-3 fold symmetric. The presence of the Fab disrupts the low-resolution pseudo-symmetry and facilitates particle alignment. However, the flexibility of the Fabs harms the high-resolution reconstruction at the SLC1A5 trimer regions. A soft binary mask was applied to the SLC1A5 trimer region during the last several rounds of Auto_Refine in cisTEM to improve the local resolution.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Model building and refinement </title><p>The initial template of the human SLC1A5 was derived from a homology-based model calculated by SWISS-MODEL (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Arnold et al., 2006</xref>).

We have addressed each of their concerns to the best of our ability as described below. We have rewritten the article as a more concise Short Report that focuses on the substrate and CHS binding sites and we have removed the HDX data as requested by the editor.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>The following are the points that should be considered when improving the physiological context of the structure in the revised manuscript:</p><p>1) Based on the structures, is it clear why ASCT2 and ASCT1 have different substrate specificity?</p></disp-quote><p>Careful comparison of the sequences of ASCT1 and ASCT2 around the substrate binding site show that the most significant difference is at position 467 – ASCT1 has a threonine at this position while ASCT2 has a cysteine. The side chain sulfhydryl group of Cys 467 in ASCT2 appears to form a hydrogen bond with the side chain of glutamine in our structure. Since the structure of ASCT1 is unknown, we attempted to generate a model for ASCT1 by replacing Cys with a threonine. Unfortunately, none of the three rotamers available for threonine can be satisfactorily accommodated because of steric clashes with backbone carbonyl atoms. This suggests that ASCT1 must have a slightly different local conformation around the substrate binding site. Regardless of the local conformation that ASCT1 adopts in this region, the side chain hydroxyl group of Thr459 (analogous to Cys467 in ASCT2) is unlikely to form a productive hydrogen bonding interaction with the glutamine substrate and this could explain why the former transports only fewer amino acids. We have incorporated this description into our revised manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) From the drug design perspective please provide more specific comments on the potential applications of the structure for the development of drugs.</p></disp-quote><p>SLC1A5 is a high value target in the pharmaceutical industry for the development of drugs for immunomodulatory drugs. The availability of the three-dimensional structure of SLC1A5 in its outward facing conformation open several paths forward for the development of drugs. (1) The structure could be used for identification of chemical leads by virtual screening methods. (2) Secondly, generating additional structures with lead molecules based on substrate-analogs could provide a strong structure-based drug design platform for medicinal chemistry optimization of compound potencies. (3) One important aspect of drug discovery is the need to engineer selectivity of lead compounds for the specific target in a given subfamily. This is especially true for modulators of SLC1A5 where dialing out off-target activities against other closely-related sub-family members is highly desirable. Historically, this has been an area of strength for structure-based design. (4) Structures have also been incredibly useful for optimization of ADME properties of compounds which is a critical element in the overall drug discovery process. (5) We believe the most relevant conformation to target for SLC1A5 inhibitors is the outward-facing conformation that we have described in our current work as that is the most relevant conformation for ligands from extracellular space. We have revised the manuscript to incorporate the above section.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) It is not clear whether the protein imaged without L-Gln was in high Na<sup>+</sup> concentration. If yes, then the structure likely represents a Na<sup>+</sup>-bound transporter, which should be evident from the arrangement of the Na<sup>+</sup>-binding residues. If not, or if the affinity for Na<sup>+</sup> is low, then one would expect to find disrupted Na<sup>+</sup> binding sites, which again should be visible in the structure.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree this is an important question to address. All protein samples in this work were imaged in presence of 100 mM NaCl. Thus, we do believe our apo structure represents Na-bound state of the transporter. We have revised the Materials and methods section to clearly state this. Given the moderate resolution of the structure and the lack of density for sodium and nearby side chains, we are unable to make a categorical statement regarding this. Future structures of ASCTs at different sodium concentrations and at higher resolution could help to clarify the precise role sodium plays in conformational switching.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) ASCTs are obligate Na<sup>+</sup>-dependent exchangers, while EAATs are concentrative pumps. Could it be rationalized from the structures, why ASCT2 cannot return to the outward-facing states without the bound amino acid and Na<sup>+</sup> ions?</p></disp-quote><p>This is also a very interesting question, but difficult to assess due to the fact that sodium ion is not visible in our structure and we do not have a structure in its absence. It is highly likely that significant conformational changes accompanies binding of sodium ions. Based on our structures in the presence and absence of glutamine, we do know that the presence of substrate does not impede the movement of HP2 loop. It is possible that higher resolution structures with and without both Na<sup>+</sup> and Gln bound may shed light on this mechanism.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) Mutations have been made in GltPh mimicking ASCT2 (including R to C mutation), but when the structure was solved with Gln, the HP2 loop was still open. Can it be rationalized from the current structure what is the difference between the binding pockets and/or HP2 between ACST2 and GltPh that allows larger substrates (even when R is mutated to C)?</p></disp-quote><p>We believe the editor is referring to the work of Scopelliti et al., 2018, which describes the structures of GltPH (R397C) bound to serine, cysteine or benzylCys. However, there is no Gln-bound structure of GltPh (WT or R397C mutant) that has been reported. In the Cys-bound GltPh-R397C structure, the HP2 loop adopts a “closed” conformation. Similarly, the HP2 loop is closed in one of the protomers in the Ser-bound GltPh structure, However, electron density suggests open conformations for the other two protomers but they were not modeled due to limited resolution. Therefore, it would be difficult to assess/compare structures of ASCT2 and GltPh with bound glutamine or comment on the precise conformation of the HP2 loop.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) The manuscript methodically indexes many structural features including protomer interactions, helix orientations, key amino acid positions, glycosylation sites, glutamine and CHS binding sites, etc. However, this style is primarily descriptive, so if the authors intend to retain these details, they should to be enhanced with a clearer narrative explaining the significance of the structural findings. Below are three examples.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank reviewers for pointing out the description of structural features. Some of them have been streamlined or removed to fit the “short report” style and focus on the significance of the structural findings.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The authors point out that &quot;based on sequence alignment, both SLC1A4 and SLC1A5 have the longest ECL2a region compared to other SLC1 family members including prokaryotic homologues.&quot; What is the significance of this?</p></disp-quote><p>As there is no significance, we have removed the sentence.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Similarly, the authors write: &quot;Importantly, the ECL2b was reported to play a critical role in determining the receptor properties of SLC1A5 for retroviruses.&quot; Can the structure help rationalize this previous report?</p></disp-quote><p>As the structure doesn’t rationalize, we have removed.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The authors write: &quot;Similarly, Arg376 of the transport domain has a potential to form a salt bridge with the Glu264 of scaffold domain in the outward-facing structure (Figure 3B-C).

It is reported that KM4012 antibody was isolated through a cell-based screen and inhibited glutamine-dependent cancer cell growth (Suzuki et al). The antibodies suppressed glutamine-dependent growth of WiDr colorectal cancer cells, which require glutamine in the culture medium to grow.</p><p>In this revised version we added a sentence “It is reported that KM4012 antibody isolated through a cell based screen inhibited glutamine-dependent cancer cell growth. (Suzuki et al)” for further clarification.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) The characterization of the transport properties of ASCT2 are based on a single concentration of substrate, which generates a signal to noise ratio of 2.

It would be preferable to have a measure of substrate affinity, and also demonstration of the exchange properties of the transporter, which would reflect previous studies measuring the functional properties of ASCT2.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for pointing out the weak signal to noise ratio. The level of glutamine transport measured with our SLC1A5 PL assay system was ~6 times lower than the level reported by Pingatore et al. and by Graraeva et al. While Pingatore et al. reported that SLC1A5 in their proteoliposomes (PL) was 100% in the correct orientation (i.e. an orientation needed to measure glutamine uptake PL) only 20-25% of the SLC1A5 in our PL was in that same correct orientation (determined by the availability of an affinity tag in relation to PL surface (data not shown). This could be due to differences in the expression systems that were used by the two different labs. Both Pingatore et al. and Graraeva et al. used a yeast expression system, but our expression system used the mammalian HEK293 cell line. These differences could account for weaker signal we observed in our assay.</p><p>In lieu of further PL experiments, we demonstrate that when expressed in cells, the affinity-tagged SLC1A5 used in this study produced a level of glutamine uptake that was comparable to untagged WT SLC1A5, thus suggesting that the presence of the affinity-tags did not alter the biological activity of SLC1A5. To make it more evident that the glutamine transport activity of our tag-version of SLC1A5 is comparable to the wild type protein, we tested a broad range of glutamine concentration and both wild type and the tag version of SLC1A5 showed similar activity. This is depicted in the revised Figure 1A.</p><p>We have also explored biophysical studies using SPR but were unsuccessful due to technical challenges with the detergent solubilized protein reagent.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) How significant are the deviations form 3-fold symmetry between protomers? From the superpositions it looks like the deviations are truly minute. Is higher resolution obtained if 3C symmetry is imposed during 3D alignment and refinement? If yes, improved resolution may help analyzing the status of Na<sup>+</sup> binding sites.</p></disp-quote><p>From the Supplementary Figure 7 (initial submission) on the superposition of each protomer, the results revealed that three protomers from the outward-facing SLC1A5 trimers share similar global fold but are not positioned symmetrically in space. Even though the deviations are truly minute, the fab-bound SLC1A5 trimers adopt the pseudo C3 symmetry and imposing C3 operation during the refinement did not improve the resolution further. The reason could be the presence of the Fab disrupts the low-resolution pseudosymmetry. We further experimented with Fab signals subtraction followed by refinements with/without C3 symmetry operation and the efforts did not improve. the resolution for the SLC1A5-cKM4012 (Fab) structure or the SLC1A5-cKM4012 (Fab)_Gln complex. In the revised “Short Report” version, we removed this figure.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) Have the authors attempted to perform symmetry expansion to detect whether there is any heterogeneity in the protomers? Such heterogeneity might be masked even if C1 is used for processing.</p></disp-quote><p>Since the structures were reconstructed without any symmetry operations, no symmetry expansion was performed. From the 3D classification and the final reconstruction results, only the outward-facing state was observed. Minor heterogeneities were observed at the loop regions among the protomers.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) The HDX-MS data is analyzed only very superficially, and as it stands, the level of detail provided does not allow a thorough analysis of the data.
