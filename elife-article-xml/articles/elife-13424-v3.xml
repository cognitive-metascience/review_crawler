Structural changes in synaptic connectivity have been proposed as a substrate of memory storage. Here, we examine the impact of brief periods of sleep deprivation on dendritic structure. In mice, we find that five hours of sleep deprivation decreases dendritic spine numbers selectively in hippocampal area CA1 and increased activity of the filamentous actin severing protein cofilin. Recovery sleep normalizes these structural alterations. Suppression of cofilin function prevents spine loss, deficits in hippocampal synaptic plasticity, and impairments in long-term memory caused by sleep deprivation. The elevated cofilin activity is caused by cAMP-degrading phosphodiesterase-4A5 (PDE4A5), which hampers cAMP-PKA-LIMK signaling. Attenuating PDE4A5 function prevents changes in cAMP-PKA-LIMK-cofilin signaling and cognitive deficits associated with sleep deprivation. Our work demonstrates the necessity of an intact cAMP-PDE4-PKA-LIMK-cofilin activation-signaling pathway for sleep deprivation-induced memory disruption and reduction in hippocampal spine density.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.13424.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.13424.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.13424.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>The demands of modern society means that millions of people do not get sufficient sleep on a daily basis. Sleep deprivation, even if only for brief periods, can impair learning and memory. In many cases, this impairment appears to be related to changes in the activity of a brain region called the hippocampus. However, the exact processes responsible for producing the effects of sleep deprivation remain unclear.</p><p>During learning or forming a new memory, the connections between the relevant neurons in the brain change. Havekes et al. found that depriving mice of sleep for just five hours dramatically reduced the connectivity between neurons in the hippocampus. This reduction is caused by the increased activity of cofilin, a protein that breaks down the actin filaments that shape the connections between neurons.</p><p>Havekes et al. then used a virus to introduce an inactive version of cofilin into hippocampal neurons to suppress the activity of the naturally present cofilin. This manipulation prevented both the loss of the connections between neurons and the memory deficits normally associated with sleep deprivation. Havekes et al. also found that recovery sleep leads to the re-wiring of neurons in the hippocampus. Future studies are now needed to determine how the neurons are able to re-wire themselves during recovery sleep.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi"

ubiquitous phenomenon and most species, including humans, spend a significant time asleep. Although the function of sleep remains unknown, it is widely acknowledged that sleep is crucial for proper brain function. Indeed, learning and memory, particularly those types mediated by the hippocampus, are promoted by sleep and disrupted by sleep deprivation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Havekes et al., 2012a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abel et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Whitney and Hinson, 2010</xref>). Despite the general consensus that sleep deprivation impairs hippocampal function, the molecular signaling complexes and cellular circuits by which sleep deprivation leads to cognitive deficits remain to be defined.</p><p>The alternation of wakefulness and sleep has a profound impact on synaptic function, with changes observed in synaptic plasticity and transmission (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Havekes et al., 2012a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abel et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Tononi and Cirelli, 2014</xref>). This relationship has led to the development of influential theories on the function of sleep (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Tononi and Cirelli, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Pavlides and Winson, 1989</xref>). Recent imaging suggests that dendritic structure is dynamic, especially during development, with alterations in spine numbers correlating with changes in sleep/wake state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Maret et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Yang and Gan, 2012</xref>). However, the impact of sleep deprivation or sleep on synaptic structure in the hippocampus in the context of memory storage or synaptic plasticity has not been examined. This is an important issue, as such structural changes in ensembles of synapses have been shown to play a critical role in memory storage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Caroni et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Vogel-Ciernia et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>The formation of associative memories increases the number of dendritic spines in area CA1 of the hippocampus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Leuner et al., 2003</xref>). Also, the induction of long-term potentiation (LTP), a cellular correlate of memory storage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Mayford et al., 2012</xref>), is associated with an increase in spine density in cultured hippocampal neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Oe et al., 2013</xref>). In addition to a critical function during development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Gurniak et al., 2005</xref>), cofilin plays an essential role in synapse structure by mediating both the enlargement and pruning of dendritic spines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Rust, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bamburg, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bosch et al., 2014</xref>). The activity of cofilin is negatively regulated by phosphorylation. Specifically, phosphorylation of serine 3 of cofilin suppresses its depolymerizing and F-actin severing activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bamburg, 1999</xref>). Importantly, increased cofilin activity can lead to the depolymerization and severing of F-actin, which in turn results in the shrinkage and loss of spines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Rust, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Zhou et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Davis et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Shankar et al., 2007</xref>). Hippocampal cofilin phosphorylation levels are increased after the induction of long-term potentiation (LTP) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Rex et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chen et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Briz et al., 2015</xref>), and during memory consolidation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Fedulov et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Suzuki et al., 2011</xref>). Additionally, elevated cofilin activity in the hippocampus was recently implicated in abnormal spine structure and function in mutant mice with altered chromatin remodeling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Vogel-Ciernia et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>Here we show for the first time that 5 hr of sleep deprivation leads to the loss of dendritic spines of CA1, but not CA3, neurons in the dorsal hippocampus. The spine loss in CA1 neurons was accompanied by reductions in dendrite length. This process was readily reversed by sleep, with just 3 hr of recovery sleep normalizing this spine loss and dendrite length. The molecular mechanisms underlying these negative effects of sleep deprivation were shown to target cofilin, whose elevated activity could contribute to spine loss. Indeed, suppression of cofilin activity in hippocampal neurons prevented the structural, biochemical, and electrophysiological changes as well as the cognitive impairments associated with sleep loss. The elevated cofilin activity is caused by the activity of the cAMP degrading phosphodiesterase-4A5 isoform (PDE4A5), which suppresses activity of the cAMP-PKA-LIMK pathway. Genetic inhibition of the PDE4A5 isoform in hippocampal neurons restores LIMK and cofilin phosphorylation levels and prevents the cognitive impairments associated with sleep loss. Thus changes in the cAMP-PDE4-PKA-LIMK-cofilin signaling pathway in the adult hippocampus underlie the cognitive deficits associated with sleep loss. These observations provide a molecular model for the notion that prolonged wakefulness reduces structural signaling and negatively impacts dendritic structure, which is then restored with sleep.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Sleep deprivation causes a robust reduction in apical and basal CA1 spine numbers and dendrite length</title><p>To determine whether short periods of sleep loss affect dendritic structure in the hippocampus, we used Golgi staining to examine the length of dendrites and number of dendritic spines in the mouse hippocampus following 5 hr of sleep deprivation, a period of sleep loss that is known to impair selectively hippocampus-dependent memory consolidation and synaptic plasticity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Havekes et al., 2012a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abel et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Graves et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Vecsey et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Havekes et al., 2014</xref>).

Mice virally expressing eGFP or cofilin<sup>S3A</sup> were trained in the object-place memory task 3 weeks after viral infection and tested 24 hr after training.

Cofilin activity is known to be suppressed by the PKA-LIMK signaling pathway through the LIMK-mediated phosphorylation of cofilin at Ser-3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Lamprecht R, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Nadella et al., 2009</xref>). We hypothesized that the elevation in PDE4A5 activity, associated with sleep loss, could negatively impact the cAMP-PKA-LIMK signaling pathway by enhancing cAMP degradation, thereby leading to increased cofilin activity. Based on this hypothesis, we also anticipated that blocking PDE4A5 function in hippocampal neurons would make the cAMP-PKA-LIMK pathway, which controls cofilin activity, resistant to the effects of sleep deprivation. To test this hypothesis, we engineered a catalytically inactive form of PDE4A5 (referred to as PDE4A5<sup>catnull</sup>) in which an aspartate group located deep within the cAMP binding pocket of PDE4A5 (PDE4A5<sup>D577A</sup>), that is critical for catalytic activity, is replaced with an alanine group (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Baillie et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">McCahill et al., 2005</xref>). Expression of PDE4A5<sup>catnull</sup> outcompetes the low levels of active, endogenous PDE4A5 from PDE4A5-containing signalosome complexes that specifically sequester it (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Houslay, 2010</xref>), thereby preventing the breakdown of cAMP in the vicinity of those complexes. We used the viral approach (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Havekes et al., 2014</xref>) to express PDE4A5<sup>catnull</sup> selectively in hippocampal neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A,B</xref>). Four weeks after viral injections, expression of PDE4A5<sup>catnull</sup> was observed in all major hippocampal subregions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C–E</xref>), and expression was excluded from astrocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F–H</xref>). Expression of PDE4A5<sup>catnull</sup> did not alter PDE4 activity in the hippocampus, prefrontal cortex or cerebellum (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1A–C</xref>). Next, we sleep deprived mice for 5 hr and assessed whether the phosphorylation of LIMK and cofilin was altered in the hippocampus. In agreement with our hypothesis, we observed that 5 hr of sleep deprivation reduced both LIMK and cofilin phosphorylation in hippocampal lysates from eGFP mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5I,J</xref>). PDE4A5<sup>catnull</sup> expression prevented the sleep deprivation-induced decreases in LIMK and cofilin phosphorylation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5I,J</xref>). While expression of PDE4A5<sup>catnull</sup> fully restored the pcofilin/cofilin ratio in the hippocampus of sleep deprived mice to the levels observed under non-sleep deprivation conditions, it should be noted that phosphatases such as slingshot (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Sarmiere and Bamburg, 2004</xref>) may also contribute to the reduction in cofilin phosphorylation levels under conditions of sleep deprivation. Three hours of recovery sleep was sufficient to restore both LIMK and cofilin phosphorylation levels in the hippocampus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5K,L</xref>). The latter observation is in line with our previous observations that a few hours of recovery sleep is sufficient to restore hippocampal synaptic plasticity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Vecsey et al., 2009</xref>).<fig-group><fig id="fig5" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.13424.018</object-id><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><title>Expression of catalytically inactive PDE4A5 in hippocampal neurons prevents memory deficits and alterations in the cAMP-PKA-LIMK-cofilin signaling pathway associated with sleep deprivation.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Mice were injected with pAAV<sub>9</sub>-CaMKIIα0.4-eGFP or pAAV<sub>9</sub>-CaMKIIα0.4-PDE4A5<sup>catnull</sup>-VSV into the hippocampus to drive neuronal expression of eGFP or catalytically inactive full-length PDE4A5 (PDE4A5<sup>catnull</sup>).

Mice expressing eGFP showed a clear preference for the displaced object 24 hr after training, which was lost in animals that were deprived of sleep for 5 hr immediately after training (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5M</xref>). In contrast, mice expressing PDE4A5<sup>catnull</sup> showed a strong preference for the displaced object despite sleep deprivation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5M</xref>). The memory rescue was not a result of altered exploratory behavior during training in the object-place recognition task (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1D</xref>). Furthermore, PDE4A5<sup>catnull</sup> expression did not alter anxiety levels and exploratory behavior in the open field (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1E</xref>).</p><p>Although the catalytic unit of the 25 distinct PDE4 isoforms is highly conserved, each has a unique N-terminal localization sequence that directs isoform targeting to a specific and unique set of protein complexes (signalosomes) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Houslay, 2010</xref>). This allows for a highly orchestrated sequestering of cAMP signaling in specific intracellular domains rather than a general, global degradation of cAMP throughout the cell (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Houslay, 2010</xref>). We therefore aimed to determine whether the rescue of memory impairments by expression of PDE4A5<sup>catnull</sup> requires the unique N-terminal domain of PDE4A5. To answer this question, we engineered a truncated version of PDE4A5<sup>catnull</sup> that lacks the first 303 base pairs encoding the isoform unique N-terminal domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bolger et al., 2003</xref>) (referred to as PDE4A5<sup>catnullΔ4</sup>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1F</xref>) and expressed this mutant in excitatory neurons in the hippocampus using a viral approach. As this species has no targeting N-terminus then, unlike the full length inactive PDE4A5 that displaces endogenous active PDE4A5 from its functionally relevant location in the cell and thereby increase cAMP levels localized to the sequestering signaling complex, this engineered 5’ truncated complex would simply lead to the expression of an inactive PDE4A catalytic unit unable to be targeted like the native enzyme and so unable to exert an effect on localized cAMP degradation in the functionally relevant compartment.</p><p>Western blot analyses of hippocampal tissue 4 weeks after viral injection confirmed the presence of the truncated PDE4A5<sup>catnullΔ4</sup> at the protein level using an antibody that detects all PDE4A isoforms and an antibody against the HA-tag (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1F,G</xref>). With a behaviorally naïve cohort of mice now expressing eGFP or PDE4A5<sup>catnullΔ4</sup> we repeated the object-place recognition task. Brief sleep deprivation after training in the object-place recognition task resulted in a loss of preference for the displaced object in mice expressing PDE4A5<sup>catnullΔ4</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1I</xref>). The inability of PDE4A5<sup>catnullΔ4</sup> to prevent the memory deficit caused by sleep deprivation was not a consequence of altered exploration levels during training (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1H</xref>). This finding indicates that the memory rescue in the previous experiment was a result of the full length PDE4A5<sup>catnull</sup> being sequestered to specific signalosomes through the isoform-unique N-terminal region rather than a consequence of PDE4A5<sup>catnull</sup> being unable totarget the functionally relevant complexes sequestering full length PDE4A5. It also indicates that displacing sequestered, active endogenous PDE4A5 in hippocampal excitatory neurons is sufficient to prevent memory deficits induced by 5 hr of sleep deprivation. Overall, these data suggest that sleep deprivation negatively impacts spine numbers by targeting the PKA-LIMK-cofilin pathway through the alterations in activity of PDE4A5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>).<fig id="fig6" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.13424.022</object-id><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><title>The impact of sleep deprivation on hippocampal spine dynamics.</title><p>Sleep deprivation increases PDE4A5 protein levels that cause a reduction in cAMP levels and attenuation of the PKA-LIMK signaling pathway, which results in a reduction in the phosphorylation of cofilin.

Here, we use in vivo rescue experiments to define a critical molecular mechanism by which brief sleep deprivation leads to cognitive impairments. First, we show that sleep deprivation dramatically reduces spine number and dendrite length of hippocampal CA1 neurons without affecting dendritic structure of CA3 neurons. Second, we demonstrate that sleep deprivation increases cofilin activity in the hippocampus, but not the prefrontal cortex, which is a likely explanation for the reductions in CA1 spine numbers and dendrite length. Third, we find that three hours of recovery sleep restores spine number, dendrite length and cofilin phosphorylation levels to those observed in non-sleep deprived mice. Fourth, we show that suppression of cofilin activity in hippocampal excitatory neurons is sufficient to prevent sleep-deprivation-induced decreases in dendritic spines number, LTP impairments, and memory. Fifth, we demonstrate that hippocampal expression of constitutively active cofilin is sufficient to cause long-term memory deficits but not LTP impairments. Sixth, we find that suppression of PDE4A5 function through overexpression of a catalytically inactive mutant version of PDE4A5 changes LIMK and cofilin phosphorylation levels caused by sleep deprivation. Finally, we show that hippocampal suppression of PDE4A5 function prevents the negative impact of sleep deprivation on memory consolidation. Thus, our studies demonstrate that changes in the cAMP/PKA/LIMK/cofilin pathway are necessary to cause memory deficits under conditions of sleep deprivation.</p><p>In light of the fact that elevated cofilin activity can lead to spine shrinkage and spine loss (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Zhou et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Pontrello et al., 2012</xref>), our genetic manipulations of cofilin and PDE4A5 signaling independently link impairments in synaptic plasticity and memory caused by brief sleep deprivation with the loss of dendritic spines in the hippocampus. Deficits in synaptic plasticity and memory both represent read outs of the impact of sleep deprivation on hippocampal function, but our work does not directly examine the direct relationship between synaptic plasticity and memory, a topic that has been the subject of extensive study and discussion in the literature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Lynch, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Sah et al., 2008</xref>). That care should be taken to directly relate LTP deficits with memory impairments is emphasized by our findings that expression of constitutively active cofilin is sufficient to cause memory deficits while it does not impact at least one form of L-LTP that is disrupted by sleep deprivation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Vecsey et al., 2009</xref>).</p><p>We observed a significant reduction in the total number of dendritic spines of excitatory CA1 neurons after 5 hr of sleep deprivation. This substantial decrease in dendritic spine number occurs rapidly and exceeds the fluctuations in hippocampal spine number observed across the estrus cycle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">González-Burgos et al., 2005</xref>), or the changes in spine number caused by stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">McLaughlin et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Shors et al., 2001</xref>). In contrast to sleep deprivation, acute stress results in an increase rather than a decrease in CA1 spine number in male rats (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Shors et al., 2001</xref>). Even 3 to 4 weeks of chronic stress or systemic delivery of corticosterone does not alter dendritic arborization of CA1 neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">McLaughlin et al., 2005</xref>). It is also unlikely that other factors associated with the procedure to keep animals awake rather than sleep deprivation per se causes the spine loss as our previous work indicated that applying the exact same amount of stimulation in the waking phase (<italic>i.e.</italic> the dark phase) does not lead to memory impairments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Hagewoud et al., 2010a</xref>).</p><p>In line with our finding of reductions in spines during sleep deprivation, work by Yang and colleagues revealed that sleep promotes dendritic spine formation in neurons activated by learning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Yang et al., 2014</xref>). Combined with our work, these experiments suggest that sleep deprivation disrupts learning-induced changes in spines that occur during sleep. Importantly, our structural studies reveal that spine loss is reversed by recovery sleep, consistent with this idea. Thus, our work reveals a distinct, selective, and rapid effect of brief periods of sleep loss on synaptic structure. It is noteworthy that even a short period of sleep deprivation acts to trigger such a dramatic effect on neuronal structure, which is reversed by recovery sleep.</p><p>Studies assessing the impact of sleep deprivation on electrophysiological properties of excitatory hippocampal neurons suggest that sleep deprivation negatively impacts long-lasting forms of LTP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Havekes et al., 2012a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abel et al., 2013</xref>). In this study and our previous work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Vecsey et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Prince et al., 2014</xref>), we showed that 5 hr of sleep deprivation attenuates long-lasting forms of LTP in the hippocampus. We observed that expression of an inactive mutant form of cofilin prevented the reductions in CA1 spine number, the impairment in a long-lasting form of LTP caused by sleep loss. It is interesting to note that three hours of recovery sleep not only restores spine numbers in CA1 neurons, but also hippocampal LIMK and cofilin phosphorylation levels. These findings complement our previous electrophysiological studies, in which we showed that such a short period of recovery sleep also restores deficits in LTP caused by 5 hr of sleep deprivation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Vecsey et al., 2009</xref>).</p><p>Our work reveals that PDE4A5 is a critical mediator of the impact of sleep deprivation on memory consolidation. Indeed, one reason why hippocampal area CA1 is specifically vulnerable to sleep deprivation may be the high level of PDE4A5 expression in this region (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">McPhee et al., 2001</xref>). Specific PDE4 isoforms are sequestered by distinct signalosome complexes that regulate localized cAMP signaling and impart functionally distinct roles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Houslay, 2010</xref>). Impairing the function of PDE4A5 signalosomes through expression of a full length catalytically inactive form of PDE4A5 exerts a dominant negative action, phenotypically identified here as preventing the alterations in LIMK and cofilin signaling caused by sleep deprivation. This makes memory consolidation resistant to the negative impact of sleep loss. Consistent with the notion that a key functional role of the isoform-unique N-terminal region of PDE4 isoforms is the targeting to signalosomes so as to exert functionally distinct actions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Houslay, 2010</xref>), the hippocampal expression of a catalytically in active version of PDE4A5 lacking the isoform unique N-terminal domain fails to rescue the cognitive deficits associated with sleep loss. The latter observation suggests that the isoform-specific N-terminal domain of PDE4A5 targets this specific PDE isoform to signalosomes that degrade cAMP in the vicinity of complexes that are particularly sensitive to sleep deprivation such as the complexes that contain LIMK and cofilin. Consistent with this, no such dominant negative phenotype is evident in a catalytically inactive PDE4A construct engineered to lack such an N-terminal targeting region.</p><p>Our data contradict the synaptic homeostasis hypothesis for sleep function. This hypothesis proposes that sleep functions to downscale synaptic strength that has increased as a result of neuronal activity and experiences during wakefulness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Tononi and Cirelli, 2006</xref>). This hypothesis has focused on explaining data from the cortex rather than the hippocampus, but one previously published study has suggested that the synaptic homeostasis hypothesis applies to the hippocampus as well (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Vyazovskiy et al., 2008</xref>). However, the hippocampus may be unique from the cortex as the hippocampus is involved in episodic memory and in much greater experience-dependent plasticity than anywhere else in the brain and thus our findings may not extend to other areas where synaptic plasticity is not as prominent. Further, the hippocampus also exhibits many distinct forms of synaptic plasticity. Here, we examine structural changes in hippocampal neurons and find that extended wakefulness leads to a loss of synaptic spines mediated by a signaling pathway involving cofilin. This suggests that prolonged wakefulness down-regulates synaptic connectivity in the hippocampus. As little as 3 hr of recovery sleep is sufficient to restore signaling through these complexes, suggesting that sleep functions to restore synaptic connectivity. Thus, the signaling pathways that mediate changes in dendritic structure are rapidly impaired by sleep loss and then can be quickly restored during recovery sleep.</p><p>Lack of sleep is a common problem in our 24/7 modern society and it has severe consequences for health, overall wellbeing, and brain function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bryant et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Harrison and Horne, 2000</xref>). Despite decades of research, the mechanisms by which sleep loss negatively impacts brain function have remained unknown. Our findings suggest that the cognitive impairments caused by brief sleep deprivation are a result of altered spine dynamics leading to a reduction in spine numbers. Our findings may also explain the reduction in hippocampal volume observed in an animal model of more chronic sleep restriction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Novati et al., 2011</xref>) and sleep disorders, such as primary insomnia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Riemann et al., 2007</xref>) as well as sleep apnea (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Morrell et al., 2003</xref>). Our work defining the molecular pathway through which sleep deprivation impacts memory consolidation underscores the importance of the plasticity of the neuronal cytoskeleton and reveals that rapid synaptic remodeling occurs with changes in behavioral state.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Subjects</title><p>Experimentally naïve C57BL/6J male mice (2–3 months of age; IMSR_JAX:000664) were obtained from Jackson laboratories at an age of 6 weeks and housed in groups of 4 with littermates on a 12 hr/12 hr light/dark schedule with lights on at 7 am (ZT0).

Sections were rinsed in PBS, blocked with 5% normal serum and incubated in PBS with 0.1% triton and 2% normal serum with either of the following antibodies or combinations of antibodies PDE4A5 (1:200, (27)), HA-tag (1:200, Roche, RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/AB_390918">AB_390918</ext-link>), VSV-G tag (1:2000, Abcam, RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/AB_302646">AB_302646</ext-link>), GFAP-alexa 488 (1:200, Invitrogen, RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/AB_143165">AB_143165</ext-link>) followed by the appropriate Alexa fluor-conjugated secondary antibodies (1:1000 Invitrogen, RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/AB_141459">AB_141459</ext-link>, RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/AB_10562718">AB_10562718</ext-link>, RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/AB_10564074">AB_10564074</ext-link>). Fluorescent images were analyzed using a Leica confocal microscope.</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>Diolistic staining</title><p>After sleep deprivation mice were injected (i.p) with a lethal dose of morbital and perfused with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS, 3 min at RT), followed by 1.5% PFA (20 min at RT). Brains were then removed and post-fixed in 1.5% PFA (40 min at RT). After post perfusion incubation in 1.5% PFA, each hemisphere was cut in 130 μm slices using a vibratome. Slices were collected to multiwell plates filled with PBS. After one hour incubation in room temperature, PBS was removed and slices were stained with a GeneGun (Biorad, pressure: 100–120 psi) using nylon filter (Merc Millipore, 10 μm, cat. No. NY1004700). DiI bullets were prepared as described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Seabold et al., 2010</xref>). After staining, slices were incubated over night at RT in PBS. The next day slices were incubated for one hour in 4% PFA and mounted with DapiFluoromount G (SouthernBiotech). Microphotographs of DiI stained apical dendrites in the stratum radiatum of CA1 area (approx. 100 µm from cell bodies) were performed in z-stacks using Zeiss LSM 780 (step 0.3 mm, objective 63x, digital magnifications 5x, resolution 1024 × 1024). Linear density (per mm of dendrite) and size of spines were counted using SpineMagick software. On average 155 spines were analyzed per an animal. Importantly, for the comparison of the spine numbers using golgi and diolistic staining methods we focused <italic>specifically</italic> on the second and third branch of the apical dendrites as the diolistic staining technique is suboptimal to label and analyze branches farther away from the soma.</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>Electrophysiology</title><p>Experiments were performed in the hippocampal Schaffer collateral pathway as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Vecsey et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Havekes et al., 2012b</xref>). Briefly, male mice injected with eGFP or cofilin<sup>S3D</sup> virus were sacrificed by cervical dislocation, and hippocampi were quickly collected in chilled, oxygenated aCSF containing 124 mM NaCl, 4.4 mM KCl, 1.3 mM MgSO<sub>4</sub> × 7H<sub>2</sub>O, 1 mM NaH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub> × H<sub>2</sub>O, 26.2 mM NaHCO<sub>3</sub>, 2.5 mM CaCl<sub>2 </sub>× 2H<sub>2</sub>O, and 10 mM D-glucose bubbled with 95% O<sub>2</sub> / 5% CO<sub>2</sub>. 400 μm thick transverse hippocampal slices were placed in an interface recording chamber at 28ºC (Fine Science Tools, Foster City, CA). Slices were equilibrated for at least 2 hr in aCSF (pH 7.4). The stimulus strength was set to elicit 40% of the maximum field excitatory postsynaptic potential (fEPSP) amplitude. The average of the baseline initial fEPSP slope values over the first 20 min was used to normalize each initial fEPSP slope.</p></sec><sec id="s4-10"><title>Golgi analyses</title><p>Brains were impregnated using the Rapid Golgi stain kit (FD Neurotechnologies Inc) according to the instructions. Coronal sections (80-<italic>um</italic> thickness) that covered the rostro-caudal axis of CA1 of the hippocampus were analyzed. The serial sections were then chosen and analyzed using a stereology-based software (Neurolucida, v10, Microbrightfield, VT), and Zeiss Axioplan 2 image microscope with Optronics MicroFire CCD camera (1600 × 1200) digital camera, motorized X, Y, and Z-focus for high-resolution image acquisition and digital quantitation in combination with a 100x objective using a sophisticated and well established method that should represent a 3D quantitative profile of the neurons sampled and prevents a failure to detect less prominent spines.</p><p>Our sampling strategy is to prescreen the impregnated neurons along the anterior/posterior axis of the region of interest to see if they were qualified for analysis. Neurons with incomplete impregnation or neurons with truncations due to the plane of sectioning were not collected. Moreover, cells with dendrites labeled retrogradely by impregnation in the surrounding neuropil were excluded. We also made sure there was a minimal level of truncation at the most distal part of the dendrites; this often happens in most of the Golgi studies, likely due to the plane of sectioning at top and bottom parts of the section. The brains were cut at a 80 μm thickness. With consideration of the shrinkage factor after processing (generally 10–25% shrinkage), the thickness of the section is even less, so the visualization of the spine subclass is no issue as we used a 100x Zeiss objective lens with immersion oil, which is sufficient to resolve the details or subtype of the spines for laborious counting. All analyses were conducted by an experimenter blind to treatment.</p></sec><sec id="s4-11"><title>Statistics</title><p>Behavioral and electrophysiological data were analyzed using Student’s t-tests or two-way ANOVAs (in some cases with repeated measures as the within subject variable). Dunnett’s tests were used for post-hoc analyses where needed. Biochemical data was analyzed using independent samples t-tests. The experimenter was blind to group treatment in all studies. Differenceswere considered statistically significant when p&lt;0.05. All data are plotted as mean ± s.e.m.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We thank Abel lab members for their help with these experiments and for their comments on the manuscript.

Your article has been reviewed by two peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by Joseph Takahashi as the Reviewing Editor and a Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Robert Greene (peer reviewer).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>In this study Havekes et al. investigated the cellular mechanisms underlying sleep deprivation induced learning deficits. They found that 5 hours of sleep deprivation can cause a large reduction in hippocampal CA1 spine density, which can be reversed with 3 hours of recovery sleep. Sleep deprivation also causes an increase in the activity of cofilin, which is known to regulate spine morphology. Suppression of cofilin activity prevents sleep deprivation induced spine loss, synaptic plasticity, and memory deficit. Reducing the activity of PDE4A5, an upstream regulator of cofilin activity has similar effects.</p><p>This study examines a series of cellular processes involved in structural synaptic plasticity and their role in sleep deprivation induced learning deficit, thus providing important insights into how sleep regulates learning and memory.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The causal association of SD effects on PDE and synaptic structure, LLTP and long-term memory are somewhat unclear. The experimental protocol involves training, immediately followed by 5h SD and a probe, 24h after that. This implies that LLTP disruption occurs at least an hour or more after induction of synaptic potentiation or that synaptic potentiation in CA1 normally occurs following the training, during sleep. Thus SD following training might disrupt the putative sleep potentiation as proposed. If the latter is occurring, then synaptic strength, dendritic structure and spine number should increase accordingly from the time immediately following training to 5h following training.</p><p>Alternatively, reduction of cAMP, PKA or cofilin inactivation should reduce LLTP an hour or more after LTP induction.</p><p>Another possibility is that the cAMP/PKA/cofilin SD associated changes and spine/dendritic structure, LLTP and/or memory changes are not mechanistically linked. Evidence for such linkage would seem essential to the proposed mechanisms of SD induced memory deficits.</p><p>The primary conclusion drawn from this study is that 5h of SD reduced CA1 spine density and LLTP of the Schaffer Collateral synapses in association with hippocampal dependent learning and memory dysfunction, by increasing cofilin activity. The evidence presented includes 1) western blots showing 5h SD decreases the ratio of the pCofilin-inactive/cofilin-active form and 2) over-expression of an inactive mutant cofilin<sup>S3D</sup> in CA1 prevented SD effects on spines, LLTP and L&amp;M.</p><p>These data are preliminary in the sense that there is no evidence that cofilin activity was affected (or to what degree) by the cofilin<sup>S3D</sup>, there is no direct measure of the putative SD effect on cofilin and it is not clear how great an effect on cofilin activity is needed (i.e. is sufficient) to elicit the observed SD effect on spines, LLTP and L&amp;M. Can off-target effects of the mutant be ruled out? Does a phospho-dead mutant cofilin mimic SD? The lack of effect of the cofilin<sup>S3D</sup> on control spines, synaptic strength and L&amp;M (on short lasting LTP?) should be addressed.</p><p>2) The effect of 5 hours of sleep deprivation on spine density is surprisingly strong; in fact with such strong structural changes one would expect much greater behavioral deficits than just impaired learning. A well-known caveat of sleep deprivation experiment is the stress induced by the deprivation procedure. While the authors discussed that stress has the opposite effect on spine density, could the reduced spine density be caused by other factors associated with the deprivation procedure rather than sleep deprivation per se?</p><p>3) The authors show that the effect of sleep deprivation is restricted to CA1 region. This raises two questions: (i) why is CA1 specifically vulnerable to sleep deprivation, while other brain regions are not? What causes cofilin activity to be sensitive to sleep deprivation in hippocampus but not other brain regions? (ii) Can the effect of sleep deprivation on memory, measured at the behavioral level, be completely attributed to deficit in CA1 plasticity? Is there another behavior that measures non-CA1 plasticity dependent learning that is spared by sleep deprivation?</p><p>4) The anatomical specificity of the structural SD-induced changes (not involving CA3) and p-cofilin/cofilin SD-decrease (not seen in PFC) is interesting, raising the possibility that SD changes in CA1 is not a good model for the role of sleep in neocortex. If so (and the structural changes need assessment in the PFC), then the assertion that &quot;Our data contradict the synaptic homeostasis hypothesis[…]&quot;, should be modified to reflect the anatomical specificity noted above.</p><p>5) Reducing cofilin activity seems to improve learning without any negative effect on behavior. So why hasn't cofilin activity been eliminated during evolution?</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were requested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for resubmitting your work entitled &quot;Sleep deprivation causes memory deficits by negatively impacting neuronal connectivity in hippocampal area CA1&quot; for further consideration at <italic>eLife</italic>. Your revised article has been favorably evaluated by a Senior editor, a Reviewing editor, and two reviewers.</p><p>The authors have been very responsive including the provision of new experiments to help resolve some of the issues raised in the first round. Notably, they examined the effect of hippocampal application of an AAV with an activated form of cofilin3SA and found it sufficient to cause deficits in the memory task but it was without effect on the form of LLTP that was disrupted by sleep deprivation (SD; the spaced 4-train LTP). This dissociation of cofilin effect from SD effect suggests that cofilin activation, while likely to be necessary, is not sufficient to underlie SD induced changes in synaptic plasticity. Further, it cannot be ruled out that the disruption of memory by cofilin activation is mediated by the same mechanism as by SD (for example SD does disrupt the one form of LLTP- is this sufficient to disrupt memory?).</p><p>On the other hand, the apparent necessity of an intact cAMP-PDE4-PKA-LIMK-cofilin activation-signaling pathway for SD induced memory disruption and reduction of spine density is a significant set of observations of general interest and potentially high impact.</p><p>Specific recommendations:</p><p>1) Last sentence of the Abstract should be altered accordingly.</p><p>2) The same for the second to last sentence of the Introduction.</p><p>3) Is there a significant effect of cofilin<sup>S3D</sup> in NSD vs. wildtype NSD on spine density?</p><p>4) In the second paragraph of the Discussion, it might be noted that the &quot;one form&quot; of LTP not impacted by active cofilin is the same as that disrupted by SD.</p><p>5) Is there a relevant phosphatase responsible for the SD induced change in pCofilin/cofilin ratio? Its activity is certainly implied by the findings of this study.</p><p>6) In the seventh paragraph of the Discussion, it might be noted that the hippocampal specific plasticity may also be mediated by different forms of plasticity whether or not they are more or less prominent.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.13424.024</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>Essential revisions:</italic> </p><p><italic>1) The causal association of SD effects on PDE and synaptic structure, LLTP and long-term memory are somewhat unclear.

The first possibility is that sleep deprivation disrupts learning-induced putative potentiation during sleep which may be reflected in increased cAMP/PKA signaling, cofilin inactivation, synaptic potentiation, and the formation of new spines. The alternative possibility is that sleep deprivation leads to cognitive deficits through other mechanisms. Our work focuses on the molecular mechanisms by which sleep deprivation negatively impacts synaptic plasticity and memory. We show that sleep deprivation causes spine loss in CA1 neurons of the hippocampus that is accompanied by reduced cofilin phosphorylation levels, a protein that regulates dendritic spine formation. We find that expression of a dominant negative inactive version of cofilin is sufficient to prevent the spine loss, synaptic plasticity deficits, and memory impairments associated with sleep deprivation. In addition, we show that the changes in cofilin signaling are directly mediated by the phosphodiesterase isoform PDE4A5 that inhibits the PKA/LIMK pathway. Therefore, we have shown that changes in cAMP/PKA/LIMK/cofilin signaling with sleep deprivation are sufficient to cause memory deficits, and our work using genetic manipulations of both ends of the cAMP/PKA/LIMK/cofilin pathway causally links changes in hippocampal PKA/LIMK/cofilin signaling with the spine loss, synaptic plasticity, and memory deficits caused by sleep deprivation.</p><p>Other researchers (Yang et al., 2014, Science) have explored changes in dendritic spines after learning. They have found that there are more spines on neurons activated after sleep. This result is consistent with the idea that sleep deprivation disrupts learning-induced changes in spines. These researchers have not manipulated spine formation, or cofilin signaling in their experiments so they have not examined any functional roles for spine formation during sleep. We focused on functional experiments to manipulate signaling pathways during sleep deprivation. We have not examined directly changes in spines with sleep as this would require in vivo 2 photon imaging in the hippocampus with behavior, experiments that go well beyond the scope of the current manuscript.</p><p>We now further clarify the relationship between our work with sleep deprivation and sleep in the manuscript. In the manuscript, we now included the following text in the manuscript in the Discussion: “In line with our finding of reductions in spines during sleep deprivation, recent work by Yang and colleagues revealed that sleep promotes dendritic spine formation in neurons activated by learning (Yang et al., 2014 Science). Combined with our work, these experiments suggest that sleep deprivation disrupts learning-induced changes in spines that occur during sleep. Importantly, our structural studies reveal that spine loss is reversed by recovery sleep, consistent with this idea.”</p><p>The other issue that is raised in this comment is the question of the relationship between synaptic plasticity (LTP) and memory. Our work shows that these “go together” that is, when one is reduced the other is also, but our work does not directly speak to the relationship between synaptic plasticity and memory. Our manipulations show that sleep deprivation leads to changes in cAMP/PKA/LIMK/cofilin and spines and that when we reverse these molecular and structural changes we block the effects of sleep deprivation on both synaptic plasticity and memory.</p><p>We now clarify these points about the relationship between molecular changes, synaptic plasticity and memory in the manuscript. In the Discussion section we now write: “In light of the fact that elevated cofilin activity can lead to spine shrinkage and spine loss (Zhou, Homma and Poo, 2004; Pontrello et al., 2012), our genetic manipulations of cofilin and PDE4A5 signaling independently links impairments in synaptic plasticity and memory caused by brief sleep deprivation with the loss of dendritic spines in the hippocampus. […] That care should be taken with directly relating LTP deficits with memory impairments is emphasized by our findings that expression of constitutively active cofilin is sufficient to cause memory deficits while it does not impact at least one form of L-LTP.”</p><p><italic>The primary conclusion drawn from this study is that 5h of SD reduced CA1 spine density and LLTP of the Schaffer Collateral synapses in association with hippocampal dependent learning and memory dysfunction, by increasing cofilin activity. The evidence presented includes 1) western blots showing 5h SD decreases the ratio of the pCofilin-inactive/cofilin-active form and 2) over-expression of an inactive mutant cofilin<sup>S3D</sup> in CA1 prevented SD effects on spines, LLTP and L&amp;M.</italic> </p><p><italic>These data are preliminary in the sense that there is no evidence that cofilin activity was affected (or to what degree) by the cofilin<sup>S3D</sup>, there is no direct measure of the putative SD effect on cofilin and it is not clear how great an effect on cofilin activity is needed (i.e. is sufficient) to elicit the observed SD effect on spines, LLTP and L&amp;M. Can off-target effects of the mutant be ruled out? Does a phospho-dead mutant cofilin mimic SD? The lack of effect of the cofilin<sup>S3D</sup> on control spines, synaptic strength and L&amp;M (on short lasting LTP?) should be addressed.</italic> </p><p>Our work shows that sleep deprivation negatively impacts spine numbers in the hippocampus that is accompanied by increased activity of cofilin. To directly test the role of altered cofilin signaling in the spine loss associated with sleep deprivation, we expressed a mutant inactive version of cofilin which is known to inhibit the function of endogenous cofilin function (Zhao et al., 2008 Journal of Biological Chemistry) and prevents dendritic spine changes associated caused by increased endogenous cofilin activity (Shi et al., 2009Journal of Neuroscience). We analyzed spine density as a final common pathway of cofilin activity. We found that expression of the mutant cofilin prevents the spine loss caused by sleep deprivation. Furthermore, expression of the inactive form of cofilin also prevented the deficits in L-LTP and long-term memory formation. Thus, this work shows the necessity of increased cofilin activity for the expression of synaptic plasticity deficits and memory impairments associated with sleep deprivation and conceptually addresses how sleep deprivation leads to spine loss.</p><p>The possibility of off-target effects is unlikely as expression of the mutant prevents spine loss, LTP deficits, and memory impairments, bringing these measures back to “normal” levels. Further, cofilin<sup>S3D</sup> expression did not impact memory in non-sleep deprived mice. This lack of an effect in non-sleep deprived mice shows the selectivity of our cofilin manipulation to the sleep-deprived state. This suggests that cofilin<sup>S3D</sup> mutant is not having “off target” effects on other molecular processes.</p><p>We have now incorporated this point in the Results section: “Although we cannot rule out the possibility of off-target effects of the cofilinS3D mutant, we think that these are unlikely as expression of this mutant form of cofilin reversed the effects of sleep deprivation, restoring spine loss, LTP and memory to non-sleep deprived levels while not having an effect in non-sleep deprived mice.”</p><p>We agree with the reviewer that it would be interesting to determine whether expression of a phospho-dead mutant cofilin in hippocampal neurons is sufficient to mimic the behavioral and electrophysiological phenotypes associated with sleep deprivation. We now show that expression of cofilin<sup>S3A</sup> is sufficient to cause cognitive deficits in the object-location memory task (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2A-B</xref>). We also show that spaced 4-train LTP was not affected by this manipulation. These new findings are now described in the Results section, subsection “Suppressing cofilin function in hippocampal neurons prevents the impairments in memory and synaptic plasticity caused by brief periods of sleep deprivation”. Together, these data suggest that at least at the behavioral level expression of constitutively active cofilin mimics the phenotypes associated with brief sleep deprivation and that care should be taken with directly relating LTP deficits with memory impairments.</p><p>These data are now also discussed in the Discussion section. Specifically, we write “In light of the fact that elevated cofilin activity can lead to spine shrinkage and spine loss ((Zhou, Homma and Poo, 2004; Pontrello et al., 2012), our genetic manipulations of cofilin and PDE4A5 signaling independently links impairments in synaptic plasticity and memory caused by brief sleep deprivation with the loss of dendritic spines in the hippocampus. […] That care should be taken to directly relate LTP deficits with memory impairments is emphasized by our findings that expression of constitutively active cofilin is sufficient to cause memory deficits while it does not impact at least one form of L-LTP.”</p><p>In future studies we will further assess the impact if cofilin<sup>S3A</sup> expression on various other LTP protocols both in vivoand ex vivobut feel that these additional experiments are better suited for a separate manuscript. Such experiments address the question whether expression of constitutively active cofilin is sufficient to impair various forms of synaptic plasticity while the current manuscript focuses on the necessity of cofilin activity for the behavioral and electrophysiological deficits associated with sleep deprivation.</p><p>We would also like to emphasize that suppression of PDE4A5 function through overexpression of a catalytically inactive mutant version of PDE4A5 (PDE4A5catnul) restores levels of phospho-cofilin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5J</xref>) and that this manipulation prevents the negative impact of sleep deprivation on memory consolidation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5M</xref>). Thus, by manipulating cofilin phosphorylation through two entirely different signalling routes / inputs each served to prevent the memory deficits associated with sleep deprivation.</p><p>We have emphasized this important finding in the first paragraph of the Discussion: “Sixth, we find that suppression of localized PDE4A5 functioning through overexpression of a catalytically inactive mutant version of PDE4A5 to displace anchored, active endogenous PDE4A5 serves to change LIMK and cofilin phosphorylation levels associated with sleep deprivation. Finally, we show that hippocampal suppression of endogenous PDE4A5 function prevents the negative impact of sleep deprivation on memory consolidation. Thus, two different ways of manipulating cofilin phosphorylation prevent the memory deficits associated with sleep deprivation.”</p><p><italic>2) The effect of 5 hours of sleep deprivation on spine density is surprisingly strong; in fact with such strong structural changes one would expect much greater behavioral deficits than just impaired learning. A well-known caveat of sleep deprivation experiment is the stress induced by the deprivation procedure. While the authors discussed that stress has the opposite effect on spine density, could the reduced spine density be caused by other factors associated with the deprivation procedure rather than sleep deprivation per se?</italic> </p><p>The reviewer raises the question whether, aside from stress, the procedure used to keep animals awake could lead to the spine loss associated with sleep deprivation. In one of our previous studies, we addressed this question by assessing whether stimulation itself negatively impacts memory. This does not appear to be the case. Specifically, we showed that subjecting the animals to the same amount of stimulation in the waking phase does not lead to memory impairments (Hagewoud et al., 2010 Sleep).</p><p>We now included the following sentence to the Discussion: “It is also unlikely that other factors associated with the procedure to keep animals awake rather than sleep deprivation per se causes the spine loss as our previous work indicated that applying the exact same amount of stimulation in the waking phase (i.e., the dark phase) does not lead to memory impairments (Hagewoud et al., 2010).”</p><p><italic>3) The authors show that the effect of sleep deprivation is restricted to CA1 region. This raises two questions: (i) why is CA1 specifically vulnerable to sleep deprivation, while other brain regions are not? What causes cofilin activity to be sensitive to sleep deprivation in hippocampus but not other brain regions?</italic></p><p>Our data indeed suggests that the hippocampus is specifically sensitive to short periods of sleep deprivation. For example, sleep deprivation leads to increased cofilin activity in the hippocampus, but not in the prefrontal cortex. We previously reported that the amygdala is less susceptible to sleep deprivation (Graves et al., 2003 Learning &amp; Memory). Within the hippocampus, we have previously showed that five hours of sleep deprivation attenuates CREB phosphorylation in area CA1, but not area CA3 of the hippocampus (Vecsey et al., 2009 Nature). One reason why area CA1 may be more sensitive to sleep deprivation may be the high level of PDE4A5 expression in this specific hippocampal subregion (McPhee et al., 2001 Cellular Signalling).</p><p>In the manuscript, we have now included the following statement in the Discussion section: “Our work reveals that PDE4A5 is a critical mediator of the impact of sleep deprivation on memory consolidation, and one reason why hippocampal area CA1 may be specifically vulnerable to sleep deprivation may be the high level of PDE4A5 expression in this region (Shors, Chua and Falduto, 2001).”</p><p><italic>(ii) Can the effect of sleep deprivation on memory, measured at the behavioral level, be completely attributed to deficit in CA1 plasticity? Is there another behavior that measures non-CA1 plasticity dependent learning that is spared by sleep deprivation?</italic> </p><p>There are two components to this comment. One is the relationship between plasticity and behavior, an issue that we address above in response to comment 1. The second is the about another behavior that might measure non-CA1 plasticity dependent learning that is spared by sleep deprivation. The current manuscript focuses on the impact of sleep deprivation on structural plasticity in area CA1 for reasons discussed above. We show that sleep deprivation reduces spine numbers in CA1 but not CA3. It will be interesting in future experiments to look at the impact of sleep deprivation on pattern completion and pattern separation, behavioral tasks that rely on hippocampal area CA3 and the dentate gyrus respectively (Nakazawa et al., 2002 Science; McHugh et al., 2007 Science) and at synaptic plasticity in these other hippocampal regions. These tasks require multiple training trials so direct examination of the impact of sleep deprivation selectively on memory consolidation is difficult. We have focused our work on sleep deprivation on single trial tasks so that we can look selectively at the impact of sleep deprivation on memory consolidation.</p><p>We have now added the following text to the Discussion to address this issue: “In the current study, we have focused on hippocampal area CA1 because we have previously found deficits in synaptic plasticity in this region caused by sleep deprivation (Vecsey et al., 2009 Nature). We found that sleep deprivation affects spine numbers in area CA1, but not area CA3. It will be interesting in future experiments to look at the impact of sleep deprivation on pattern completion and pattern separation, behavioral tasks that rely on hippocampal area CA3 and the dentate gyrus respectively (Nakazawa et al., 2002 Science; McHugh et al., 2007 Science) and at synaptic plasticity in these other hippocampal regions. Further, future experiments can restrict manipulations of cofilin function to area CA1 using viral constructs that are Cre-dependent in combination with Cre lines that express selectively in CA1, CA3 or the dentate gyrus.”</p><p><italic>4) The anatomical specificity of the structural SD-induced changes (not involving CA3) and p-cofilin/cofilin SD-decrease (not seen in PFC) is interesting, raising the possibility that SD changes in CA1 is not a good model for the role of sleep in neocortex. If so (and the structural changes need assessment in the PFC), then the assertion that &quot;Our data contradict the synaptic homeostasis hypothesis….&quot;, should be modified to reflect the anatomical specificity noted above.</italic> </p><p>We agree with the reviewer that there may be brain region specificity in the effects of sleep deprivation, as our own study shows at the level of cofilin phosphorylation. However, we would like to point out that it has been suggested that the synaptic homeostasis hypothesis not only applies to the cortex but to the hippocampus as well (Vyazovskiy et al., 2008 Nature Neuroscience). As such we feel it is important to emphasize that our data are not in line with the original proposition.</p><p>We have now included the following sentence in the Discussion section: “This hypothesis has focused on explaining data from the cortex rather than the hippocampus, but one previously published study has suggested that the synaptic homeostasis hypothesis applies to the hippocampus as well (Vyazovskiy et al., 2008). However, the hippocampus may be a special case from the cortex as the hippocampus is involved in episodic memory and in much greater experience dependent plasticity than anywhere else in the brain and thus our findings may not extend to other areas where synaptic plasticity is not as prominent.”</p><p><italic>5) Reducing cofilin activity seems to improve learning without any negative effect on behavior. So why hasn't cofilin activity been eliminated during evolution?</italic> </p><p>This is an interesting point raised by the reviewer. Cofilin has a variety of functions in the body and, in this regard, the fact that cofilin has not been ‘deleted’ from the CNS indicates that it has evolutionary important functions that outweigh any negative effects on learning. Indeed, knockout of the cofilin-1 gene in mice is embryonic lethal (Gurniak et al., 2004 Developmental Biology). Furthermore, it is also important to note that structural plasticity is highly dynamic and for this process to be highly dynamic both positive and negative regulators of spine plasticity are required. Cofilin could for example play an essential role updating outdated memories, erasing irrelevant information, extinction learning, and transferring information from the hippocampus to cortical layers for long-term storage (i.e.systems consolidation). However, to date no studies have defined a role for cofilin in these processes.</p><p>We have now included the following statement in the Introduction section of the manuscript “In addition to a critical function during development (Gurniak, Perlas and Witke, 2005), cofilin plays an essential role in synapse structure by mediating both the enlargement and pruning of dendritic spines (Rust, 2015; Bamburn, 1999; Bosch et al., 2014).”</p><p><italic>[Editors' note: further revisions were requested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</italic></p><p><italic>Specific recommendations:</italic> </p><p><italic>1) Last sentence of the Abstract should be altered accordingly.</italic> </p><p>We agree with the reviewers and have now revised the last sentence of the Abstract. The last sentence of the abstract now reads “Our work demonstrates the necessity of an intact cAMP-PDE4-PKA-LIMK-cofilin activation-signaling pathway for sleep deprivation-induced memory disruption and reduction in hippocampal spine density”.</p><p><italic>2) The same for the second to last sentence of the Introduction.</italic></p><p>The second to last sentence of the Introduction has now been altered to “Thus changes in the cAMP-PDE4-PKA-LIMK-cofilin signaling pathway in the adult hippocampus underlie the cognitive deficits associated with sleep loss.”</p><p><italic>3) Is there a significant effect of cofilin<sup>S3D</sup> in NSD vs. wildtype NSD on spine density?</italic> </p><p>The reviewers raise an interesting point. Previous work by others has indicated that cofilin<sup>S3D</sup> expression per se does not alter hippocampal spine density (Shi et al., 2009 Journal of Neuroscience; Pontrello et al., 2012 <italic>PNAS</italic>). In the Results section we now write “Importantly, cofilin<sup>S3D</sup> expression does not alter spine density under baseline conditions (Pontrello et al., 2012; Shi et al., 2009).”</p><p><italic>4) In the second paragraph of the Discussion, it might be noted that the &quot;one form&quot; of LTP not impacted by active cofilin is the same as that disrupted by SD.</italic> </p><p>We agreed with the reviewers and have revised the text accordingly. The sentence now reads “That care should be taken to directly relate LTP deficits with memory impairments is emphasized by our findings that expression of constitutively active cofilin is sufficient to cause memory deficits while it does not impact at least one form of L-LTP that is disrupted by sleep deprivation (Seabold et al., 2010).”</p><p><italic>5) Is there a relevant phosphatase responsible for the SD induced change in pCofilin/cofilin ratio? Its activity is certainly implied by the findings of this study.</italic> </p><p>While the phosphatase slingshot could contribute to the altered pcofilin/cofilin ratio we would like to point out that the changes in PKA-LIMK signaling seem to play a causal role in the altered pcofilin/cofilin ratio, because blocking the degradation of cAMP by PDE4A5 is sufficient to fully restore the pcofilin/cofilin ratio in sleep deprived mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5J</xref>). Nevertheless, in the revised manuscript in the Results section we now include a sentence about a potential role for the phosphatase slingshot in the altered pcofilin/cofilin ratio observed in sleep deprivation mice.</p><p>We now write “While expression of PDE4A5<sup>catnull</sup> fully restored the pcofilin/cofilin ratio in the hippocampus of sleep deprived mice to the levels observed under non-sleep deprivation conditions, it should be noted that phosphatases such as slingshot (Sarmiere and Bamburg, 2004) may also contribute to the reduction in cofilin phosphorylation levels under conditions of sleep deprivation.”</p><p><italic>6) In the seventh paragraph of the Discussion, it might be noted that the hippocampal specific plasticity may also be mediated by different forms of plasticity whether or not they are more or less prominent.</italic> </p><p>We appreciate the suggestion and revised the text accordingly.</p><p>We now write “However, the hippocampus may be unique from the cortex as the hippocampus is involved in episodic memory and in much greater experience-dependent plasticity than anywhere else in the brain and thus our findings may not extend to other areas where synaptic plasticity is not as prominent. Further, the hippocampus also exhibits many distinct forms of synaptic plasticity.”</p></body></sub-article></article>
