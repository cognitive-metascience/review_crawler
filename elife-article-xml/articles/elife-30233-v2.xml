Consequently, many assays have been developed to detect and study them, particularly in the context of living cells, where native PPIs are unperturbed by cell lysis, detergents, fixatives, or dilution. For example, FRET (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Truong and Ikura, 2001</xref>), BRET (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Pfleger and Eidne, 2006</xref>), fluorescence correlation spectroscopy (FCS) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Krichevsky and Bonnet, 2002</xref>), protein complementation assays (PCAs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Shekhawat and Ghosh, 2011</xref>), and fluorescence relocalization assays (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Teruel and Meyer, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Yang et al., 2013</xref>) have all been applied to visualize PPI dynamics in living cells. Though information-rich, these assays have the downside of being labor-intensive, requiring high-content or time-lapse microscopy, and are consequently difficult to perform on a large scale. This makes them non-optimal for PPI discovery, for adaptation to high-throughput screens, or for analysis of large cell populations such as those found within complex tissue. Instead, real-time assays are better suited for the focused study of a small number of known PPIs under a small set of conditions, or in a small number of cells.</p><p>A separate class of assays detects PPIs by signal integration rather than real-time imaging, and produces gene transcription as the readout. Examples include the yeast two hybrid assay (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Miller and Stagljar, 2004</xref>), the split ubiquitin assay (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Petschnigg et al., 2014</xref>), and TANGO (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Barnea et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Inagaki et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Kroeze et al., 2015</xref>). Benefits of these assays include scalability (because real-time microscopy is not needed), versatility of read out (transcription of a fluorescent protein or an antibiotic resistance gene, for example), and high sensitivity due to signal amplification. These properties have led to the widespread use of integrative PPI assays for PPI discovery and drug screening. However, these assays have two major drawbacks. First, because they integrate PPI events over long time periods, typically 18 hr to days (i.e., over the entire time that the tools are expressed in cells), they often produce high background, leading to high rates of false discovery. Second, these assays lose information about PPI dynamics. It is impossible to know, for instance, whether a PPI event occurred during a specific 5 min time window of interest or at another time during the tool expression window.</p><p>To address these limitations, and to expand the utility and versatility of PPI assays that work by signal integration and transcriptional readout, we report a new tool called SPARK, for ‘Specific Protein Association tool giving transcriptional Readout with rapid Kinetics’. SPARK detects interactions in living cells between specific protein pairs of interest (proteins A and B in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>), and produces gene transcription as a result. In contrast to previous tools, SPARK is also gated by externally-applied blue light. Hence, transcriptional activation requires both protein A-protein B interaction <italic>and</italic> light, the latter of which can be applied during any user-specified time window. This generic and non-invasive form of temporal gating enables SPARK to capture PPI dynamics to some extent, and reduces background signal overall, while preserving the tremendous benefits of transcriptional readout.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.30233.002</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Design of SPARK and application to light- and agonist-dependent detection of β2-adrenergic receptor (β2AR)-β-arrestin2 interaction.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Scheme. A and B are proteins that interact under certain conditions. In this example, protein A is membrane-associated and is fused to a light-sensitive eLOV domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Wang et al., 2017</xref>), a protease cleavage site (TEVcs), and a transcription factor (TF). These comprise the ‘SPARK TF component.’ Protein B is fused to a truncated variant of TEV protease (TEVp) (‘SPARK protease component’). When A and B interact (right), TEVp is recruited to the vicinity of TEVcs. When blue light is applied to the cells, eLOV reversibly unblocks TEVcs. Hence, the coincidence of light <italic>and</italic> A-B interaction permits cleavage of TEVcs by TEVp, resulting in the release of the TF, which translocates to the nucleus and drives transcription of a chosen reporter gene.

(<bold>C</bold>) Imaging of SPARK activation by β2AR-β-arrestin2 interaction under four conditions. HEK 293T cells were transiently transfected with the three SPARK components shown in (<bold>B</bold>). β2AR-β-arrestin2 interaction was induced with addition of 10 μM isoproterenol for 5 min. Light stimulation was via 467 nm LED at 60 mW/cm<sup>2</sup> and 10% duty cycle (0.5 s of light every 5 s) for 5 min. Nine hours after stimulation, cells were fixed and imaged. (<bold>D</bold>) Same as (<bold>C</bold>), but HEK 293T cells were stably expressing the SPARK protease component and transiently expressing SPARK TF component and UAS-luciferase. Results of shorter and longer irradiation times are also shown. ±isoproterenol signal ratio was quantified for each time point. Each datapoint reflects one well of a 96-well plate containing &gt;6000 transfected cells. Four replicates per condition. (<bold>E</bold>) SPARK is specific for PPIs over non-interacting protein pairs. Same experiment as in (<bold>C</bold>), except arrestin was replaced by calmodulin protein (which does not interact with β2AR) in the second column, and β2AR was replaced by the calmodulin effector peptide MK2 (which does not interact with arrestin) in the third column. Anti-myc and anti-V5 antibodies stain for the SPARK protease and TF components, respectively. (<bold>F</bold>) SPARK is activated by direct interactions and not merely proximity. Top: experimental scheme. To drive proximity but not interaction, we created SPARK constructs in which A and B domains were a transmembrane (TM) segment of the CD4 protein, and β-arrestin2, respectively. TM and arrestin do not interact. HEK 293T cells expressing these SPARK constructs were also transfected with an expression plasmid for HA-tagged β2AR. Upon isoproterenol addition, β-arrestin2-TEVp is recruited to the plasma membrane via interaction with β2AR, but it does not interact directly with the SPARK TF component. Bottom: Images of HEK 293T cells 9 hr after stimulation with isoproterenol and light (for 5 min). The last column shows the experiment depicted in the scheme. The first two columns are positive controls with SPARK constructs containing β2AR and β-arrestin2 (which do interact). The third column is a negative control with omission of the HA-β2AR construct.

We use SPARK to compare the temporal profiles of different GPCRs interacting with β-arrestin2 in response to various ligands. Finally, we show that SPARK can enable FACS-based enrichment of cells that experienced specific transient PPI events &gt;9 hr earlier. This lays the foundation for the eventual use of SPARK for genetic screens and PPI discovery on a genome-wide scale.</p><sec id="s1-1"><title>Design and optimization of SPARK</title><p>To design SPARK, we built upon our recently reported FLARE tool, which is a transcription factor gated by the coincidence of light and high calcium (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Wang et al., 2017</xref>). As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A–B</xref>, SPARK has three components: a transcription factor (TF) that is tethered to protein interaction partner ‘A’ as well as to the plasma membrane (or other intracellular membrane, sequestered from the nucleus) via a protease cleavage site (‘TEVcs’ for tobacco etch virus protease cleavage site); a protease (‘TEVp’ for tobacco etch virus protease) that is fused to protein interaction partner ‘B’; and a reporter gene whose transcription is triggered by TF translocation to the nucleus. TF release from the plasma membrane via TEVcs cleavage requires the coincidence of two events: protein A-protein B interaction <italic>and</italic> externally-applied blue light. This is because, first, the TEVp protease is tuned to have low affinity for its TEVcs substrate and cleavage is only significant when the two are brought into proximity via A-B interaction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Wang et al., 2017</xref>). Second, the TEVcs is caged by an ‘evolved LOV domain’ (eLOV), which we previously generated by directed evolution to tightly cage the TEVcs sequence and prevent its cleavage in the dark state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Wang et al., 2017</xref>). A brief (&lt;1 s) pulse of 467 nm light alters the eLOV protein conformation, unblocking the adjacent TEVcs and allowing cleavage. After ~100 s without blue light, eLOV spontaneously reverts to its dark state conformation and again blocks TEVcs.</p><p>To test the SPARK design with a well-established cellular PPI, we selected the β2-adrenergic receptor (β2AR), a 7-transmembrane GPCR that recruits the soluble cytosolic effector protein β-arrestin2 after stimulation with small-molecule agonist isoproterenol. We cloned β2AR and β-arrestin2 genes into the protein A and protein B positions of SPARK, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). Note that β2AR is not fused to the tail domain of the vasopressin receptor or any other motif that artificially boosts its recruitment of arrestin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Barnea et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Lee et al., 2017</xref>). HEK293T cells expressing these SPARK components were stimulated for 5 min with both 467 nm light (60 mW/cm<sup>2</sup>) and isoproterenol. Under these conditions, we expect SPARK components to interact and release the transcription factor, Gal4, from the plasma membrane. Consequently, we should observe transcription and translation of the Citrine fluorescent protein reporter gene. Nine hours after stimulation of the HEK cells, we fixed them and imaged Citrine expression. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref> shows robust Citrine expression in the light- and isoproterenol-treated cells. Essential for a functional ‘AND’ gate, we detected negligible Citrine expression in the light-only or isoproterenol-only cells.</p><p>Because SPARK is a transcriptional tool, the readout can be any gene of our choosing. Luciferase is frequently chosen for high-throughput assays, because it is easy to detect and quantify. By repeating the above experiment, but replacing the UAS-Citrine gene with a UAS-luciferase gene, and quantifying luminescence on a platereader, we again detected a robust increase in reporter gene transcription in light- and isoproterenol-treated cells compared to light-only or isoproterenol-only cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>).</p><p>In an effort to further optimize SPARK, we explored alternative TEVcs sequences and alternative LOV domain sequences. Alternative TEVcs sequences, particularly with changes at the P1´ position immediately following the cleavage site, have the potential to alter both k<sub>cat</sub> and K<sub>m</sub> of the TEVp-TEVcs interaction. For optimal SPARK performance, we favor high k<sub>cat</sub>, for high signal, and high K<sub>m</sub>, for low background and strong proximity-dependence of the cleavage. Hence, we explored TEVcs variants with P1´=M, Q or Y because these have previously been shown to tune TEVp-TEVcs kinetics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Wang et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Kapust et al., 2002</xref>). <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref> shows that P1´=M displayed the highest signal and strongest proximity dependence in the context of β2AR-β-arrestin2 SPARK, and hence we selected this TEVcs sequence for all subsequent experiments in this study.</p><p>While our evolved eLOV provides robust light caging of TEVcs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Wang et al., 2017</xref>), a new LOV sequence with improved properties over the original LOV (which served as the template for our directed evolution [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Wang et al., 2017</xref>]) has been reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Lee et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Guntas et al., 2015</xref>). We thus performed a side-by-side comparison of this new LOV domain (called ‘iLID’) to our eLOV, in the context of β2AR-β-arrestin2 SPARK. In addition, we constructed two different hybrid LOV domains (hLOV1 and hLOV2) that combine features of eLOV and iLID into a single gene (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref>). <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C and E</xref> shows that with short stimulation times, or low SPARK component expression levels, eLOV is the best light gate, because it gives the highest signal in the +light condition. When SPARK components are highly overexpressed, and the stimulation time is increased from 5 min to 15 min, however, hLOV1 is the best light gate, because it gives the lowest signal in the no-light condition (i.e., best steric protection of TEVcs in the dark state, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1D</xref>). Because we want SPARK to be robust even with short tagging time windows, we selected eLOV for all subsequent experiments in this study. For applications that require minimization of dark state leak, however, hLOV1 may prove to be a better light gate.</p></sec><sec id="s1-2"><title>Further characterization of SPARK in mammalian cells</title><p>We compared different light stimulation times and found that 5 min is sufficient to give a 4.3-fold increase in SPARK-driven luciferase expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). 1 min of light is too short, and one can optionally increase the stimulation time to 15 min to further boost the ±isoproterenol signal ratio to 10.3. To test SPARK-PPI specificity, we replaced one protein partner in the β2AR-β-arrestin2 SPARK pair with a non-interacting protein. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref> shows that the mismatched pairs β2AR-calmodulin and MK2-β-arrestin2 fail to drive Citrine expression.</p><p>We wondered whether mere recruitment of TEVp to the vicinity of TEVcs, without direct complexation mediated by the A-B PPI, would be sufficient to give proteolytic cleavage and TF release. To test this, we generated a mismatched SPARK pair using β-arrestin2 (protein B) and the transmembrane domain of CD4 (protein A). We transfected HEK cells with these SPARK constructs along with a V5-tagged β2AR expression plasmid. We then drove arrestin-TEVp translocation from the cytosol to the plasma membrane by addition of isoproterenol (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2A</xref>). <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2B</xref> show that, even when arrestin-TEVp is recruited to the immediate vicinity of the TM (CD4) SPARK TF component, no SPARK activation (citrine expression) is observed.

How much TEVcs cleavage occurs after our standard stimulation time of 5 min? To quantify this, we used the β2AR-β-arrestin2 SPARK constructs in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>, and lysed the cells immediately after stimulation to examine the SPARK proteins by Western blot. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2C</xref> shows that 30% of total TEVcs is cleaved after 5 min of light and isoproterenol, and the cleavage yield increases to 48% after 30 min of stimulation.</p><p>For most of our experiments, we used a blue LED array to deliver light to cells. However, many laboratories do not have access to such a light source. The light power required to uncage the LOV domain is very weak, &lt;0.5 mW/cm<sup>2</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Pudasaini and Zoltowski, 2013</xref>). Thus we tested if SPARK could be stimulated equipotently by ordinary room light. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2D</xref> shows that the signal ratios obtained are the same whether the light source is a blue LED or ambient room light.

To test whether the TF component of SPARK would also work in a different subcellular region besides the plasma membrane, we created a FRB-SPARK construct localized to the outer mitochondrial membrane (OMM) (via fusion to the N-terminal 53-amino acid OMM targeting domain of AKAP1). <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref> shows that this SPARK pair gives rapamycin- and light-dependent gene expression as well.</p><p>GPCRs are a protein class of special interest due to their central role in signal transduction, their rich pharmacology, and their prevalence as therapeutic targets. Though ligand-activated GPCRs differ in their downstream recruitment of various G proteins (G<sub>i</sub>, G<sub>s</sub>, or G<sub>q</sub>), nearly all of them recruit the effector arrestin as part of their desensitization pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Shenoy and Lefkowitz, 2011</xref>). As a consequence, assays that read out arrestin recruitment to GPCRs can detect activation of a wide range of GPCRs. We were interested to know whether SPARK could detect the ligand-dependent recruitment of arrestin to a range of GPCRs, and if so, whether the signal ratios would exceed those observed in the commonly-used GPCR assays TANGO (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Barnea et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Kroeze et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Zhou et al., 2017</xref>) and DiscoverX (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Takakura et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Southern et al., 2013</xref>) (these typically give signal ratios of 2–3 or less). In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>, we selected eight different GCPRs and tested them in SPARK. The first six GPCRs gave robust light- and ligand-dependent luciferase expression, five of them with ±ligand signal ratios &gt;15. Such large signal ratios are especially encouraging given that previous work has shown that some of these GPCRs (e.g., DRD2, NMBR and AVPR2) have significant interactions with arrestin prior to ligand addition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Kroeze et al., 2015</xref>), suggesting that background signal (SPARK-driven luciferase expression in the no ligand condition) could have been a concern. Despite this, the high sensitivity and specificity of SPARK permitted facile differentiation between the +ligand and no-ligand states.</p><p>The last two GPCRs we surveyed, AGTR2 and ADRA1A, are not known to recruit arrestin, and previous assays (e.g., PRESTO-TANGO (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Kroeze et al., 2015</xref>)) failed to produce signal. Our SPARK ±ligand signal ratios were small for these GPCRs (1.5 and 1.4, respectively, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>) but statistically significant (p&lt;0.001 for both in two separate experiments). Thus the sensitivity of SPARK enables us to conclude that these receptors do indeed recruit arrestin, but to a lesser extent than other GPCRs.</p><p>In addition to detecting the presence of ligands, scientists studying GPCRs are often interested in differentiating agonists from antagonists, and calculating EC50 and IC50 values. In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>, we show that SPARK can be easily used to generate dose-response curves for the β2AR ligands isoproterenol (an agonist) and alprenolol (an antagonist).</p><p>In total, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> extends SPARK to 12 different PPI pairs. Importantly, these results were all obtained simply by cloning protein-coding genes into positions A and B of the constructs in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>. We did not vary geometries or linkers or create panels of constructs to test for each PPI of interest.

For instance, if an A-B PPI has the time course shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>, left, a light window that overlaps with the peak of A-B interaction will result in SPARK activation and gene transcription, whereas a light window that is right-shifted to a later time period (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>, right) will not. To test this concept, we used the β2AR-arrestin2 SPARK constructs, applied isoproterenol at t = 0, and read out luciferase expression after shifting the light window to various time ranges (e.g., 0–5 min, 5–10 min, 15–20 min, etc.). <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref> shows that the β2AR-β-arrestin2 interaction extent is high in the initial time period (0–5 min), and then falls off rapidly in the 5–10 min range.

Isoproterenol and isoetharine are both full agonists, while clenbuterol is a partial agonist, evoking a weaker downstream response and kinetically slower recruitment of arrestin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Kaya et al., 2012</xref>). Carvedilol is an inverse agonist, which can attenuate downstream signaling while still recruiting arrestin, albeit more weakly than a full agonist (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Wisler et al., 2007</xref>). We used the light staggering scheme in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref> to examine the temporal response of the β2AR-arrestin2 interaction to these different ligands. As expected, the full agonists isoproterenol and isoetharine evoked strong responses (maximum ±ligand signal ratios ~18) and transient arrestin association. Clenbuterol induced a much smaller response and delayed onset of arrestin recruitment, consistent with its classification as a partial agonist. Interestingly, carvedilol produced a delayed but sustained interaction with β-arrestin2.</p><p>Different GPCRs are also thought to recruit arrestin with different kinetics. We performed the same SPARK time course assay, keeping the β-arrestin2-TEVp SPARK component constant, but varying the identity of the GPCR. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref> shows that two Class A GPCRs, β2AR and DRD1, give strong SPARK responses within 5 min of ligand addition but much lower SPARK-driven luciferase expression shortly after ligand washout. This is consistent with previous studies showing that Class A GPCRs interact weakly and transiently with arrestin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Oakley et al., 2000</xref>). In contrast, the Class B GPCR AVPR2 recruits arrestin quickly and maintains a strong interaction with arrestin even 90 min after washout of the ligand vasopressin. The dopamine receptor DRD2 has not previously been classified as type A or B, but our data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref> strongly suggest that it is Class A, like DRD1, due to its transient association with arrestin. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref> shows the same experiment, but with ligand left on the cells for the entire duration of the experiment.

In these experiments, each cell in a population expresses a constant ‘bait’ protein and a variable ‘prey’ protein. If in a particular cell, the prey interacts with bait, a transcription factor is reconstituted, and transcription of a survival gene such as HIS3 ensues. However, existing two-hybrid assays have two major limitations: high background, resulting in many false positive identifications, and no temporal resolution: is it impossible to distinguish between PPIs that occurred 1 min after ligand addition versus 20 min after ligand addition, for example. These problems have prevented the application of existing PPI-dependent transcriptional assays, including split-ubiquitin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Petschnigg et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Fetchko and Stagljar, 2004</xref>) and TANGO (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Barnea et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Inagaki et al., 2012</xref>), to genetic selections in mammalian cells.

In contrast to SPARK, however, TANGO lacks a light gate, and it utilizes a higher affinity TEVp-TEVcs pair (with K<sub>m</sub> of 240 μM versus est. 450 μM for our system [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Kapust et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Kapust et al., 2001</xref>]) that reduces the dynamic range and increases the background of the assay. Furthermore, when applied to GPCRs, TANGO requires a vasopressin receptor 2 tail domain (V2 tail) to be fused to the GPCR’s C-terminal end, to artificially enhance arrestin recruitment and increase TANGO signal. Because TANGO is used extensively in the GPCR field for its simple and scalable design (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Kroeze et al., 2015</xref>), we performed a side-by-side comparison to SPARK. β2AR-arrestin2 SPARK and TANGO constructs used for the comparison are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1A</xref>.</p><p>HEK293T cells expressing the respective constructs were treated with light and isoproterenol for 15 min, then cultured for 9 hr, before quantitation of luciferase expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1B</xref>). The ±ligand signal ratio was 16.4-fold higher for SPARK than for TANGO under these conditions. Since the TANGO assay is typically performed with much longer periods of ligand stimulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Barnea et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Kroeze et al., 2015</xref>), we repeated the assay but increased the isoproterenol incubation to 18 hr (light period was still 15 min for SPARK). The TANGO ± ligand signal ratio increased from 1.2 to 1.5, but was still far lower than the SPARK signal ratio, which was 11.8. The main reason for this difference in performance appears to be high TANGO background in the no-ligand condition. SPARK has much lower no-ligand luciferase expression because the eLOV domain protects the TEVcs from cleavage in the dark state. In contrast, TANGO’s TEVcs is exposed throughout the entire period (hours to days) that the TANGO components are expressed, leading to high accumulated background.</p><p>Recently, a light-gated version of TANGO was reported, called iTANGO (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Lee et al., 2017</xref>). iTANGO was used to mark neurons exposed to dopamine in the mouse brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Lee et al., 2017</xref>). Though not explored for PPI detection, the design of iTANGO suggests that it could potentially also be applied to PPI detection. Thus, we performed a side-by-side comparison of iTANGO and SPARK as well, for the detection of isoproterenol-stimulated β2AR-arrestin interaction. The constructs used for the comparison are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1A</xref>, and the results are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1C</xref>. We found that under all conditions tested, iTANGO gave significantly higher background than SPARK. For example, there was 3 to 26-fold greater iTANGO-driven luciferase expression under dark/+ligand and light/no-ligand conditions, than SPARK-driven luciferase expression under the same conditions. This resulted in 2 to 3-fold greater ±ligand signal ratios for SPARK, and 5 to 14-fold greater ±light signal ratios, compared to iTANGO (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1C</xref>).</p><p>We hypothesize that the high background we observed with iTANGO derives mainly from its use of split TEV protease, whose fragments may have high affinity for one another, and reverse slowly, similar to other split proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Martell et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Kerppola, 2008</xref>). To test this possibility, we performed GPCR-arrestin time course assays using both SPARK and iTANGO. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1D and E</xref> show that SPARK signal reverses quickly after ligand washout, whereas iTANGO continues to gives signal for 15–45 min longer. This is consistent with iTANGO’s design ‘trapping’ PPIs, while SPARK’s design is much less perturbative.</p><p>Based on our collective observations, we conclude that SPARK is more sensitive, specific, and accurate than TANGO and iTANGO for PPI detection in cells.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>The SPARK assay we have developed converts a specific, transient molecular interaction into a stable and amplifiable reporter gene signal. As such, SPARK is highly versatile, able to drive luciferase expression for platereader assays, or fluorescent protein expression for microscopy or FACS-based cell selections. Though not shown here, it should be facile to couple SPARK to the expression of other reporter genes as well, including APEX for EM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Martell et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Lam et al., 2015</xref>) and proteomics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Rhee et al., 2013</xref>), antibiotic resistance genes, and various actuators such as opsins and toxins.</p><p>To develop SPARK, we optimized both the protease cleavage sequence and the light-sensitive LOV domain. The resulting tool is highly modular and generalizable; 12 of the 13 PPIs (including transmembrane as well as soluble proteins) we cloned into SPARK worked on the first try, without any optimization of geometries or linkers. SPARK is highly specific for direct PPIs, and is not activated merely by protein proximity (e.g., colocalization to the plasma membrane – <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>). We showed that only 5 min of light coinciding with a PPI event are sufficient to produce a stable signal that lasts for nine hours to days.</p><p>SPARK produces much larger signal-to-noise ratios than other PPI assays. When Presto-TANGO was applied to 167 different GPCRs, for example, the majority of them gave signal ratios between 1.3 and 5 (Ref. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Kroeze et al., 2015</xref>). In contrast, SPARK gave signal ratios &gt;15 for five of the eight GPCRs that we randomly selected, and signal ratios &gt;10 for other PPI pairs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B and C</xref>). The higher signal ratios result from two factors. First, noise is lower for SPARK because the LOV domain prevents proteolytic cleavage outside of the brief light window. Second, signal is higher for SPARK because our TEVp-TEVcs pair has higher catalytic turnover (est. 10.8 min<sup>−1</sup> for SPARK compared to 0.84 min<sup>−1</sup> for TANGO (Kapust et al., 2002); and iTANGO uses split-TEVp (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Lee et al., 2017</xref>) which is expected to have even slower turnover). As a result of improved signal ratio, SPARK can be used without artificial enhancement of native affinity (e.g., V2 tail), in contrast to both TANGO and iTANGO. And due to its higher sensitivity, SPARK can detect the activation of receptors that are opaque to other methods, such as ADRA1A and AGTR2 in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>, which gave no ±ligand signal difference with Presto-TANGO (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Kroeze et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>FRET is also commonly used to image cellular PPIs, and has been applied to GPCR-arrestin interactions in particular (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Nuber et al., 2016</xref>). SPARK also gives much larger signal-to-noise ratios than those observed in such FRET experiments (1.02–1.03 S/N in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Nuber et al., 2016</xref>), partly because SPARK incorporates signal amplification. SPARK is also more accessible to most laboratories, as it does not require specialized instrumentation or software as FRET imaging does.</p><p>Protein Complementation Assays (PCAs) are another commonly used alternative assay to detect and study cellular PPIs. Irreversible PCAs such as bimolecular fluorescence complementation (BiFC) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Kerppola, 2008</xref>) and split HRP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Martell et al., 2016</xref>) also integrate molecular events and produce stable signals, but unlike SPARK, they trap PPI partners in an irreversible complex that can perturb cellular signaling and give rise to false positives. Reversible PCAs such as split luciferase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Ozawa et al., 2001</xref>) do not trap, but they also do not produce stable signals that enable single time point readout or genetic selections as SPARK does. By integrating through a transcription factor, SPARK is unique in combining a non-trapping design with stable, integrated signal generation.</p><p>PPI dynamics are central to signal transduction but previous transcriptional assays were unable to probe this aspect of their biology. Due to SPARK’s light gate, we showed that it is possible to ‘time stamp’ PPI events, and even to reconstruct PPI time courses.</p><p>Future applications of SPARK might include examination of GPCR ‘biased’ signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bologna et al., 2017</xref>). Here, we used only arrestin-TEVp with our GPCR panel, but it should be possible to replace the arrestin gene with Gi, Gs, or Gq and compare intensities and time courses of G protein versus arrestin recruitment to GPCRs in response to various ligands. Our model selection using FACS also suggests that SPARK will have utility for PPI discovery and other functional genomics applications. Notably, while yeast two hybrid and split ubiquitin assays have been employed for yeast-based selections (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Fetchko and Stagljar, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Ito et al., 2001</xref>), we are not aware of any applications of these platforms or related ones to mammalian cell-based selections, perhaps because the signal-to-noise ratios of these assays are not sufficiently high to enable selection in mammalian cells.</p></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s3-1"><title>Plasmids and cloning</title><p>All constructs for transient expression were cloned into pAAV vector.

PEI was used for all imaging experiments shown in this study (except for the first three columns of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>) and for the genetic selection experiment in Figure 4. To perform PEI transfection, we treated HEK cells at 60–90% confluence with homemade PEI max solution (Polysciences catalog no. 24765; polyethylenimine HCl Max in H<sub>2</sub>O, pH 7.3, 1 mg/mL). For transfection of a single well in a 48-well plate, a mixture of DNA (15 ng of UAS-Citrine plasmid; 5–15 ng of SPARK protease plasmid; and 35 ng of SPARK TF plasmid) was incubated with 0.8 μL PEI max solution (1 mg/mL in H<sub>2</sub>O) in 10 μL serum-free DMEM media for 15 min at room temperature. 100 μL DMEM (Gibco) supplemented with 10% FBS (Sigma) was then mixed with the DNA-PEI max solution and added to the HEK293T cells. Cells were incubated at 37 °C under 5% CO<sub>2</sub> until further processing (typically, 15-18 hours). For the DNA quantities, we found that it was important to use a low quantity of SPARK protease DNA (5–15 ng/well in a 48-well plate) in order to achieve low background.</p></sec><sec id="s3-5"><title>HEK cell transfection with lipofectamine</title><p>For the luciferase platereader assays described in this study, we used lipofectamine to transfect HEK cells instead of PEI. The reason is that for this assay, we had to lift and further divide the cells into multiwell plates ~3 hr following transfection, and this is not compatible with the PEI protocol (which requires the PEI-DNA mixture to remain on the cells for &gt;12 hours) whereas it is compatible with the lipofectamine transfection protocol, described below. HEK293T cells were transfected at 60–90% confluence with Lipofectamine 2000 Transfection Reagent (Invitrogen). For transfection of a single well in a 6-well plate, a mixture of DNA (150 ng of the UAS-reporter plasmid; 100 ng of SPARK protease plasmid; and 350 ng of SPARK TF plasmid) was incubated with 8 μL Lipofectamine in 100 μL serum-free DMEM media for 15 min at room temperature.

For the same field of view, images were taken before and 5 min after isoproterenol treatment. For isoproterenol treatment, 100 μL isoproterenol in DPBS was gently added to the top of the coverslips to a final concentration of 10 μM.</p></sec><sec id="s3-22"><title>Cell based selection using SPARK (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>)</title><p>HEK cells stably expressing arrestin-TEVp Δ220–242 and CaM-TEVp Δ220–242 were co-cultured at a ratio of 1:50 in a T75 flask in 15 mL complete media, DMEM (Dublecco’s Modified Eagle medium, Gibco) supplemented with 10% FBS (Fetal Bovine Serum, Sigma) and 1% (v/v) Penicillin-Streptomycin (VWR, 5000 units/ml of penicillin and 5,000 μg/mL streptomycin), at 37°C under 5% CO<sub>2</sub>. At 40–60% confluence, the cells were transfected with UAS-citrine (1,125 ng, plasmid # 1 in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>) and β2AR-eLOV-TEVcs-FLAG-GAL4-V5 (2265 ng, plasmid # 6 in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>) using 60 μL PEI max, and the cells were wrapped in aluminum foil to prevent unwanted activation of the LOV domain by ambient room light. 18 hr post-transfection, the cells were stimulated with light (10 min, daylight lamp) and isoproterenol (10 μM final concentration) at 25°C. After stimulation, the cells were washed once and then further incubated with 15 mL complete media for 9 hr in the dark at 37°C under 5% CO<sub>2</sub>. The cells were then lifted with 3 mL trypsin (Invitrogen) and resuspended in 12 mL FACS buffer (ice cold RPMI buffer supplemented with 2% FBS (Fetal Bovine Serum, Sigma), 1% (v/v) Penicillin-Streptomycin (VWR, 5000 units/ml of penicillin and 5000 mg/mL streptomycin), and 20 mM HEPES buffer (Thermofisher)). 15 μL of the cells were pelleted and frozen at -80°C freezer right away for ‘pre-sort’ analysis. The rest of the cells were pelleted by centrifugation at 1000 r.p.m for 3 min at RT. The pellet was washed once with the FACS buffer and then resuspended in 3 mL FACS buffer to a final concentration of roughly 5 × 10<sup>6</sup> cells/mL. The cell suspension was filtered through the cell-strainer cap on the polystyrene tubes (FALCON, CAT# 352235) into the 5 mL polystyrene tubes (FALCON) and kept on ice until sorting.</p><p>FACS was performed on a SONY sorter (SH800S, 488 nm laser, optical filter 525/50), and a sorting gate was drawn to capture all the cells above the threshold of the CaM-TEV cells (determined by separate FACS analysis of a control sample). Before sorting, HEK cells were pipetted up and down five times and filtered again into the polystyrene tubes, to ensure complete separation between single cells and removal of cell clumps. During sorting, the source cells were pipetted up and down every 10 min to prevent aggregate formation. We tried addition of EDTA (1–5 mM) to prevent cell aggregation; however, cell recovery was poor (&lt;5% cells survived). Therefore, we used pipetting every 10 min during sorting instead to break up aggregates. In total, around 1000 cells (0.01% of total cells) were collected. Cells were sorted into a 15 mL conical tube with 4 mL FACS collection media (DMEM supplemented with 30% FBS (Sigma), 1% (v/v) Penicillin-Streptomycin (VWR, 5000 units/ml of penicillin and 5,000 μg/mL streptomycin) and 20 mM HEPES buffer (Thermofisher)).</p><p>The collected cells were immediately put on ice and pelleted by centrifugation at 1000x RPM at 25 °C for 3 min using eppendorf Centrifuge 5810 R. The media was gently removed. The cell pellet (not visible) was resuspended with 400 μL FACS collection media and transferred to a 1.6 mL eppendorf tube. The cells were pelleted again by centrifugation at 1000x g.</p></sec><sec id="s3-23"><title>RNA extraction from HEK cells and RNA reverse transcription</title><p>RNA was extracted from the pelleted cells from above following RNeasy Plus Mini Kit (QIAGEN). The cell pellet was resuspended in 350 μL RLT Plus buffer with 40 μM DTT and homogenized by pipetting up and down at least 10 times. The lysate was transferred to a gDNA Eliminator spin column and centrifuged at &gt;8000 x g for 1 min. 350 μL of 70% ethanol was added to the flow through, mixed and transferred to an RNeasy spin column.

A lightly edited version of the letter sent to the authors after peer review is shown, indicating the most substantive concerns; minor comments are not usually included.</p></boxed-text><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Time-gated detection of protein-protein interactions with transcriptional readout&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>, which was considered as a Tool and Resources article. Your article has been favorably evaluated by Philip Cole (Senior Editor) and two reviewers, one of whom, Volker Dötsch (Reviewer #1), is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>The authors describe the engineering and testing in cell culture of a system (TIGER) for reporting protein-protein interactions within a time window gated by blue light (time resolution ~5min) as transcriptional activation of a reporter gene.</p><p>The current work directly compares the performance of the TIGER system with the previously published iTango, since both focus primarily on GPCR-arrestin interactions. TIGER (current work) has better contrast +/- light and +/- agonist, primarily as a result of lower background, relative to iTANGO. It also has better kinetics which provide improved time resolution, both of which are beneficial in this approach. The current work attempts to generalize by showing several additional protein-protein interactions, including EGFR-Grb2, FRB-FKBP, and CIBN-CRY2PHR.</p><p>Overall, the work successfully improves upon molecular tools for driving transcription in response to light + protein+protein interactions, an approach which will likely prove valuable for many aspects of cell and systems biology. The approach appears general at some level across protein-protein interactions, although for some interactions the contrast is dramatically reduced and may require optimization.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Unfortunately, there is no quantification of experiments describing non membrane protein interactions, only low-resolution images of cell culture. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> shows that the efficacy of the approach varies widely depending on the specific protein-protein interaction being studied. A quantification of results from these protein-protein interactions (non-GPCR-arrestin) is required.</p><p>2) The method proposed is conceptually very similar to three systems published earlier this year:</p><p>Cal-Light:https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28650460</p><p>FLARE:https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28650461iTango:https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28369042</p><p>Despite the similarities with previously reported systems, there is no mention of these in the Introduction of this manuscript, where comparisons are drawn between TIGER and other molecular approaches for monitoring protein-protein interactions. These other techniques should be mentioned in the Introduction and similarities and differences to these systems should be discussed.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.30233.015</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Unfortunately, there is no quantification of experiments describing non membrane protein interactions, only low-resolution images of cell culture. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> shows that the efficacy of the approach varies widely depending on the specific protein-protein interaction being studied.

We now explicitly mention FLARE and what it is for, as soon as we begin to discuss the design of our SPARK tool, because that is the way that FLARE is relevant – in its design, but not in its purpose (its purpose is to sense calcium, not PPIs). iTango was published as a dopamine sensing tool, not a PPI detection methodology, and therefore we do not believe it is appropriate to mention it in our Introduction of PPI methods. Later in the manuscript, we have an entire section on iTango and a side by side comparison to SPARK (because we extrapolate that iTango <italic>could</italic> be used for PPI detection, even though the previous study did not demonstrate it). Cal-Light is even less relevant, as it is not for PPIs, and its design is different from that of SPARK and FLARE; nevertheless we do cite Cal-Light when we discuss LOV domain optimization.</p></body></sub-article></article>
