signalling but the mechanism of force detection and its coupling to Notch are unclear. We propose a role for Piezo1 channels, which are mechanically-activated non-selective cation channels. In cultured microvascular endothelial cells, Piezo1 channel activation by either shear stress or a chemical agonist Yoda1 activated a disintegrin and metalloproteinase domain-containing protein 10 (ADAM10), a Ca<sup>2+</sup>-regulated transmembrane sheddase that mediates S2 Notch1 cleavage. Consistent with this observation, we found Piezo1-dependent increase in the abundance of Notch1 intracellular domain (NICD) that depended on ADAM10 and the downstream S3 cleavage enzyme, γ-secretase. Conditional endothelial-specific disruption of Piezo1 in adult mice suppressed the expression of multiple Notch1 target genes in hepatic vasculature, suggesting constitutive functional importance in vivo. The data suggest that Piezo1 is a mechanism conferring force sensitivity on ADAM10 and Notch1 with downstream consequences for sustained activation of Notch1 target genes and potentially other processes.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>ion channel</kwd><kwd>notch signalling</kwd><kwd>proteinase</kwd><kwd>endothelial cell</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100004440</institution-id><institution>Wellcome</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>110044/Z/15/Z</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Beech</surname><given-names>David J</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000274</institution-id><institution>British Heart Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>RG/17/11/33042</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Beech</surname><given-names>David J</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000780</institution-id><institution>European Commission</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>H2020-MSCA-IF-2016 SAVE 748369</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Caolo</surname><given-names>Vincenza</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100003130</institution-id><institution>Fonds Wetenschappelijk Onderzoek</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>G091018N</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Jones</surname><given-names>Elizabeth AV</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Cell protease and cell fate decisions are regulated by a bone fide force-sensor, the Piezo1 channel, and by this means achieve integration with the mechanical environment.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Mammalian Notch proteins were identified following studies in <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> that linked genetic abnormality to wing notch (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Siebel and Lendahl, 2017</xref>). Extensive research then revealed major roles in the transfer of information between cells in health and disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Siebel and Lendahl, 2017</xref>). Each of the four Notch receptors (Notch1-4) is a membrane protein that is trans coupled to a membrane-anchored ligand such as Deltalike 4 (DLL4). Though the initiation of Notch signalling is often considered to occur through ligand-receptor complex formation, mechanical force also plays an important role in this activation whereby a pulling force arising from ligand endocytosis causes trans activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Siebel and Lendahl, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Gordon et al., 2015</xref>). Furthermore it became apparent that frictional force from fluid flow also stimulates Notch1, but how this force couples to the Notch mechanism is unknown (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Fang et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Mack et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Lee et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Jahnsen et al., 2015</xref>). Therefore mechanical forces would seem to play key roles in Notch regulation. Further information is needed on how this is achieved.</p><p>Piezo1 channels are key players in the sensing of shear stress and lateral force applied to plasma membranes (membrane tension) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Coste et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Murthy et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Li et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Rode et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Ranade et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Wu et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Maneshi et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Wang et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Beech and Kalli, 2019</xref>). While there are multiple candidate sensors, Piezo1 channels are notable because of broad agreement amongst investigators that they are direct sensors of physiological force. As such they are now considered to be bona fide force sensors that evolved to sense and transduce force as a primary function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Murthy et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Wu et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Beech and Kalli, 2019</xref>). Piezo1 channels are exquisitely sensitive to membrane tension (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Lewis and Grandl, 2015</xref>) and readily able to confer force-sensing capacity on cells that are otherwise poorly sensitive (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Coste et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Li et al., 2014</xref>). Reconstitution of Piezo1 channels in artificial lipid bilayers generates force-sensing channels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Syeda et al., 2016</xref>) and native Piezo1 channels in excised membrane patches respond robustly to mechanical force in the absence of intracellular factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Rode et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>Global knockout of Piezo1 in mice is embryonic lethal just after the heart starts to beat, apparently because of failed vascular maturation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Li et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Ranade et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Beech and Kalli, 2019</xref>). Particular functional significance is thought to arise in endothelial cells, where requirements in cell adherence, migration and proliferation and angiogenesis, wound closure, vascular permeability and blood pressure have been described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Beech and Kalli, 2019</xref>). Human genetic studies have suggested importance specifically in lymphatic vasculature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Fotiou et al., 2015</xref>) and varicose vein formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Fukaya et al., 2018</xref>). Piezo1, like Notch1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Siebel and Lendahl, 2017</xref>), is not restricted to endothelial cells or vasculature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Murthy et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Beech and Kalli, 2019</xref>). There are also roles in erythrocytes and immune cells, neural stem cells, skeletal muscle cells, fibroblasts and many other cells and systems, as reviewed recently (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Beech and Kalli, 2019</xref>).</p><p>Piezo1 channels are Ca<sup>2+</sup>-permeable non-selective cationic channels, so when force causes them to open there is Ca<sup>2+</sup> entry, elevation of the cytosolic Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentration and regulation of Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent mechanisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Coste et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Murthy et al., 2017</xref>). Potentially relevant to such a system is Ca<sup>2+</sup> and Ca<sup>2+</sup>-calmodulin regulation of ADAM10 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Nagano et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Maretzky et al., 2015</xref>), a metalloprotease or sheddase that catalyses rate-limiting S2 cleavage of Notch1 prior to γ-secretase-mediated S3 cleavage and release of Notch1 intracellular domain (NICD), driving downstream transcription (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Siebel and Lendahl, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Alabi et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Anders et al., 2001</xref>). Therefore, we speculated about a relationship between Piezo1 and Notch1. We focussed on endothelial cells where both proteins are prominent and have established functional significance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Siebel and Lendahl, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Murthy et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Li et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Rode et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Wu et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Alabi et al., 2018</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Shear stress-induced S3 cleavage of Notch1 is Piezo1 dependent</title><p>The canonical pathway for Notch1 activation involves cleavage at the S3 site, which generates NICD, a protein of about 110 kDa that can be detected by western blotting. The pathway was previously suggested to be activated by shear stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Mack et al., 2017</xref>). We first tested if we could reproduce the shear stress activation, using cultured human microvascular endothelial cells (HMVEC-Cs) as a model of endothelium. Laminar shear stress of 10 dyn.cm<sup>−2</sup> was applied to the cells for 1 hr and then abundance of NICD was measured. As expected, NICD was significantly increased (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a,b</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). We next validated a Piezo1-targeted siRNA for specific Piezo1 depletion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplements 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">3</xref>). Strikingly, depletion of Piezo1 strongly reduced the amount of NICD in the shear stress condition, so much so that it became similar to that of the static control siRNA condition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a,b</xref>). In some experiments there was unexpected reduction in NICD in the static (no shear stress) condition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref>) but accurate determination above non-specific background was technically challenging and the effect was not always evident. Although statistical analysis indicated no significant change in this basal NICD signal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1b</xref>), its existence in some individual experiments complicated our determination of whether shear stress induced an increase in NICD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a,b</xref>). Nevertheless, in some individual experiments there was clearly no effect of shear stress on NICD after Piezo1 depletion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref>) and statistical analysis of all experiments confirmed no significant effect of shear stress (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1b</xref>). The data suggest that Piezo1 is needed for normal elevation of NICD in shear stress and that it may be a factor regulating basal NICD.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Shear stress induced S3 cleavage of Notch1 is Piezo1 dependent.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) Representative Western blot labelled with anti-NICD and anti-GAPDH (loading control) antibodies for HMVEC-Cs exposed to 10 dyn.cm<sup>−2</sup> laminar shear stress (SS) for 1 hr.

Yoda1 is described to enhance the force sensitivity of Piezo1 channels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Syeda et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Lacroix et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Wang et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Evans et al., 2018</xref>).

Therefore we applied Yoda1 at 0.2 μM, the concentration previously reported for half-maximal activation of native endothelial Piezo1 channels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Evans et al., 2018</xref>). Strikingly, in static conditions, Yoda1 alone could stimulate increased NICD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1c,d</xref>). Piezo1 siRNA suppressed the Yoda1 effect (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1c,d</xref>). In these experiments, the effect of Piezo1 to reduce basal NICD was statistically significant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1d</xref>). The data support the hypothesis that Piezo1 is the sensor for shear stress that then triggers downstream Notch1 processing. The data also suggest a constitutive role of Piezo1 in maintaining a basal level of Notch1 cleavage.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>γ-secretase is required</title><p>S3 cleavage is mediated by γ-secretase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Siebel and Lendahl, 2017</xref>).

Therefore we measured ADAM10 enzymatic activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2a</xref>). Importantly, even after only 30 min shear stress, there was significant increase in ADAM10 activity and this effect was abolished by Piezo1 depletion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2a</xref>). Similarly, in static conditions, Yoda1 activated ADAM10, again consistent with Piezo1 being the starting point (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2b</xref>). The effect was prevented by the widely used ADAM10 inhibitor GI254023X ((2R,3S)−3-(Formyl-hydroxyamino)−2-(3-phenyl-1-propyl) butanoic acid[(1S)−2,2-dimethyl-1-methylcarbamoyl-1-propyl] amide) which is thought to act via the catalytic site (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Ludwig et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2b</xref>). We also quantified the abundance of ADAM10’s cleaved form, a 62–64 kDa protein that is generated by proprotein convertase to enable enzymatic activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Anders et al., 2001</xref>).

A 10-fold lower concentration of GI254023X (500 nM) also inhibited the Yoda1 effect on NICD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>), consistent with its nanomolar potency against ADAM10 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Ludwig et al., 2005</xref>).

Two weeks after disruption in vivo, endothelial cells were isolated and gene expression was measured acutely to reflect the normal Notch1 target gene expression in the endothelial cells of the mice. We elected to study hepatic microvascular endothelial cells because these cells were previously demonstrated to contain functional Piezo1 channels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Rode et al., 2017</xref>) and Notch1 has known relevance in liver endothelial sinusoids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Alabi et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cuervo et al., 2016</xref>).

Based on our data we propose a pathway in which activation of Piezo1 channels leads to stimulation of ADAM10 for S2 cleavage of Notch1, which then enables intracellular S3 cleavage of Notch1 by γ-secretase and release of NICD for association with transcriptional regulators such as RBPJ and the control of multiple Notch1 target genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). In this way, Notch1 is coupled to an exceptional force sensor, the Piezo1 channel. Other mechanisms by which Notch1 achieves force sensitivity are not excluded but we suggest that Piezo1 is a mechanism of biological significance because we found that endothelial-specific disruption of Piezo1 in vivo disturbed Notch1-regulated gene expression in hepatic endothelial cells, a site known to be Notch-regulated. Our findings are consistent with prior studies of <italic>D melanogaster</italic> that inferred Notch to be downstream of Piezo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">He et al., 2018</xref>) and so the proposed mechanism may have broad relevance.</p><fig id="fig5" position="float"><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><title>Summary of the proposed pathway.</title><p>Activation of Piezo1 channel by mechanical force (e.g. fluid flow) or chemical agonist (Yoda1) causes elevation of the intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentration which stimulates enzymatic activity of ADAM10 to cause S2 and S3 Notch1 cleavage and release of NICD to drive target gene expression that includes increased expression of Hes1, Dll4, Hey1, HeyL, Jag1, Hes2, Hes3 and Efnb2 in hepatic vasculature of the mouse. In the schematic we also include the suggested contributions from ADAM10/Notch1/NICD independent signalling from Piezo1 and non-canonical Notch1 signalling via the Notch1 transmembrane domain (TMD), as described and referenced in the text.</p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-50684-fig5-v2.tif"/></fig><p>The pathway proposed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref> is based primarily on evidence from our studies of human endothelial cells in culture (HMVEC-Cs) but we also investigated the relevance to endothelial cells in vivo by studying endothelium freshly isolated from whole liver of control and endothelial Piezo1 knockout (Piezo1<sup>ΔEC</sup>) mice. These hepatic experiments show that loss of Piezo1 in endothelium leads to reduced expression of multiple Notch1 target genes in endothelium. Therefore, the data suggest that Piezo1 positively impacts Notch1 target genes in vivo and that the pathway of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref> is active in vivo. There were intriguing differences in the Notch1 target genes affected by Piezo1 in HMVEC-Cs compared with freshly-isolated mouse endothelium, with a greater range affected in the mouse cells. Such data suggest context-dependent regulation of Notch1 target genes by Piezo1 or endothelial cell heterogeneity. Piezo1 activates not only ADAM10/Notch1 signalling but also calpain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Li et al., 2014</xref>), eNOS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Li et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Wang et al., 2016</xref>) and other signalling mechanisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Beech and Kalli, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Albarrán-Juárez et al., 2018</xref>). We speculate that these other pathways may also impact Notch1 target genes directly or indirectly, either to prevent or enhance the positive impact of Piezo1 via ADAM10 and Notch1.</p><p>The specific downstream implications of Piezo1-ADAM10/Notch1 signalling in the liver remain to be explicitly determined but we know that prior work showed important effects of endothelial-specific disruption of Notch1-regulated RBPJ on hepatic microvasculature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Alabi et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cuervo et al., 2016</xref>). Disruption of RBPJ in 6 week-old mice led to enlarged sinusoids between portal and central venules, and disruption earlier in postnatal development caused poor perfusion, hypoxia and liver necrosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cuervo et al., 2016</xref>). Therefore our observed requirement for Piezo1 in Notch1-regulated gene expression of hepatic endothelium suggests a positive role for the proposed Piezo1-ADAM10/Notch1 partnership in hepatic function. Moreover, roles of Piezo1 and Notch1 in chemotactic chemokine release, portal hypertension and liver fibrogenesis were recently suggested (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hilscher et al., 2019</xref>) and will be interesting to investigate further in regard to shear stress activation of Piezo1-ADAM10/Notch1 signalling. It is important to emphasise again, however, that Piezo1 signalling is extensive (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Beech and Kalli, 2019</xref>) and therefore unlikely to be limited to ADAM10/Notch1. Therefore, studies of Piezo1<sup>ΔEC</sup> mice will not inform specifically about the role of the Piezo1-ADAM10/Notch1 pathway. We will be able to determine the specific significance in vivo only if we first determine how to specifically disrupt this pathway relative to others.</p><p>The signalling pathway linking Piezo1 to ADAM10 is not precisely known and may involve yet to be identified components. We suggest that ion permeation through the Piezo1 channels is a critical starting point because Gd<sup>3+</sup>, a blocker of the Piezo1 channel ion pore (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Coste et al., 2010</xref>), prevented Yoda1 from stimulating ADAM10 activity. This suggests that cation flux is important. We suggest that it might be Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>) because Ca<sup>2+</sup> is an especially important intracellular messenger and prior work has shown Ca<sup>2+</sup> and Ca<sup>2+</sup>-calmodulin-regulated mechanisms for S2 cleavage of Notch1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Nagano et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Maretzky et al., 2015</xref>), but signalling mediated by Na<sup>+</sup> influx has also been suggested (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Rode et al., 2017</xref>) and cannot yet be excluded. It should be emphasised that the ADAM10 activity was measured after 30 min exposure to Yoda1, which is longer than the time required for maximum intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> elevation in response to Yoda1 (1 or 2 min). This time difference may reflect limited sensitivity of the ADAM10 activity assay compared with the intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> assay, which is known to be highly sensitive. Ca<sup>2+</sup> sensitivity of ADAM10 creates the potential for its regulation by various Ca<sup>2+</sup> entry and Ca<sup>2+</sup> release mechanisms. Piezo1 may, therefore, not be unique as a Ca<sup>2+</sup> entry mechanism regulating ADAM10 unless it has privileged spatial relationship with it, which is currently unknown.</p><p>Our observation of shear stress activation of ADAM10 via Piezo1 is consistent with previous work describing activation of ADAM10 by shear stress in human platelets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Facey et al., 2016</xref>), which also express Piezo1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Ilkan et al., 2017</xref>). The finding has implications for Notch1 signalling but also more widely because ADAM10 is a sheddase that also targets E- and VE-cadherin, CD44 and cellular prion protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Nagano et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Maretzky et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Schulz et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Jarosz-Griffiths et al., 2019</xref>). Therefore its shear stress regulation via Piezo1 may be broadly relevant, for example in adherens junction biology and cartilage integrity, where functional importance of Piezo1 is already suggested (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Friedrich et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Lee et al., 2014</xref>), and amyloid plaque formation, where Piezo1 was originally detected (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Satoh et al., 2006</xref>) and has been suggested to have functional importance in combination with <italic>E coli</italic> infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Velasco-Estevez et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>A challenging aspect of our HMVEC-C experiments was the tendency for the inhibition or depletion of ADAM10/Piezo1 to reduce the constitutive abundance of NICD. This created a technical limitation because the basal abundance of NICD in static conditions sometimes became difficult to distinguish from non-specific background signals, leading the reference point for any effect of shear stress to be different and potentially unreliable. In some data sets the impression can be gained of an approximate doubling of the abundance of NICD in the ADAM10/Piezo1-depleted or inhibited condition. This could suggest ADAM10/Piezo1-independent stimulation of Notch1 by shear stress, a possibility that we do not exclude, but it is important to recognise the following: (1) Any such effect of shear stress was small relative to the robust effect seen in control conditions; (2) The total abundance of NICD in the shear stress ADAM10/Piezo1-inhibited or depleted condition was only about the same as (or less than) that of static control conditions; (3) No apparent ADAM10/Piezo1-independent effect of shear stress was validated by statistical significance; and (4) In some experiments there was no change in basal signal and yet the effect of shear stress was abolished by Piezo1 depletion (ADAM10 activity and <italic>HEY1</italic> gene expression). Therefore we conclude that Piezo1 is the dominant mechanism for shear stress activation of ADAM10/Notch1 in HMVEC-Cs and suggest that this effect is relevant in vivo based on our studies of hepatic endothelium of Piezo1<sup>ΔEC</sup> mice.</p><p>It is unclear if the basal effect of Piezo1 on NICD in some experiments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a,d</xref>) is functionally important or related to mechanical force. Our data suggest lack of relevance to the Notch1-regulated genes investigated in HMVEC-Cs, although there was a hint of an effect in some experiments on <italic>HES1</italic> expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4a</xref>). There are several possible explanations for a basal effect on NICD because multiple signalling pathways are activated by Piezo1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Beech and Kalli, 2019</xref>). However, our favoured hypothesis is that basal mechanical activation of Piezo1 occurs via physical interaction of the cells with the substrate, which could explain the variability in the effect depending on the type of experiment. Previous work has shown that increasing substrate stiffness activates Piezo1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Pathak et al., 2014</xref>). Another interesting possibility is that basal regulation, and indeed shear stress-regulation, depends on relationships of Piezo1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Nourse and Pathak, 2017</xref>) and Notch1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Polacheck et al., 2017</xref>) to cytoskeleton that depend on how cells interact with each other and the substrate. We previously showed that Piezo1 depletion affects cytoskeletal structure in endothelial cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Li et al., 2014</xref>) and so there is a possibility that this plays a role in the interplay between Piezo1 and Notch1.</p><p>The pathway proposed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>) focusses on evidence from our study but, in addition, there may be relevance to non-transcriptional signalling through non-canonical exposure of the Notch1 transmembrane domain (TMD) to promote the formation of a complex of LAR phosphatase, TRIO guanidine-exchange factor and VE-cadherin and thus regulate barrier function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Polacheck et al., 2017</xref>) where Piezo1 has important roles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Friedrich et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Zhong et al., 2020</xref>). Piezo1 signalling would be expected to increase availability of the TMD but this remains to be tested experimentally.</p><p>A prior report has suggested lack of specificity of Yoda1 for Piezo1 channels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Dela Paz and Frangos, 2018</xref>) but other prior studies have shown that genetic deletion of Piezo1 abolishes Yoda1’s effects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Rode et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Friedrich et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Cahalan et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Romac et al., 2018</xref>) and that Piezo1 knockdown by RNA interference suppresses its effects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Wang et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Albarrán-Juárez et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Nonomura et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Iring et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Tsuchiya et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Liu et al., 2018</xref>), consistent with Yoda1 having only Piezo1-mediated effects. Specific structure-activity requirements of Yoda1 at Piezo1 have been observed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Evans et al., 2018</xref>) and Yoda1 does not activate Piezo2, the only other Piezo channel (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Syeda et al., 2015</xref>). Here we observed that Piezo1-specific siRNA suppressed or abolished Yoda1 effects. Although it is important to seek Piezo1-specific activation with agents such as Yoda1 (because mechanical force is not specific to Piezo1), such agents do not necessarily mimic activation by a physiological factor. Importantly, therefore, we showed that Yoda1 indeed mimicked the effect of laminar shear stress because shear stress similarly activated ADAM10, increased the abundance of NICD and stimulated Notch1 target gene expression in a Piezo1-dependent manner. Moreover, genetic disruption of endothelial Piezo1 in vivo, in the absence of Yoda1, led to loss of Notch1 signalling. Therefore Piezo1 regulation of the ADAM10/Notch1 pathway is physiological and not dependent on Yoda1.</p><p>In conclusion, we connect the Piezo1 mechanosensing ion channel with the extensive prior discoveries of the ADAM and Notch fields (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Siebel and Lendahl, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Alabi et al., 2018</xref>). The ability of Piezo1 to activate ADAM10 and Notch1 suggests that these mechanisms are downstream of Piezo1 and therefore linked via Piezo1 to changes in physiological force. There are likely to be broad-ranging implications for hepatic biology, as we suggest, but also for other biology linked to ADAM10 and Notch1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Siebel and Lendahl, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Alabi et al., 2018</xref>). Understanding how to specifically disrupt the Piezo1-ADAM10/Notch1 partnership will be important if we are to better decipher the roles of the pathway and explore its therapeutic potential.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th>Reagent type <break/>(species) or resource</th><th>Designation</th><th>Source or reference</th><th>Identifiers</th><th>Additional information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Strain, strain background (<italic>Mus musculus,</italic> C57BL6/J, male)</td><td>Piezo1<sup>flox/flox</sup>/Cdh5-Cre</td><td>University of Leeds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Rode et al., 2017</xref>)</td><td>N/A</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Cultured cells (<italic>Homo sapiens</italic>)</td><td>HMVEC-Cs</td><td>Lonza</td><td>Cat# CC-7030</td><td/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Antibody</td><td valign="top">anti-cleaved Notch1 val1744 (D3B8) (Rabbit monoclonal)</td><td valign="top">Cell Signaling Technology</td><td valign="top">Cat# 4147, RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/AB_2783876">AB_2153348</ext-link></td><td valign="top">WB (1:1000)</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Antibody</td><td valign="top">anti-ADAM10 (Rabbit polyclonal)</td><td valign="top">Merck Millipore</td><td valign="top">Cat# AB19026, RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/AB_2783876">AB_2242320</ext-link></td><td valign="top">WB (1:1000)</td></tr><tr><td>Sequence-based reagent</td><td valign="top">ON-TARGET plus Control siRNA</td><td valign="top">Dharmacon</td><td valign="top">Cat# L-001810</td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td>Sequence-based reagent</td><td valign="top">ON-TARGET plus SMARTpool Human siRNA ADAM10</td><td valign="top">Dharmacon</td><td valign="top">Cat# L-004503</td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td>Sequence-based reagent</td><td valign="top">Piezo1 siRNA</td><td valign="top">Sigma-Aldrich</td><td valign="top">N/A</td><td valign="top">GCAAGUUCGUGCGCGGAUU[DT][DT]</td></tr><tr><td>Commercial assay or kit</td><td>SensoLyte 520 ADAM10 Activity Assay Kit</td><td>AnaSpec Inc</td><td>Cat# AS-72226</td><td>Use kit directions</td></tr><tr><td>Chemical compound, drug</td><td>GI 254023X</td><td>Tocris Bioscience</td><td>Cat# 3995</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Chemical compound, drug</td><td>DAPT</td><td>Sigma-Aldrich</td><td>Cat# D5942</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Chemical compound, drug</td><td>Yoda1</td><td>Tocris Bioscience</td><td>Cat# 5586–10</td><td/></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap><sec id="s4-1"><title>Piezo1 mutant mice</title><p>All animal use was authorized by the University of Leeds Animal Ethics Committee and Home Office UK (Project Licence P606320FB to David J Beech).

Cells were then washed in SBS at room temperature for 30 min, allowing deesterification to release free fura-2. Fluorescence (F) acquisition (excitation 340 and 380 nm; emission 510 nm) was performed on a Flexstation three microplate reader with SoftMax Pro 5.4.5 software (Molecular Devices). After 60 s of recording, Yoda1 was injected. Ca<sup>2+</sup> entry was quantified after normalization (ΔF340/380 = F340/380(t)-F340/380(t = 0)).</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>Immunoblotting</title><p>Proteins were isolated in RIPA buffer supplemented with PMSF, protease inhibitor mixture, and sodium orthovanadate (RIPA Lysis Buffer System, sc24948, Santa Cruz, Dallas, TX). Samples were heated at 95°C for 5 min in SDS-PAGE sample buffer, loaded on a precast 4–20% polyacrylamide gradient gel (4561094, Biorad) and subjected to electrophoresis. Proteins were transferred onto a nitrocellulose membrane (Trans-Blot Turbo RTA Mini Nitrocellulose Transfer Kit, 1704270, BioRad) for 30 min using Trans-Blot Turbo Transfer System (BioRad). Membranes were blocked with 5% milk in Tris-buffered saline with Tween 0.05% for 1 hr at room temperature. The membranes were exposed to primary antibody overnight at 4°C, rinsed and incubated with appropriate horseradish peroxidase-labelled secondary antibody for 1 hr at room temperature. The detection was performed by using SuperSignal West Femto (34096, ThermoFisher Scientific) and visualized with a G-Box Chemi-XT4 (SynGene, Cambridge, UK). GAPDH was used as reference protein.</p></sec><sec id="s4-10"><title>Reagents</title><p>Human cardiac microvascular endothelial cells (HMVEC-C, CC-7030, Lonza), DAPT (D5942, Sigma-Aldrich), GI254023X (3995, Tocris Bioscience, Bristol, UK), Yoda1 (5586/10, Tocris Bioscience), ON-TARGET plus Control siRNA (Dharmacon, Lafayette, CO), siRNA Piezo1 (Sigma-Aldrich: 5’- GCAAGUUCGUGCGCGGAUU[dT][dT]- 3’), ON-TARGET plus SMARTpool human siRNA ADAM10 (Dharmacon), cleaved Notch1 Val1744 D3B8 rabbit monoclonal (4147, Cell Signaling Technology, Danvers, MA), rabbit anti-ADAM10 (AB19026, Merck KGaA, Darmstadt, Germany), goat anti human VEGFR2 (AF357, R and D system, Minneapolis, MN), mouse anti-human PECAM-1 (CD31) (M0823, Agilent Dako, Santa Clara, CA), GAPDH mouse anti-human (10R-G109b, Fitzgerald Industries International, Acton, MA) and anti-mouse, anti-rabbit and anti-goat HRP conjugated secondary antibodies (Jackson ImmunoResearch, Ely, UK).</p></sec><sec id="s4-11"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>All averaged data are presented as mean ± standard deviation (SD). Statistical significance was determined using two-tailed <italic>t</italic>-test when only two groups were compared or by 2-way ANOVA followed by Tukey posthoc test when multiple groups were treated with vehicle control (DMSO) or Yoda1 were studied. When distribution of data were compared, two-tailed Fisher’s exact test was used. The genotypes of mice were blinded to the experimental investigator and studied at random according to Mendelian ratio. In all cases, statistical significance was assumed for probability (<italic>P</italic>) &lt; 0.05. NS indicates when no significant difference was detected. Statistical tests were performed using OriginPro 8.6 software or GraphPad Prism 6.0. The letter n indicates the number of independent biological experiments and its value in each case is stated in figure legends. The number of replicates per independent experiment was one for western blotting, two for qPCR, four for Ca<sup>2+</sup> assays and one for the ADAM10 activity assay.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>The study was supported by EU Marie Skłodowska Curie Individual Fellowship to VC and by grants from the Wellcome Trust and British Heart Foundation to DJB and a Fonds Wetenschappelijk Onderzoek grant G091018N to EAVJ.

What follows is the decision letter after the first round of review.]</p><p>Thank you for submitting your work entitled &quot;Piezo1 channel activates ADAM10 sheddase to regulate Notch1 and gene expression&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Julien Vermot (Reviewer #3).</p><p>Having considered your plan for revisions, our decision has been reached after consultation between the editors. Based on these discussions and the individual reviews below, we regret to inform you that your work will not be considered further for publication in <italic>eLife</italic>.</p><p>It is our view that the submitted plan does not address at all the main reviewers' comments (that were defined as &quot;essential&quot;), but mainly provides explanations as to why the experiments are not necessary or cannot be performed.</p><p>Specifically, in response to point 1, which was one of the major criticisms, the authors do not explain which experiments (if any) they plan to carry out. In response to point 2 and point 3, only a minor experiment would be performed.</p><p>Based on the submitted plan, we anticipate that a revised manuscript would not address the essential concerns raised by the reviewers and therefore we have decided against inviting re-submission.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic></p><p>In this study Caolo and co-workers propose a mechanism linking between mechanical forces and Notch1 regulation in endothelial cells, which involves Piezo1 channels and ADAM10 enzymatic activity. Specifically, the authors use the small-molecule Yoda1 to activate Piezo1 channels in HMVECs and assess the cleavage and release of NICD, as well as the levels of expression of downstream Notch1 targets such as Hes1 and Dll4. Using a similar approach, the authors investigate also the potential role of Piezo1 as inducer of ADAM10 enzymatic activity, and show that this step is involved as well in NICD release. Finally, the authors propose that this mechanism is physiologically relevant by showing that liver endothelial cells isolated from Piezo1<sup>∆EC</sup> mice display specific downregulation of Notch1 target genes.</p><p>Overall, the work could be of potential interesting as it identifies a putative mechanistic link between mechanical forces and Notch activation. However, the data come across as being somewhat preliminary and quite speculative. While the presented experiments appear solid in terms of numbers, most assumptions are based solely on a single assay (Yoda1 agonist to activate Piezo1, enzymatic assay to assess ADAM10 activity, etc), making it difficult to reach accurate conclusions. Moreover, some of the results appear over-interpreted and too strong to be drawn from the presented data. For instance, while the authors aim to demonstrate the link between mechanical forces and Notch activation, there's only one experiment that applies actual shear stress, whereas the large majority is based solely on the addition of a small molecule to the medium.</p><p>An additional major weakness of this manuscript is that there is a significant imbalance between the characterization of HMVECs and mouse Piezo1<sup>∆EC</sup> liver endothelial cells. Given that mouse-derived ECs, which provide a more physiological platform, were available to the authors, it is unclear why they didn't use this system to characterize the proposed molecular mechanisms.</p><p>Finally, the manuscript is written in a rather superficial way, with no proper elaboration of the observed phenotypes and/or the significance of most of the results. The Introduction and Discussion could be significantly improved by a more detailed, critical, in depth analysis of the findings. Likewise, the Results section will benefit from a more elaborated presentation.</p><p>As a whole, this manuscript presents an interesting hypothesis, however it appears to lack the broad scope and impact necessary for publication in <italic>eLife</italic>, and therefore I believe it might suit better a more specialized journal.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>Notch1 has recently been shown to be activated by fluid shear stress in endothelial cells and to mediate flow-dependent gene regulation and stabilization of the vascular barrier. The mechanism by which flow induces Notch1 activation has however remained unclear. Caolo et al. now provide data indicating that the mechanosensitive cation channel Piezo1 links fluid shear stress via calcium-dependent regulation of proteinases to the activation of Notch1. This is an exciting new finding, which may be of broader relevance for the understanding of Notch1 physiology and pathophysiology. In several points the study, however, appears a little bit fragmentary and preliminary, and a couple of additional experiments are required to better support the major conclusions of this manuscript.</p><p>1) With one exception, all the in vitro data are based on activation of Piezo1 by Yoda1. While Yoda1 appears to be a specific activator of Piezo1, it remains an unphysiological way to stimulate the pathway. It is important that the authors test whether also a physiological endothelial stimulus, such as fluid shear stress, promotes the formation of NICD and the activation of Notch1 downstream gene expression in a Piezo1-dependent manner.</p><p>2) The authors use inducible endothelium-specific Piezo1-deficient mice to show that loss of Piezo1 in hepatic sinusoidal endothelial cells results in reduced expression of Notch1-regulated genes. This is an interesting finding but not sufficient to make a strong point as this could also be an indirect phenomenon. It is at least necessary to determine in the Piezo1-deficient liver endothelial cells the formation of NICD and the activity of ADAM10 and/or γ-secretase. To test the physiological significance of this observation, the authors should also consider studying sinusoid development after early postnatal induction of endothelial Piezo1 deficiency or later in adult animals in the context of liver regeneration after e.g. partial hepatectomy.</p><p>3) A recently published study describes that shear stress triggers DLL4-dependent proteolytic activation of Notch1 as a mechanism linking fluid shear stress to the stabilization of the endothelial barrier (doi: 10.1038/nature24998). Since this study suggests a somewhat different mechanism of shear stress-induced Notch1 activation, the authors need to discuss this manuscript and test whether Piezo1 mediates e.g. internalization of DLL4 as suggested in this publication.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic></p><p>In this study, Caolo et al. are investigating the mechanism that provides force sensing properties to the notch receptor. The authors provide a nice explanation by implicating piezo1, a well-established stretch sensitive receptor, and a Ca<sup>2+</sup>-regulated transmembrane sheddase that mediates S2 Notch1 cleavage. The results are based on convincing in vitro and in vivo data and are expected to have a significant impact in the field.</p><p>I only have a few comments to improve the work:</p><p>I have an issue with the timing of the experiments: the authors are assessing fast responses related to piezo and calcium (seconds/minutes) but use tools such as siRNA or conditional KO that takes hours/days to inactivate function.

While as stated by the authors the paper is improved, the reviewers are still not fully convinced about the findings and feel that the new data do not fully address their major concerns. Accordingly, the changes summarized below will be essential in order for <italic>eLife</italic> to further consider this manuscript for publication.</p><p>1) Testing the effect of Piezo1 knockdown on shear stress induced generation of NICD was an important experiment missing from the manuscript. The authors have not been able to do the experiment in primary cells, however they did it in HMVECs. What they actually found was that both the basal as well as the stimulated level of the NICD was greatly reduced after knockdown of Piezo1, while the shear stress induced increase doesn't appear to be affected (Figure 1A of revised manuscript). This is not really convincing and needs to be further explored.</p><p>2) In Figure 1A the authors should provide the ratio of NICD intensity before and after stimulation in both conditions. Looking at the graphs, it seems that this ratio may not be different. This might suggest that piezo known down may have additional effect (such as on cell cytoskeletal properties) in addition to its shear sensing functions as previously suggested by reviewer #3. This point has not been fully addressed in this revised version.</p><p>3) It is not clear why the authors were not able to study the mechanism in whole livers. Any data supporting the proposed mechanism on the in vivo level would be absolutely required to strengthen the manuscript.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were suggested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Shear stress activates ADAM10 sheddase to regulate Notch1 via the Piezo1 force sensor in endothelial cells&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>.

However, they agree that their major comment regarding the in vivo work has not been successfully addressed. In particular, they refer to the inability to see changes in NICD levels in liver endothelial cells lacking Piezo1. While the reviewers understand that this may result from technical reasons, they feel that without these data the manuscript lacks conclusive in vivo evidence for the proposed mechanism linking Piezo1 and expression of Notch1 target genes. Therefore, they request the following changes so that this fact is reflected in the final manuscript:</p><p>1) You should add in the scheme (Figure 5) an arrow indicating the possibility of an Adam 10/Notch/NICD independent mechanism</p><p>2) You should also include the alternative mechanism of flow-induced Notch signalling described by Polacheck et al., 2017.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.50684.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p>[Editors’ note: The authors appealed the original decision.

While we don’t show such changes specifically for the liver, it is expected that they will be seen in endothelial Piezo1 knockouts if studied at suitable time-points.

We have added a specific section in the Results. The result suggests that it is indeed the fast Piezo1 ion-permeation mechanism that is responsible for the ADAM10/Notch1 activation. We speculate that effects such as ADAM10 activation and NICD formation are triggered quickly but that it then takes time for sufficient accumulation that is detectable by available assays, which are relatively insensitive.

While as stated by the authors the paper is improved, the reviewers are still not fully convinced about the findings and feel that the new data do not fully address their major concerns. Accordingly, the changes summarized below will be essential in order for eLife to further consider this manuscript for publication.</p><p>1) Testing the effect of Piezo1 knockdown on shear stress induced generation of NICD was an important experiment missing from the manuscript. The authors have not been able to do the experiment in primary cells, however they did it in HMVECs. What they actually found was that both the basal as well as the stimulated level of the NICD was greatly reduced after knockdown of Piezo1, while the shear stress induced increase doesn't appear to be affected (Figure 1A of revised manuscript). This is not really convincing and needs to be further explored.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for drawing attention to this important aspect. We had been too concise and not properly explained the data. Moreover, the example raw data of Figure 1A were not representative of the statistical outcome of the experiments and so we changed to another example.</p><p>The statistical outcome of the experiments is that stimulated NICD was reduced to the control level, whereas basal NICD was not affected and shear stress (SS) did not increase NICD above the basal level in the Piezo1 knockdown (siPiezo1) group (Figure 1B). We added “NS” (Not Significant) to Figure 1B to clarify the statistical outcome. Therefore, the concerns raised are not correct according to the statistical analysis. Nevertheless, we understand why there was concern and accordingly changed Figure 1A to another example, revised the text to help understanding and better recognised the complexity and potential limitations of the underlying data through addition of discussion.</p><p>More repetitions of the experiment could be done if these changes were felt to be unsatisfactory, but power calculation analysis using the known variance and anticipated effect size indicates that n=17 independent repeats per group would be required to achieve statistical significance for an effect of shear stress after knockdown of Piezo1. This implies that there is an effect to be detected, but one that is difficult to prove under these conditions. Such an n value would be much in excess of norms for this type of labourintensive and time-consuming experiment and could be construed as biased in favour of detecting an effect when a relatively small n value was sufficient to demonstrate significance in the control group.</p><p>We had previously used the absence of asterisks to indicate no significant difference but addition of “NS” makes it clearer. We therefore now inserted NS throughout all 11 data figures.</p><p>Below we briefly consider the issues regarding Figure 1A, B:</p><p>Knockdown of Piezo1 strongly reduced the amount of NICD in the Shear Stress (SS) condition, in fact so much so that it became similar to the Static condition (siCtrl). This result is seen in the example data of Figure 1A and quantitative data of Figure 1B, in which “SS siPiezo1” was not significantly (“NS”) different from “Static siCtrl”; whereas “SS siPiezo1” was significantly less than SS siCtrl (** P &lt; 0.01). We added “NS” to Figure 1B to clarify.</p><p>From the quantitative data of Figure 1B we must conclude that knockdown of Piezo1 had no effect on basal NICD in these experiments. We have clarified by adding “NS” but we recognise that there is an appearance of decreased basal NICD in the mean data and such a decrease is evident in the individual experiment shown in Figure 1A (“Static siPiezo1” <italic>cf</italic> “Static siCtrl”). Moreover, related quantitative data of Figure 1D show significant effect on basal NICD (Figure 1D, “DMSO siPiezo1” <italic>cf</italic> “DMSO siCtrl”), apparently contradicting Figure 1B. The experiments of Figure 1B and Figure 1D were, however, not exactly the same. Most obviously the experiments of Figure 1d included DMSO, but Figure 1B was also done in a separate special chamber to enable shear stress studies. We suggest, therefore, that the ability of Piezo1 to regulate basal NICD is particularly sensitive to the cell environment (more sensitive than the effect of Piezo1 to enable induction of NICD by Shear Stress). We have added discussion of this topic.</p><p>We appreciate that any effect of treatment on basal NICD creates a challenge for determining the effect of shear stress on top of this because the reference point (basal NICD) is (or may be) different. We added discussion of this matter to better recognise it, explain that it is a potential limitation of the study and to suggest interpretations (e.g. about why there might be a basal effect and why it might be variably observed).</p><p>Importantly, the independent data of Figure 4 (B, C) cleanly demonstrate Piezo1-dependence of shear stress effects on Notch1-target gene activation without complication from basal effects.</p><p>We accept that the data are not as simple as might be hoped because of the issues around the basal signal. It is clear throughout the study that the topic of basal NICD regulation is an unexpected, interesting and relevant one, as is the topic of the effect of shear stress on top of the basal signal.</p><p>To the Results we added and revised as follows:</p><p>“Strikingly, depletion of Piezo1 strongly reduced the amount of NICD in the shear stress condition, so much so that it became similar to that of the static control siRNA condition (Figure 1A, B). […] The data suggest that Piezo1 is needed for normal elevation of NICD in shear stress and that it may be a factor regulating basal NICD.”</p><p>To the Discussion we added and revised as follows:</p><p>“A challenging aspect of our HMVEC-C experiments was the tendency for the inhibition or depletion of ADAM10/Piezo1 to reduce the constitutive abundance of NICD. […] We previously showed that Piezo1 depletion affects cytoskeletal structure in endothelial cells (9) and so there is a possibility that this plays a role in the interplay between Piezo1 and Notch1.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) In Figure 1A the authors should provide the ratio of NICD intensity before and after stimulation in both conditions. Looking at the graphs, it seems that this ratio may not be different. This might suggest that piezo known down may have additional effect (such as on cell cytoskeletal properties) in addition to its shear sensing functions as previously suggested by reviewer #3. This point has not been fully addressed in this revised version.</p></disp-quote><p>The first part of this point is closely related to point 1, to which we responded above.</p><p>If we normalise the “Static siPiezo1” data of the Figure 1B to 1.0, the “SS siPiezo1” NICD data appear almost two times larger (to be precise, 1.85 times). As you have identified, this is already apparent in the original presentation of Figure 1B. It remains the same in the revised version. It is important to note that changing the presentation does not change the fact that there was no significant difference. We have correctly reached conclusions based on the results of the statistical tests but now provide better explanation and discussion to help with the situation, as described in response to point 1.</p><p>We draw attention to the raw data of Figure 1A where the basal NICD signal in “Static siPiezo1” was seen to be weak and only just above background. Using such data as a reference, or normalisation, point is precarious and leads to large variation in the associated data. Moreover, it can be seen that the NICD signal was generally weak in the siPiezo1 group, which we think explains, at least in part, the high variance of these data points. We also added discussion about this point to the main manuscript, as described above.</p><p>Despite these difficulties, it is clear that the total amount of NICD achievable in the Shear Stress condition was much less after Piezo1 knockdown, and validated strongly by objective statistical analysis.</p><p>The second part of this point relates to additional effects of Piezo1 knockdown and potential roles of the cell cytoskeleton. We completely agree that Piezo1 has multiple effects and we worked to make this clearer in the Discussion. Our group has provided some of the evidence in the literature and we recently comprehensively reviewed all of the available evidence – we cite this work and other work. We now further enhanced the discussion on these points by providing more details on the cytoskeleton, referring to possible roles of Piezo1 in addition to shear stress sensing and developing a hypothesis for how Piezo1’s relationship to cytoskeleton might be an explanation for regulation of basal NICD.</p><p>We added discussion as follows:</p><p>“There are several possible explanations for a basal effect on NICD because multiple signalling pathways are activated by Piezo1. […] We previously showed that Piezo1 depletion affects cytoskeletal structure in endothelial cells (9) and so there is a possibility that this plays a role in the interplay between Piezo1 and Notch1.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) It is not clear why the authors were not able to study the mechanism in whole livers. Any data supporting the proposed mechanism on the in vivo level would be absolutely required to strengthen the manuscript.</p></disp-quote><p>We apologise that this wasn’t sufficiently clear. We worked to improve this section. Such data are in the section entitled “Endothelial Piezo1 is required for Notch1 target gene expression in mice” and associated Figure 4 and Figure 4—figure supplements 2 and 3. There was no change in Notch1-target gene expression in whole liver of endothelial-specific Piezo1 knockouts (Figure 4—figure supplements 2 and 3). Endothelium is a minor fraction of whole liver. When we separated the endothelium (without cell culture), we saw clear effects on Notch1-target genes (Figures 4). Therefore, we show data supporting the proposed mechanism at the in vivo level; i.e., using knockout mice and the study of freshly-isolated endothelium from whole liver.</p><p>We have worked to achieve NICD-specific staining in tissue sections but the quality of NICD antibodies is limited, especially for detecting a decrease of NICD below basal levels (the expected effect of Piezo1 knockout). We have added discussion to recognise this limitation.</p><p>Piezo1 signals to multiple pathways, not only ADAM10 and Notch1. Therefore, studies in search of a liver phenotype of Piezo1 knockouts will not specifically address the Piezo1ADAM10-Notch1 hypothesis and would cause a loss of focus that could be misleading by implying an in vivo role of Piezo1-ADAM10-Notch1 signalling that might actually be due to some other function of Piezo1.</p><p>We revised and enhanced the Discussion as follows:</p><p>“The specific downstream implications of Piezo1-ADAM10/Notch1 signalling in the liver remain to be explicitly determined but we know that prior work showed important effects of endothelial-specific disruption of Notch1-regulated RBPJ on hepatic microvasculature. […] We will be able to determine the specific significance in vivo only if we first determine how to specifically disrupt this pathway relative to others.”</p><p>If there are further experiments you would like us to consider, we would be grateful if you would take into account that the Covid-19 outbreak has caused our laboratories to be temporarily shut down and many of our animals to be culled. Significant time, planning and new resource would be needed to provide new in vivo data. Limits on current funding and contracts might prevent such work if our campus shutdown continues for an extended period.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were suggested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Revisions:</p><p>The reviewers were pleased with the way you responded to their concerns. However, they agree that their major comment regarding the in vivo work has not been successfully addressed. In particular, they refer to the inability to see changes in NICD levels in liver endothelial cells lacking Piezo1. While the reviewers understand that this may result from technical reasons, they feel that without these data the manuscript lacks conclusive in vivo evidence for the proposed mechanism linking Piezo1 and expression of Notch1 target genes. Therefore, they request the following changes so that this fact is reflected in the final manuscript:</p><p>1) You should add in the scheme (Figure 5) an arrow indicating the possibility of an Adam 10/Notch/NICD independent mechanism</p><p>2) You should also include the alternative mechanism of flow-induced Notch signalling described by Polacheck et al., 2017.</p></disp-quote><p>We made the requested changes to Figure 5. We accordingly added this sentence to the Figure 5 legend:</p><p>“In the schematic we also include the suggested contributions from ADAM10/Notch1/NICD independent signalling from Piezo1 and non-canonical Notch1 signalling via the Notch1 transmembrane domain (TMD), as described and referenced in the text.”</p><p>We reference and describe the Polacheck work in the manuscript.</p></body></sub-article></article>
