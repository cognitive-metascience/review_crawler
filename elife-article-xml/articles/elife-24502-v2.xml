system. Increased <italic>DYRK1A</italic> gene dosage, such as occurs in Down syndrome, is known to affect neural progenitor cell differentiation, while haploinsufficiency of <italic>DYRK1A</italic> is associated with severe microcephaly. Using a set of known and newly synthesized DYRK1A inhibitors, along with CRISPR-mediated gene activation and shRNA knockdown of <italic>DYRK1A</italic>, we show here that chemical inhibition or genetic knockdown of <italic>DYRK1A</italic> interferes with neural specification of human pluripotent stem cells, a process equating to the earliest stage of human brain development. Specifically, DYRK1A inhibition insulates the self-renewing subpopulation of human pluripotent stem cells from powerful signals that drive neural induction. Our results suggest a novel mechanism for the disruptive effects of the absence or haploinsufficiency of <italic>DYRK1A</italic> on early mammalian development, and reveal a requirement for <italic>DYRK1A</italic> in the acquisition of competence for differentiation in human pluripotent stem cells.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>Homo sapiens</kwd><kwd>pluripotent</kwd><kwd>stem cell</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>None</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000923</institution-id><institution>Australian Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Special Research Initiative SR1101002</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ovchinnikov</surname><given-names>Dmitry A</given-names></name><name><surname>Elefanty</surname><given-names>Andrew G</given-names></name><name><surname>Stanley</surname><given-names>Edouard G</given-names></name><name><surname>Wolvetang</surname><given-names>Ernst J</given-names></name><name><surname>Pera</surname><given-names>Martin</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000925</institution-id><institution>National Health and Medical Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Senior Research Fellowship</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Elefanty</surname><given-names>Andrew G</given-names></name><name><surname>Stanley</surname><given-names>Edouard G</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001782</institution-id><institution>University of Melbourne</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Strategic APA</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Bellmaine</surname><given-names>Stephanie F</given-names></name><name><surname>Williams</surname><given-names>Spencer J</given-names></name><name><surname>Pera</surname><given-names>Martin</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Small molecule inhibition of stem cell differentiation in vitro provides novel insight into how DYRK1A loss disrupts human nervous system development.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The dual-specificity tyrosine-phosphorylation-regulated (Dyrk) kinases belong to a family collectively referred to as CMGC kinases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Aranda et al., 2011</xref>) that includes cyclin dependent kinases, mitogen associated protein kinases, glycogen synthase kinases, and cyclin dependent-like kinases The distinguishing biochemical features of Dyrk kinases are their ability to phosphorylate serine, threonine and tyrosine residues, and the autoregulation of their kinase activity through tyrosine phosphorylation. The five mammalian Dyrk kinases are divided into two classes. The Class 1 kinase DYRK1A has been implicated in a diverse variety of biological processes, including central nervous system development, Down syndrome, cancer, beta cell proliferation and diabetes, and Alzheimer’s disease, and the discovery of novel DYRK1A inhibitors has been a goal of many recent studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abbassi et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Aranda et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Shen et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Smith et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Stotani et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p><italic>DYRK1A</italic> has multiple roles in central nervous system development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Tejedor and Hämmerle, 2011</xref>).

Studies of DYRK1A overexpression have elucidated some of its functions during neurogenesis. In embryonic neuroepithelium, a transient increase in DYRK1A expression results in the cessation of the proliferative divisions that expand the progenitor compartment, and premature entry of these cells into a pro-differentiation neurogenic pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hämmerle et al., 2011</xref>). In several model systems, DYRK1A overexpression led to exit of neural stem cells from the cell cycle, through mechanisms involving cyclin D1 and p53 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Najas et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Park et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Soppa et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Yabut et al., 2010</xref>). <italic>DYRK1A</italic> gene dosage also affects later stages of neurogenesis, including neuronal dendritogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Benavides-Piccione et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Göckler et al., 2009</xref>). DYRK1A has also been implicated in tau protein phosphorylation in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer’s disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Coutadeur et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>Previously we showed that the indole derivative ID-8, in combination with WNT3A, could maintain human embryonic stem cells (hESC) in long-term culture under defined conditions in the absence of exogenous activators of the nodal or FGF signalling pathways, both of which are generally considered to be essential for human pluripotent stem cell (hPSC) maintenance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hasegawa et al., 2012</xref>). In the presence of WNT3A, ID-8 modestly enhanced hESC plating efficiency, and strongly inhibited the induction of lineage specific differentiation genes normally observed following WNT treatment of undifferentiated stem cells. Using affinity chromatography, we found that ID-8 bound to Dyrk family members DYRK2 and DYRK4 in extracts of human pluripotent stem cells. We further showed that stable knockdown of <italic>DYRK1A</italic> and <italic>DYRK2</italic> caused a modest increase in the plating efficiency of hESC, but we did not establish whether this effect was related to enhancement of attachment and survival, or to inhibition of differentiation. Thus although these studies suggested an important action of ID-8 on hESC through modulation of Dyrk kinase activity, the actual molecular target of the compound related to its specific biologic activities remained unclear.</p><p>In this study we examine the biological activity of ID-8 and a related series of novel indole compounds to determine the role of Dyrk kinase inhibition in stem cell regulation. Human kinome screening, structure activity relationships and targeted gene activation and inactivation studies implicate DYRK1A as the biologically significant target of ID-8. We show that DYRK1A inhibition results in a block to neural specification of human embryonic stem cells. This block is not a uniform response across the entire hPSC population, but instead reflects the ability of DYRK1A inhibitors to insulate the self-renewing subpopulation of hESC from powerful differentiation induction signals. We consider these results in the context of stem cell fate determination, and the deleterious effects of <italic>DYRK1A</italic> loss on central nervous system development.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Specificity of a series of indole kinase inhibitors for DYRK1A</title><p>We examined the specificity of kinase inhibition by ID-8 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref>) and a related series of novel indole compounds using a biochemical in vitro assay. ID-8 was screened against a panel of 339 human protein kinases by measuring incorporation of radioactive ATP into appropriate substrates (Reaction Biology). Activity (based on percentage inhibition at a 10 μM dose of ID-8) against the top ten protein kinase targets, and several members of the CMGC family, are listed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1b</xref>. The specificity of the compound is displayed in a kinome inhibition map in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1c</xref> (for the complete results of the screen, see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>). ID-8 indeed showed selectivity against the CMGC kinase family, with DYRK1B, GSK3B and DYRK1A being the top three kinase targets. Although a biotinylated derivative of ID-8 bound DYRK2 and DYRK4 in affinity chromatography pull down assays (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hasegawa et al., 2012</xref>), ID-8 itself showed little activity against these kinases, or against DYRK3. Next we determined IC<sub>50</sub> values for a subset of these kinase targets, using the same <sup>33</sup>P incorporation assay (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>). This study revealed the high specificity of ID-8 for DYRK1A and DYRK1B, and confirmed a lack of activity against DYRK2 and DYRK4. Inhibition of PIM1, GSK3A, GSK3B, and CLK4 at IC<sub>50</sub> values between 280–450 nM was also observed.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.24502.002</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Protein kinase inhibition by ID-8.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) ID-8 structure.

The 1 and 6 positions were targeted because modelling studies (discussed below) implicated the –OH and –OCH<sub>3</sub> groups as critical to binding at the active site of DYRK1A. The NO<sub>2</sub> group was modified since this group might lead to unwanted pharmacological properties in vivo, such as metabolic conversion to toxic nitroso or hydroxylamine derivatives. These compounds were prepared using: (1) the Nenitzescu reaction used for the preparation of ID-8 itself (for compounds <bold>48</bold> and <bold>49</bold>); (2) by derivatization of ID-8 (for compounds <bold>28, 29, 30, 34, 35</bold>); or (3) by Fischer indole synthesis (compounds <bold>38</bold> and <bold>51</bold>). The synthetic pathways used to form these analogues are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref> and described in detail in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref>.</p><p>Biochemical screening of the analogues against the top ten kinase hits for the parent ID-8 are shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2">Table 2</xref>. Compounds <bold>28</bold>, <bold>30</bold> and <bold>48</bold> showed excellent selectivity for DYRK1A and DYRK1B. In particular, compound <bold>28</bold> showed much less activity against DYRK1B, CLK1, GSK3B or LRRK2, relative to ID-8. Compound <bold>30</bold> showed better selectivity against DYRK1A relative to CLK1, CLK4 or GSK3A. Compound <bold>48</bold> showed a similar spectrum of kinase inhibition to ID-8 but was less potent against DYRK1A and DYRK1B. Compound <bold>45</bold> showed activity against all of the kinases in the selected panel and maintained high potency of inhibition of DYRK1A and DYRK1B.

This effect was further enhanced by addition of WNT3A. WNT3A alone promoted propagation of hESC, but also strongly induced expression of differentiation markers. The addition of ID-8 to WNT3A- treated cells partially suppressed the induction of differentiation markers seen in the presence of WNT3A alone. We therefore first investigated the effects of ID-8 alone on hESC cultured under conditions that promote self-renewal. Propagation of hESC in the presence of ID-8 did not affect the cell cycle distribution of hESC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1a–b</xref>), or the overall distribution of the proportion of cells in the culture bearing stem cell surface markers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1c</xref>).

Given the importance of DYRK1A in the development of the nervous system, we chose to examine the effects of ID-8 and its homologues on early neural specification in hESC. We used the combined inhibition of BMP and nodal/activin signalling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chambers et al., 2009</xref>) to induce neural specification, and assayed the conversion of hESC to neural progenitors by flow cytometry using a PAX6 reporter cell line developed in our laboratories (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2a</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>, and Materials and methods).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.24502.006</object-id><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Inhibition of neural specification of hESC by ID-8.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) design of time course experiments.

However, we observed a clear morphological difference between control cells that had been induced with dual SMAD only versus cells that also received ID-8. The former had formed obvious rosette structures characteristic of early neural differentiation by Day 16, whereas the latter more nearly resembled pluripotent stem cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2b</xref>). Flow cytometry analysis showed that the addition of dual SMAD inhibitors led to the induction of the early human neural progenitor marker PAX6 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Zhang et al., 2010</xref>) in about 75% of cells after 16 days. By contrast, in the presence of ID-8, there was a dose dependent reduction in PAX 6 induction to around 5% of control levels at 5 μM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2c</xref>). We studied the time dependency of the ID-8 effect, to determine whether the compound was required during neural induction or later, after transfer to neural progenitor media. ID-8 had to be present during the period of neural induction and neural progenitor formation to achieve full inhibition of PAX6 expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2d</xref>); it had no effect if added after the neural induction period. The decrease in PAX6 expression caused by ID-8 was accompanied by a decrease in NESTIN staining and an increase in POU5F1 staining in treated colonies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2e</xref>). We also evaluated the expression of stem cell surface markers in cultures subjected to neural induction alone or in the presence of ID-8. We have previously shown that flow cytometry using the cell surface markers GCTM-2 and CD9 can identify a continuum of pluripotent stem cell states within the population (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Hough et al., 2014</xref>). Induction with dual SMAD inhibition alone resulted in a rapid depletion of the entire pluripotent stem cell population (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2f</xref>). The addition of ID-8 had an unusual effect. As in control cells, dual SMAD inhibition resulted in loss of stem cell marker expression across much of the population, but the fraction expressing the highest level of stem cell markers persisted (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2f</xref>). The proportion of cells remaining in this fraction relative to the rest of the population was markedly increased (140 fold) when ID-8 was present during dual SMAD inhibition.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Effects of known DYRK1A and GSK3β inhibitors and ID-8 analogues on neural specification of hESC</title><p>We then examined the effect of a series of known inhibitors of DYRK1A (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3a</xref>) for effects in the PAX6 induction assay.

ID-8 docks such that there is a hydrogen bond from the 6-hydroxyl to the amide group of L241, which is achieved from a slightly different direction to LDN-211898 by binding deeper into the active site, while the <italic>para</italic>-methoxy group of ID-8 is bound to E203 (adjacent to the amino group of K188). The distance between the two interacting atoms of ID-8 is 8.22 Å, similar to that of other DYRK1A inhibitors. Similarly, the amino group of K188 hydrogen bonds to the <italic>para</italic>-hydroxyl group of ID-8 by placing this hydroxyl group deep into the binding site. Compound <bold>45</bold> was able to dock into the binding site of 5AIK (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5c</xref>) forming hydrogen bonds between the 6-hydroxyl and the amide nitrogen of L241 (2.97 Å) as well as the backbone carbonyl group of E239 (3.09 Å). The nitro group formed an interaction with the primary amino group of K188 (3.02 Å). The distance between the two interacting oxygen atoms of compound <bold>45</bold> is 7.78 Å. While compound <bold>45</bold> did not dock in the same mode as ID-8 it is easily be envisaged that this mode of binding is possible, as this compound possesses the same key polar interaction oxygens present in ID-8. A confounding factor encountered in docking both ID-8 and <bold>45</bold> is that the nitro group is more polar than the other two hydrogen bonding groups, and the docking algorithm is biased towards placing this group within the site to achieve polar interactions.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Here we present evidence that the indole compound ID-8 and a series of related molecules act to inhibit the neural specification of hESC through inhibition of DYRK1A. Our biochemical studies revealed that ID-8 is a relatively specific inhibitor of DYRK1A, and that the activity of a series of related compounds on neural specification most closely correlated to their ability to inhibit this enzyme. Further, in pluripotent stem cells specifically engineered to overexpress DYRK1A, neural specification induced by dual SMAD inhibition is enhanced, and this effect is offset by addition of ID-8 or other DYRK1A inhibitors. Finally, DYRK1A knockdown phenocopied the effect of the inhibitors on PAX6 expression during neural specification.</p><p>Our docking analysis provides a set of possible binding modes for ID-8 and compound <bold>45</bold>, which allow a rationalization of the potency of ID-8 analogues (Table 2) as inhibitors of DYRK1A. For example, the lack of inhibition for compounds <bold>38</bold> and <bold>51</bold> likely arise from the absence of a hydroxyl group at position 6 which therefore cannot interact with L241. Substitution at this position with a methyl group in compound <bold>28</bold> led to a small reduction in potency, while larger acetyl or benzyl in compounds <bold>29</bold>, <bold>30</bold> and <bold>34</bold> led to a marked reduction in potency. Compounds <bold>48</bold> and <bold>49</bold>, bearing methoxy groups oriented <italic>ortho</italic> or <italic>meta</italic>, respectively, cannot make ideal interactions with E203. Studies in man have implicated missense mutations affecting residues around the proposed binding site of ID-8 and compound <bold>45</bold> in the microcephaly syndrome associated with <italic>DYRK1A</italic> deficiency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Ji et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>hPSC provide powerful models for understanding early human development. The biological actions of the DYRK1A inhibitors described here provide new insight into the effect of the absence of this kinase on neural development in the embryo. In human or mouse, hemizygous loss of <italic>DYRK1A</italic> leads to microcephaly, a severe disorder of brain development. Some of the phenotypes of <italic>Dyrk1a</italic> knockout mouse, and haploinsufficient humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bronicki et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Courcet et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Fotaki et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Ji et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Møller et al., 2008</xref>), could be explained by an action at a very early stage of lineage specification in the embryo. Our previous work showed that ID-8 treatment of hESC blocked the ability of WNT3A to induce expression of mesoderm or endoderm genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hasegawa et al., 2012</xref>). This study reveals that DYRK1A inhibition specifically interferes with the early specification of hESC to neural fates. Together, these findings suggest that <italic>DYRK1A</italic> loss might exert a profound effect on endowment of the three germ layer lineages in homozygous or heterozygous null embryos. <italic>Dyrk1a</italic> homozygous null mice die at E10.5, with growth delay in multiple organ systems, including heart, brain, liver and branchial arches. Humans heterozygous for loss or mutation of <italic>DYRK1A</italic> display severe microcephaly, but also commonly show developmental delay and intrauterine growth retardation. It is possible that failure to allocate sufficient numbers of pluripotent progenitors into the three germ layer lineages could result in generalised developmental deficiencies and delay, along with severe central nervous defects. The neural specification assay here is suitable for rapid screening of the effects of DYRK1A inhibition on neural development in human cells, and could aid in development of novel inhibitors, as could the CRISPR mediated DYRK1A induction assay, which mimics the gene dosage effect of DYRK1A overexpression in Down syndrome. Indeed, the results of this assay suggest that DYRK1A inhibitors could be used to ameliorate neural phenotypes in Down syndrome, though clearly the dose of the agents would need to be controlled rather precisely to avoid excessive reduction in enzyme activity.</p><p>Our observations are in contrast to previously reported actions of DYRK1A inhibition in mouse embryonic stem cells, where treatment with epigallocatechin-gallate caused reduced expression of pluripotency genes and enhanced expression of mesodermal and endodermal lineage specific genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Canzonetta et al., 2008</xref>). However, epigallocatechin-gallate is a broad spectrum kinase inhibitor that lacks specificity for DYRK1A, and its effects on mouse ES cells could be attributable to interference with other pathways, or to species differences in stem cell regulation.</p><p>The actions of DYRK1A inhibitors on human pluripotent stem cells provide important insight into the role of this kinase in stem cell regulation. ID-8 treatment did not affect expression of stem cell markers in cultures maintained under conditions that support self-renewal. Neither did the compound affect proliferation of stem cells maintained under these conditions. We showed previously that ID-8 could promote colony formation of hESC, but this effect was modest, except in combination with WNT3A. The strongest effect of treatment of hESC with ID-8 observed in our previous work was the inhibition of induced differentiation. In cells treated with WNT3A (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hasegawa et al., 2012</xref>), WNT3A induction of mesodermal and endodermal genes was strikingly attenuated by ID-8. Here we showed that the powerful neural induction using dual SMAD inhibition could be offset by treatment of stem cells with ID-8.</p><p>Careful inspection of flow cytometry profiles after ID-8 treatment revealed that the response of the cell population to DYRK1A inhibition was not homogenous. In fact, a large proportion of cells treated with dual SMAD inhibition with or without ID-8 lost stem cell surface markers. However, in ID-8 treated cultures, the cellular subset bearing the highest levels of stem cell markers appeared to remain intact, and indeed was proportionally expanded 140 fold in differentiating cultures relative to other subpopulations under the condition of DYRK1A inhibition. We have previously shown that this cellular subset represents the self-renewing component of hESC cultures, and that it has molecular properties distinct to the bulk of the stem cell population (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Hough et al., 2014</xref>). Recently we have observed that this subpopulation of hESC has an unusual cell cycle, with a short or non-existent G1 phase compared to the remainder of the population (unpublished). It is known that hPSC become competent to respond to differentiation signals in G1 phase of the cycle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Boward et al., 2016</xref>). Our results suggest that DYRK1A inhibition by ID-8 prevents the self-renewing subpopulation from acquiring competence to respond to induction of differentiation, rendering it refractory to strong extrinsic inductive signals. Thus, transition to a differentiation permissive state may require activation of DYRK1A, an effect that may be actuated through the lengthening of G1 in the self-renewing population. Inhibition of DYRK1A could prevent the lengthening of the G1 phase and thereby block progression of the self-renewing hESC subpopulation towards neural specification. Further study of DYRK1A will provide additional insight into its role in early development, and the mechanism whereby its activity modulates the competence of hESC to respond to inducers of lineage specification.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>DYRK1A inhibitors and other compounds</title><p><bold>LDN193189</bold> (Stemgent, Lexington, MA, #130-096-226), <bold>SB431542</bold> (Stemgent, #130-097-448), <bold>CHIR99021</bold> (Stemgent, #130-095-555) and harmine hydrochloride (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, #SMB00461) were purchased from commercial suppliers.

Sequences representing the 3.6 Kb 5’ homology arm were amplified by PCR and subsequently cloned into a vector containing a PGKNeo selection cassette and sequences corresponding to the 7.8 Kb 3’ homology arm, the latter having been previously introduced into this plasmid using recombineering. This vector was then linearised at an Mlu1 site at the junction of the 5’ homology arm and the PGKNeo selection cassette, enabling the sequential introduction of a T2A sequence that replaced the PAX6 stop codon and, an mCherry-IRES-puromycin cassette.

Your article has been reviewed by two peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Marianne Bronner as the Senior Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>We have now received two reviews on your manuscript &quot;Inhibition of DYRK1A Disrupts Neural Lineage Specification in Human Pluripotent Stem Cells&quot;. While the second reviewer is more enthusiastic than the first, there seems to be general agreement that the manuscript is potentially publishable in <italic>eLife</italic> after additional experimental work is done.</p><p>Essential Revisions:</p><p>Since the paper focuses heavily on ID-8 and its analogues, it is very important to show definitively that the action of the compounds is truly via inhibiting DYRK1a. It is not sufficient to show that particular compounds have activities in cell-free systems that appear to translate into their effects on cells. The authors themselves state that some of the enzymes that can be inhibited by the compounds are not even expressed in huES cells. Moreover, it may be that the potency differences observed across a series of compounds can be ascribed to variability in cellular permeability. Thus, as requested by both reviewers, it is key that the authors provide more evidence that the compounds act on target cells at their effective concentrations by inhibiting DYRK1A and not, for example, GSK3β. Furthermore, as requested by both reviewers, more information should be provided as to the details of compound testing in cell-free assays and on the ES cells. These items are addressed in detail by Reviewer 1 (points 1-3); Reviewer 2 (point 3b). In addition, please make clear what conclusions you are drawing from <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>. Along those lines, both reviewers also request that you show convincingly using genome modification methods that DYRK1a reduction or deletion phenocopies the effects of your compounds.</p><p>In addition, both reviewers would like you to show that the compounds have similar effects on more than 1 huES line.

Using a computational model, the authors rationalized the SAR within the series on DYRK1A. Using these chemical tools, together with the cell line reporting the level of PAX6 expression, as well as CRISPR-mediated gene activation, the authors argue that the inhibition of DYRK1A prevents the neural specification of huES cells. The ID-8 is previously proposed to be the potential DYRK inhibitor, although not as characterized, and the molecular mechanisms underlying DYRK1A's effect is not characterized in this report.</p><p>1) The methods for the kinase assays in Table 1 and 2 should be detailed, including the source of kinase protein preparation, substrate peptides, K<sub>m</sub> for each peptide substrate, and ATP? Is each assay performed at Km for substrate and K<sub>m</sub> for ATP? As the IC<sub>50</sub>s of the chemical compounds depend on the kinase assay condition, such information must be provided, and critical in evaluating the results for specificity. Why the discrepancy between Table 1, and Table 2 in terms of the IC<sub>50</sub>s of ID8 against DYRK1A (0.054 vs. 0.104μM), GSK3b (0.45μM vs. 0.15μM)?</p><p>2) For the evaluation of cellular activities of ID8 series compounds, dose responses of key compounds in this assay, should be included in the Table 2. Cellular toxicity needs to be addressed. At 5 μm, does ID-8 cause any reduction in the number of cultured cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>, right panel)? CRISPR-mediated conditional deletion of DYRK1A would be a direct and conclusive genetic evidence to demonstrate that DYRK1A is necessary to support the neural specification, and should be included in the argument.</p><p>3) It is not conclusive whether GSK3b underlies the effect of ID-8 on neural specification, as CHIR99021 has an effect on PAX reporter assay. CHIR99021 has a different profile across kinome, and the noticed difference on Oct-4 expression may be derived from off-target effects of CHIR99021. Providing a GSK3b dependent cellular readout with ID-8 compounds in these cells, such as p-tau, or p-CRMP, could help answer wither ID-8 compounds hit GSK3b in these cells.</p><p>4) The author showed that ID-8 compounds blocked the neural specification, most likely through inhibiting DYRK1A. Previously, it is shown that ID-8 promotes the stem-ness of huES cells by promoting self-renewal (Hasegawa et al., 2012). Are the observations in this report merely reflecting the fact that the huES cells in the presence of ID8 have more stem-ness, hence resistance to be induced for any lineage specialization, or that DYRK1A is a key switch for neural lineage specification? Can huES cells be induced into neurons, in the presence of ID8, by overexpressing neurogenin2 that bypass the neuroprogenitor stage (Sudhof lab, 2013 Neuron)? In either case, the molecular targets need to be identified/discussed to provide a mechanism for such observation, are EGFR, FGF, p53 etc. involved in such a functional role (PMID 20237271; PMID 18771760; Ferron et al., 2010).</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic> </p><p>In their manuscript entitled &quot;Inhibition of DYRK1A Disrupts Neural Lineage Specification in Human Pluripotent Stem Cells,&quot; Bellmaine et al. demonstrate that the addition of ID-8, and similar chemical inhibitors of DYRK1A, prevents hESCs from differentiating to NPCs.

It is not sufficient to show that particular compounds have activities in cell-free systems that appear to translate into their effects on cells. The authors themselves state that some of the enzymes that can be inhibited by the compounds are not even expressed in huES cells. Moreover, it may be that the potency differences observed across a series of compounds can be ascribed to variability in cellular permeability. Thus, as requested by both reviewers, it is key that the authors provide more evidence that the compounds act on target cells at their effective concentrations by inhibiting DYRK1A and not, for example, GSK3β.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with this point and provide new data and some additional background information to address these concerns. First, with respect to inhibition of GSK3b as a potential mechanism (the active compounds in our study showed some inhibitory activity towards this kinase), we showed in the first submission that the potent and selective GSK3b inhibitor CHIR 99021 also reduced PAX6 induction following dual SMAD inhibition, similar to DYRK1A inhibitors. However, we argued that the action of CHIR 99021 was fundamentally different to that of DYRK1A inhibitors, because treatment with the latter agent but not the former resulted in retention of a pluripotent phenotype. We based this claim on indirect immunofluorescence staining for nestin and POU5F1 following CHIR 99021 treatment shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref> (compare to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref> with ID-8). We grant that this evidence on its own is fairly weak, so we now provide further support for this interpretation. First we cite previous studies showing that inhibition of GSK3b in combination with SMAD inhibition in hPSC indeed blocks PAX6 induction but directs cells towards other neural fates-neural crest or more caudal neural precursors (1-4) subsection “Effects of known DYRK1A and GSK3β inhibitors and ID-8 analogues on neural specification of hESC”, last paragraph. These studies (which we should have noted in the first submission) are consistent with our findings on CHIR 99021 but fundamentally different to our results with ID-8. We also provide new immunocytochemistry and flow cytometry data which confirm results in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref> and show that while co-treatment of cells with ID-8 (or another DYRK1A inhibitor, compound 28) and dual SMAD inhibition results in retention of pluripotent phenotype by a significant fraction of cells, co-treatment with CHIR 99021 plus dual SMAD inhibitors results in complete loss of stem cell marker expression across the population, similar to dual SMAD inhibition alone subsection “Effects of known DYRK1A and GSK3β inhibitors and ID-8 analogues on neural specification of Hesc”, last paragraph, and new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D, E</xref>.
