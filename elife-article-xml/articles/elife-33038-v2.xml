be key for developing effective universal vaccines. Mutations in the framework regions of such broadly neutralizing antibodies (bnAbs) have been reported to play a role in determining their properties. We used molecular dynamics simulations and models of affinity maturation to study specific bnAbs against HIV. Our results suggest that there are different classes of evolutionary lineages for the bnAbs. If germline B cells that initiate affinity maturation have high affinity for the conserved residues of the targeted epitope, framework mutations increase antibody rigidity as affinity maturation progresses to evolve bnAbs. If the germline B cells exhibit weak/moderate affinity for conserved residues, an initial increase in flexibility via framework mutations may be required for the evolution of bnAbs. Subsequent mutations that increase rigidity result in highly potent bnAbs. Implications of our results for immunogen design are discussed.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>affinity maturation</kwd><kwd>broadly neutralizing antibodies</kwd><kwd>molecular dynamics</kwd><kwd>framework mutations</kwd><kwd>HIV</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>None</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100006227</institution-id><institution>Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>LLC Award #B620960</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ovchinnikov</surname><given-names>Victor</given-names></name><name><surname>Louveau</surname><given-names>Joy E</given-names></name><name><surname>Karplus</surname><given-names>Martin</given-names></name><name><surname>Chakraborty</surname><given-names>Arup K</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Ragon Institute of MGH, MIT and Harvard</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>MGH Internal Fund #214931</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Louveau</surname><given-names>Joy E</given-names></name><name><surname>Barton</surname><given-names>John P</given-names></name><name><surname>Chakraborty</surname><given-names>Arup K</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>CHARMM Development Project</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ovchinnikov</surname><given-names>Victor</given-names></name><name><surname>Karplus</surname><given-names>Martin</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Computer simulations of the evolution of broadly neutralizing antibodies against HIV suggest that non-traditional pathways involving framework mutations which lead initially to increased antibody flexibility do occur, but can be avoided by appropriate vaccine design.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The HIV/AIDS epidemic affects more than 37 million individuals worldwide, and there were 2 million new infections in 2014 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Deeks et al., 2015</xref>). The introduction of antiretroviral drugs in the 1990s has made HIV infection a manageable condition, but less than half of the persons diagnosed with HIV remain in care in the United States. In sub-Saharan Africa, the epicenter of the disease, this problem is far more acute. Vaccination is a way to confront this challenge and eradicate the disease. One major obstacle to developing a universal vaccine is the high mutability of HIV (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Korber et al., 2001</xref>). In order to prevent new infections, the vaccine-induced immune response must protect against a great diversity of circulating HIV strains. Antibodies (Abs) that can neutralize a broad diversity of HIV strains, known as broadly neutralizing antibodies (bnAbs), are of great interest in this regard because they have shown potential to both prevent new infection in animal models and to control existing infection for some duration in both human and animal models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Barouch et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Klein et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Mascola et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Moldt et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Lu et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>BnAbs naturally evolve in only a subset of HIV-infected patients, and usually in low titers after several years of infection. The isolation of bnAbs from patients provides proof that the human immune system can evolve such antibodies. Past attempts at eliciting them by vaccination have failed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Kong and Sattentau, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">McCoy and Weiss, 2013</xref>). Many efforts are currently underway to design immunogens and vaccination strategies that can induce bnAbs. Despite significant progress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Shaffer et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Wang et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Escolano et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Steichen et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bonsignori et al., 2016</xref>), a vaccination protocol that can efficiently induce bnAbs in non-human primates or humans is not available.</p><p>The key process in the development of Abs is a Darwinian evolutionary process known as affinity maturation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Shlomchik and Weisel, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Victora and Nussenzweig, 2012</xref>). A B cell is activated upon binding of its B cell receptor (BCR) to a part of the proteins (epitope) that constitutes the antigen (e.g., spikes on the surface of viruses). Activated B cells can seed structures called germinal centers (GCs) in lymph nodes where affinity maturation occurs. During affinity maturation (AM) B cells proliferate, and upon induction of the activation-induced cytidine deaminase (AID) gene, mutations are introduced in the receptor at a high rate (somatic hypermutation). The B cells with mutated BCRs then interact with the antigen displayed on the surface of Follicular Dendritic Cells (FDCs). The B cells undergo selection to favor those with receptors that bind more strongly to the target epitope. Upon immunization with a single antigen, as cycles of diversification and selection ensue in the GC, antibodies with increasingly higher affinity for the antigen are produced (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Eisen and Siskind, 1964</xref>).</p><p>For an HIV vaccine to produce bnAbs, immunization with a single strain of antigen will likely not suffice as it would lead AM to produce strain-specific antibodies. Immunization with multiple variant antigens that have the same amino acid sequence at conserved positions on the viral spike proteins, but diverse amino acids at the surrounding positions, are likely to be required. An example set of conserved residues is the CD4 binding site, which is a part of the epitopes targeted by certain bnAbs. Recent studies have suggested that the variant antigens can act as conflicting selection forces, which frustrate the Darwinian evolutionary process of AM under some conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Shaffer et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Wang et al., 2015</xref>). Under some circumstances, the importance of sequential immunization with variant antigens for the induction of bnAbs has been shown (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Wang et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Escolano et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Steichen et al., 2016</xref>), and the possibility of designing optimal cocktails of variant antigens has also been noted (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Dosenovic et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Shaffer et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>BnAbs exhibit unusual structural features such as a high degree of somatic hypermutation (including insertions and deletions) in the antigen binding regions known as the complementarity determining regions (CDRs), as well as changes in the surrounding framework regions (FWR) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Scheid et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Sok et al., 2013</xref>). Most efforts to understand the evolution of bnAbs have concentrated on mutations in the CDRs. However, mutations in FWRs that are spatially separated from the antigen-binding site may also affect binding properties. For example, Klein et al. showed that, for the bnAbs they studied, the reversal of FWR mutations reduces breadth and potency. However, the FWR mutations had no effect on non-broadly neutralizing antibodies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Klein et al., 2013</xref>). This finding implies that FWR mutations can be important for the broadly neutralizing activity, and it has been proposed that FWR mutations increase neutralizing breadth by providing the Ab with greater conformational flexibility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Scheid et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Klein et al., 2013</xref>). A subsequent study of the 4E10 bnAb also found a high degree of plasticity in the mature antibody (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Finton et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>The implications of these studies contradict the established paradigm of antibody maturation, which suggests that antibodies progressively become more rigid as AM ensues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Schmidt et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Eisen and Chakraborty, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Foote and Milstein, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Wedemayer et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Thorpe and Brooks, 2007</xref>). Since bnAbs evolve upon undergoing AM induced by multiple variant antigens, different selection forces may be at play.</p><p>A recent study on a class of enzymes showed that adaptation to different ligands in a PDZ domain preferentially occurred not only through mutations in the ligand-binding site, but rather through a collection of distant mutations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Raman et al., 2016</xref>). These mutations worked allosterically to enable multiple conformational states, therefore allowing binding to a diversity of ligands during adaptation. This finding, and those reported by Nussenzweig and co-workers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Scheid et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Klein et al., 2013</xref>), led us to hypothesize that mutations in the framework region (FWR) of BCRs could potentially affect the conformational states of the antigen binding region and allow BCRs to bind to a broad range of variant antigens present during AM induced by natural infection or vaccination. This may, in turn, enable B cells to better negotiate the conflicting selection forces represented by the variant antigens and thus facilitate the evolution of bnAbs.</p><p>To explore this hypothesis, we used molecular dynamics (MD) simulations to quantify the structural flexibility of antibodies obtained at different stages of AM in three bnAb lineages. These studies were augmented by a simplified computational model of AM in the presence of multiple variant antigens that simulated the effect of mutations in both the CDR and the FWR to provide insight on the evolution of flexibility and its influence on breadth.</p><p>Our results suggest that distinct evolutionary pathways are followed during the evolution of breadth and potency in bnAbs, and we provide mechanistic insights into the underlying reasons. If the binding affinity of the germline BCR to the conserved residues shared by the variant antigens is high, the traditional paradigm where the antibodies become progressively more rigid as AM progresses is predicted. If this is not the case, FWR mutations that increase flexibility are favored. Additional complexities are predicted as breadth and potency evolve. From the standpoint of designing vaccination protocols, our results imply that, if model antigens can prime germline B cells whose BCRs bind strongly to the shared conserved residues of the boosting variant antigens, inducing FWR mutations that influence receptor flexibility is not essential for the evolution of bnAbs. This is significant as it simplifies the task of immunogen design.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>MD simulations of different bnAb lineages show varying effects of framework mutations</title><sec id="s2-1-1"><title>Description of the MD simulations</title><p>We used atomistically detailed molecular dynamics (MD) simulations to study how flexibility evolved in three different bnAb lineages (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>): bnAbs 3BNC60 and CH103 bind to the CD4 binding site on the HIV gp120 protein, and bnAb PGT121 binds primarily to glycans near the V3 chain of gp120.

More flexible molecules are characterized by larger RMS fluctuations. Further, the standard deviation in the RMSF plots allows one to distinguish between antibody regions that are flexible but stably folded (small Std. Dev.) and antibody regions that are either partially unfolded or have significant conformational heterogeneity across the simulations (high Std. Dev). This coarse-graining also allowed us to calculate the conformational entropy of the antibodies, which is a quantitative thermodynamic measure of their overall flexibility. Toward this end, we used standard quasi-harmonic analysis which treats each bond as a spring (see Materials and methods). Although it is known that the conformational entropy from quasi-harmonic analysis typically overestimates the true conformational entropy (see, e.g., [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Tyka et al., 2007</xref>]), the relative differences between the structures studied are expected to be meaningful because of the overall structure similarity of antibodies in the same lineage. More flexible molecules are characterized by a larger value of the conformational entropy.</p><sec id="s2-1-1-1"><title>Results of the MD simulations</title><p>The results shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref> quantify the dramatic effect of the P61A reversal mutation in the heavy chain of 3BNC60. Consistent with experiments, the presence of proline in the mature antibody disrupts the secondary structure of the <italic>β</italic>-sheet connecting the CDR2 and FWR3 regions, resulting in partial unfolding of the region (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Klein et al., 2013</xref>). The magnitude of the fluctuations in the CDR regions is illustrated qualitatively in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref> by overlaying multiple CDR conformations. The fluctuations are highest in the region surrounding the P61 residue. The high fluctuations propagate to other regions (e.g. FWR1/CDR1 and FWR3) because of geometric (but not sequence) proximity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). The large RMS fluctuations indicate a more flexible structure, and are thus consistent with the observation that the melting temperature for the P61A reverted 3BNC60 mature antibody was 5K lower than that for the mature bnAb (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Klein et al., 2013</xref>). Although the P61A single reversal has a dramatic effect on the dynamics of the Ab, it is clear from <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref> that other somatic mutations also increase the flexibility of the 3BNC60 heavy chain relative to the germline structure. This is made clear from the values of the calculated conformational entropy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>), where we observe a progressive increase in the conformational entropy from the germline to intermediate to mature antibody for the 3BNC60 lineage. The conformational entropy of the light chains of the 3BNC60 lineage of antibodies show a modest decline (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). From these results we conclude that there was a progressive increase in flexibility of the 3BNC60 lineage of antibodies as affinity maturation progressed.</p><fig id="fig3" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.33038.008</object-id><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>Evolution of flexibility differs for our three bnAb lineages.</title><p>Absolute classical quasi-harmonic entropy for the CG antibody model of the heavy (<bold>A</bold>) and light (<bold>B</bold>) chains, shown as the contribution to the absolute free energy (−TS).

This is reflected in both the RMS fluctuations and the conformational entropy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). This result indicates that increased flexibility is not always required to achieve breadth, even for antibody lineages that target the same region (the CD4 binding site). In fact, (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Fera et al., 2014</xref>) attribute the breadth increase in the CH103 lineage to a reorientation of the LC relative to the HC, which alleviates steric clashes with gp120 variants that have longer V5 loops. Furthermore, the variation in flexibility that we report for the CH103 lineage is consistent with earlier studies of non-broadly neutralizing antibodies, which also showed a loss of flexibility during maturation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chong et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Thorpe and Brooks, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Wong et al., 2011</xref>), and with the traditional paradigm of affinity maturation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Foote and Milstein, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Wedemayer et al., 1997</xref>). The light chains of the CH103 also show a loss of flexibility upon maturation, although this change is more modest.</p><p>For the PGT121 lineage, our MD simulation results exhibit greater complexity. For the heavy chains of this lineage, flexibility changes are observed in the CDR3 region (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). In this antibody, CDR3 has a 11 residue insertion relative to the 3BNC60 and CH103 lineages, and is involved in binding to gp120 glycans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Garces et al., 2015</xref>). The CDR3 heavy chain compared to the germline loses flexibility with maturation, again consistent with the traditional paradigm. However, our simulations did not show statistically significant flexibility differences outside of the CDR3 (as indicated by 95% confidence limits associated with 2 × Std. Dev.) suggesting that the overall flexibility reduction of PGT121 HC upon maturation is rather modest. Differences in the conformational entropy for this antibody (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>) are consistent with this observation. Although the flexibility differences for the HC of the PGT121 lineage are modest, the variation in flexibility for the LC is significant. We studied three structures – the mature PGT121 antibody, the germline structure, and an antibody construct in which a lightly-mutated heavy chain (3 hr with 11% amino acid mutations, [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Sok et al., 2013</xref>]) was paired with a heavily-mutated light chain (109L with 34% mutations, [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Sok et al., 2013</xref>]). Since the 109L LC is heavily mutated (i.e., like the mature PGT121 LC, which is 28% mutated [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Sok et al., 2013</xref>]), the 109L LC can be considered another variant of the mature light chain. Since it is paired with a lightly mutated heavy chain, we consider the 3 hr/109L antibody structure to be representative of an intermediate stage of PGT121 evolution. While the mature variant is less flexible than the germline in the regions FWR3-FWR4, the intermediate construct has high flexibility, particularly in the framework regions (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). This result underscores that the dramatic flexibility increase observed for the 3BNC60 HC above is not an isolated occurrence. Specifically, both chains of the 3H109L PGT121 intermediate have higher entropies than the corresponding germline and mature structures, with the increase being more pronounced for the light chain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>), on which we focus below.</p><p>To understand the physical basis for the markedly increased fluctuations in the 3 hr/109L intermediate, we examined the simulated structures and the sequences of the mature PGT121 and of the intermediate 3 hr/109L. In the PGT121 light chain, the FWR3 region near residue 68 is well ordered, and interacts with the CDR1 region near residue S27 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). Hydrogen bonds are formed between S27 (both, side chain and backbone oxygens) and G68 (backbone amide). In the 109L LC the serine is an alanine, and the stabilizing hydrogen bonds do not form, which allows the FWR3 region to unfold locally near the three residue insertion 66(a)P-66(b)D-66(c)I. In the mature PGT121 light chain, this insertion is mutated to 66(a)D-66(b)S-66(c)P (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>), and in conjunction with A27S, results in a stable conformation. However, it is possible that this conformation is only weakly stable, such that minor changes in the adjacent structure (such as the S27A mutation in the CDR1) could cause unfolding. Therefore, the stability of FWR3 in the intermediate 109L LC appears to depend, at least in part, on the sequence identity of CDR1, which might seem surprising because the framework regions are thought to provide a relatively rigid scaffold to which variable and flexible CDR regions are attached. Other sequence differences between the mature LC and 109L in or near the insertion region could also be significant, such as S65T or S66(c)I. However, examination of the trajectory did not implicate these residues in the instability directly, because they are oriented away from the CDR1 loop. These results suggest that the complete explanation for the increased flexibility is quite complicated.</p><p>Overall, our results demonstrate that flexibility throughout the antibody can be changed significantly by mutations in both the FWR and CDR regions, and, more generally, that affinity maturation in bnAbs does not follow the rigidification paradigm in all cases.</p></sec></sec></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>A model of AM suggests that the binding affinity of the germline BCR to the conserved regions of the epitope determines the role of framework mutations on bnAb evolution</title><p>Our analyses of MD simulation results clearly indicate significant ‘exceptions’ to the paradigm of antibody rigidification during affinity maturation. For the 3BNC60 lineage, flexibility progressively increased, while the opposite is true for the CH103 lineage. For the PGT121 lineage, our results indicate that the intermediate is more flexible than either the mature or germline antibodies, so that this is an example of a more complex maturation trajectory. The germline for the CH103 lineage bound strongly to the CD4 binding site of the founder HIV envelope glycoprotein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Liao et al., 2013</xref>). Conversely, ancestors of 3BNC60 show lower potency and breadth of neutralization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Scheid et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Klein et al., 2013</xref>). Therefore, although the founder viral strain for the patient from whom 3BNC60 was harvested was not available, this result suggests that the 3BNC60 ancestors bind weakly to the CD4 binding site of the epitope that induced bnAb evolution. In general, it is not likely that a naive germline B cell will have a strong affinity for the shared conserved residues. Thus, we hypothesized that the traditional paradigm of reduced flexibility with maturation applies when the germline BCR binds strongly to the conserved shared residues of the variant antigens that induce the evolution of bnAbs. More complex evolution of flexibility can result when this is not the case, as we found for the 3BNC60 and PGT121 lineages. To explore this hypothesis in light of processes that occur during AM in the presence of variant antigens, we developed a simplified model of AM.</p><sec id="s2-2-1"><title>Description of the affinity maturation model</title><p>Past studies analyzing the evolution of bnAbs in infected persons show that often diversification of viral strains precedes the development of bnAbs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Liao et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Doria-Rose et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bhiman et al., 2015</xref>). Thus, we studied AM induced by a cocktail of multiple variant antigens. Our computational model of affinity maturation of B cells includes somatic hypermutation (SHM) in the CDR as well as in the FWR. The purpose of our computational model is not the quantitative reproduction of existing experiments or our MD simulation results, but rather to provide mechanistic insights into how mutations in the CDR and FWR regions change the flexibility of Ab structure to influence the development of breadth and potency. As in recent models of the mutation and selection phenomena that occur during AM induced by multiple variant antigens, which predicted phenomena that were experimentally validated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Wang et al., 2015</xref>), our model for AM does not explicitly consider the motion of B cells in space or the atomistically detailed structure of BCRs and antigens. The model is conceptually similar to the one described by (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Wang et al., 2015</xref>) and (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Shaffer et al., 2016</xref>), but we adopt a different approach to modeling the BCRs, the variant antigens, and their interactions with each other. The present approach explicitly considers the flexibility of the antibody structures in determining the free energy of interactions between BCRs and antigens. We first describe how the binding free energy is estimated, and then show how the various steps of AM are computed (further details are provided in the Materials and methods).</p><p>The variant antigens have a certain fraction <italic>λ</italic> of their amino acid sequence that is the same. This fraction represents the shared conserved residues of the targeted epitope; (1- <italic>λ</italic>) is the fraction of amino acids that differ. Each B cell is characterized by its binding energy <italic>E<sub>c</sub></italic> to the shared conserved region, and its binding energy <italic>E<bold><sub>vi</sub></bold></italic> to the variable part of each antigen <italic>i</italic>. Lower (i.e., more negative) binding energies indicate stronger binding. Further, the flexibility of the BCR can play an important role in determining the entropy loss on binding. For more rigid BCR structures, there is a smaller loss of entropy upon binding; for more flexible BCRs, the binding free energy is less favorable (for the same binding energy) because of the greater entropy loss. However, since more flexible structures can bind to more diverse antigen variants, increased flexibility can contribute favorably to the binding energy. For simplicity, we characterize the structural flexibility of a BCR by a single parameter <italic>Q</italic>, which take values between 0 and 1; <italic>Q</italic> = 0 and <italic>Q</italic> = 1 correspond to a highly flexible and a highly rigid structure, respectively.

The B cells that internalize antigen are ranked according to their binding free energy, which is expected to correlate with the concentration of pMHC that they display to T cells, and only the best performers are selected (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">2</xref> for details on parameter values).</p><p>In the presence of multiple antigen variants present on FDCs, a B cell could interact with and internalize several variants at a time or just one variant. However, there is no experimental data to describe how heterogeneously different antigens are distributed on the surface of FDCs at a given time. It was shown previously that, if B cells interact with multiple variants of the antigen in every cycle, bnAbs are less likely to evolve (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Wang et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Shaffer et al., 2016</xref>). Therefore, in our model we assume that a B cell encounters only one antigen variant on FDCs at a time; a different choice would lower the probability of bnAb evolution. The encountered antigen variant is chosen randomly with a uniform probability for each B cell during each round of selection.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2-6"><title>Recycling, exit for differentiation, and termination of the GC reaction</title><p>Most (70%) B cells that are positively selected are recycled for further rounds of mutation-selection while a few randomly selected B cells exit the GC to mimic the differentiation into memory and antibody-producing plasma cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Oprea and Perelson, 1997</xref>).

Due to the stochastic nature of B cell evolution during affinity maturation, we carried out 10<sup>4</sup> simulations for each set of conditions studied, and combined the results to obtain meaningful statistics. Our results thus reflect the probability with which certain types of evolutionary patterns would be observed for each set of conditions that we studied. Because mutation probabilities are less than unity, cell division can generate cells with identical values for binding energies and rigidity. Thus, the GC contains sets, also called clones, of these functionally identical B cells. We analyze the properties of the clone with the largest number of cells at the end of the AM trajectory, and consider this to be representative of the properties of most of the antibodies generated. We also trace the evolutionary trajectories of these clones to determine the history of mutations in the CDR and FWR regions that shaped these final properties. To analyze the antibody breadth, we compute the binding free energy of this largest clone to a panel of 100 antigens different from those against which the antibody matured. For this purpose, we take the overlap parameter <italic>λ</italic> and the binding strength with the conserved region to be the same as in the simulations of affinity maturation, but the binding strength with the variable region is randomly selected for each new antigen in the panel (Materials and methods). As a proxy for breadth, we compute the median binding free energy with panel antigens of each antibody over the maturation pathway . This allows us to track how breadth evolves during the course of affinity maturation. The higher the magnitude of the median binding free energy the greater the cross-reactivity of the Abs to variant antigens.</p><p>The results described in the main text have been carried out with ten variant antigens that share 90% sequence identity (<italic>λ =</italic> 0.9), and three B cells seeding the GC. The precise number of antigens and the value of λ used in the simulation are not important for the qualitative results that we present (for example, see Materials and methods and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2</xref> where results with five antigens are shown). Similarly, increasing the number of seeding B cells to seven did not affect our results.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2-8"><title>Results of the affinity maturation model</title><p>To explore the hypothesis suggested by our MD simulation results, we considered two classes of activated germline B cells that seed the GC upon immunization with a cocktail of variant antigens: 1) those with a high favorable value of the binding energy to the shared conserved region of the antigens, <italic>E<sub>c</sub></italic> (such as those that have a long finger-like structure that binds to the CD4 binding site in the VRC01 family of antibodies); and 2) those with a weak/moderate binding energy to the shared conserved regions, which are expected to be more common upon natural infection, since most naïve B cells are unlikely to have strong interactions with the conserved residues prior to affinity maturation. The Abs start with a high value of the rigidity parameter, <italic>Q</italic> = 0.8.

This is consistent with our MD simulation results for the CH103 lineage (and the traditional paradigm).

This is made evident by the fact that in simulations where changes to flexibility are disallowed, GC reactions are 35% less likely to complete successfully because all the B cells undergo apoptosis as AM ensues (data not shown). Akin to enzymes in a changing environment of substrates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Raman et al., 2016</xref>) discussed earlier, the FWR mutations enable the B cells to bind loosely to the diverse variant antigens that act as the selection forces during affinity maturation. Since the value of <italic>E<sub>c</sub></italic> during the early stages of affinity maturation is not high, one way for the B cells to bind sufficiently strongly to diverse variant antigens and be positively selected is by evolving FWR mutations that increase conformational flexibility. Upon becoming more flexible and thus surviving selection against the variant antigens, in subsequent rounds of mutation and selection, the B cells can start to acquire CDR mutations that increase the binding energy to the conserved residues, thus acquiring breadth. Most bnAbs harvested at this stage of evolution will exhibit high breadth and relatively low potency because the free energy of binding to each variant antigen is not very high. This is because the flexibility of the BCR/antibody implies that a high entropic penalty has to be paid upon binding to the antigens (also see <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="equ1">Equation 1</xref> in the limit of small <italic>Q</italic>). In some cases, however, the flexible bnAbs can also be highly potent. This is because, as our calculations show, some flexible bnAbs that are produced at this stage of AM can develop strong interactions with the conserved residues (<italic>E<sub>c</sub></italic>≈ –11). This may be the case for the 3BNC60 antibody, which was isolated from patients with the specific selection criteria of high breadth and potency. As our MD simulation results show, for this lineage, flexibility progressively increases with maturity; 3BNC60 exhibits high breadth, with the potency expected to be comparable to that of CH103. Although we could not find specific comparative data for 3BNC60, another 3B class of bnAb, 3BNC117, is slightly more potent than CH103 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chuang et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Eroshkin et al., 2014</xref>). Indirect comparisons based on available data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Scheid et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chuang et al., 2013</xref>) suggest that 3BNC55, another bnAb with the P61 FWR mutation is less potent than CH103. This may be because it has not yet acquired the mutations required for strong interactions with the conserved residues, and our calculations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>) suggest that its flexibility makes 3BNC55 less potent.</p><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref> shows that, in the case where germline B cells have a weak binding energy <italic>E<sub>c</sub></italic>, if the evolutionary trajectories progress beyond a reasonably favorable value of <italic>E<sub>c</sub></italic> (which our simulations show to be roughly equal to <italic>E<sub>0</sub></italic>), then framework mutations that make the structure more rigid are acquired much like the case where germline B cells exhibit a stronger <italic>E<sub>c</sub></italic>. Thus, the antibodies become more potent because they do not have to lose conformational entropy upon binding (see also <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="equ1">Equation 1</xref>). Our results show that for the cases where the germline B cells have a low binding energy to the conserved residues, the median binding free energy of the antibodies for the panel of antigens exhibits a broad pattern at generation 400 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). Analyses of our results demonstrate that the population that exhibits lower breadth (median binding free energy) and lower final values of <italic>E<sub>c</sub></italic> is comprised of those antibodies that are more flexible, while those that continue to evolve and become more rigid have a higher breadth and potency (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>). This rigidification, following an initial increase in flexibility that enables the development of sufficiently strong interactions with the conserved residues, would explain why the PGT121 bnAb is more potent than 3BNC60. Also, these results are consistent with our MD simulations, which show that the intermediate is more flexible than both the germline or the mature antibodies.</p><p>For cases where the germline B cells exhibit a weak binding energy for the shared conserved residues of the antigens, we also observe some evolutionary trajectories where mutations quickly arise in the CDR regions that increase the affinity to the conserved residues and this is followed by the antibody structures evolving to become even more rigid. Such cases are less common.</p><p>The AM simulation results described above were obtained with a particular value of the “generic’’ binding energy <italic>E<sub>0</sub></italic> (nonspecific binding energy accessible to flexible antibodies; see <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="equ1">Equation 1 a,b</xref>). We have explored the effects of varying the value of this parameter on our results when the germline B cell does not bind strongly to the conserved residues of the epitope (weak initial <italic>E<sub>c</sub></italic>). As <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4—figure supplement 3</xref> shows, shifting <italic>E<sub>0</sub></italic> to very strong or weak binding energies affects the preferred antibody maturation pathway. A significantly more favorable value of <italic>E<sub>0</sub></italic> than that used to obtain the results in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref> makes flexibility-increasing framework mutations more beneficial, and thus drives antibody evolution more along 3BNC60-like trajectories (compare <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4—figure supplement 3</xref> with <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). In this case, antibodies begin to rigidify and become more like the PGT121 lineage later in the maturation cycle, after mutations that make <italic>E<sub>c</sub></italic> (binding energy to the conserved residues) very strong have been acquired. So, if <italic>E<sub>0</sub></italic> is stronger than what was used to obtain the results in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>, the qualitative behavior does not change, but the 3BNC60-like antibodies are more likely to be observed for a greater duration of the affinity maturation cycle and are likely to be more potent. If <italic>E<sub>0</sub></italic> is weaker than what was used to obtain the results in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>, and we use the same antigen concentration as before, most of the B cells die and the GC is likely to be extinguished. This is because affinity maturation is frustrated when there are multiple variant antigens and the initial <italic>E<sub>c</sub></italic> is weak, as has been described before (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Wang et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Shaffer et al., 2016</xref>), and a path to relieving this frustration by evolving flexibility through FWR mutations is no longer available (because of weak E<sub>0</sub>). In this circumstance, if the antigen concentration is increased, we find that the GCs are not extinguished with high probability, and more CH103-like maturation trajectories are promoted (compare <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4—figure supplement 3</xref> with <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). This is because CDR mutations that improve binding with the conserved region (stronger <italic>E<sub>c</sub></italic>) become relatively more beneficial early in the maturation process since <italic>E<sub>0</sub></italic> is weak and there is little benefit to evolving FWR mutations that affect flexibility. Consistent with the points noted above, varying values of <italic>E<sub>0</sub></italic> also change the rate of acquiring CDR versus FWR mutations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>), with stronger values of <italic>E<sub>0</sub></italic> promoting FWR mutations more than in Figure 6B and weaker values of <italic>E<sub>0</sub></italic> suppressing FWR mutations.</p></sec></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>HIV is a highly mutable pathogen that continues to rage in many parts of the world. A promising strategy for the development of a prophylactic vaccine against such pathogens is to design immunization protocols and immunogens that can induce antibodies (bnAbs) that can neutralize diverse circulating mutant strains of the virus. BnAbs that evolve naturally in infected persons exhibit high levels of CDR and FWR mutations. In some instances, FWR mutations are important for breadth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Scheid et al., 2011</xref>) and, in at least one case, FWR mutations have been shown to increase antibody flexibility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Scheid et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Klein et al., 2013</xref>). The standard paradigm, based on the development of strain-specific antibodies is that FWR mutations result in a more rigid antibody structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Schmidt et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Eisen and Chakraborty, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Foote and Milstein, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Wedemayer et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Thorpe and Brooks, 2007</xref>). Since bnAbs develop by AM in the presence of diverse mutant strains, we explored the hypothesis that FWR mutations increase the number of accessible conformational states of the antigen binding region, thus enabling binding to the variant antigens. This, in turn, may allow B cells to avoid frequent apoptosis due to the conflicting selection forces represented by the variant antigens.</p><p>To test this hypothesis, we first performed atomistically detailed molecular dynamics simulations of the structures of antibodies at three different time points during the maturation process for three bnAb lineages (3BNC60, PGT121, and CH103). Only the 3BNC60 lineage, showed the continuous increase in conformational flexibility previously reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Scheid et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Klein et al., 2013</xref>). Structures in the CH103 lineage progressively became more rigid with maturation, consistent with the standard paradigm. For PGT121, the germline and mature forms had similar levels of conformational rigidity, while an intermediate construct was more flexible, suggesting a more complex maturation process.</p><p>To interpret these complex results in light of the evolutionary forces at play during the development of bnAbs by AM, we developed and studied a simple computational model of AM driven by multiple variant antigens. The essential findings from our simulations of affinity maturation are depicted schematically in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>, which illustrates how the three different cases studied here evolve during AM; details are given with <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="equ1">Equation (1)</xref> and the discussion of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref> above. Specifically, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref> shows the change in rigidity (<italic>Q</italic>) and the binding energy to conserved residues (<italic>E<sub>c</sub></italic>)as a function of the value of <italic>E<sub>c</sub></italic> for the germline B cell. If <italic>E<sub>c</sub></italic> is sufficiently favorable (<italic>E<sub>c</sub></italic> ≪ 0), as in the CH1 E103 case (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>, orange), AM follows the classical path of increasing rigidity. If <italic>E<sub>c</sub></italic> is low (<italic>E<sub>c</sub></italic>≈ 0), as is likely the case for 3BNC60 (green) and PGT121 (purple), rigidity initially decreases via mutations in the FWR regions. The increase in flexibility allows the antibodies to bind a broader set of antigens via conformational plasticity, with a relatively low but sufficiently strong affinity, to permit them to survive until they acquire additional mutations that enhance <italic>E<sub>c</sub></italic>. That is, a more negative (or stronger) binding free energy, <italic>E</italic>, can be acquired by increasing the magnitude of the second term in <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="equ1">Equation 1</xref>b at the expense of the first term. Then, further beneficial CDR mutations that strengthen <italic>E<sub>c</sub></italic> can follow, thus making <italic>E<sub>w</sub></italic> more negative (stronger binding) for diverse variant antigens. This scenario is consistent with both 3BNC60 and PGT121 cases. Most antibodies harvested at this stage of AM will not be very potent because flexible antibodies lose more entropy upon binding, thus limiting the value of <italic>E</italic> (green curve); however, some antibodies, such as 3BNC60, can also develop a highly favorable value of <italic>E<sub>c</sub></italic>. At this stage in the AM process, rigidification can increase the antibody potency further. This is observed in our simulations once <italic>E<sub>c</sub></italic> is sufficiently high that <italic>E<sub>w</sub></italic> &lt;<italic>E<sub>0</sub></italic>; conformational plasticity is now no longer required and the selection pressure will increase <italic>Q</italic> to enhance the effect of the first term in <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="equ1">Equation 1</xref>b. This phenomenon is consistent with the AM trajectories of the PGT121 lineage (purple curve). The reason that PGT121 is more potent than 3BNC60 is likely that it has proceeded further along the evolutionary trajectory and become more rigid.</p><fig id="fig5" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.33038.013</object-id><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><title>The three bnAb lineages we studied evolve through different paths that depend on the binding strength of their germline to conserved epitopes.</title><p>CH103 (in orange) has a strong starting binding energy for the conserved residues, <italic>E<sub>c</sub></italic>.

We hope our findings encourage others to further study this fundamental problem at the intersection of immunology and evolutionary biology with important implications for health. Several caveats in our study are worth noting as they provide suggestions for such studies. We were able to study only three bnAb lineages because of the lack of high resolution antibody structures at different points of maturation. Furthermore, we could only study three time points in the evolutionary pathway of each lineage, and for PGT121, the structure we studied is a chimeric construct and not a true intermediate. Our results suggest that complex evolutionary trajectories are followed under different conditions, and structural analysis of various bnAb lineages at multiple time points during their maturation pathway could further test our predictions and reveal new phenomena. For example, studies that provide a finer temporal resolution during AM could reveal additional types of evolutionary trajectories not described by our current results. Iteration between such experiments and development of more refined models would further elucidate the complex processes that occur when AM results in the development of bnAbs.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><p>Data and some analysis for molecular dynamics simulations are available in a GitHub repository (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Barton, 2018</xref>). A copy is archived at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/elifesciences-publications/paper-bnAb-flexibility">https://github.com/elifesciences-publications/paper-bnAb-flexibility</ext-link>.</p><sec id="s4-1"><title>Molecular dynamics simulations</title><p>Antibody structures listed in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref> were downloaded from the PDB databank, and include both the variable regions and the constant regions, which are connected by a single <italic>β</italic>-strand for each HC and LC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>).

Consistent with the qualitative nature of the model, we did not attempt to choose an ‘optimal’ set of parameters, for example by precisely fitting the typical number of mutations or GC duration in the single antigen case.

We use the clone with the largest number of cells at the end of the reaction as the representative to analyze the events that shaped the final characteristics of most of the antibodies generated by AM. In order to analyze the breadth, we compute the binding free energy of this largest clone against an artificial panel of 100 antigens different from those that the antibody matured against. Here we take the overlap parameter <italic>λ</italic> and the binding strength with the conserved region to be the same as in the simulations, but the binding strength with the variable region is randomly selected for each new antigen in the panel. Here, the random binding strength is chosen from a log-normal distribution that is broader (standard deviation σ = 1) and shifted toward weaker binding (mean μ = 3) compared to the one used to generate the binding free energies for the founder B cell-Ab combinations. This choice is based on the assumption that variable regions for a broad cross-section of antigens should be more variable and less likely to bind strongly to the Ab than those encountered in the original host.

For example, the main text states that the model is coarse-grained, yet the level of graining does not appear to be defined. Based on the Supplementary Information, it appears that this is a population model that has no spatial resolution. As another example, the description of the model starts with a definition of how the system was seeded. However, this is premature, since the model has not been defined. It appears that the actual computational protocol is not mentioned until late in the Supplementary Information (Subsection “Selection in the light zone”). With these types of major issues in the organization of the maturation model description, it is very difficult to determine the significance of the presented analysis. In summary, a concise general form description of the theoretical model should be provided, first. Next, the authors should discuss their specific implementation and parameterization of the model, prior to describing results. Throughout this description, the limits of the model should also be presented.</p><p>Subsection “Results of the MD simulations” the fourth paragraph is confusing and not technically correct as written. What you observe is that A27 in the 109L LC, which mutates in Ser in mature LC, does not hbond to G68, which results in an instability of the 3-residue insertion at 66abc.

The claim is that instability of 66abc &quot;appears to be a consequence of mutations in the CDR1…&quot; (Subsection “Results of the MD simulations”), but to prove this, one would need to show that S27 in conjunction with 66(a)P-66(b)D-66(c) of 109L LC results in a stable conformation. I suggest a re-wording such as the following:</p><p>“In the 109L LC, residue 27 is an alanine, and the stabilizing hydrogen bonds do not form, which allows the FWR3 region to unfold locally near the three-residue insertion 66(a)P-66(b)D-66(c). In the mature PGT121 light chain, this insertion is mutated to 66(a)D-66(b)S-66(c)P (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>), and in conjunction with A27S, allows the formation a stable conformation. However, it is possible that this conformation is only weakly stable, such that minor changes in the adjacent structure (such as the S27A mutation in the CDR1) could cause unfolding. Therefore, stability of FWR3 in the intermediate 109L LC appears to partially depend on the sequence identify of CDR1, which might seem surprising because the framework regions are thought to provide a relatively rigid scaffold to which variable and flexible CDR regions are attached.

If #mutations and binding affinity is treated as the &quot;training&quot; data, a cross-validation with other experimentally measured values would have been preferred. The parameters are especially crucial since beyond a certain point, small steps as you are performing using an evolutionary algorithm cannot escape a deep local minimum, and the conclusions merely falls out of the math rather than representing real biology. I also have a specific concern with the energy function, which is that E0 is kept constant for each simulation, whereas the value should really reflect the flexibility of the epitope itself. For a cocktail of antigens, this value should be sampled from an empirical distribution.

Namely, you nicely showed that the profile for a weak initial Ec is bimodal, and that the distribution changes drastically with a small change in λ (in the sensible direction equivalent to decreasing initial Ec, since the energy term is λ*Ec). If the model is accurate, you would expect that a high constant value of E0 to drastically shift the distribution toward PGT121-like antibodies, and that a low value of E0 toward 3BN60-like antibodies. Using the current value in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref> as control, please try two simulations, doubling and halving E0, or altering E0 in those directions as you see appropriate.

The parameters that are used are now further detailed in tables in the supplement. As we have noted, the purpose of our model is not to quantitatively reproduce experimental or simulation results (which are also not quantitatively absolutely accurate); rather, our goal is to provide mechanistic insights into the qualitative behavior revealed by the MD simulations and available experimental results on the role of framework mutations, and make qualitative predictions that can be further tested by experiments. We do not assert that the values of the unknown parameters are the only ones that would reproduce the changes in binding affinity observed in experiments with mouse models. We are, however, encouraged that the same parameters that recapitulate this feature (training data, if you will) also capture the behavior pertinent to the number of acquired mutations (cross validation, if you will). A strength of our model is that the qualitative mechanistic information revealed by the model with regard to the role of framework mutations for bnAb evolution are robust to variations of the parameters (e.g., see below our new calculations recommended by the reviewer on varying the value of E<sub>0</sub>). Therefore, we feel encouraged to make predictions about the relative rates at which CDR and FWR mutations may be acquired for different bnAb lineages – hints of which are already seen in existing phylogenetic data. Finally, in our past work using simplified models of affinity maturation to study bnAb evolution (e.g., Wang et al., 2015), we found that if unknown parameters were chosen to reflect the qualitative trends for affinity maturation induced by a single antigen, the mechanistic insights and predictions emerging from the model for bnAb evolution were positively tested by new experiments. We have not added this discussion to the paper at this point, but if the reviewer so recommends, we could add it to the Discussion section of the paper. We await editorial guidance in this regard.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The parameters are especially crucial since beyond a certain point, small steps as you are performing using an evolutionary algorithm cannot escape a deep local minimum, and the conclusions merely falls out of the math rather than representing real biology.</p></disp-quote><p>We apologize for not being sure that we understand this point made by the reviewer. Perhaps, the points noted above and the following point address this remark. Our results clearly show that our evolutionary simulations are not trapped in any local minimum. In all circumstances that we have simulated, there are large changes in the flexibility, affinity to conserved residues of the epitope, or both, as affinity maturation ensues. These changes are also physically/biophysically consistent with expectations as you vary values of parameters (such as studies varying E<sub>0</sub> recommended by the reviewer – see below).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>I also have a specific concern with the energy function, which is that E0 is kept constant for each simulation, whereas the value should really reflect the flexibility of the epitope itself.

We have not carried out such calculations because of two reasons: (1) We have no idea how to guess the form of the distribution that should be used. (2) We are unsure as to what issues pertinent to the main points of our paper such calculations would address? We would be happy to do calculations with a distribution of values of E<sub>0</sub>, but we would be grateful for specific editorial guidance on these two questions. We also note that our guess is that the distribution is likely to be narrow since the variant antigens share the conserved residues of the epitope, and any distribution of epitope flexibility would emerge from difference in the amino acids at the variable sites in the same epitope. This is the only comment made by the reviewer that we have not addressed, rather we have carried out related calculations varying E<sub>0</sub> as per another excellent suggestion made by the reviewer (see below).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>I suggest an easy follow-up experiment that would serve to further validate the model and its chosen parameters, solidify the conclusion that entropy is central to the evolution, and provide insight into the importance of the epitope during AM.

We have carried out precisely the calculations that were recommended. We have added a description of these calculations in the main text (appended below) and added two supplementary figures that show these results.</p><p>“The results reported in the text were carried out with a particular value of <italic>E<sub>0</sub></italic>, which is the binding energy to diverse antigens that becomes accessible to flexible BCRs/antibodies. We have explored the effects of varying the value of this parameter on our results when the germline B cell does not bind strongly to the conserved residues of the epitope (weak initial <italic>E<sub>c</sub></italic>). As <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4—figure supplement 3</xref> shows, shifting <italic>E<sub>0</sub></italic> to very strong or weak binding energies affects the preferred antibody maturation pathway. A significantly more favorable value of <italic>E<sub>0</sub></italic> than that used to obtain the results in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref> makes flexibility-increasing framework mutations more beneficial, and thus drives antibody evolution more along 3BNC60-like trajectories (compare <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4—figure supplement 3</xref> with <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). In this circumstance, antibodies only begin to rigidify and become more like the PGT121 lineage later in the maturation cycle, after mutations that make <italic>E<sub>c</sub></italic>(binding energy to the conserved residues) very strong have been acquired. So, if <italic>E<sub>0</sub></italic> is stronger than what was used to obtain the results in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>, the qualitative behavior does not change, but the 3BNC60like antibodies are more likely to be observed for a greater duration of affinity maturation and are likely to be more potent. If <italic>E<sub>0</sub></italic> is weaker than what was used to obtain the results in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>, and we use the same antigen concentration as before, most of the B cells die and the GC is likely to be extinguished. This is because affinity maturation is frustrated when there are multiple variant antigens and the initial <italic>E<sub>c</sub></italic> is weak, as has been described before (Wang et al., 2015; Shaffer et al., 2016), and a path to relieving this frustration by evolving flexibility through FWR mutations is no longer available (because of weak E<sub>0</sub>). In this circumstance, if the antigen concentration is increased, we find that the GCs are not extinguished with high probability, and more CH103-like maturation trajectories are promoted (compare <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4—figure supplement 3</xref> with <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). This is because CDR mutations that improve binding with the conserved region (stronger <italic>E<sub>c</sub></italic>) become relatively more beneficial early in the maturation process since <italic>E<sub>0</sub></italic> is weak and there is little benefit to evolving FWR mutations that affect flexibility. Consistent with the points noted above, varying values of <italic>E<sub>0</sub></italic> also change the rate of acquiring CDR versus FWR mutations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>), with stronger values of <italic>E<sub>0</sub></italic> promoting FWR mutations more than in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref> and weaker values of <italic>E<sub>0</sub></italic> suppressing FWR mutations.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Subsection “Example: Affinity maturation against a single antigen”: Please state explicitly whether the initial and constant parameters (or distributions thereof) in the energy function and evolutionary scheme for the 10 antigen cocktail is the same as those used for the single antigen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>. If not, please comment on using the values obtained from <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref> (or similar values for which you have data) when extended to 10 antigens.</p></disp-quote><p>Precisely the same parameters were used. However, the antigen concentration was increases to study the cocktail. This is because, at the same antigen concentrations, as has been described in this paper and previously, for a cocktail of variant antigens the frustration level becomes too high leading to extinction of many GCs. Vaccination with a cocktail would require higher antigen concentrations than what is optimal for a single antigen. This point is now addressed in the new tables of parameters.</p></body></sub-article></article>
