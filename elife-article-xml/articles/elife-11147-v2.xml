However, current approaches are limited in their capacity to directly assign molecular identities to neurons. Here, we use serial multiplex immunogold labeling (siGOLD) and serial-section transmission electron microscopy (ssTEM) to identify multiple peptidergic neurons in a connectome. The high immunogenicity of neuropeptides and their broad distribution along axons, allowed us to identify distinct neurons by immunolabeling small subsets of sections within larger series. We demonstrate the scalability of siGOLD by using 11 neuropeptide antibodies on a full-body larval ssTEM dataset of the annelid <italic>Platynereis</italic>. We also reconstruct a peptidergic circuitry comprising the sensory nuchal organs, found by siGOLD to express pigment-dispersing factor, a circadian neuropeptide. Our approach enables the direct overlaying of chemical neuromodulatory maps onto synaptic connectomic maps in the study of nervous systems.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.11147.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.11147.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.11147.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>In the nervous system, cells called neurons connect to each other to form large “neural” networks. The most powerful method that is currently available for tracing neurons and mapping the connections between them is called electron microscopy. This requires slicing brain tissue into ultrathin sections, which are then imaged one by one. However, while electron microscopy provides highly detailed information about the structure of the connections between neurons, it does not reveal which molecules the neurons use to communicate with each other.</p><p>To address this question, Shahidi et al. have developed a new approach called ‘siGOLD’. Unlike previous approaches, siGOLD allows signal molecules inside cells to be labeled with protein tags called antibodies without compromising the ability to examine the tissue with electron microscopy. The technique was developed using the larvae of a marine worm called <italic>Platynereis</italic>. A single larva was sliced into 5000 sections thin enough to view under an electron microscope, and 150 of these were selected to represent the entire body. Because neurons are typically long and thin, individual neurons usually spanned multiple slices.</p><p>To identify the neurons, Shahidi et al. then applied an antibody that recognizes a specific signal molecule to a subset of the slices. The antibodies were labeled with gold particles, which show up as black dots under the electron microscope. Because the molecules recognized by the antibodies are present all along the neuron, and because individual neurons extend over multiple slices, it was possible to trace single neurons by labeling only a small number of slices. Repeating this process in different subsets of slices with antibodies that bind to different signal molecules allowed entire neural circuits to be mapped.</p><p>In the future, Shahidi et al.’s approach could be adapted to study neural networks in other organisms such as flies, fish and mice.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.11147.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.11147.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd><italic>Platynereis dumerilii</italic></kwd><kwd>annelid</kwd><kwd>neuropeptide</kwd><kwd>connectome</kwd><kwd>immunogold</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd>Other</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000781</institution-id><institution>European Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>260821</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Shahidi</surname><given-names>Réza</given-names></name><name><surname>Williams</surname><given-names>Elizabeth A</given-names></name><name><surname>Conzelmann</surname><given-names>Markus</given-names></name><name><surname>Asadulina</surname><given-names>Albina</given-names></name><name><surname>Verasztó</surname><given-names>Csaba</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004189</institution-id><institution>Max-Planck-Gesellschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Bezares-Calderón</surname><given-names>Luis A</given-names></name><name><surname>Jékely</surname><given-names>Gáspár</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000780</institution-id><institution>European Commission</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>GA 317172</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Jasek</surname><given-names>Sanja</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>A new technique called ‘siGOLD’ allows neural circuits to be mapped using a combination of antibody labeling and electron microscopy.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>A comprehensive understanding of nervous system function requires knowledge of not only precise neuronal connectivity but also the unique combinations of molecules expressed by each neuron. Connectomics using serial-sectioning electron microscopy (EM) aims to map the synapse-level connectivity of entire neural circuits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Morgan and Lichtman, 2013</xref>). However, wiring diagrams provide an incomplete picture of the nervous system, since they lack information about the molecular nature of neurons.</p><p>One important class of molecules are neuromodulators, including monoamines and neuropeptides, that actively shape the output of circuits by modifying synaptic function and neuron excitability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bargmann, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bargmann and Marder, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Bucher and Marder, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Marder, 2012</xref>). The direct mapping of specific neuromodulators to their source cells in synapse-level anatomical maps would help to integrate connectomic and neuromodulatory perspectives, thereby enriching our understanding of circuit function.</p><p>Several approaches have been developed to assign molecular identities to neurons on EM sections. Genetically encoded tags with enzymatic activity, such as miniSOG and APEX probes, allow the resolution of cells or subcellular structures by EM following incubation with a substrate that is converted to electron-dense deposits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Martell et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Shu et al., 2011</xref>). Fixation-resistant protein tags compatible with EM procedures and observable by correlative light and electron microscopy (CLEM) or directly by immunogold labeling (immunoEM), such as the smGFPs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Viswanathan et al., 2015</xref>), have also been developed. In CLEM, fluorescently labeled neurons or organelles can be imaged live prior to fixation, sectioning, and EM imaging of the specimen. Fiducial markers allow the correlation of cellular structures in the immunofluorescence (IF) and EM images (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Colombelli et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Maco et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Maco et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Urwyler et al., 2015</xref>). However, the neuron-specific probes employed by these technologies must be expressed using transgenesis, limiting their use to one or a few markers, such as in the ‘two-tag’ labeling approach (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Lin et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>An alternative approach to assigning molecular identities to neurons is the use of endogenous targets in fixed specimen, as in array tomography, a method employing sequential IF with several different antibodies on large series of sections (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Collman et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Micheva and Smith, 2007</xref>). IF imaging can be combined with scanning EM imaging of selected sections to resolve ultrastructural detail. The sequentially acquired IF and EM images can be registered, allowing for correlative analysis of images of different modalities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Collman et al., 2015</xref>). However, the sequential IF procedure compromises the membrane contrast in EM, preventing the reliable tracing of fine processes across series of sections (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Collman et al., 2015</xref>). Array tomography also relies on embedding the specimen in porous, hydrophilic acrylic resins to allow optimal immunolabeling. For large-scale serial sectioning projects, epoxy resins, such as Epon, are favored due to their higher stability during sectioning and imaging and the optimal ultrastructural preservation they provide (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bock et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Briggman et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Bumbarger et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Ohyama et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Randel et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">White et al., 1986</xref>). Unfortunately, the Epon-embedding procedure, including osmium-fixation and resin polymerization at 60°C, compromises the immunogenicity of many endogenous targets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Brorson, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Brorson and Reinholt, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">De Paul et al., 2012</xref>). Current immunolabeling approaches therefore sacrifice the mechanical stability and ultrastructural contrast of the sample for optimal immunolabeling.</p><p>One exception is short amidated neuropeptide antigens that show good immunopreservation in epoxy-embedded samples (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Hamanaka et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Koizumi et al., 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Merighi et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Yasuyama and Meinertzhagen, 2010</xref>). Such antigens represent promising targets in an attempt to combine connectomics on Epon-embedded samples and immunogold labeling for specific neuromodulators. Neuropeptides are often chemically modified, including C-terminal amidation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Eipper et al., 1992</xref>), which confers stability and high immunogenicity to even very short peptides (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Conzelmann and Jékely, 2012</xref>). Furthermore, neuropeptides show neuron-type specific expression and are distributed throughout the axon of peptidergic neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Wong et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Zupanc, 1996</xref>), representing useful markers for neuron-type identification.</p><p>Here, we introduce serial-multiplex immunogold (siGOLD), a method for immunolabeling connectomes. siGOLD involves immunogold labeling of small subsets of sections from large series with different neuron-type-specific neuropeptide antibodies. The molecularly identified neurons and their synaptic partners are then reconstructed from the entire aligned series using standard EM-based connectomics.</p><p>We established siGOLD using larval stages of <italic>Platynereis dumerilii</italic>, a marine annelid that has recently emerged as a powerful model for circuit neuroscience, genetics, and whole-body connectomics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Backfisch et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bannister et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Gühmann et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Randel et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Randel et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Tosches et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Veedin-Rajan et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Zantke et al., 2014</xref>). We identified several amidated neuropeptide epitopes that showed long-term immunopreservation in Epon-embedded samples, allowing us to simultaneously obtain high ultrastructural detail and specific immunogold signal. Using siGOLD with 11 distinct antibodies on the same specimen, we identified several neuropeptide-containing neuron profiles in a whole-body <italic>Platynereis</italic> larval serial EM dataset (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Randel et al., 2015</xref>). Furthermore, taking advantage of the whole-body series, we fully reconstructed several peptidergic neurons identified by siGOLD in the <italic>Platynereis</italic> larva. We also identified and reconstructed the postsynaptic partners of selected peptidergic neurons, focusing on the nuchal organs, paired, putatively chemosensory organs with high structural complexity and variability among the annelids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Purschke, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Purschke, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Purschke et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Schlötzer-Schrehardt, 1987</xref>). Our work demonstrates that siGOLD can be used in large serial EM datasets to assign molecular identities to multiple neurons using different markers and to fully reconstruct and analyze the synaptic connectivity of these neurons at EM resolution.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Multiplex neuron identification with siGOLD on serial sections</title><p>In order to selectively label individual neurons in large-scale serial EM datasets, we established an immunoEM procedure to label ultrathin sections with neuronal cell-type specific antibodies. We reasoned that immunoEM performed on only a few layers from a large series of sections could identify neuron profiles that contain the antigen (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). We first performed immunoEM on 40-nm serial sections from the ventral nerve cord (VNC) of a 72 hr post-fertilization (hpf) <italic>Platynereis</italic> larva (specimen HT9-5, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B,C</xref>). For specimen preparation, we used a conventional serial TEM protocol including high-pressure freezing, fixation with a freeze substitution medium containing 2% osmium tetroxide and 0.5% uranyl acetate, and embedding in Epon. We also developed a procedure for the safe handling of several grids in parallel during the immunostaining and contrasting procedure. We optimized the immunolabeling protocol to achieve high specificity for immunoEM and high ultrastructural detail. In our protocol, we use secondary antibodies coupled to ultra small gold particles and a silver-enhancement procedure. We also fine-tuned the contrast-staining protocol to optimize contrast for both gold labeling and ultrastructural detail.<fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.11147.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Development of the siGOLD method.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Schematic flowchart of the siGOLD labeling approach from high-pressure freezing and freeze substitution (HPF-FS) to tracing and 3D reconstruction.

Four to 18 consecutive serial sections were collected on each EM grid for immunoEM. For each antibody, we stained two grids separated by a serial distance of approximately 50 sections (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). We imaged the VNC region in each section at a resolution of 2.22 nm/pixel followed by stitching and alignment of the images. We found strong and localized labeling in only a small subset of neurites for each antibody (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Shahidi, et al., 2015</xref>).

In sections where we omitted the primary antibody, we did not see any gold labeling in any of the traced neurites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). The VNC in our sample contained approximately 1600 neurite cross-sections and the majority of these showed no gold labeling. However, for each antibody we could identify a small number of neurites that consistently showed strong labeling across different sections (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Figure 3—source data 1</xref>). The pattern of the labeled neurites in the VNC showed bilateral symmetry, supporting the labeling of specific peptidergic neuron populations on the left and right sides of the body. Most neurites that were labeled on one grid were also strongly labeled on their grid pair with the same antibody separated by approximately 50 sections. There were some exceptions, for example neurite n5 that was labeled strongly with the FVamide antibody in layers 18–23 but not in layers 69–74 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Figure 3—source data 1</xref>). To determine whether the lack of labeling was due to the lack of DCVs in these sections, we scored the number of DCVs across all sections for selected neurites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>). We found that DCVs were non-uniformly distributed in the neurites and some sections completely lacked DCVs. Importantly, we only detected gold labeling on sections that contained DCVs in the respective neurite (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Figure 3—source data 1</xref>).</p><p>siGOLD also allowed us to detect the coexpression of some neuropeptides in the same neurons. For example, we found coexpression of FVa and PDF neuropeptides in a subset of the neurites labeled by these two antibodies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>). Some antibodies showed extensive overlap in labeling, including the FMRFa, luqin and RYa antibodies.</p><p>To test whether the antibodies specifically recognize the neuropeptides used for immunization, we performed morpholino-mediated knockdown experiments of proneuropeptide expression. The specificity of the MIP antibody was demonstrated previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Williams et al., 2015</xref>). We performed microinjections with 10 different translation-blocking morpholinos, one targeting each remaining proneuropeptide. We then performed triple IF in whole-mount 72 hpf larval samples using an acetylated tubulin antibody, a rat FVa antibody, and the respective rabbit neuropeptide antibodies. The acetylated tubulin antibody allowed us to exclude developmental abnormalities caused by morpholino injection. The rat FVa antibody provided a further control to exclude that morpholino injection affected proneuropeptide processing in general. For 8 out of 10 antibodies (FVa, FMRFa, ATO, FVRIa, PDF, RGWa, PENK, LEUC), morpholino injection strongly reduced IF signal with the respective antibody (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>). For the FMRFa antibody, we did not detect staining in the VNC following morpholino injection but we could still detect staining in the head. The FMRFa antibody therefore likely recognizes other antigens, such as other RFa peptides in the head (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Conzelmann et al., 2013b</xref>). For the RYa and LUQ antibodies, we did not see a reduction in staining intensity in the VNC following morpholino injection. These two antibodies may cross-react with other R[Y F]amide peptides as suggested by the labeling of an overlapping set of neurites with the FMRFa, LUQ, and RYa antibodies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). Without knowing the exact antigen specificity for these antibodies, we can nevertheless use them as specific markers of R[Y|F]amidergic neurons.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Comparison of siGOLD labeling to whole-mount immunofluorescence</title><p>siGOLD labeling of consecutive sections with 11 antibodies revealed the arrangement of several peptidergic neurites in the VNC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>).

High-accuracy image registration of different specimens is possible in <italic>Platynereis</italic>, due to the stereotypic anatomy and neuronal connectivity of the larvae (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Asadulina et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Randel et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Tomer et al., 2010</xref>). For optimal VNC registration, we generated an unbiased average whole-body reference template based on the non-rigid registration of the acetylated tubulin IF signal from 36 specimens. We aligned whole-body confocal scans of IF specimens to this reference using non-rigid image registration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A,B</xref>; <xref ref-type="other" rid="media1">Video 1</xref>). We then took virtual cross sections from this registered dataset to analyze the spatial relationships of distinct peptidergic axons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C–E</xref>). The arrangement of peptidergic axons in the VNC reconstructed by IF and image registration was similar to that of the VNC reconstructed by siGOLD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F–H</xref>). To allow a more direct comparison of the spatial relationship of peptidergic axons, we performed double IF with each of the RGWa, PDF, and LEUC antibodies generated in rabbits in combination with a FVa antibody generated in rats. The spatial relationships of the neurites labeled with the RGWa, PDF, and LEUC antibodies relative to six prominent FVa neurites was very similar between IF and siGOLD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5I,J</xref>). We could also detect the coexpression of FVa and PDF in some axons, both by double-IF and siGOLD. The high specificity of immunoEM, the reproducibility of labeling across sections, and the spatial correspondence of the labels between siGOLD and whole-mount IF indicate that we could accurately identify different peptidergic neurites in a serial EM dataset.<fig id="fig5" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.11147.011</object-id><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><title>Axonal arrangements in the VNC detected by whole-body IF spatially match those detected by siGOLD.</title><p>(<bold>A, B</bold>) Ventral overview of individual registered full-body IF with antibodies raised against 11 different neuropeptides (colors).

To demonstrate this, we focused on the nuchal organs in the <italic>Platynereis</italic> larval head as an example. The nuchal organ is a paired putative chemosensory organ in the annelid head with sensory neurons projecting a sensory dendrite into an olfactory pit. The olfactory pit is covered by cuticle and is associated with a patch of motile cilia (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10A–C</xref>; <xref ref-type="other" rid="media3">Video 3</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Purschke, 2005</xref>). We found that several sensory neurons of the nuchal organs (SN<sup>nuch</sup>) were strongly labeled by the PDF antibody in three different PDF-labeled sections in the head (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>; <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl2">Table 2</xref>). Of the 35 SN<sup>nuch</sup> cells we identified, 15 were labeled with the PDF antibody, with some of the neurons showing strong gold labeling in multiple sections (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl2">Table 2</xref>). This is consistent with the labeling of the nuchal organ with the PDF antibody in IF (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8G</xref>). We traced all SN<sup>nuch</sup> neurons and identified their direct postsynaptic targets. We found that the most strongly connected neurons, receiving up to 22 synapses from SN<sup>nuch</sup> cells, were two pairs of interneurons (IN<sup>arc</sup>) with a unique biramous morphology and contralaterally projecting axons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10D–F</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10s1">Figure 10—figure supplement 1</xref>; <xref ref-type="other" rid="media4">Video 4</xref>). Two of the IN<sup>arc</sup> neurons were previously shown to be postsynaptic to the photoreceptor cells of the larval eyespots and have connections to the ventral motorneurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Randel et al., 2015</xref>). This represents a potential functional path linking the nuchal organs to the locomotor apparatus. We also identified several other neurons that received a few synapses from the SN<sup>nuch</sup> cells, including two interneurons (IN<sup>RGWa-dcr1</sup>, IN<sup>RGWa-dcl1</sup>) that were identified by siGOLD labeling to express the RGWa neuropeptide (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9A,B</xref>). Additionally, 87 neurons received only one synapse from one of the SN<sup>nuch</sup> cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10s2">Figure 10—figure supplement 2</xref>). The strong connectivity of the IN<sup>arc</sup> cells to the nuchal organ relative to these other neurons suggests that the IN<sup>arc</sup> cells represent the functionally relevant targets in the circuit.<fig-group><fig id="fig10" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.11147.020</object-id><label>Figure 10.</label><caption><title>Reconstruction of a siGOLD-labeled peptidergic circuit.</title><p>(<bold>A, B</bold>) SEM image of the nuchal organs (arrowhead) in the dorsal-posterior head of a 72 hpf <italic>Platynereis</italic> larva, dorsal view.

Due to the sparse labeling of a few sections across many, siGOLD allows the use of several different antibody labels, each at different sections, within a single dataset. siGOLD relies on continuous series of sections of sufficient quality that allow the tracing of neurites in order to reconstruct the morphologies of labeled neurons.</p><p>Since siGOLD requires the sparse labeling of small subsets of sections, it is ideally used with markers that broadly label a neuron’s morphology. We established siGOLD using neuropeptide antibodies for two reasons. First, neuropeptides are distributed along the entire length of axons, due to their active circulation throughout the axon (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Wong et al., 2012</xref>). Second, neuropeptide antigens have unique properties, including their small size, high abundance, concentration in DCVs, and frequent C-terminal amidation, a modification that confers increased stability and immunogenicity to mature neuropeptides (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Conzelmann and Jékely, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Eipper et al., 1992</xref>). In agreement with the extreme stability of neuropeptide immunoreactivity, we could perform immunoEM of ‘set-aside’ layers using neuropeptide antibodies years after sectioning and the acquisition of the complete image series had been completed.</p><p>We did not test other antibodies, but several generally used antibody markers, including antibodies against neurotransmitters, transporters, or enzymes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Collman et al., 2015</xref>), could in principle be suitable for neuron identification using siGOLD. We established siGOLD on Epon-embedded samples that allowed robust sectioning of thousands of sections and provided high ultrastructural detail. Since Epon-embedding is known to compromise the immunogenicity of some antigens (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Brorson, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Brorson and Reinholt, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">De Paul et al., 2012</xref>), labeling for such antigens may require the use of alternative embedding resins such as Lowicryl HM-20 that provides excellent ultrastructural contrast and is compatible with many antibodies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Collman et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>siGOLD is compatible with conventional TEM using sections collected on slotted, plastic-coated nickel grids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Skepper and Powell, 2008</xref>). It is also compatible with sectioning methods that collect long ribbons of sections on a glass slide (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Blumer et al., 2002</xref>) or the high-throughput automatic tape-collecting ultramicrotome (ATUM) method (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Hayworth et al., 2014</xref>). However, siGOLD is not compatible with sectioning procedures that destroy the sections, such as focused ion beam (FIB) SEM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Reyntjens and Puers, 2001</xref>) or the serial block-face method (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Denk and Horstmann, 2004</xref>).</p><p>The siGOLD method differs from conjugate light-electron array tomography (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Collman et al., 2015</xref>) and CLEM in several aspects. Array tomography was developed to provide detailed molecular profiling of individual synapses, and uses repeated immunolabeling of every section. siGOLD does not rely on the staining of every section with multiple markers, but rather the staining of sparsely distributed sections with one marker each. The aim of siGOLD is to assign molecular tags to several different neurons and to trace them through many layers. Array tomography and CLEM involves the registration of separately acquired IF and EM images, and the relocation of the sample between the different imaging setups can be challenging and time consuming (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Timmermans and Otto, 2015</xref>). In contrast, siGOLD relies on the direct immunoEM labeling of sections and no registration step is needed. With siGOLD, we enjoy the full resolving power of the electron microscope, and in this study we could also identify individual DCVs that carry strong immunogold signal in the neurite profile of specific peptidergic neurons.</p><p>One shortcoming of the immunoEM approach is that sections cannot be relabeled after they have been contrasted and exposed to the electron beam. However, given that in siGOLD only a subset of the sections is processed for immunoEM, it is possible to use an arbitrarily large number of antibodies at different sections from a series that encompasses a large volume of tissue, allowing the multiplex identification of neuron types.</p><p>We demonstrated that siGOLD can be used to molecularly identify neurons in large serial EM datasets, in conjunction with the reconstruction of the synaptic connectivity of these neurons. We reconstructed the sensory neurons of the nuchal organs and their postsynaptic partners, representing a candidate chemotactic circuit in the <italic>Platynereis</italic> larval head. siGOLD labeling revealed that the sensory neurons express the PDF neuropeptide. The presence of DCVs and lack of clusters of clear vesicles at presynaptic sites in these neurons suggest the presence of peptidergic transmission to the target interneurons.</p><p>The bilateral projection of the nuchal organ sensory neurons is similar to that seen for olfactory receptor neurons in <italic>Drosophila</italic>. These neurons form bilateral projections, and the lateralization of odor processing is achieved by an asymmetry in neurotransmitter release (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Gaudry et al., 2013</xref>). The nuchal organ circuit may use a similar computational strategy, and this is likely different from the processing of visual information (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Randel et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Randel et al., 2015</xref>). The molecular information obtained by siGOLD provides a useful entry point to the genetic investigation of this putative chemotactic circuit in <italic>Platynereis</italic>.</p><p>The mapping of peptidergic neurons by siGOLD, together with the recent identification of several neuropeptide receptors in <italic>Platynereis</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bauknecht and Jékely, 2015</xref>), open up the possibility of a cellular-level analysis of peptidergic neurotransmission in diverse circuits in <italic>Platynereis</italic>. In total, we have identified 83 different peptidergic neurons out of approximately 2000 total in the <italic>Platynereis</italic> whole-body dataset. Further connectome tracing in these data will provide a rich source of information about specific peptidergic circuit motifs in this animal.</p><p>The siGOLD approach and the use of neuropeptide antibodies could also be adapted to enrich connectome data with molecular information in other organisms. In <italic>Platynereis</italic>, as well as vertebrates, <italic>C. elegans</italic>, and <italic>Drosophila</italic>, the majority of mature neuropeptides are amidated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Jékely, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Mirabeau and Joly, 2013</xref>), and several antibodies are available (e.g. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Johard et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Nässel, 1993</xref>)) or could readily be generated. Some neuropeptide antibodies have already been shown to work with immunoEM. For example, PDF neuropeptide-containing neurons were identified in the <italic>Drosophila</italic> brain by immunoEM and their local synaptic inputs were reconstructed from a series of sections (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Yasuyama and Meinertzhagen, 2010</xref>). This and other antibodies could be used for siGOLD labeling in larger-scale connectome projects in <italic>Drosophila</italic>. Similar protocols and reagents could also be established for other organisms. siGOLD could also be adapted to organisms where transgenic tools to deliver EM-compatible markers are not available. In such organisms, the use of cross-species antibodies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Conzelmann and Jékely, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Nässel, 1993</xref>) is a promising approach that would also allow the comparison of specific peptidergic neurons and their circuits across species.</p><p>The direct overlaying of chemical neuromodulatory maps onto synaptic connectomic maps by siGOLD opens up new possibilities for the study of nervous systems.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>M<bold>aterials and methods</bold></title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Transmission electron microscopy</title><p>Fixation and embedding was carried out on 72 hpf <italic>Platynereis</italic> larvae (HT9-4 and HT9-5) as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Conzelmann et al., 2013a</xref>).

It stabilizes the grids during the staining procedures and saves time by eliminating the need for one-by-one grid manipulation.</p><p>A 6 × 12 hole microwell mini tray plate (NUNC™ Brand MicroWell® Mini Trays) was cut into two 3 × 12 hole plate strips.

This procedure produced two lightweight plates similar to that described in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Rowley and Moran (1975</xref>) with the additional benefit of 'raised', separated walls. This approach prevents cross-contamination by diffusion of solutions during the staining and labeling procedures. A strip of Formvar support film was used to coat the microwell mini plate on the topside of the plate. A small water droplet (10 µl) was placed on each hole of the plate on the support film using a filtered syringe. A grid containing previously cut sections was placed (sections facing up) on each droplet and dried in the 50ºC oven until the grids and the plastic support film had fused.

First, sections were blocked with TBST-BGN for 10 min; blocked sections were then incubated with primary antibody (1:25 dilution) in TBST-BGN for 2 hr. Grids were washed twice with TBST-BGN for 5 min, and then incubated with secondary goat anti-rabbit IgG antibody with gold conjugates (AURION Ultra Small Immunogold Reagents; size 0.8 nm) at 1:50 dilution for 1 hr. Grids were then washed with TBST-BGN twice for 5 min, then washed twice with filtered distilled water for 5 min, followed by fixation with 1% glutaraldehyde in filtered distilled water for 5 min. Sections were washed in filtered distilled water twice for 5 min. Silver enhancement was applied with Aurion silver-enhancement kit for up to 47 min. The time interval of silver enhancement was dependent on temperature and concentration of the silver-enhancement solution. Gold size growth was approximately 15–20 nm within this time interval, a size appropriate for observation of gold particles in EM. Silver enhancement was stopped with three 3-min washes in filtered distilled water. Excess water was gently wicked from the back of the plate and individual holes with wedges of Whatman filter paper. Grids were dried in a 50°C oven and then contrasted (see above).</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>Preparation of blocking and wash buffer solution</title><p>Buffer concentration and consistency is very important in immunological reactions. We compared many protocols to achieve the best buffer for our experiments. We found that a saline buffer with Tris, Tween, bovine serum albumin (BSA), fish Gelatin, and normal serum (TBST-BGN), worked well. Our solutions were always freshly prepared on the day of the experiment. To prepare the buffer for immunoEM, three separate solutions were made: (1) 0.61 g Trizma, 0.90 g NaCl, and 70 ml of distilled water, (2) 1.0 g of BSA, 1.5 ml normal sheep serum, 500 µl Tween-20, and 20 ml distilled water, and (3) 0.01 g of fish Gelatin and 10 ml of distilled water. Solution 3 was heated to dissolve and then cooled before being added to solutions 1 and 2. Finally, solutions 1–3 were combined and gently mixed. The buffer solution was then adjusted to pH of 7.9 using 1 M HCl and syringe filtered with a 0.45 µm filter.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Imaging and post-processing</title><p>Image acquisition of TEM serial sections was performed on a FEI TECNAI Spirit transmission electron microscope equipped with an UltraScan 4000 4X4k digital camera using the image acquisition software Digital Micrograph (Gatan Software Team Inc., Pleasanton) and SerialEM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Mastronarde, 2005</xref>). The images for the HT9-4 and HT9-5 samples were scanned at a pixel resolution of 5.71 nm/pixel and 2.22 nm/pixel, respectively.

We used full-body scans of 36 larvae generated on a Zeiss LSM 780 confocal microscope with ZenBlue software. All stacks were oriented and their centers of mass were aligned. Stacks were averaged, and all stacks were aligned to this first average template using affine transformation. The 24 registered stacks most similar to the first average (as determined by an iteration metric) were then used to create an affine-transformed average. All original oriented stacks were then aligned to the affine-transformed average using affine and deformable transformation. The 24 registered stacks most similar to the affine-transformed average were then used to create an affine/deformable-transformed average. All original oriented stacks were then aligned to the affine/deformable-transformed average using affine and deformable transformation. The 24 registered stacks most similar to the affine/deformable-transformed average were then used to generate the final average acetylated tubulin reference template. The final average stack was unbiased and was used for image registration.</p><p>Imaris was used for image processing (adjusting brightness and contrast uniformly) and to take virtual cross-sections of the VNC for comparison with siGOLD samples.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Morpholino injection</title><p>Morpholino injections were performed as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Conzelmann et al., 2013a</xref>).

Your article has been reviewed by Eve Marder (Senior Editor) and three peer reviewers, one of whom, Ronald L. Calabrese, is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>The authors report a new technique that allows overlaying peptidergic neuromodulatory maps onto EM level synaptic connectivity maps in the study of nervous systems. This technique uses serial multiplex immunogold labeling (siGOLD) combined with standard serial-section transmission electron microscopy. Immunogold labeling for amidated neuropeptide epitopes, which show robust and long-term immunopreservation in Epon-embedded samples, is used, one marker per section, on sparsely distributed sections. Peptides provide unique markers because they are widely distributed in neurons including along the full lengths of axons. The advantage of siGOLD is that it relies on direct immunoEM of sections and does not rely on registering EM and IF images to assign immunolabels to specific structures. They use this technique to identify peptidergic neurons for eleven different neuropeptides in the CNS of 72 hpf <italic>Platynereis</italic> larva and they also reconstruct part of a sensory peptidergic circuit in the head of this larva.</p><p>The strength of the manuscript is the novelty and clearly demonstrated utility of the technique and its potential applicability to other preparations that are actively under investigation, including but not limited to mouse and zebra fish. Importantly, it can be used for organisms that are not now amenable to facile genetic manipulations.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>The major weaknesses pointed out in the expert reviews and which require revision are:</p><p>1) A poor presentation in which the excitement of the work is not conveyed and is irregular at places. Additionally, the choice of the sensory nuchal organs for illustration of the method is neither introduced nor discussed. There is presumably considerable scientific interest in these findings but these are not highlighted.</p><p>2) The authors do not do a thorough enough comparison with related methods (e.g. superresolution microscopy to image fluorescent probes and correlating their location with EM and array tomography) nor do they discuss applicability to other organisms adequately.</p><p>Below are excerpts from the expert reviews that expand on these needed revisions and point out other more minor revisions and clarifications that are needed.</p><p>A) It isn't clear how generalizable the method is to other targets beyond neuropeptides. Do other common neuro-related targets, such as receptors, enzymes, calcium binding proteins, etc. also survive Epon embedding so that etching steps are not required? It doesn't necessarily detract from the study if only neuropeptides can be labeled using the protocol described, but it would be helpful to discuss how broadly applicable is the approach.</p><p>B) We had a question about the statement 'Neurites that were labeled on one grid were also strongly labeled on their grid pair with the same antibody separated by approximately 50 sections.' Examination of Figure 2—source data 1 seems to indicate violations of this statement. For example, n13 labels for LUQ in layers 44-50, but not in layers 1-5. Also, n5 labels for cFVa in layers 18-23, but not in 69-74. And so on. Are we missing something? Were the axons just not contained in the unlabeled layer ranges? Or did the axons not contain dense core vesicles in the unlabeled ranges?</p><p>C) Was the average distance between dense core vesicles along axons taken in to consideration when deciding how to space out the immuno-labeled sections in the whole body EM dataset? Is there anything that prevents immuno-labeling every section besides time and effort?</p><p>D) The circuit diagram in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10G</xref> seems to imply the synapses indicated by the directed graph edges are using the respective neuropeptides for transmission. But this point isn't explicitly made. Were the immuno-labeled dense core vesicles always associated with a clear postsynaptic partner?</p><p>E) The introduction on the topic of Epon resin transitions abruptly. A sentence stating that the limitations of Epon don't apply to neuropeptides and therefore this could be exploited is called for.</p><p>F) The Introduction does not touch at all on the nuchal system and the PDF-expressing neurons. What was the point of studying them? Why were they chosen as a case study?</p><p>G) In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>, contrast seems optimized to detect immunogold particles. Processing with CLAHE would better reveal cytoplasmic membranes while still preserving the saliency of immunogold particles. What was the algorithm chosen for improving contrast?</p><p>H) In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10G</xref>, are the 1-synapse edges meaningful? What is the error rate and synapse count variance when redundantly or repeatedly mapping connections between neurons?</p><p>I) The manuscript does not address the advantage over array tomography: far faster imaging and higher resolution, both in Z (thinner sections) and in XY. &quot;With siGOLD we enjoy the full resolving power of the electron microscope&quot; should mention transmission EM; array tomography uses SEM which offers far slower image acquisition.</p><p>J) The Discussion does not address the issue of what has been learned by performing these labelings in <italic>Platynereis</italic> beyond merely proposing a circuit for chemotaxis.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.11147.029</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>The major weaknesses pointed out in the expert reviews and which require revision are: 1) A poor presentation in which the excitement of the work is not conveyed and is irregular at places.

We find it unlikely that receptors or enzymes would survive the Epon embedding procedure. We discuss the use of alternative embedding resins, such as Lowicryl HM-20 that provide excellent ultrastructural contrast and is compatible with many antibodies.</p><p><italic>B) We had a question about the statement 'Neurites that were labeled on one grid were also strongly labeled on their grid pair with the same antibody separated by approximately 50 sections.' Examination of Figure 2—source data 1 seems to indicate violations of this statement. For example, n13 labels for LUQ in layers 44-50, but not in layers 1-5. Also, n5 labels for cFVa in layers 18-23, but not in 69-74. And so on. Are we missing something? Were the axons just not contained in the unlabeled layer ranges? Or did the axons not contain dense core vesicles in the unlabeled ranges?</italic> </p><p>In order to address this comment we have now performed further quantifications. We scored the number of dense core vesicles per slice in several axons in our test series (HT9-5). We found that the lack of consistent gold labeling of the same axon with the same antibody on grid pairs was always due either to the lack of vesicles in the non-labeled part of the axon, or the termination of the axon before the labeled sections. In these axons, we never found gold labeling in layers where the respective axons lacked dense-core vesicles. For example, n5 in layers 18-23 contains many dense-core vesicles, and labels strongly for cFVa, but it does not contain any vesicles in layers 69-74, and consistently lacks cFVa labeling. We could also demonstrate the non-uniform distribution of dense-core vesicles along peptidergic axons at the sub-micron scale. Despite this, a large number of sections contain dense-core vesicles meaning that the random selection of sections for gold labeling is a feasible approach with a high rate of success. We have now included these new data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Figure 3– source data 1</xref>.</p><p><italic>C) Was the average distance between dense core vesicles along axons taken in to consideration when deciding how to space out the immuno-labeled sections in the whole body EM dataset? Is there anything that prevents immuno-labeling every section besides time and effort?</italic> </p><p>No, we picked sections at uniform intervals across the whole series. Regarding dense core vesicle distribution, see our response to comment B.</p><p>There is in principle nothing that prevents immunolabeling every section. However, besides time and effort the immunolabeling procedure introduces extra risks (losing or damaging sections), and reduces the contrast, making tracing more difficult. More importantly, immuno-labeling of every section is not necessary if the only goal is to obtain the peptidergic identity of many neurons in a series (our main objective with siGOLD). We now discuss this issue in the paper.</p><p><italic>D) The circuit diagram in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10G</xref> seems to imply the synapses indicated by the directed graph edges are using the respective neuropeptides for transmission. But this point isn't explicitly made. Were the immuno-labeled dense core vesicles always associated with a clear postsynaptic partner?</italic> </p><p>We have now characterized the synapses in the PDF positive nuchal organ sensory neurons in more detail. We measure the diameter of several vesicles that were associated with a postsynaptic partner. The vesicles are much larger than previously characterized glutamatergic synaptic vesicles of the eye photoreceptor cells. We also found that the presynaptic vesicles in the PDF neurons were dense core vesicles. These observations suggest that these neurons use neuropeptides for synaptic transmission. We have incorporated these data, including high-resolution images of example synapses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10</xref>).</p><p>Unfortunately, we did not directly gold label any synapse. Given that we only stained three sections with the PDF antibody in the head, the chances of finding a synapse exactly in these layers was slim. We labeled dense core vesicles that were not adjacent to the membrane, presumably representing the circulating pool of vesicles in the axon.</p><p><italic>E) The introduction on the topic of Epon resin transitions abruptly. A sentence stating that the limitations of Epon don't apply to neuropeptides and therefore this could be exploited is called for.</italic></p><p>We have now changed the Introduction and mentioned that the unique immunopreservation of neuropeptides has already been observed, and that we wanted to exploit this property in order to directly map neuromodulators onto connectomes.</p><p><italic>F) The Introduction does not touch at all on the nuchal system and the PDF-expressing neurons. What was the point of studying them? Why were they chosen as a case study?</italic> </p><p>The nuchal organs represent chemosensory organs in annelids that have been extensively studied by annelid morphologists and are of considerable interest for marine sensory biology and for the comparative analysis of chemosensory circuits. In our whole-body siGOLD-labeled dataset we noticed that the sensory neurons of the nuchal organs showed a striking labeling with the PDF antibody. PDF represents a conserved neuropeptide that has been extensively studied in <italic>Drosophila</italic>. We discuss in more detail the implications of the circuitry and compare it to the olfactory circuitry in <italic>Drosophila</italic>.</p><p><italic>G) In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>, contrast seems optimized to detect immunogold particles. Processing with CLAHE would better reveal cytoplasmic membranes while still preserving the saliency of immunogold particles. What was the algorithm chosen for improving contrast?</italic> </p><p>The contrast on the images in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> was only minimally adjusted. We did not use the CLAHE algorithm. We provided high-resolution raw images showing excellent membrane contrast and gold labeling (Figure 2—source data 1). These are the images as we acquire them at the electron microscope. When the tiles are stitched together to generate the final layer, the tile with the best contrast was chosen, and the contrast was applied to all other tiles on the same layer using TrakEM2 (built-in commands such as: &quot;Adjust images – Enhance contrast layer-wise&quot; and &quot;Adjust images – Set min and max layer-wise&quot;).</p><p><italic>H) In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10G</xref>, are the 1-synapse edges meaningful? What is the error rate and synapse count variance when redundantly or repeatedly mapping connections between neurons?</italic> </p><p>We do not repeatedly trace the same neuron, instead we use the built-in functionality in Catmaid to review neuron traces by different users. Two expert neuroanatomists reviewed every neuron in the described circuit at least twice. Each synapse was visited at least four times, once from the presynaptic side and once from the postsynaptic site, by both tracers. All single-synapse connections have been confirmed. However, we do not know the functional significance of such singe-synapse connections. In the revised version we only show the main synaptic partners of the nuchal organs that receive many synaptic inputs (the IN<sup>arc</sup> interneurons). We have now included a figure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10s2">Figure 10—figure supplement 2</xref>) showing all postsynaptic partners of the nuchal organ sensory neurons. It is clear that there are several other targets that receive five or less synaptic inputs from the nuchal organs, with 87 cells receiving only one synapse. These are unlikely to be all functionally relevant connections.</p><p><italic>I) The manuscript does not address the advantage over array tomography: far faster imaging and higher resolution, both in Z (thinner sections) and in XY. &quot;With siGOLD we enjoy the full resolving power of the electron microscope&quot; should mention transmission EM; array tomography uses SEM which offers far slower image acquisition.</italic> </p><p>We think that the latest SEM technology can deliver imaging speeds that are comparable (and rapidly improving!) to TEM imaging. The imaging speed in TEM will also depend largely on the detection setup. We therefore cannot say which technology is faster. The sectioning thickness can also be varied in both approaches, and also does not represent a major difference. We discuss in the text that siGOLD could also be used in combination with SEM imaging.</p><p><italic>J) The Discussion does not address the issue of what has been learned by performing these labelings in</italic> Platynereis <italic>beyond merely proposing a circuit for chemotaxis.</italic></p><p>We have now extended the Discussion of the nuchal organ circuitry and compare the lateralization of synapse distribution to the olfactory circuitry in <italic>Drosophila</italic> and the visual circuitry in <italic>Platynereis</italic>.</p></body></sub-article></article>
