particular allele during sexual reproduction. The phenomenon is observed as spore killing in multiple fungi. In natural populations of <italic>Podospora anserina</italic>, seven spore killer types (<italic>Psk</italic>s) have been identified through classical genetic analyses. Here we show that the <italic>Spok</italic> gene family underlies the <italic>Psk</italic>s. The combination of <italic>Spok</italic> genes at different chromosomal locations defines the spore killer types and creates a killing hierarchy within a population. We identify two novel <italic>Spok</italic> homologs located within a large (74–167 kbp) region (the <italic>Spok</italic> block) that resides in different chromosomal locations in different strains. We confirm that the SPOK protein performs both killing and resistance functions and show that these activities are dependent on distinct domains, a predicted nuclease and kinase domain. Genomic and phylogenetic analyses across ascomycetes suggest that the <italic>Spok</italic> genes disperse through cross-species transfer, and evolve by duplication and diversification within lineages.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.46454.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>In many organisms, most cells carry two versions of a given gene, one coming from the mother and the other from the father. An exception is sexual cells such as eggs, sperm, pollen or spores, which should only contain one variant of a gene. During their formation, these cells usually have an equal chance of inheriting one of the two gene versions.</p><p>However, a certain class of gene variants called meiotic drivers can cheat this process and end up in more than half of the sexual cells; often, the cells that contain the drivers can kill sibling cells that do not carry these variants. This results in the selfish genetic elements spreading through populations at a higher rate, sometimes with severe consequences such as shifting the ratio of males to females.</p><p>Meiotic drivers have been discovered in a wide range of organisms, from corn to mice to fruit flies and bread mold. They also exist in the fungus <italic>Podospora anserina,</italic> where they are called ‘spore killers’. Fungi are often used to study complex genetic processes, yet the identity and mode of action of spore killers in <italic>P. anserina</italic> were still unknown.</p><p>Vogan, Ament-Velásquez et al. used a combination of genetic methods to identify three genes from the <italic>Spok</italic> family which are responsible for certain spores being able to kill their siblings. Two of these were previously unknown, and they could be found in different locations throughout the genome as part of a larger genetic region. Depending on the combination of <italic>Spok</italic> genes it carries, a spore can kill or be protected against other spores that contain different permutations of the genes. Copies of these genes were also shown to be present in other fungi, including species that are a threat to crops.</p><p>Scientists have already started to create synthetic meiotic drivers to manipulate how certain traits are inherited within a population. This could be useful to control or eradicate pests and insects that transmit dangerous diseases. The results by Vogan, Ament-Velásquez et al. shine a light on the complex ways that natural meiotic drivers work, including how they can be shared between species; this knowledge could inform how to safely deploy synthetic drivers in the wild.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd><italic>Podospora</italic></kwd><kwd>selfish genetic element</kwd><kwd>spore killer</kwd><kwd>genomic conflict</kwd><kwd>fungi</kwd><kwd>gene drive</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Other</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100010663</institution-id><institution>H2020 European Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>ERC-2014-CoG</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Johannesson</surname><given-names>Hanna</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004359</institution-id><institution>Swedish Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Spore killer genomics</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Johannesson</surname><given-names>Hanna</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004722</institution-id><institution>Lars Hierta Memorial Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Podospora genomics</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ament-Velásquez</surname><given-names>S Lorena</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100005753</institution-id><institution>Royal Physiographic Society in Lund</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Podospora genomics</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ament-Velásquez</surname><given-names>S Lorena</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Members of a single gene family determine the genomic basis of multiple coexisting meiotic drive elements in natural populations of <italic>Podospora</italic>.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The genomes of all Eukaryotes harbor selfish genetic elements that employ a variety of mechanisms to undermine the canonical modes of DNA replication and meiosis in order to bias their own transmission (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib124">Werren et al., 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Burt and Trivers, 2009</xref>). As the proliferation of these elements is independent of the regulated reproduction of the host organism, they can create conflict within the genome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Rice and Holland, 1997</xref>). Such intragenomic conflict is predicted by theory to spur an arms race between the genome and the elements and, consequently, to act as a major driver of evolutionary change (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib125">Werren, 2011</xref>). To understand the extent to which intragenomic conflict has shaped the evolution of genomes and populations, it is crucial to identify the selfish genetic elements that are able to impact the dynamics of natural populations.</p><p>One important class of selfish genetic elements are known as meiotic drivers. These elements use a variety of mechanisms to hijack meiosis in order to bias their transmission to the gametes in proportions greater than 50% (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Sandler and Novitski, 1957</xref>). This segregation distortion of alleles can be difficult to observe unless it is linked to an obvious phenotype such as sex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Sandler and Novitski, 1957</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Helleu et al., 2014</xref>), thus the prevalence of meiotic drive in nature is probably underestimated. Nevertheless, meiotic drive has been observed in many model systems, including <italic>Drosophila</italic>, <italic>Mus</italic>, <italic>Neurospora</italic>, and <italic>Zea mays</italic>, suggesting that it is widespread across all major Eukaryotic groups (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Lindholm et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Bravo Núñez et al., 2018b</xref>). In ascomycete fungi, meiotic drive occurs in the form of spore killing, which represents the most direct way to observe the presence of drive (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib110">Turner and Perkins, 1991</xref>). When a strain possessing a driving allele mates with a compatible strain that does not carry the allele (i.e., a sensitive strain), the meiotic products (ascospores) that carry the driving allele will induce the abortion of their sibling spores that do not have the allele. Spore killing is apparent in the sexual structures (asci) of the fungi because it results in half of the normal number of viable spores. Owing to the haplontic life cycle of most fungi, spore killing is unusual among meiotic drivers as it is the only system in which the offspring of an organism are killed by the drive (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Lyttle, 1991</xref>). In addition, with few exceptions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Hammond et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib105">Svedberg et al., 2018</xref>), spore killer elements appear to be governed by single loci that confer both killing and resistance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Grognet et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Nuckolls et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Hu et al., 2017</xref>), which contrasts with the other well-studied drive systems that comprise genomic regions as large as entire chromosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Larracuente and Presgraves, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Hammer et al., 1989</xref>).</p><p>Meiotic drivers are often expected to reach fixation or extinction in populations relatively rapidly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Crow, 1991</xref>), at which point the effects of the drivers will no longer be observable. In agreement with this expectation, most drivers that have been described exhibit large shifts in frequencies in both time and space (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Lindholm et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Carvalho and Vaz, 1999</xref>). In the case of spore killers, multiple drivers have been found to coexist within a given species. The evolutionary dynamics of multiple drivers within species has not been thoroughly explored, but two contrasting examples are known. In the genomes of <italic>Schizosaccharomyces pombe</italic>, numerous copies of both functional and pseudogenized versions of the <italic>wtf</italic> driver genes are found (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Nuckolls et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Hu et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Eickbush et al., 2019</xref>). By contrast, the two spore killers <italic>Sk-2</italic> and <italic>Sk-3</italic> of <italic>Neurospora intermedia</italic> have only been described in wild strains four times and once, respectively, whereas resistance to spore killing is widespread (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib108">Turner, 2001</xref>). The impact of multiple drivers coexisting in a single population was not characterized in either of these cases.</p><p>Natural populations of the filamentous fungus <italic>Podospora anserina</italic> are known to host multiple spore killers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Grognet et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib114">van der Gaag et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Hamann and Osiewacz, 2004</xref>), and hence provide an ideal system for the investigation of interactions among drivers at the population level. The first spore killer gene to be described in <italic>P. anserina</italic> was <italic>het-s</italic>, a gene that is also involved in allorecognition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Dalstra et al., 2003</xref>). Another class of spore killer genes in <italic>Podospora</italic> are known as <italic>Spok</italic> genes. <italic>Spok1</italic> is only known from a single representative of <italic>P. comata</italic>, a species that is closely related to <italic>P. anserina</italic>, whereas <italic>Spok2</italic> has been shown to exist in high frequency among strains of a French population of <italic>P. anserina</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Grognet et al., 2014</xref>). <italic>Spok1</italic> is capable of killing in the presence of <italic>Spok2</italic>, but not vice versa, indicating a dominant epistatic relationship between the two genes. In addition, seven spore killer genotypes have been identified through classical genetic analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib114">van der Gaag et al., 2000</xref>). These are referred to as <italic>Psk-1</italic> through <italic>Psk-7</italic> and were defined by observing the presence, absence and frequency of killed spores in defined crosses among French and Dutch <italic>P. anserina</italic> strains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="box1fig1">Box 1—figure 1</xref>). At the onset of this study, it was not known whether the <italic>Psk</italic> elements represent independent meiotic drive genes, or whether they may be related to the <italic>Spoks</italic> and/or allorecognition loci. The <italic>het-s</italic> gene itself is not associated with the <italic>Psk</italic>s, but allorecognition is correlated with <italic>Psk</italic> spore killing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib115">van der Gaag et al., 2003</xref>). On the other hand, the relationship between the <italic>Spoks</italic> is reminiscent of the hierarchy of killing among the <italic>Psk</italic>s, suggesting a possible connection between the activity of <italic>Spok</italic> genes and <italic>Psk</italic>s.</p><boxed-text id="box1"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.46454.004</object-id><label>Box 1.</label><caption><p>The seven separate <italic>Psk</italic>s are defined by their spore-killing percentage and mutual interactions.</p></caption><p>To understand how the spore-killing percentages relate to the <italic>Psk</italic> types of the strains, it is necessary to first appreciate some of the fundamental aspects of <italic>Podospora</italic> biology. Within the fruiting body (perithecium), dikaryotic cells undergo karyogamy to produce a diploid nucleus that immediately enters meiosis. After meiosis, one round of post-meiotic mitosis occurs, resulting in eight daughter nuclei. The nuclei are packaged together with their non-sister nuclei from mitosis (dashed line) to generate dikaryotic, self-compatible spores. In a cross in which the parental strains harbor two alternative alleles for a given gene of interest (one of which is indicated by the red mark on the chromosome), spores that are either homoallelic or heteroallelic for the gene can be produced, depending on the type of segregation. Specifically, if there is no recombination event between the gene and the centromere, the gene undergoes first division segregation (FDS) and the parental alleles co-segregate during meiosis I, generating homoallelic spores (i). FDS of a spore-killing gene will thus result in a two-spored ascus (ii). If there is a recombination event between the gene of interest and the centromere, second division segregation (SDS) occurs. In this case, heteroallelic spores will be formed (i). For spore-killing, a four-spored ascus will still be produced because only one copy of the spore killer is required to provide resistance (ii). As SDS is reliant on recombination, the frequency of SDS relates to the relative distance from the centromere and can be used for linkage mapping. When there is spore-killing, the percentage of two-spored asci is the frequency of FDS, and is referred to as the ‘spore-killing percentage’. The <italic>Psk</italic>s were described by crossing different strains and evaluating their spore-killing percentage in each cross. The seven unique <italic>Psk</italic>s were shown to interact in a complex hierarchy, showing either a dominance interaction, mutual resistance, or mutual killing. (See Appendix 1 for more details and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref> for a reproduction of the hierarchy presented in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib114">van der Gaag et al., 2000</xref>).</p><fig id="box1fig1" position="anchor"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.46454.003</object-id><label>Box 1—figure 1.</label><caption><title>Schematic representation of meiotic segregation in <italic>Podospora anserina</italic>.</title></caption><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-46454-box1-fig1-v1.tif"/></fig></boxed-text><p>The primary goal of this study was to determine the identity of the genes that are responsible for the <italic>Psk</italic> spore-killer types found in <italic>P. anserina</italic>, and whether they relate to known meiotic drive genes.

In all cases, we sequenced single haploid monokaryons (marked with + or - following the strain name, to designate their mating type; see 'Materials and methods' and Appendix 1). We selected strains from a natural population in Wageningen (Wa), the Netherlands, and a few strains from France, representing six of the seven previously described <italic>Psk</italic> spore killer types (<italic>Psk-1</italic>, <italic>Psk-2</italic>, <italic>Psk-3</italic>, <italic>Psk-4</italic>, <italic>Psk-5</italic> and <italic>Psk-7</italic>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib114">van der Gaag et al., 2000</xref>) along with a strain of a novel killing type (Wa100), to which we assign the type <italic>Psk-8</italic>, and strain Wa63. The reference strain of <italic>P. anserina</italic>, S, was not given a <italic>Psk</italic> designation previously, as it was not known to induce spore-killing. However, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Grognet et al. (2014)</xref> demonstrated that it can indeed induce spore-killing, so here we assign it to <italic>Psk-S</italic> along with Wa63.

A strain annotated as T was acquired from two different laboratories, one from the Wageningen collection (referred hereafter as T<sub>D</sub>) and one from Goethe University Frankfurt (here as T<sub>G</sub>).

BUSCO analyses of these assemblies reported 97–98% of 3725 Sordariomyceta-conserved genes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>), which is concordant with the same analysis done in the reference assemblies of the <italic>P. anserina</italic> strain S+ (hereafter referred to as Podan2; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Espagne et al., 2008</xref>) and of <italic>P. comata</italic> (PODCO; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">Silar et al., 2019</xref>). Notice that as the assemblies of each strain were produced from one haploid (monokaryotic) isolate, we will refer to specific genome assemblies with their strain name followed by their corresponding mating type; for example, the assembled genome of monokaryon Wa63+ (derived from the strain Wa63) is called PaWa63p (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>).</p><p>In addition, all genomes sequenced with Illumina were assembled de novo using SPAdes.

These newly identified <italic>Spoks</italic> are found at different genomic locations depending on the strain.

We considered the <italic>Spok2</italic> sequence of S+, and the <italic>Spok3</italic> and <italic>Spok4</italic> sequences of Wa87+ as reference alleles for each homolog. Overall they show a high degree of conservation, including the 3' and 5' UTRs. A nucleotide alignment of the <italic>Spok</italic> genes’ coding sequence revealed 130 variable sites out of 2334 total sites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). A relatively large proportion (67%, 87/130) of those variable sites result in amino acid changes and 74% are unique to one of the <italic>Spok</italic> homologs. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2">Table 2</xref> displays pairwise comparisons of the amino-acid sequence of the SPOK proteins, revealing a high rate of non-synonymous substitutions, and a relatively high similarity between <italic>Spok1</italic> and <italic>Spok4</italic>.

All homologs share an intron within the 5' UTR. At the start of the coding region (CDS) there is a repeat region, in which the number of repeats varies among the homologs. The central portion of the CDS has a number of indels, which appear to be independent deletions in each of <italic>Spok2</italic>, <italic>Spok3</italic>, and <italic>Spok4</italic>. There is a frameshift mutation at the 3' end of the CDS that shifts the stop codon of <italic>Spok3</italic> and <italic>Spok4</italic> into what is the 3' UTR of <italic>Spok1</italic> and <italic>Spok2</italic>. The pseudogenized <italic>Spok</italic> gene (<italic>SpokΨ1</italic>) contains none of the aforementioned central indels and appears to share the stop codon of <italic>Spok1</italic> and <italic>Spok2</italic>. However, there are numerous mutations that result in stop codons within the CDS as well as a full DNA transposon (discoglosse) insertion.

In the strains without <italic>Spok2</italic> (Wa46, Y, and T<sub>G</sub>), the discoglosse transposon itself is interrupted and the sequence continues on the 3' end of a fragmented crapaud (<italic>gypsy</italic>/Ty3) long terminal repeat (LTR) element, which can be found in full length downstream of <italic>Spok2</italic> in the other strains.

To determine the killing relation between <italic>Spok2</italic> and <italic>Spok3</italic>, a cross was conducted between <italic>Spok3::PaPKS1</italic> and strain s (of the <italic>Psk-S</italic> type). This cross yielded mostly two-spored asci with two unpigmented spores (163/165 asci: 98.8%) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2H</xref>), indicating that <italic>Spok3</italic> kills in the presence of <italic>Spok2</italic>. Similarly, to determine the killing relation between <italic>Spok2</italic> and <italic>Spok4</italic>, a cross was conducted between <italic>Spok4::PaPKS1</italic> and s, which resulted in 99:5% killing (216/217 asci) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2I</xref>).

To address this point, <italic>Spok2</italic> killing was analyzed in a cross that was homoallelic for <italic>Spok3</italic> (<italic>Spok3::PaPKS1</italic> x <italic>Spok3::PaPKS1d</italic> Δ<italic>Spok2</italic>), which yielded 46% two-spored asci (143/310), confirming that <italic>Spok2</italic> killing occurs in the presence of <italic>Spok3</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2J</xref>).

All backcrossed strains show a few continuous tracts of SNPs from the dominant killer parent (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4—figure supplement 3</xref>). For example, Psk1xS<sub>5</sub>– has a long tract in chromosome 1 that represents the <italic>mat–</italic> mating type, which is to be expected because the published reference of S (Podan2), for which the SNPs are called, is of the opposite mating type (<italic>mat+</italic>). Importantly, the location of <italic>Spok3</italic> and/or <italic>Spok4</italic> of each parental strain has a corresponding introgressed SNP tract in the corresponding S<sub>5</sub> backcross, while all backcrossed strains possess the <italic>Spok2</italic> gene from strain S (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4—figure supplement 3</xref>). The <italic>Psk-5</italic> parental strain of Psk5xS<sub>5</sub> (strain Y) does not possess <italic>Spok2</italic>, whereas Psk5xS<sub>5</sub> does. Hence, the change in the killing phenotype of the backcrossed strain can be attributed to the presence of <italic>Spok2</italic> (see below).

However, the <italic>Psk-4</italic> strain Wa46 has no intact <italic>Spok</italic> genes (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>). The spore killing observed when this strain was crossed to S in previous publications (or to Wa63 here) is a result of <italic>Spok2</italic>-induced killing.

Moreover, our crossing data show that our representative strain of <italic>Psk-3</italic> (Wa21) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib114">van der Gaag et al., 2000</xref>) is of <italic>Psk-2</italic> killer type because it does not exhibit spore killing when crossed to Wa28 (<italic>Psk-2</italic>), because it has the expected spore-killing percentage when crossed to a <italic>Psk-S</italic> strain, and because its <italic>Spok</italic> content and location are representative of a <italic>Psk-2</italic> strain. Finally, our representative strain of <italic>Psk-6</italic> (Wa47) behaves as naïve (<italic>Psk-4</italic>), and does not exhibit the spore-killing reported by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib114">van der Gaag et al.

Isolates of <italic>Psk-1</italic>, <italic>Psk-2</italic>, <italic>Psk-4</italic>, <italic>Psk-5</italic>, and <italic>Psk-7</italic>, as well as those previously considered as ‘sensitive’ (now <italic>Psk-S</italic>), account for 92 of the 99 strains collected from Wageningen. The seven remaining strains were identified as either <italic>Psk-3</italic> or <italic>Psk-6</italic>.

We estimate that <italic>Spok2</italic> is in 98%, <italic>Spok3</italic> in 17%, and <italic>Spok4</italic> in 11% of the Wageningen strains. A subsample of 11 strains from the 1937 French collection (including strains Y, Z and T<sub>G</sub>) have also been assessed for their <italic>Psk</italic> type , as have eight strains from a collection from Usingen (Us), Germany (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Hamann and Osiewacz, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib114">van der Gaag et al., 2000</xref>).

When present, the <italic>Spok</italic> block was found once per genome and always contained at least one <italic>Spok</italic> gene.

Importantly, these positions correspond to a single SNP tract identified in the S<sub>5</sub> backcrosses. In <italic>P. pauciseta</italic> (CBS237.71), the <italic>Spok</italic> block is found on chromosome 4.

However the F1 progeny from this cross show no killing when crossed to either parent, nor when selfed, satisfying condition 2. Thus they are mutually resistant, which is consistent with the fact that they carry the same three <italic>Spok</italic> genes. The reason spore killing is observed in the original cross is because the <italic>Spok</italic> block is located at different genomic positions. As a result, the <italic>Spok</italic> block can co-segregate during meiosis, leaving two spores without any <italic>Spoks</italic> and making them vulnerable to killing (see Appendix 1 for a detailed explanation). An example in which the <italic>Psks</italic> show dominance is in the interaction between <italic>Psk-7</italic> and <italic>Psk-8</italic>, which is revealed by the absence of killing when an F1 progeny from a <italic>Psk-7</italic> x <italic>Psk-8</italic> cross is selfed or crossed to the <italic>Psk-7</italic> parent, and the observation of killing when crossed to the <italic>Psk-8</italic> parent. This result indicates that the F1 progeny inherited its killing function from the <italic>Psk-7</italic> parent, and is consistent with the idea that <italic>Spok</italic> gene interaction determine killing as, although <italic>Psk-8</italic> and <italic>Psk-7</italic> strains have a <italic>Spok</italic> block in the same location, the <italic>Psk-8</italic> version of the block does not possess <italic>Spok3</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>).</p><p>The backcrossing method described above was not conducted for representative strains of all pairwise interactions among the <italic>Psks</italic> because of the unmanageable number of crosses that would be involved and the difficulty in mating some strains. In cases where dominance was strongly suspected (on the basis of <italic>Spok</italic> gene distribution, such as with crosses to <italic>Psk-S</italic> or naïve strains), the killing percentage was used as a proxy for dominance because in crosses involving dominance, the killing percentage should reflect that of the dominant <italic>Psk</italic> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig4sdata2">Figure 4—source data 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig4sdata3">3</xref>). <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref> displays these results as a killing hierarchy, in which strains of the <italic>Psk</italic> type at the top of the hierarchy are dominant to strains of the <italic>Psk</italic> type lower in the hierarchy and either mutually resistant to (level 3) or mutual killers of (level 2) strains on the same level. The exception is <italic>Psk-5</italic>, which exhibits mutual killing with <italic>Psk-S</italic>. Our classifications, based on crosses, show that the killing hierarchy observed in the Wageningen population of <italic>P. anserina</italic> is an emergent property of the presence and absence of the various <italic>Spok</italic> homologs in the different genomes. Hence, our data demonstrate that other components of the <italic>Spok</italic> block do not affect spore-killing.</p><p>Of note, crosses between <italic>Psk-1</italic> and <italic>Psk-5</italic> strains have a lower killing percentage than would be expected on the basis of the FDS of <italic>Spok2</italic> (~25% instead of ~40%). We confirmed that <italic>Spok2</italic> is completely associated with two-spored asci in these crosses using a pooled sequencing approach (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s5">Figure 4—figure supplement 5</xref>), an observation that is in line with the backcrossing results. However, we noted a high prevalence of three-spored asci (which were excluded from the analyses). We also observed three-spored asci in crosses between <italic>Psk-S</italic> and naïve strains. Despite low germination rates, we have been able to isolate a spore from a three-spored ascus in a cross between <italic>Psk-S</italic> and a naïve strain that has no copy of <italic>Spok2</italic> (Appendix 2). Therefore, the three-spored asci are probably due to incomplete penetrance of the killing factor and support the conclusion that the spore killing observed in these crosses is caused by the same gene, <italic>Spok2</italic>. This result is consistent with findings presented in the study by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib116">van der Gaag (2005)</xref> that provided independent evidence for incomplete penetrance of spore-killing between S and Wa46 (<italic>Psk-S</italic> and naïve).

To investigate the role that the domains 1–3 may play in these two functions, we constructed a number of point mutations and truncation variants of <italic>Spok3</italic> and assayed their ability to kill or provide resistance in vegetative cells. We were able to determine that domain 2 is important for killing activity whereas domain 3 is important for resistance activity.</p><p>It had been shown previously that the predicted kinase domain of SPOK2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>) is involved in the resistance function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Grognet et al., 2014</xref>). We introduced a point mutation in a plasmid-cloned <italic>Spok3</italic> gene that led to the replacement of the predicted catalytic aspartic acid residue of <italic>Spok3</italic> by an alanine (D667A). The mutant allele was first used to transform a Δ<italic>Spok2</italic> recipient strain. This <italic>Spok3</italic> D667A mutant allele leads to a drastic reduction in transformation efficiency (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig6sdata1">Figure 6—source data 1</xref>), whereas the <italic>Spok3</italic> wildtypeallele only moderately affects the number of transformants. As this approach results in random integration and potential multicopy insertion, we also attempted to introduce the mutant <italic>Spok3</italic> D667A allele as a single copy at the <italic>PaPKS1</italic> locus, as described above for wildtype <italic>Spok3</italic>. The initial transformants were heterokaryotic and displayed sectors of abnormal growth that corresponded to unpigmented mycelium, presumably containing nuclei with <italic>Spok3</italic> D667A that inserted at <italic>PaPKS1</italic>. Monokaryotic transformants could be recovered and were tested for killing activity in a cross to a Δ<italic>Spok2</italic>. Four-spored asci with two white and two black spores were observed, suggesting that the D667A mutation abolishes spore killing. However, when the integrated <italic>Spok3</italic> allele was amplified by PCR and sequenced, it appeared that the allele presents a GAG to TAG mutation, leading to a premature stop codon in position 282 (E282stop). This result is consistent with the observation that <italic>Spok3</italic> D667A affects transformation efficiency and is toxic. Moreover, we detected expression of <italic>Spok2</italic> and <italic>Spok1</italic> in the vegetative cells of monokaryotic (self-sterile) cultures, suggesting that <italic>Spok</italic> activity is not restricted to the sexual cycle (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2C and D</xref>). No further attempts to insert the mutant allele at <italic>PaPKS1</italic> were made.</p><p>If the toxicity of the <italic>Spok3</italic> D667A allele in vegetative cells is mechanistically related to spore-killing, it is expected that this toxicity should be suppressed by wildtype <italic>Spok3</italic>.

Co-transformation experiments were set up with <italic>Spok3</italic> D667A used as the transformation vector in the presence or absence of <italic>wt Spok3</italic>. As in the previous experiment, <italic>Spok3</italic> D667A alone was found to affect transformation efficiency, but this effect was suppressed in co-transformations with <italic>Spok3</italic> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig6sdata1">Figure 6—source data 1</xref>). This experiment confirms that <italic>Spok3</italic> D667A is only toxic in the absence of <italic>Spok3</italic>. Therefore, the <italic>Spok</italic>-related killing and resistance activities can be recapitulated in vegetative cells.</p><p>We also analyzed the role of the conserved cysteine cluster just upstream of the predicted kinase domain. Three plasmids with point mutations in that region were constructed (a C493A C497A double mutant, and C511A and C511S point mutants), and the mutant alleles were used in transformation assays as previously described for <italic>Spok3</italic> D667A. All three mutants reduced transformation efficiencies as compared to the controls, and this effect was suppressed in co-transformations with <italic>wt Spok3</italic> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig6sdata1">Figure 6—source data 1</xref>). These results suggest that the kinase domain and the cysteine-cluster region are both required for the <italic>Spok</italic>-related resistance function but not for the killing activity. To test this, we constructed a truncated allele of <italic>Spok3</italic> that lacks these two regions: <italic>Spok3</italic>(1–490) (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>).

If, as proposed here, the toxicity and suppression activities assayed in vegetative cells are mechanistically related to spore-killing, then domain 3 appears to be required for the resistance function but dispensable for the killing activity, which can be carried out by the N-terminal region of the SPOK3 protein (domains 1 and 2).</p><p>Next we analyzed the role of the predicted nuclease domain (domain 2) in spore-killing activity. We generated a plasmid with a point mutant that affects the predicted catalytic core lysine residue (K240A). Introduction of this point mutation in the <italic>Spok3</italic>(1--490) allele abolished its killing activity in transformation assays (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig6sdata1">Figure 6—source data 1</xref>), suggesting that the predicted nuclease domain is required for killing activity. The <italic>Spok3</italic> K240A mutant was then inserted at the <italic>PaPKS1</italic> locus and the resulting knock-in strain was crossed with a Δ<italic>Spok2</italic> strain (in order to assay killing) and to a <italic>Spok3::PaPKS1d</italic> strain (to assay resistance) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2M and N</xref>). In the cross to Δ<italic>Spok2</italic>, no killing was observed: the majority of the asci were four-spored with two white and two black spores (308/379, 81.2%), indicating that the K240A mutation abolishes the spore-killing activity of <italic>Spok3</italic>. In the <italic>Spok3</italic> K240D<italic>::PaPKS1</italic> x <italic>Spok3::PaPKS1d</italic> cross, no killing was observed: the majority of the asci were four-spored with two white and two black spores (268/308, 87%). These crosses indicate that the <italic>Spok3</italic> K240A allele has no killing ability but has retained resistance. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Grognet et al.

These phylogenies reveal two notable patterns. First, the SPOK phylogeny shows a high degree of incongruence with the species phylogeny. Moreover, the SPOK phylogeny can be robustly divided into two clades: Clade I and II. Clade I contains the Fs_82228 sequence from <italic>Fusarium solani</italic> (old name <italic>Nectria haematococca</italic>). This sequence was previously introduced into <italic>P. anserina</italic>, and the genetically modified strain produced empty asci when mated to a naïve strain, suggesting that it has a killing action (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Grognet et al., 2014</xref>). Clade II contains the <italic>Podospora</italic> Spok homologs. The sequences from the two clades are disparately distributed in the species phylogeny. The second notable pattern is the distribution of the SPOK sequences within the genomes. The sequences in Clade I are present in single copies in each strain, except for <italic>Fusarium oxysporum</italic> f. sp. <italic>pisi</italic> (Fop), suggesting that they are all orthologs. By contrast, many of the sequences in Clade II are present in multiple copies in each genome. It is particularly interesting to note how many <italic>Spok</italic> homologs from Clade II are present across strains of <italic>F. oxysporum</italic> (Fo) and the number of copies that are found in each genome. Several of the duplicate <italic>Spok</italic> homologs are present on the lineage-specific chromosomes of <italic>Fusarium</italic> that are often associated with pathogenicity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Armitage et al., 2018</xref>). <italic>Beauveria bassiana</italic> (Bb) also shows a high degree of variability in homolog content among the four strains that have homologs, indicating that the homologs are polymorphic in this species. The insect pathogen <italic>Metarhizium rileyi</italic> (Mr) shows an interesting pattern in that it possesses four divergent homologs, which is in stark contrast to many of the other species(including <italic>Podospora</italic>) that have multiple, though nearly identical, copies. The Clade II <italic>Spok</italic> homologs also appear to diversify within each strain or species in much the same way as the <italic>Spok</italic> genes do in <italic>Podospora</italic>, with variable lengths of the coil-coil repeat region and frameshift mutations near the 3′ end that relocate the stop codon. A few of the sequences may also represent pseudogenes, as evidenced by premature stop codons and/or frameshifts, although these features might also be the result of unidentified introns (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>The identification of <italic>Spok3</italic> and <italic>Spok4</italic> has allowed us to explain the genomic basis for five of the seven <italic>Psk</italic> spore-killer types found in natural populations of <italic>P. anserina</italic>.

Often, meiotic drive elements occupy regions of suppressed recombination that span large tracts of chromosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib109">Turner and Perkins, 1979</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Hammer et al., 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Sandler et al., 1959</xref>) and co-occur with complex rearrangements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Harvey et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib97">Silver, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Dyer et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib105">Svedberg et al., 2018</xref>). In these well-studied cases, the elements of the drive mechanisms are encoded by separate genes within the region, and the rearrangements and suppression of recombination are expected to have evolved to ensure that the drive machinery (e.g., the toxin and antitoxin genes) is inherited as one unit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Lyttle, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Bravo Núñez et al., 2018b</xref>). In <italic>Podospora</italic>, a single <italic>Spok</italic> gene is fully capable of driving, and thus no region of suppressed recombination is required. Nevertheless, <italic>Spok3</italic> and <italic>Spok4</italic> are found in a large region that is not syntenic with the null allele. Hence, had the <italic>Spok</italic> genes not been previously identified from more placid genomic regions, the entire <italic>Spok</italic> block may have been misidentified as a driving haplotype with multiple interacting components. Considering that single-gene meiotic drivers might be more common than anticipated, it becomes necessary to question whether other drive systems that are located within complex regions, and for which the genetics are not well known, may also represent single gene drivers.</p><p>At this stage, our data strongly suggest that the <italic>Spok</italic> block is moving in the genomes as a unit, but nevertheless, the mechanism of movement remains unknown. It may be hypothesized that movement of the block is achieved via an interaction with TEs at different genomic locations and non-allelic homologous recombination. This hypothesis is supported by the observation that the <italic>Spok</italic> genes outside of the <italic>Spok</italic> block, including <italic>SpokΨ1</italic>, are not located at the same position in different species, and that they are often surrounded by similar TEs. Such movement may be under selection as matings between strains that have the same <italic>Spok</italic> genes but in different locations will result in spore-killing. Furthermore, because of the idiosyncrasies of meiosis in <italic>Podospora</italic>, the position of the block may be under selection because the killing frequency is dependent on the frequency of crossing over with the centromere. Alternatively, the TEs may simply accumulate around the <italic>Spok</italic> genes because of a reduced efficacy of purifying selection at regions linked to the driver genes; their presence per se might increase the chance of rearrangements. As such, the role that TEs play in generating complex regions that are associated with meiotic drive should be investigated further in order to determine their importance in the evolution of drive.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Molecular function of the <italic>Spok </italic>genes</title><p>Spore-killing systems display analogies to toxin-antitoxin (TA) systems in bacteria and it is interesting to note that many toxin families rely on nuclease activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Harms et al., 2018</xref>). The contrast between the <italic>Spok</italic> system and TA systems, however, resides in the fact that <italic>Spok</italic> toxin and antitoxin activities appear to be supported by the same protein molecule. The predicted kinase activity seems able to counter the toxic activity of the predicted nuclease domain both in cis and in trans. Mechanistic spore-killing models have to explain: (i) how the <italic>Spok</italic> gene can affect spores that do not carry it, at a distance, with SPOK proteins being intracellular proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Grognet et al., 2014</xref>); and (ii) how asymmetry is brought about in this system if killing and resistance activities are carried by the same protein molecule. It is premature to devise a mechanistic model for the molecular basis of <italic>Spok</italic> gene drive, yet it might be possible to conjecture about the substrates of the proposed kinase (and nuclease) activities of SPOK proteins.</p><p>A first way to explain how <italic>Spok</italic> genes might act at distance and affect spores not containing them is to hypothesize that toxicity relies on the production of a diffusible metabolite. The predicted nuclease/phosphodiesterase activity would lead to the production of a diffusible toxic molecule that could be further detoxified by phosphorylation (much in the way that bacterial phosphotransferases detoxify antibiotics) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Shi et al., 2013</xref>). Isolation of the toxic intermediate from the detoxifying activity of the kinase would allow its accumulation specifically outside of the spores expressing SPOK proteins, and thus could bring about asymmetry in spore-killing. Then, alternatively, spores lacking the <italic>Spok</italic> gene might be affected by SPOK proteins if some amount of SPOK protein expressed in the zygote or from sister nuclei is carried over at the time of spore delimitation. The resistance function of the predicted kinase domain could be explained by hypothesizing that the nuclease activity can be inhibited by autophosphorylation of the SPOK proteins. Alternatively, it could also be that it is the phosphorylation of a distinct macromolecule that nullifies toxicity. In a simple model, the same molecule could be the target of both the kinase and nuclease activity, and the phosphorylation of the target would make it resistant to the toxic action of the predicted nuclease domain. As stated above, models have to explain how killing could occur specifically in spores lacking the <italic>Spok</italic> gene. This situation could occur if the proposed kinase activity is concentration-dependent and favored at higher SPOK protein concentrations (for instance, the kinase activity might require a protein dimerization step that occurs specifically in spores expressing the <italic>Spok</italic> gene). In addition to the yet unresolved mechanistic basis of killing and resistance, the characterization of <italic>Spok</italic> gene function described here poses another puzzle. As all SPOK products have a predicted active kinase, it is not yet known what changes in sequence confer the hierarchical interactions among some <italic>Spok</italic> genes, or why not all SPOKs are able to provide resistance to one another. One possibility is that the cellular targets for the proposed nuclease and kinase activities differ for the different SPOK proteins.</p><p>Studies of similar protein domains suggest that the coil-coiled domain is likely to be involved in protein–protein interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib118">van Maldegem et al., 2015</xref>). The fact that <italic>Spok1</italic> and <italic>Spok4</italic> have the same length repeat in this domain could imply that the protein–protein interactions of this domain are important for resistance, as <italic>Spok1</italic> and <italic>Spok4</italic> are mutually resistant. This model would agree somewhat with the results of reporter constructs from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Grognet et al. (2014)</xref>, which showed an N-terminal mCherry tag on <italic>Spok2-</italic>produced empty asci. It is possible that the functional divergence observed between the SPOK proteins is due to mutations in this portion of the protein. In this model, domain 1 might be responsible for the target specificity of the nuclease (and kinase) activity. The killing action itself is expected to be universal among the <italic>Spoks</italic> and is supported by the fact that this entire domain of <italic>Spok3</italic> from T<sub>G</sub> is identical to <italic>Spok4</italic>, yet appears to retain <italic>Spok3</italic> functionality. The identification of the role of the predicted nuclease domain in killing and of the predicted kinase domain in resistance provides a first mechanistic insight into the dual role of <italic>Spok</italic> genes. However, further dissection of the molecular action of these proteins is required so that we can fully understand the molecular basis of <italic>Spok</italic> drive.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Absence of resistance</title><p>One of the main factors that stands out in the <italic>Podospora</italic> system, as compared to the other well-studied spore killers, is the lack of resistant strains. Only one strain of <italic>P. anserina</italic> (the French strain A) has ever been described as resistant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Grognet et al., 2014</xref>). The point mutations of <italic>Spok3</italic> that were induced in the laboratory imply that the creation of a resistant strain is a simple task, as only a single nucleotide change was required. Likewise, the resistant strain A <italic>Spok2</italic> is different from the reference allele by only two novel insertions. Consequently, the lack of resistance does not appear to be the result of a mechanistic constraint. Potentially, the current <italic>Spok</italic> gene distribution could be a relatively young phenomenon and resistance could evolve over time. Another possibility is that resistance itself is somehow costly to the organism and selected against. In addition, it is puzzling that none of the <italic>Spoks</italic> in <italic>P. anserina</italic> show cross resistance. Intuitively, it would seem advantageous for novel <italic>Spok</italic> homologs to evolve new killing functions while maintaining resistance to the other <italic>Spok</italic> homologs. Again, the lack of cross-resistance does not solely appear to be the result of functional constraints, as <italic>Spok1</italic>, which is highly similar to <italic>Spok4</italic>, is resistant to all other <italic>Spok</italic> homologs. It is possible that it is more advantageous to combine multiple independent spore killers than to have a single broadly resistant gene. This option is supported by two observations presented in this study: the occurrence of the killing hierarchy and the association of <italic>Spok3</italic> and <italic>Spok4</italic>. The fact that <italic>Spok3</italic> and <italic>Spok4</italic> are present in the <italic>Spok</italic> block means that they are in tight linkage with each other. It may be the case that the linkage was selected for because it provided strains with the ability to drive against strains with just <italic>Spok3</italic> or just <italic>Spok4</italic>. However, this association could also be simply the result of a duplication without invoking selection. Whether the killing hierarchy that we observe in <italic>P. anserina</italic> is due to a complex battle among the <italic>Spok</italic> homologs or a result of the existence of the <italic>Spok</italic> block will require further experimentation and mathematical modeling to resolve.</p></sec><sec id="s3-4"><title>Evolutionary dynamics of the <italic>Spok </italic>genes</title><p>Some interesting aspects of meiotic drive in <italic>Podospora</italic> identified herein bear numerous features that parallel the <italic>wtf</italic> genes that are responsible for drive in <italic>Schizosaccharomyces</italic> <italic>pombe</italic>. There is no sequence similarity or conserved domains between the <italic>Spok</italic> and <italic>wtf</italic> genes, and <italic>Podospora</italic> and <italic>Schizosaccharomyces</italic> are only distantly related (~500 million years diverged) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib122">Wang et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Prieto and Wedin, 2013</xref>). Yet these systems display similar evolutionary dynamics within their respective species. Both of these systems are built of multiple members of gene families, which appear to duplicate, rapidly diverge to the point where they no longer show cross reactions (potentially with the aid of gene conversion), and then pseudogenize and become nonfunctional (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Nuckolls et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Bravo Núñez et al., 2018a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Hu et al., 2017</xref>). Both systems also have close associations with TEs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Bowen et al., 2003</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Hu et al. (2017)</xref> invoke LTR-mediated non-allelic homologous recombination as a possible mechanism for <italic>wtf</italic> gene deletion in a lab strain of <italic>S. pombe</italic>. We provide evidence for the deletion of <italic>Spok2</italic>, but it does not fit with expectation that this deletion is LTR-mediated. Nevertheless, as TEs are still accumulating in the region, other TE-related processes may have been involved in the deletion.</p><p>The factors that determine the abundance and diversity of multigene family meiotic drivers in a species are the rates of gene duplication and loss, and time since origin. In the case of the <italic>Spok</italic> genes, we expect a low rate of deletion as they approach fixation because of the dikaryotic nature of <italic>Podospora</italic>. Specifically, when first appearing, a deletion is only expected to be present in one of the two separate nuclear genomes maintained within a dikaryon. Any selfing event should erase (i.e. drive against) the deletion, meaning that in order to become homoallelic for a deletion, the strain would have to outcross with another individual with no <italic>Spok </italic>genes or <italic>Spok </italic>genes that differ from its own. Such outcrossing could allow deletions of <italic>Spok3</italic> and <italic>Spok4</italic>, but as <italic>Spok2</italic> is nearly fixed in the population, any outcrossing event should also lead to the elimination of the deletion by the driving action of <italic>Spok2</italic>. A possible solution to the paradoxical finding that <italic>Spok2</italic> appears to have been lost occasionally is that the incomplete penetrance of <italic>Spok2</italic> may have allowed spores that were homoallelic for the deletion to survive and persist. In this sense, <italic>Spok2</italic> fits a model of driver turn over, wherein it is beginning to lose killing function after becoming fixed in the population. <italic>SpokΨ1</italic> is missing the portion of the gene that is responsible for killing and the small <italic>Spok</italic> fragment of <italic>P. comata</italic> also corresponds to the resistance part of the gene. Both of these observations suggest that the killing domain may have been lost prior to these genes becoming fully pseudogenized and hints that they may have functioned as resistance genes.</p><p>It has been pointed out that spore-killing may be a weak form of meiotic drive, because the transmission advantage is relative to the number of spores produced in a given cross, but there is no absolute increase at the population level (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Lyttle, 1991</xref>). Hence, a spore killer was predicted by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Nauta and Hoekstra (1993)</xref> to require an additional fitness advantage in order to reach fixation in a population. It is thus striking that <italic>Spok2</italic> is close to fixation in at least the European populations, bringing into question the direct fitness effects of the <italic>Spok</italic> genes. On the other hand, the <italic>Spok</italic> block (and hence <italic>Spok3</italic> and <italic>Spok4</italic>) seems to be present at relatively low frequency. It is possible that the rate at which the <italic>Spok</italic> block switches position is higher than the rate at which the <italic>Spoks</italic> can sweep to fixation. Therefore, the dynamics of <italic>Spok</italic> genes within the <italic>Spok</italic> block might differ from the <italic>Spok2</italic> life-cycle and might explain why spore-killing is observed to be polymorphic in <italic>P. anserina</italic>. In addition, <italic>P. anserina</italic> is capable of selfing, which may slow down the rate of fixation of the genes. Moreover, the vegetative and/or sexual expression of the <italic>Spok</italic> genes might be deleterious in itself, and hence natural selection might increase or maintain the frequency of strains without all <italic>Spok</italic> homologs. Overall, this complex system requires population genetic modeling to resolve the factors affecting the frequency of the <italic>Spok</italic> genes in populations of this fungus.</p><p>The relationships among the <italic>Spok</italic> gene<italic>s</italic> can provide insight as to the evolutionary history of the <italic>Spok</italic> block. The observation that <italic>Spok3</italic> and <italic>Spok4</italic> are both present in the <italic>Spok</italic> block in a duplicate region suggests that these genes represent paralogs that formed via duplication. Indeed, the phylogenetic analysis of the UTRs agrees with a duplication origin. However, this scenario is contradicted by the finding that <italic>Spok4</italic> shares many features with <italic>Spok1 of P. comata</italic>, but not <italic>Spok3</italic>. The four most likely evolutionary scenarios are outlined in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>. If the relationship between <italic>Spok1</italic> and <italic>Spok4</italic> is a result of common descent (orthology; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8A</xref>), then after the duplication event that generated <italic>Spok3</italic> and <italic>Spok4</italic>, <italic>Spok3</italic> would have to have had a much higher rate of change than both <italic>Spok1</italic> and <italic>Spok4</italic> in order to explain the observed divergence. In addition, the inferred deletions in the <italic>Spok3</italic> coding sequence would have to be reverted by gene conversion with an unknown <italic>Spok</italic> homolog, and new deletions would have to appear subsequently in <italic>Spok3</italic>.</p><p>Alternatively, the diversification of the <italic>Spok </italic>genes may have been influenced by past hybridization, and we discuss a few possible scenarios here. One possibility is that <italic>Spok4</italic> was introduced into <italic>P. comata</italic>, which then diverged to become <italic>Spok1</italic> after the duplication event (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8B</xref>). This divergence would then have to be followed by gene conversion in order to account for the shared frameshift mutation in <italic>Spok3</italic> and <italic>Spok4</italic>. On the other hand, <italic>Spok1</italic> may have been transferred to <italic>P. anserina</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8C</xref>), and then duplicated to form <italic>Spok3</italic> and <italic>Spok4</italic>, but this scenario requires the same additional steps as the orthology scenario. A final option is that <italic>Spok3</italic> and <italic>Spok4</italic> are not homologs formed via duplication but rather orthologs that evolved independently in separate populations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8D</xref>). Their current positions in the <italic>Spok</italic> block could be due to the fusion of ancestral blocks, followed by gene conversion. In <italic>P. pauciseta</italic> (CBS237.71), <italic>Spok3</italic>, <italic>Spok4</italic>, and the <italic>Spok</italic> block are nearly identical to the same sequences in <italic>P. anserina</italic>, so in order to explain the current pattern of the <italic>Spok</italic> genes and the <italic>Spok</italic> block without interspecies transfer, the block would have had to remain virtually unchanged since the divergence of <italic>P. anserina</italic> and <italic>P. pauciseta</italic>. This scenario seems highly unlikely given the relative divergence between the three species. The broader <italic>Spok</italic> homolog phylogeny presented here is also not consistent with a simple vertical decent model, supporting the conclusion that the evolution of the <italic>Spok</italic> genes has involved inter-lineage transfers. Such interspecies interactions that mediate the introgression of meiotic drive genes between species would not be a phenomenon that is unique to the <italic>Spok</italic> genes of <italic>Podospora</italic>, as meiotic drive genes in <italic>Drosophila</italic> have been observed to cross species boundaries and erode barriers of reproduction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Meiklejohn et al., 2018</xref>). Further analyses of the genomes of populations of multiple <italic>Podospora</italic> species is needed in order to resolve the history of the <italic>Spok</italic> genes and the block.</p><fig id="fig8" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.46454.033</object-id><label>Figure 8.</label><caption><title>Evolutionary models of <italic>Spok</italic> diversification.</title><p>See main text for a description of the models.

Here, we have identified a group of more closely related homologs (clade II) from genome sequences that have been released since the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Grognet et al. (2014)</xref> study, allowing us to analyze the evolutionary history at a finer resolution. The phylogenetic distribution of the clade II <italic>Spok</italic> homologs supports the general hypothesis that the <italic>Spok</italic> genes are transferred horizontally among evolutionarily disparate groups, as suggested by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Grognet et al. (2014)</xref>. For example, the eurotiomycete <italic>Polytolypa hystricis</italic> possesses a homolog that is closely related to the <italic>Podospora Spok </italic>genes. However, the phylogeny presented here shows that a subset of the clade II homologs agree with the relationships among closely related species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Maharachchikumbura et al., 2015</xref>), suggesting an alternative hypothesis whereby the <italic>Spok</italic> genes are ancestral to the Sordariomycetes but lost frequently. Such a scenario would imply that there are long-term consequences of possessing spore-killer genes, even if they are fixed in the population. These two hypotheses are not mutually exclusive, and with our data, we are not able to disentangle their relative importance for the observed pattern.</p><p>The diversification pattern may also give insight into the possibility that SPOK homologs function as drivers in lineages other than <italic>Podospora</italic>. The phylogeny presented here suggests that the clade I homologs do not represent meiotic drive genes because only one presumably orthologous copy is typically found. By contrast, the numerous closely related <italic>Spok</italic> homologs of clade II may be driving. For example, in <italic>F. oxysporum</italic> f. sp. <italic>cepae</italic> four nearly identical copies are found, resembling the distribution of the <italic>Spok</italic> genes in <italic>Podospora</italic>. However, no sexual cycle has been observed in <italic>F. oxysporum</italic>. Given that we demonstrate vegetative killing with <italic>Spok3</italic>, it is possible that the <italic>Fusarium Spok </italic>g<italic>enes</italic> operate in vegetative tissue to ensure the maintenance of the pathogenic-associated chromosomes. Alternatively, as <italic>F. oxysporum</italic> strains have been found with both mating type alleles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">O'Donnell et al., 2004</xref>), there may be a cryptic sexual cycle in which the <italic>Spok</italic> homologs are active.</p></sec><sec id="s3-6"><title>Conclusions</title><p>With this study, we have provided a robust connection between the phenotype and genotype of spore-killing in <italic>P. anserina</italic>.

The S<sub>14</sub> backcrosses (see below) were mated to the strain S in order to obtain killer heteroallelic spores (from four-spore asci) that were dissected from ripe fruiting bodies (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>). The spores were germinated in plates of PASM2 with 5 g/L ammonium acetate added. Two days after germination, the culture was stored in PASM0.2 media at 4°C to arrest growth. From that stock, we inoculated HPM plates with either a polycarbonate track etched 76 mm 0.1 µm membrane disk (Poretics, GVS Life Sciences, USA) (Psk1xS<sub>5</sub> and Psk7xS<sub>5</sub>) or a cellophane layer (Psk2xS<sub>5</sub> and Psk5xS<sub>5</sub>) on top. The mycelia were grown for ~11 days and harvested for RNA extraction when the first spores were shot into the plate lid, ensuring several stages of fruiting body development. Note that <italic>P. anserina</italic> starts to degrade cellophane after ~6 days, and therefore the polycarbonate membrane allows for longer growing periods. Spore-killing was independently confirmed on HPM plates inoculated without a membrane. In addition, in order to improve gene annotation, we grew the strains Wa63– and T<sub>D</sub>+ on a cellophane layer on HPM for 11 and 7 days, respectively, to capture transcripts occurring during the monokaryotic phase.</p><p>The harvested mycelia were immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at −80°C until RNA extraction. Next, 150 mg of frozen tissue was ground under liquid nitrogen and total RNA was extracted using an RNeasy Plant Mini Kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany). The quality of RNA was checked on the Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer (Agilent Technologies, USA). All RNA samples were treated with DNaseI (Thermo Scientific). Sequencing libraries were prepared using an NEBNext Ultra Directional RNA Library Prep Kit for Illumina (New England Biolabs). The mRNA was selected by purifying polyA+ transcripts (NEBNext Poly(A) mRNA Magnetic Isolation Module, New England Biolabs). Finally, paired-end libraries were sequenced with Illumina HiSeq 2500 at the SNP and SEQ Technology platform.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Genomic analyses</title><p>For both DNA and RNA Illumina HiSeq reads, adapters were identified with cutadapt v. 1.13 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Martin, 2011</xref>) and then trimmed using Trimmomatic 0.36 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Bolger et al., 2014</xref>) with the options ILLUMINACLIP:adapters.fasta:1:30:9 LEADING:20 TRAILING:20 SLIDINGWINDOW:4:20 MINLEN:30.

Scaffolds were assigned to chromosome numbers on the basis of homology with Podan2. Small scaffolds (&lt;100 kb) corresponding to rDNA and mitochondrial-derivatives were discarded. Only the biggest mitochondrial scaffold was retained.

As the MinION assemblies maintain some degree of sequencing error at repetitive regions that cannot be confidentially polished, we also assembled both types of reads into a hybrid assembly using SPAdes (same options as above) and, whenever different for short indels or SNPs but fully assembled, the sequence of the <italic>Spok</italic> genes was taken from the (low-error) hybrid assembly. Assembly of the <italic>Spok</italic> block of the T<sub>G</sub>+ strain was particularly challenging because the recovered MinION reads were relatively short. However, a few (&lt;10) reads were long enough to cover the tandem duplication that contains <italic>Spok3</italic> (albeit with high nucleotide error rate in the assembly). The hybrid SPAdes assembly collapsed the duplication into a single copy. We therefore mapped the short reads into the hybrid assembly, confirming that the <italic>Spok3</italic> gene had doubled coverage and no SNPs, as expected for a perfect duplication.</p><p>Alignments of the assembled genomes were performed with the NUCmer program of the MUMmer package v. 4.0.0beta2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Kurtz et al., 2004</xref>) using options –<monospace>b 200 c 2000 –maxmatch</monospace>, except when otherwise noted.

Translocation 1 is clearly a misassembly. The translocation 2 in chromosome 4 however is complex because the corresponding boundaries in Podan2 start at a cluster of TEs at the 5′ end, and finish at the centromere on the 3′ end. Indeed, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">Silar et al. (2019)</xref> could not verify this translocation using PCR.

Given that the <italic>Spok</italic> content is the same as that in Wa53+, the introgressed track co-occurs with the expected position of the <italic>Spok</italic> block on chromosome 3, and the fact that the phenotype of this backcross matches a <italic>Psk-1</italic> spore-killer type, we concluded that Wa170 (Psk1xS<sub>5</sub>) in the collection actually belongs to another of the <italic>Psk-1</italic> backcrosses described in the doctoral thesis of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib116">van der Gaag (2005)</xref>, probably backcrossed from Wa52.

Values of d<sub>N</sub>/d<sub>s</sub> were calculated using the seqinr package in R (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Charif and Lobry, 2007</xref>).</p><p>In order to infer the relationship between the three <italic>Podospora</italic> taxa investigated herein, we used OrthoFinder v. 2.2.6 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Emms and Kelly, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Emms and Kelly, 2019</xref>) to define orthogroups across all samples with long-read data and the reference genomes of <italic>P. anserina</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Espagne et al., 2008</xref>) and <italic>P. comata</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">Silar et al., 2019</xref>). We randomly selected 1000 orthogroups of single-copy orthologs. As OrthoFinder works with protein sequence, we used the Podan2 ortholog to do BLAST searches against each genome and extracted the corresponding best hit as nucleotide sequence (including introns). We then aligned each orthogroup using MAFFT v. 7.407 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Katoh et al., 2017</xref>) with options ––<monospace>maxiterate 1000 –retree 1 –localpair</monospace>. We concatenated the 1000 alignments (1,652,987 sites, from which 27,000 were variable) and used the resulting matrix as input for SplitsTree4 v. 4.14.16, build 26 Sep 2017 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Huson and Bryant, 2006</xref>) to construct an unrooted split network with a NeighborNet (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Bryant and Moulton, 2002</xref>) distance transformation (uncorrected distances) and an EqualAngle splits transformation. To estimate the genetic (gene) distance between species, we averaged the identity across all <italic>P. anserina</italic> samples vs <italic>P. pauciseta</italic> (CBS237.71) and vs. <italic>P. comata</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">Silar et al., 2019</xref>), using the values produced in the distance matrix of SplitsTree.</p><p>The final gene models of all the <italic>Spok</italic> genes in <italic>Podospora</italic> spp. were aligned along with the sequences of <italic>Spok2</italic> and <italic>Spok1</italic> from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Grognet et al. (2014)</xref> using MAFFT online version 7 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Katoh et al., 2017</xref>) with default settings (only one copy of <italic>Spok3</italic> from T<sub>G</sub> was used). The resulting alignment was manually corrected taking into account the reading frame of the protein. As the UTRs seem to be conserved between paralogs, 654 (5' end) and 250 (3' end) bp of the flanking regions with respect to <italic>Spok2</italic> were also included in the alignment. An unrooted split network was constructed in SplitsTree4 as above. SplitsTree4 was used likewise to perform a Phi test for recombination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Bruen et al., 2006</xref>), using a windows size of 100 and k = 6. In addition, we used the BlackBox of RAxML-NG v. 0.6.0 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Kozlov et al., 2019</xref>) to infer maximum likelihood phylogenetic trees of the nucleotide alignment of the 5' UTR, the coding sequence (CDS), and the 3' UTR of the <italic>Spok</italic> homologs. We ran RAxML-NG with 10 parsimony and 10 random starting trees, a GTR +GAMMA (four categories) substitution model, and 100 bootstrap pseudo-replicates for each analysis.</p><p>In order to create a phylogeny of proteins that are closely related to the products of the <italic>Spok</italic> genes in <italic>Podospora</italic> (and hence likely to be meiotic drivers), the protein sequence of <italic>Spok1</italic> was used as a query against the NCBI genome database (as of 14 November 2018). We collated all hits with e-values lower than Fs_82228, which has been shown previously to have some spore-killing functionality in <italic>P. anserina</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Grognet et al., 2014</xref>), with hit coverage greater than 75% and no missing data (Ns) in the sequence. The sequences were aligned using the codon-aware program MACSE v. 2.03 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Ranwez et al., 2018</xref>), with the representative <italic>Podospora Spok </italic>g<italic>enes</italic> set as ‘reliable’ sequences (–seq), and the rest as ‘non reliable’ (–seq_lr). Many of the original gene models predict introns in the sequences, but no divergent regions were apparent in the alignment and, even if present, MACSE tends to introduce compensatory frame shifts. The entire gene alignment was used for the analysis. The resulting nucleotide alignment was corrected manually, translated into amino acids, and trimmed with TrimAl v. 1.4.1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Capella-Gutiérrez et al., 2009</xref>) using the gappyout function. A maximum likelihood tree was then produced using IQ-TREE v. 1.6.8 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Kalyaanamoorthy et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Nguyen et al., 2014</xref>) with extended model selection (–m MFP) and 1000 standard bootstrap pseudo-replicates. The protein sequence Uv_5543 of <italic>Ustilaginoidea virens</italic> was selected as an outgroup on the basis of a BioNJ tree made with SeaView v. 4.5.4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Gouy et al., 2010</xref>) of the Gremlin alignment described above.</p><p>For comparison, we performed a phylogenomic analysis of all of the strains that had at least one BLAST hit for the <italic>Podospora Spok</italic> homologs, as defined above. Briefly, we recovered all the protein sequences for each genome from GenBank and ran OrthoFinder to recover orthogroups. We obtained 288 single-copy orthogroups that were then processed with PREQUAL v.1.02 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib126">Whelan et al., 2018</xref>) and aligned with MAFFT. Columns with more than 50% missing data were removed with TrimAl (–gt 0.5) and all alignments were concatenated. The supermatrix was analyzed with IQTree as above but with 100 standard bootstraps.</p></sec><sec id="s4-11"><title>Pool-sequencing of <italic>Psk-1</italic> vs <italic>Psk-5</italic> progeny</title><p>In order to confirm that <italic>Spok2</italic> is responsible of the killing relationship between <italic>Psk-5</italic> and <italic>Psk-1</italic>, we conducted a cross between the strains Wa87 and Y. When perithecia started shooting spores, we replaced the lid of the cross plate with a water-agar plate upside-down, and let it sit for around an hour. As the <italic>P. anserina</italic> spores from a single ascus typically land together, it is possible to distinguish spores that came from an ascus with no killing (groups of four spores) from those that survived killing (groups of two spores). To improve germination rates, we scooped spore groups of the same ascus type and deposited them together in a single plate of germination medium. After colonies became visible, they were transferred into a PASM2 plate with a cellophane layer where they grew until DNA extraction, which was followed by pool-sequencing with Illumina HiSeq X. In total, 21 two-spore groups, and 63 four-spore groups were recovered.</p><p>The resulting short reads were quality controlled and mapped to Podan2 as above. We used GATK to call variants from the parental strains (treated as haploid) and the two pool-sequencing databases (as diploids). We then extracted SNPs, removed sites with missing data, and attempted to quantify the coverage frequency of the parental genotypes for each variant. The expectation was that spore killing (two-spore asci) would result in a long track of homozygosity (only one parental genotype) around <italic>Spok2</italic>, as compared to the fully heterozygous four-spore asci.

<italic>P. anserina</italic> is an important factor to consider when discussing the meiotic drive of the <italic>Spok</italic> genes. Although it has haploid nuclei, <italic>P. anserina</italic> maintains a dikaryotic (n + n) state throughout its entire lifecycle. Haploid nuclei of different mating-types are shown as white and black circles within fungal cells. The fruiting body (perithecium) is generated from dikaryotic (n + n) mycelia, usually from a single individual strain. Within the perithecium, the sexual cycle is completed to produce four dikaryotic ascospores per ascus. Occasionally, atypical spore formation may occur and can result in the production of five spores in an ascus, of which two are small and monokaryotic (n). These are self-sterile and need to outcross either with a monokaryotic individual of the opposite mating type or with a dikaryotic individual to complete the life cycle. Note that outcrossing may occur via mating between either siblings or unrelated individuals of the opposite mating type. The monokaryotic spores are useful for generating self-sterile (haploid) cultures for the purposes of sequencing and laboratory mating and are used to generate the + and -strains that are discussed in the main text.</p><fig id="app1fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.46454.040</object-id><label>Appendix 1—figure 1.</label><caption><title>Simplified life cycle of <italic>P. anserina</italic> with explanation for isolating monokaryotic spores.</title></caption><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-46454-app1-fig1-v1.tif"/></fig></sec><sec id="s9" sec-type="appendix"><title>Two-locus spore-killing interaction</title><p>The interaction between <italic>Psk-1</italic> and <italic>Psk-7</italic> provides a good example of how the meiotic drive dynamics of <italic>P. anserina</italic> result in killing, even though both <italic>Psk-1</italic> and <italic>Psk-7</italic> possess the same <italic>Spok</italic> homologs (mutual resistance). The three <italic>Spok</italic> homologs (<italic>Spok2</italic>, <italic>Spok3</italic>, and <italic>Spok4</italic>) are all present in both <italic>Psk-1</italic> and <italic>Psk-7</italic>. The observed mutual resistance is thus due to the fact that the <italic>Spok</italic> block (with <italic>Spok3</italic> and <italic>Spok4</italic>) is located on different chromosomes.

The discovery of <italic>Spok3</italic> and <italic>Spok4</italic> provides us with the opportunity to reinterpret these data in light of the results presented herein. Here, we will address data from four important studies: <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Padieu and Bernet (1967)</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib114">van der Gaag et al.

(2000)</xref> for strains Wa28, Wa53, Wa58, Wa63, Wa87, S, and Z, but contradictions were observed for Wa21, Wa46, Wa47, and Y. Strain Wa21 was previously categorized as <italic>Psk-3</italic>, which is typified by inconsistent spore killing with <italic>Psk-S</italic> strains. Here we observed stable percentages and thus consider Wa21 to be representative of <italic>Psk-2</italic>. The role of <italic>Psk-3</italic> as a spore killer has been in doubt since its description (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib114">van der Gaag et al., 2000</xref>). This is in part due to the fact that the ascospores are not fully aborted as they are for the other spore-killer types. Instead, small transparent ascospores can still be observed within the ascus. Here, we were unable to find support for this spore-killer type and there is no clear correlation between its phenotype and any <italic>Spok</italic> genes. We therefore find it likely that the effect is due to other incompatibility factors rather than meiotic drive.</p><p>We did not observe any spore-killing in crosses between Wa46 (<italic>Psk-4</italic>) and Wa47 (<italic>Psk-6</italic>) as reported in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib114">van der Gaag et al. (2000)</xref>. Two other strains had been annotated as <italic>Psk-6</italic>, Wa89 and Wa90, but no other strains were recorded as <italic>Psk-4</italic>. Unfortunately we were not able to phenotype these strains and so we are unable to evaluate <italic>Psk-6</italic> further in this study. In addition, results from crosses of <italic>Psk-4</italic> with a <italic>Psk-S</italic> strain (Wa63) reveals that there is a dominance interaction between them, with <italic>Psk-S</italic> killing <italic>Psk-4</italic>. This is the opposite of what was proposed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib114">van der Gaag et al. (2000)</xref>, i.e. that <italic>Psk-S</italic> kills <italic>Psk-4</italic>. Potentially, the original interpretation was hindered by poor mating of the <italic>Psk-4</italic> strain with tester <italic>Psk-S</italic> strains. Previously, strain Y was reported to have mutual resistance with <italic>Psk-1</italic>, to be susceptible to <italic>Psk-7</italic>, and to be dominant over all other types. Here we report that Y is susceptible to <italic>Psk-1</italic> and <italic>Psk-7</italic>, and has mutual killing with all other types, except in crosses with naïve strains where it is dominant.</p></sec><sec id="s12" sec-type="appendix"><title>Allorecognition (<italic>het</italic>) genes and spore killing</title><p>As the <italic>het-s</italic> gene is capable of causing both vegetative incompatibility and spore killing, it was hypothesized that the <italic>Psk</italic> loci may be as well. The S<sub>5</sub> strains all demonstrate barrage formation (symptomatic of vegetative incompatibility) with strain S (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib115">van der Gaag et al., 2003</xref>). However when additional backcrosses were performed to generate S<sub>14</sub> strains, no barrages were observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="app2fig1">Appendix 2—figure 1</xref>). This indicates that the spore-killing types do not directly affect vegetative incompatibility or vice versa, but may be linked to loci which do. Note that the S<sub>5</sub> strains contain multiple genomic regions that are not isogenic with S, some of which contain known allorecognition genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4—figure supplement 3</xref>).</p><fig id="app2fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.46454.042</object-id><label>Appendix 2—figure 1.</label><caption><title>Barrage tests of the S<sub>14</sub> strains.</title><p>Strains Wa126, Wa76, Wa52, and Wa125 are wild isolates of <italic>P. anserina</italic> in the Wageningen collection.

If the three-spored asci were the result of a four-spored ascus in which one of the spores aborted, all three spores should be heteroallelic for <italic>Spok2</italic>. If the three-spored asci are the result of incomplete penetrance of the killing factor, two spores should be homoallelic for <italic>Spok2</italic> while the other spore should have no copy of <italic>Spok2</italic>. Unfortunately, spores from the crosses had very low germination rates (1/15 for Wa63 x Wa46 and 1/12 for Us5 x Wa46) as compared to other crosses (generally close to 100% germination). The progeny from the successfully germinated spores were backcrossed to the parental strains and also allowed to self to infer their <italic>Spok2</italic> genotype.

It was one of the two strains investigated in the original description of spore killing by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Padieu and Bernet (1967)</xref> translated and reinterpreted by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib110">Turner and Perkins (1991)</xref>, it was the strain in which <italic>Spok1</italic> was described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Grognet et al., 2014</xref>), and it was part of an investigation of spore killing in German strains of <italic>Podospora</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Hamann and Osiewacz, 2004</xref>). Our results clearly demonstrate that two strains labeled as T (T<sub>G</sub> and T<sub>D</sub> herein) are not only different strains, but are different species. The description of spore-killing in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Padieu and Bernet (1967)</xref> matches our observations of crosses between T<sub>G</sub> and the <italic>Psk-S</italic> strain Wa63, including incomplete penetrance as implied by the presence of three-spored asci. Thus, we believe T<sub>G</sub> to be representative of the original T strain. In light of this, we reinterpret the results of both <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Padieu and Bernet (1967)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Hamann and Osiewacz (2004)</xref> as informed by the interactions of the <italic>Spok</italic> genes.</p><p>In <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Padieu and Bernet (1967)</xref>, a cross between two strains, T and T', is described. They identify two genes (one present in T and the other in T') that cause spore-killing and interact as mutual killers. The gene from T has a killing percentage of 90%, whereas the one from T' has a killing percentage of 40% and occasionally produces three-spored asci. This fits well with a cross of <italic>Psk-5</italic> and <italic>Psk-S</italic>, in which <italic>Psk-5</italic> kills at 90% and <italic>Spok2</italic> of the <italic>Psk-S</italic> strain kills at 40%, but has incomplete penetrance resulting in three-spored asci. Unfortunately, strain T' has to our knowledge not been maintained in any collections, so this cannot be confirmed experimentally. However, <italic>Psk-S</italic> strains are the most abundant phenotype from French, German, and Dutch populations (T' was isolated in France along with T) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib114">van der Gaag et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Grognet et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Hamann and Osiewacz, 2004</xref>).</p><p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Hamann and Osiewacz (2004)</xref> presented a number of interesting observations. They reported a new spore-killer type, identified progeny that appeared to demonstrate gene conversion of the killer locus, and observed apparent recombinant spore-killer types. The study mostly centres around strain O, which they report to be of the same spore-killer type as T<sub>G</sub> and should thus be <italic>Psk-5</italic> given our results. As such, we suspect that their focal cross between O and Us5, a <italic>Psk-S</italic> strain, is the same as that in the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Padieu and Bernet (1967)</xref> paper. We have independently confirmed that Us5 (kindly provided by A Hamann and H Osiewacz) is <italic>Psk-S</italic>, but strain O has not been maintained in any collection. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Hamann and Osiewacz (2004)</xref> also state that strain He represents a new type of spore killer. However, with O classified as <italic>Psk-5</italic>, the interactions of He match that of a <italic>Psk-1</italic> strain. Furthermore, strain He exhibited no spore-killing with a <italic>Psk-1</italic> strain from Wageningen. From the cross of O and Us5, they identify a number of progeny with unexpected genotypes. They interpret these genotypes as evidence of both gene conversion and recombinant spore killer types. However, under a two-locus model of mutual killing, both effects can be explained by incomplete penetrance of <italic>Spok2</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="app2fig2">Appendix 2—figure 2</xref>). As the cross with Us5 showed a particularly high degree of anomalous results, it is possible that Us5 contains a unique allele of <italic>Spok2</italic> that is a particularly weak killer.</p><fig id="app2fig2" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.46454.043</object-id><label>Appendix 2—figure 2.</label><caption><title>Explanation of results from a (presumably) <italic>Psk-5</italic> vs <italic>Psk-S</italic> cross in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Hamann and Osiewacz (2004)</xref> with information about <italic>Spok</italic> genes as described in the text.</title><p>The seven asci represent the possible genotype combinations of a cross between a <italic>Psk-5</italic> strain and a <italic>Psk-S</italic>, as illustrated in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib110">Turner and Perkins (1991)</xref>. Black ovals represent the ascospores, dashed ovals represent killed spores, and colored circles represent the individual nuclei, with each color corresponding to a given genotype. Genotypes are annotated as in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib110">Turner and Perkins (1991)</xref>, wherein locus 1 corresponds to a killer locus with 90% FDS, the <italic>Psk-5 Spok</italic> block, and locus 2 represents a killer locus with 40% FDS, <italic>Spok2</italic>. Red nuclei represent the <italic>Psk-S</italic> parental genotype with <italic>Spok2</italic>, orange nuclei represent the <italic>Psk-5</italic> parental genotype with <italic>Spok3</italic> and <italic>Spok4</italic>, green nuclei represent the recombinant genotype with no <italic>Spok</italic> genes, and blue nuclei represent the recombinant genotype with <italic>Spok2</italic>, <italic>Spok3</italic>, and <italic>Spok4</italic>. Note that <italic>Spok3</italic> and <italic>Spok4</italic> are linked and do not segregate independently. Given its <italic>Spok</italic> content, the ascus type 1 should experience mutual killing, resulting in the abortion of all spores. Ascus types 2 to 4 should contain only two surviving spores, whereas ascus types 5 to 7 should have all spores surviving. Below, the asci are our interpretations of the annotations from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Hamann and Osiewacz (2004)</xref>. In their study, these authors isolated F1 spores from four-spore asci, genotyped them on the basis of crosses to the parental strains, and found no spore-killing after selfing in a few cases. In their terminology, K + K strains would correspond to a strain with the <italic>Psk-5</italic> (grey spore) parental genotype of ascus type 1. This type of ascus should produce empty asci, so the fact that they are observed from four-spored asci suggests that when mutual killing occurs, the four spores may still develop. However, as no S + S strains (i.e. spores with two red nuclei in the type ascus 1) were reported, we can infer that only the <italic>Psk-5</italic> type (grey spore) may be viable. S,K + S,K strains are not indicative of a recombinant killer locus as suggested in the original work, but represent strains with all three <italic>Spok</italic> genes as produced in ascus type 2. The FDS frequencies reported suggest that the isolated strains are indicative of the blue nuclear genotype and not the green nuclear genotype. Hence, the spores containing only green nuclei might not be viable either. The S,K + K and K + S,K strains are indistinguishable from each other and are indicative of the surviving spores of a type 3 ascus. These strains should exhibit spore killing when selfed because of the distribution of <italic>Spok2</italic>. However, cases in which spore killing was not observed in their study could be explained by incomplete penetrance of <italic>Spok2</italic>. In all cases, these strains should not have been isolated from four-spored asci, indicating that either methodological issues occurred or that spore killing may still produce four-spored asci, but where the spores which should be absent are instead inviable.</p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-46454-app2-fig2-v1.tif"/></fig></sec></boxed-text></app></app-group></back><sub-article article-type="decision-letter" id="SA1"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.46454.059</article-id><title-group><article-title>Decision letter</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="editor"><name><surname>Rokas</surname><given-names>Antonis</given-names></name><role>Reviewing Editor</role><aff><institution>Vanderbilt University</institution><country>United States</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="reviewer"><name><surname>Zanders</surname><given-names>Sarah E</given-names></name><role>Reviewer</role><aff><institution>Stowers Institute for Medical Research</institution><country>United States</country></aff></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><boxed-text><p>In the interests of transparency, eLife includes the editorial decision letter and accompanying author responses.

Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the evaluation has been overseen by Diethard Tautz as the Senior Editor.

Using an impressive combination of genetics, genomics, and molecular evolution approaches, the work greatly extends what is known about meiotic drivers in <italic>Podospora</italic>. Vogan et al. conclude that the <italic>Psk</italic> spore killing phenotype is due to alleles of previously identified <italic>Spok</italic> genes. The authors extend the analysis of <italic>Spok</italic> gene evolution and find that the <italic>Spok3</italic> and <italic>Spok4</italic> genes have moved around the genome in different lineages as part of a <italic>Spok</italic> sequence block. In addition, the authors significantly extend what is known about the potential molecular mechanisms of the <italic>Spok</italic> genes, a broadly important finding. Overall, this study is an important contribution that addresses fundamental questions related to the functioning and evolution of selfish genomic elements. <italic>P. anserina</italic> presents and excellent model system as it can be easily crossed, genetically manipulated and spore killing easily identified. Moreover, spore killing in <italic>P. anserina</italic> is a classic text-book example in genetics, and the present study provides novel insight into the underlying molecular mechanisms of a fungal meiotic drive system.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) This is a wonderful piece of work but its value is at present reduced by the lack of clarity in presentation and writing. All reviewers noted that the experiments and results are not well presented and made numerous suggestions as to how they could be improved. The manuscript is extremely long and includes many details, which would be better summarized in a well-written supplementary text. The appendix includes a mini-review on <italic>Podospora</italic> genetics and biology although the main text already includes a box that summarizes necessary information on meiosis in <italic>Podospora</italic>. A more clear presentation of experiments conducted here as well as appropriate citation for previous studies could replace the &quot;mini-review&quot; in the appendix. Perhaps a figure that illustrates the different crossing experiments and the spore killing phenotypes would be helpful.

The reason is that, after consideration, we think the PAML analysis is not suitable for our dataset as the relationship of the <italic>Spok</italic> genes appears very complex, including possible cross-species transfers and gene conversions. Given this complexity, we risk violating the assumptions of the analyses and therefore prefer to remove it.

It is unknown whether homologs in other species function as meiotic drive genes or if they have also been transferred horizontally. As such it is difficult to construct valid hypotheses to test with the broader data set and we again run the risk of violating the assumptions of the model, so we have opted to not conduct this analysis.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) The authors' inference that spok genes underwent cross-species transfer (last line of Abstract) is tenuous and the available data for this inference are very thin. It is fine to have it as &quot;speculation&quot; in the Discussion section, but we think this claim needs to be removed from the Abstract.

Or are we missing something?</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer that the results pointing towards cross-species transfer could be better and more carefully disentangled and discussed. Accordingly, in the Discussion, we have made a more explicit description of different scenarios, and added a figure to illustrate these (Figure 8). Our conclusion on cross-species transfer is based on two major points. First, the <italic>Spok</italic> genes from different species have reticulated relationships, with multiple gene features (indels and repeat motifs) shared between <italic>Spok1</italic> and <italic>Spok4</italic>. This pattern is in direct contradiction with the structure of the block that suggests <italic>Spok3</italic> and <italic>Spok4</italic> are paralogs produced from tandem duplications. The discussion of the new figure addresses this contrast extensively. The second point involves the phylogeny of closely related SPOK homologs across fungi, which places homologs from very different taxonomic classes close together. We hope that we have made the case more clear and that you think it is valid to say in the Abstract that “Genomic and phylogenetic analyses across ascomycetes suggest that the <italic>Spok</italic> genes disperse via cross-species transfer, and evolve by duplication and diversification within several lineages.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) A large part of the study relies on analyses of the population genomic dataset.

Also the content and distribution of transposable elements which are proposed to support the diversification of Spok genes.

To assess if synteny breaks and frequently occurring rearrangements on small genome scales are particular traits that characterize this &quot;selfish&quot; block, more details on overall genome synteny would be informative.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer on this point and accordingly, we have added two new analyses illustrated by two new figures (Figure 1 and Figure 1—figure supplement 1). We have in the beginning of the Results added the section “The <italic>Podospora</italic> species are closely related and highly syntenic”, in which we show (1) species divergence/diversity, and (2) a circos plot with collinear regions between species. A new supplementary figure shows inversions as well. Furthermore, we added another supplementary figure (Figure 4—figure supplement 1) with the alignment of chromosome 5 for three representative strains. This plot serves the double purpose of showing overall collinearity interrupted by the <italic>Spok</italic> block, and to show the small scale movement of transposable elements (which are correlated to low GC content in <italic>Podospora</italic>). It also provides context for the position of <italic>Spok2</italic> and <italic>SpokΨ1</italic>.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) Considering evolution of the Spok genes in P. anserina populations, an important question is whether the Spok genes confers a fitness cost during the life cycle of P. anserinia. This aspect is poorly addressed although the knock-in and knock-out strains of Spok3 and Spok4 should allow the authors to assess this.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that this is very important for the understanding of drive and <italic>Spoks</italic>, but we argue not to have it in this particular paper since 1) it is not really the scope and 2) it needs its large attention (measuring fitness in <italic>Podospora</italic> is not trivial).</p></body></sub-article></article>
