single neurons. In vivo, wide-field GCaMP imaging and sub-cortical/cortical cellular electrophysiology were used in mice to investigate relationships between spontaneous single neuron spiking and mesoscopic cortical activity. We make use of a rich set of cortical activity motifs that are present in spontaneous activity in anesthetized and awake animals. A mesoscale spike-triggered averaging procedure allowed the identification of motifs that are preferentially linked to individual spiking neurons by employing genetically targeted indicators of neuronal activity. Thalamic neurons predicted and reported specific cycles of wide-scale cortical inhibition/excitation. In contrast, spike-triggered maps derived from single cortical neurons yielded spatio-temporal maps expected for regional cortical consensus function. This approach can define network relationships between any point source of neuronal spiking and mesoscale cortical maps.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.19976.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.19976.001</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>functional connectivity</kwd><kwd>mesoscale maps</kwd><kwd>thalamocortical</kwd><kwd>spike triggered maps</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>International Alliance of Translational Neuroscience</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Xiao</surname><given-names>Dongsheng</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Brain Canada, Canadian Neurophotonics Platform</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>LeDue</surname><given-names>Jeffrey M</given-names></name><name><surname>Murphy</surname><given-names>Timothy H</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000024</institution-id><institution>Canadian Institutes of Health Research</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>MOP-12675</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Murphy</surname><given-names>Timothy H</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000024</institution-id><institution>Canadian Institutes of Health Research</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>FDN-143209</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Murphy</surname><given-names>Timothy H</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Mesoscale cortical calcium activity correlating with single cortical and thalamic cell spiking reveal rich dynamics and support a novel approach for investigating in vivo functional networks in the mammalian brain.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Neural activity ranges from the microscale of synapses to macroscale brain-wide networks. Mesoscale networks occupy an intermediate space and are well studied in cortex forming the basis of sensory and motor maps (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bohland et al., 2009</xref>). These networks are largely defined by co-activation of neurons and have been evaluated with a variety of statistical approaches that capitalize on detecting synchrony. The study of large-scale networks (meso-to macroscale) has been mostly restricted to functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), or magnetoencephalography that can capture whole-brain activity patterns (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">de Pasquale et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Kahn et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Logothetis et al., 2012</xref>), but lack high spatial and temporal resolution and sensitivity. To overcome these limitations, alternative approaches including mesoscopic intrinsic signal, voltage, glutamate, or calcium sensitive indicator imaging have been employed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Kleinfeld et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Kenet et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Ferezou et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Chemla and Chavane, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Chen et al., 2013b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Mohajerani et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Stroh et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Vanni and Murphy, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Carandini et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chan et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Madisen et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Wekselblatt et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Xie et al., 2016</xref>). New preparations using large-scale craniotomies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Kim et al., 2016b</xref>) and large format imaging systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Tsai et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Sofroniew et al., 2016</xref>) provide the ability to link mesoscale activity patterns to individual neurons. However, these measures are restricted to superficial layers of cortex and cannot assess linkages with sub-cortical structures. Developments in fiberoptic technology allow local optical functional assessment of brain activity in sub-cortical structures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Hamel et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Kim et al., 2016a</xref>), but cannot simultaneously resolve cortex over large fields of view. Although the evolution of imaging has revealed new aspects of cortical processing in identified neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Harvey et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Chen et al., 2013a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Chen et al., 2013b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Fu et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Guo et al., 2014</xref>), the electrically recorded action potential is still a signal of prominence given its exquisite timing and ability to reflect the output of neuronal networks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Buzsáki, 2004</xref>).</p><p>We combine extracellular recordings of single units in the cortex, thalamus, and other sub-cortical sites with mesoscopic functional imaging in transgenic mice expressing the calcium indicator GCaMP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Zariwala et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Vanni and Murphy, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Silasi et al., 2016</xref>). While slower than protein-based or small molecule voltage sensors, GCaMP imaging offers a high signal-to-noise ratio and is associated with supra-threshold activity which allows a more direct comparison with spike activity. This work extends pioneering studies investigating the relationship between single neuron spiking and local neuronal population activity assessed by voltage-sensitive dye imaging. Spike-triggered averaging (STA) was used to identify the local activity profile related to the spiking activity of a single neuron within this population (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Arieli et al., 1995</xref>), and it was further demonstrated that this activity profile could reveal the instantaneous spatial pattern of ongoing population activity related to a neuron’s optimal stimulus in visual cortex of anesthetized cat (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Tsodyks et al., 1999</xref>). This current study extends these approaches and also exploits the main advantage of mesoscopic imaging allowing the simultaneous measurement of brain activity in multiple regions across most of cortex simultaneously and not only that of the local population of activity surrounding the recording site. This multiscale strategy has allowed us to define temporal relationships between the activity of single neurons at the microscopic scale and mesoscale cortical maps (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Zingg et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Madisen et al., 2015</xref>). Furthermore, we employ multisite, long shank, silicon probe recordings of single neuron activity that facilitates the assessment of long-distance activity relationships between remote subcortical single neuron activity and mesoscale cortical population activity. Spontaneous activity in awake and anesthetized mice was exploited as a source of diverse cortical network activity motifs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Mohajerani et al., 2010</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chan et al., 2015</xref>). Application of STA to cortical spontaneous activity linked single neurons to mesoscale networks. Single thalamic neuron spikes were found to functionally link to multiple primary sensorimotor maps, in contrast spiking cortical neurons were largely associated with consensus cortical maps. Thalamic neurons were found to both predict and report (firing before and after) specific cycles of wide-scale cortical inhibition/excitation, while cortical neuron firing was usually associated with excitation. These results are consistent with an active computational role of thalamus in sensory-motor processing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Theyel et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Hooks et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Petrus et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Sheroziya and Timofeev, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">McCormick et al., 2015</xref>), as opposed to merely serving a relay function and is consistent with a diverse role of the thalamus in feedforward sensory processing. Thalamocortical transmission can dynamically and differentially recruit local cortical excitation and inhibition based on thalamic neuron firing patterns and where thalamocortical feedforward inhibition is a critical feature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Galarreta and Hestrin, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Swadlow and Gusev, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Gabernet et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Cruikshank et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Hu and Agmon, 2016</xref>). We expect that this spike-triggered cortical mapping technique, exploiting mesoscopic calcium imaging, can be extended to any brain location where electrodes can be placed to identify functionally linked cortical mesoscale networks.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Linkage of individual spiking neurons to specific mesoscopic cortical maps</title><p>We exploit the wide field of view of mesoscale cortical imaging using GCaMP transgenic mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Madisen et al., 2015</xref>) in combination with cellular electrophysiology recordings to derive cortical networks that reflect activity at targeted point sources of neuronal spiking throughout the brain. Cortical and sub-cortical neuron spiking activities were recorded electrically while simultaneously imaging cortical mesoscopic activity across a 9 × 9 mm bilateral window that encompassed multiple areas of the mouse dorsal cortex including somatosensory, motor, visual, retrosplenial, parietal association and cingulate areas (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A,B</xref>). Spectral decomposition of the mesoscopic spontaneous activity using GCaMP6 revealed the presence of information below 10 Hz that was distinct from non-specific green light reflectance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). Given the slow Ca<sup>2+</sup> binding and unbinding kinetics of GCaMP6, we expect imaging dynamics will be prolonged compared to actual spike records. In some cases, we employed deconvolution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Pnevmatikakis et al., 2016</xref>) to improve the time course of raw calcium signals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>). While deconvolution improved the temporal dynamics of the decay of the calcium signal, spike-triggered analysis was only marginally affected and it was not used throughout. Spiking signals were initially recorded in multiple brain areas using glass electrodes (n = 8 mice) to minimize obstruction of cortical imaging and reduce potential for damage from electrode placement. Subsequently, laminar probes (16 channel with 0.1 mm contact spacing) permitted the resolution of more spiking neurons simultaneously, and facilitated the recordings in multiple sub-cortical regions (n = 16 mice). Given the invasive nature and the long duration of recordings, initial data were obtained from urethane (n = 4) or isoflurane (n = 12) anesthetized adult mice, but were later optimized to include awake recordings (n = 12, see Materials and methods). The spike-triggered average maps (STMs) obtained under both these conditions were qualitatively similar, and this observation was consistent with previous work using VSD imaging (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Mohajerani et al., 2013</xref>). To perform these assessments, we identified single neuron spikes from extracellular recordings using spike sorting methods based on clustering of principal components distributions of spike signals on sets of adjacent channels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Swindale and Spacek, 2014</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>).<fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.19976.002</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Experimental setup and multichannel electrode recordings and spike classification.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Set-up for simultaneous wide-field calcium imaging and single unit recording using a glass pipette or laminar silicon probe.

For each individual spike, we considered cortical image frames from 3s before to 3s after the spike normalized as ΔF/F<sub>0</sub> by subtracting and dividing the average calcium activity during the 3s preceding the spike. The static STM was then defined as the peak response (in units of ΔF/F<sub>0</sub>) calculated for each pixel within a time window of ±1 s. This peak method is a better reflection of correlated activity than the average over the ±1 s interval which would smooth out highly activated – but short duration activity increases. This method revealed that the activity recorded from a single right barrel cortex neuron yielded an STM showing strong and specific GCaMP signal in the barrel and motor cortices of both hemispheres (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1Ei</xref>). STMs were thus calculated by averaging calcium activity during spiking activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1Eii</xref>) and revealed the high spatial specificity of the mapping when compared with reference region (hind limb) or random spike averaging (see Materials and methods) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1Eiii</xref>).</p><p>We verified the calcium specificity of STMs (reflecting underlying neuronal activity) by imaging Thy-1 GFP-M mice (n = 6 mice) that lacked calcium-dependent neuronal fluorescent signals and failed to produce functional maps using the same procedures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A,B</xref>). To investigate the sensitivity of the technique, the minimum number of spikes needed to make maps in GCaMP mice was measured by quantifying the similarities of pairs of STMs generated from a subset of increasing numbers of spikes.

To quantify the difference of variability of STM between cortical and thalamic units, we compared the percentage overlap of static STMs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>; red areas) for neighboring pairs of neurons (100 μm apart). We found cortical neurons in the same functional region exhibited substantial similarity, while subcortical neurons had more diversity even within the same sub-nucleus in thalamus (i.e. VPL, VPM, see <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref> for nomenclature and compare 3 example in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>).

To create SPMs, the cross-correlation coefficient r values between the temporal profiles of one selected pixel and all the others within the field of view were calculated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Mohajerani et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Vanni and Murphy, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chan et al., 2015</xref>) (see Materials and methods). To evaluate the similarity between the static STM and SPMs, we calculated the correlation coefficient between pixels of both types of maps for all possible SPMs in the library. We then selected the SPM that resulted in best match: highest correlation between a given STM and the library of SPMs. The library of SPMs is expected to reflect cortical consensus activity motifs (areas undergoing temporally-correlated activity) and can be largely attributed to their underlying intra-cortical axonal projections (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Mohajerani et al., 2013</xref>). Single cortical neuron-derived STMs were largely predicted by the pattern of cortical connectivity using SPM correlation mapping (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>) as correlations were relatively high between these SPMs and STMs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>). In contrast, thalamic STMs were more complex and corresponded to more unique distributions of cortical patterns and had significantly lower correlations with the cortical consensus SPM library (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B,C</xref>). For example, VPM, VPL and CP neurons can functionally link to multiple cortical areas that are not predicted by SPM (SPM made by putting the seeds in either BCS1, HLS1 or RS areas). In other words, it is possible that the cortical STMs derived from single spiking sub-cortical neurons are the super-position of 2 or more cortical networks defined by SPMs. To support this theory, we show examples comparing subcortical STMs to pairs of SPMs made from two seed locations that can lead to these potentially more complex maps (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>). For example, the VPM STM could be constructed as a combination of a BCS1 and RS SPM (seed point a and b, respectively, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>).<fig id="fig4" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.19976.010</object-id><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><title>STM compared with seed pixel correlation maps (SPM).</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Cortical STM (left) and the best fitting SPM (right) according to correlation coefficient (cc) values for different electrode placements (text to the left of panel).

However, thalamocortical synapses are known to be prone to synaptic depression and burst pattern firing may yield altered cortical responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Castro-Alamancos, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Gil et al., 1997</xref>). It is conceivable that averaging all spike activity may mask STMs from sub-groups of spikes that contribute different motifs during varying ongoing cortical dynamics. One way to divide the spikes into groups is to partition them into bursting versus tonic modes. We found that both STMs and STMTDs are similar across spiking modes to the all-spike average STMs in both cortical and thalamic cells examined (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplements 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s3">3</xref>; see Materials and methods). We also tried grouping spikes according to motif similarity but did not find natural groupings or clusters. Manually partitioning the motifs into groups of four or more, and removing the spontaneous motif average, revealed that the sub-group STMs were the same as the overall average (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s4">Figure 6—figure supplements 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s5">5</xref>; see Materials and methods). These tests confirm that the averaging method reveals how single cells participate in largely stereotyped networks despite the variability of ongoing cortical activity.</p><p>While our analyses have employed spike-triggering averaging, spike-triggered co-variance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Aljadeff et al., 2016</xref>) or variance maps are another way to view the association between GCaMP activity and spiking as opposed to the mean. Spike-triggered variance maps revealed similar brain regions as defined using spike-triggered average (STA) mapping when examined as a difference to baseline (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s6">Figure 6—figure supplement 6</xref>). It is conceivably that during particular behavioral states or tasks that variance mapping may reveal markedly different maps than STA.</p><p>We next investigated whether the multi-second corticocortical and thalamocortical dynamics revealed by this novel functional approach can be categorized into distinct groups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Figure 7—source data 1</xref>). Identification of the location of maximally activated cortical regions provided a means of comparing cortical and thalamic neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>). Using Principal Component Analysis (PCA) we plotted the distribution of 428 STMTDs from both cortical and subcortical cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>). The time courses were then clustered in three patterns of STMTDs (using k-means algorithm) and averaged. Based on their temporal relationship to spikes, we termed them: <bold>pattern #1</bold>: spike-triggered-excitation; <bold>pattern #2</bold> spike-triggered inhibition; <bold>pattern #3</bold> inhibition-triggered spiking followed by inhibition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7Ci</xref>). The distribution of these three patterns were then compared between cortical and thalamic cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7Cii</xref>).</p><p>This classification showed that ~80% cortical neurons were associated with a pure cortical excitation profile (pattern #1) and 20% triggered inhibition (pattern #2). In contrast, only 20% of thalamic neurons associated with post-spiking cortical excitation, while 80% of were associated with cortical inhibition patterns (45% with pattern #2% and 35% with pattern #3). Notably, pattern #3 was only identified with subcortical neuron spiking. Neither cortical cell depth, subcortical cell location (e.g. VPM vs VPL), nor cell-type classification (inhibitory and excitatory types [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Connors and Gutnick, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Nowak et al., 2005</xref>]) revealed any significant correlations between temporal dynamic clusters and cell-classification (not shown). We suggest future work with larger datasets and multiple cortical/subcortical areas could address the question of whether STMTD classification are a novel intrinsic single-cell property.</p><p>The profile of STMTDs across all mice and recordings were also presented by aligning their peak activation (red) or peak depression (blue) in various bilateral ROIs that span wide and varied regions of cortex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>). The analysis in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref> provides a powerful means of visualizing group-data temporal relationships across ROIs for both cortical and sub-cortically derived spikes. We found that as observed for individual neuron STMTDs, aggregate cortical neuron spikes were generally followed by strong periods of persistent activation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8A</xref>), whereas sub-cortical neurons were linked to more diverse cortical activity profiles, in particular longer depression across multiple cortical ROIs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8B</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>The role of movement and hemodynamics STMs</title><p>Our goal is to assess cortical functional connectivity based on coincidence between individual neuron spiking and ongoing spontaneous activity. However, we concede that in awake animals activity is rarely entirely spontaneous and that periods of volitional activity are present interspersed with relatively quiet intervals. Qualitative observations indicate limb twitches as well as tail and facial movements. In order to evaluate the impact of body movement on mapping, STAs were generated from spikes during periods of quietness and compared with STA from all spikes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s1">Figure 8—figure supplement 1</xref>). Period of quietness and movement were identified by measuring behavior imaging collected simultaneously with the neurophysiological data (see Materials and methods, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s1">Figure 8—figure supplement 1A</xref> and <xref ref-type="other" rid="media5">Video 5</xref>). STA generated from periods of quietness did not differ from those generated with all spikes (see Materials and methods, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s1">Figure 8—figure supplement 1B</xref>). This suggests that, even when some movement could be observed during recordings, they minimally contribute to the mapping. This data also indicated that periods of high movement were relatively rare in awake head-fixed mice under the conditions we have employed and contributed negligibly to overall STA maps. Therefore, brain imaging activity obtained in awake states is mostly indicative of a quiet awake state and is not primarily movement-related activity.<media content-type="glencoe play-in-place height-250 width-310" id="media5" mime-subtype="mp4" mimetype="video" xlink:href="elife-19976-media5.mp4"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.19976.028</object-id><label>Video 5.</label><caption><title>Evaluation of whisker movement.</title><p><italic>Left:</italic> Average of absolute gradient within the region of interest (yellow box in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s1">Figure 8—figure supplement 1</xref>) between the frames 3400 and 5000. <italic>Right:</italic> Corresponding image frames displayed at real time.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.19976.028">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.19976.028</ext-link></p></caption></media></p><p>Other potential sources of error include apparent changes in GCaMP6 signal due to alterations in blood volume or oxygenation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Ma et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Wekselblatt et al., 2016</xref>). Increases in blood volume are expected to decrease both excitation and emission light. While we have implemented a multi-wavelength correction strategy (see Materials and methods), the corrections in practice did not appreciably alter cortical or thalamic STA maps or dynamics altering peak % ΔF/F<sub>0 </sub>by more than 1/10 of the maximum ΔF/F<sub>0</sub>. We provide examples of the strategy being employed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1A,B</xref>). In these examples, we employ a short blue reference signal that correlated positively with apparent blood volume artifacts that were revealed by parallel experiments using green reflected light imaging (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1C,D</xref>). Consequently, the ratio of green over blue signal greatly reduced the blood volume hemodynamic response. To determine whether the short blue correction strategy was effective, we assessed data from GFP-m mice that exhibit green fluorescence signals that are not expected to be the calcium dependent as in GCaMP6 mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1E</xref>). We used the ratio of F/F<sub>0</sub> green fraction signal to blue reflected light signal F/F<sub>0</sub> fraction to reduce nonspecific signals that were observed in GFP mice. Consistent with published work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Ma et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Wekselblatt et al., 2016</xref>) blood volume artifacts were greatly reduced. This same strategy was then applied to GCaMP fluorescence data. Although the approach was effective at removing smaller non-specific signals in GFP-m mice, in practice, using GCaMP mice, where much larger activity-dependent signals were present, we revealed only a relatively small apparent contribution of blood volume to cortical and subcortical STA fluorescent signals as in other work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Vanni and Murphy, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Murphy et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Silasi et al., 2016</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1F,G</xref>). Furthermore, thalamic STA maps and STA dynamic plots still indicated cases where thalamic spiking was associated with cortical inhibition. For these reasons, we have attempted to correct other STA maps using this multi-wavelength procedure.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Using STM of wide-field spontaneous calcium imaging data, we have characterized mesoscopic cortical maps defined by the spiking activity of individual cortical/sub-cortical neurons. Our results demonstrate that STMs can reveal functional cortical architecture related to the activity of individual cortical and subcortical-cortical neurons. Cortically recorded STMs reflect the cortical state when a neuron spikes in connected areas. We observed that the STMs of individual sub-cortical neurons had more variation than maps attributed to spiking cortical neurons. For example, sub-cortical STM patterns of neighboring neurons were more diverse than cortical neurons, and were less likely to match intra-cortical consensus activity patterns defined using SPM. Sub-cortical-neuron-derived STMs revealed multiple areas of activation and multimodal kinetic behavior, while intra-cortical spiking neuron networks were simpler in structure and kinetics. Furthermore, spiking sub-cortical neurons reflected diverse cortical multi-phasic excitation/inhibition timing patterns that were reflected in dynamic STMTDs. In contrast, most spiking cortical neurons were linked to a single phase of cortical excitation.</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>Event-triggered brain mesoscale mapping</title><p>Previously, STA of local field potentials has been used to investigate of how single neurons in visual cortex were linked to on-going state-dependent activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Nauhaus et al., 2009</xref>); however, this work only examined such correlations locally within visual cortex and did not assess regional connectivity using imaging or investigate differences with individual sub-cortical neurons. Other similar applications where single neuron spiking was recorded and related to spontaneous activity using calcium imaging have been restricted to in vitro brain slices (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Aaron and Yuste, 2006</xref>)). Our study extends previous in vivo work that assessed spike-triggered events using voltage-sensitive dye imaging (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Arieli et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Tsodyks et al., 1999</xref>) to encompass a more expansive spatial scale, electrode arrays, awake recordings, and selective genetically encoded indicators of activity. While being important seminal findings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Arieli et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Tsodyks et al., 1999</xref>), previous STA work was largely confined to the visual system, performed under anesthesia and was unable to define how collections of brain areas interact. The approach is probably most analogous to event-triggered MRI imaging from the standpoint of larger spatial scale (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Logothetis et al., 2012</xref>). Interestingly, in this study, it was observed that during hippocampal ripple states that cortex exhibited net positive bold responses and thalamus net negative BOLD responses. This anti-correlated relationship is consistent with some of our observations of thalamic spiking activity corresponding with cortical temporal dynamics exhibiting slow depression of calcium signals and may point to a larger coordinated network involving other brain structures. However, as we did not record simultaneously from hippocampus we cannot definitively comment on whether these observations necessarily correspond to hippocampal ripple events. Furthermore, MRI signals lack temporal resolution and can be more difficult to relate to neuronal activity than GCaMP signals that are isolated within excitatory neurons of GCaMP6f mice using specific promoters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Chen et al., 2013b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Madisen et al., 2015</xref>). Unique to our approach is the power to assess the functional connectivity and temporal dynamics between specific sub-cortical neurons and areas of cortex not predicted by previous knowledge such as linkages between thalamic neurons and cortical state as defined by GCaMP signal dynamics. We anticipate that the approach can be further refined as tools such as more selective cre-dependent CGaMP6f transgenic mice allow for the expression of calcium indicators in particular neuron types (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Madisen et al., 2015</xref>). Furthermore, two-photon microscopy could be used to provide information about behavior of individual cells within the context of larger maps (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Chen et al., 2013a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Guo et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Okun et al., 2015</xref>). Because of the high sensitivity of the indicator and the possibility of measuring the activity of tens of single-units using multiple electrode channels simultaneously, a large number of functional connections can be mapped in only a few minutes of recording. Although we have only used a single electrode shank, we anticipate future applications using higher density electrodes and multiple shanks to collect spikes from more neurons simultaneously.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Relationship between cortical and sub-cortical spiking derived maps</title><p>Our results indicate that the neocortex is divided into discrete subdivisions where individual spiking cortical neurons generally belong to spatial-temporal maps that follow a consensus function that can be defined using correlation as in previous work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Mohajerani et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chan et al., 2015</xref>). In contrast, we show that single thalamic neurons tend to fire when cortex is in more kinetically diverse states which is dominated by inhibition. The more diverse dynamics between thalamic neurons and cortical mesoscopic networks indicate that sub-cortical thalamic neurons play an instructive role with respect to cortical state, particularly with respect to feedforward cortical inhibition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Stroh et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Urbain et al., 2015</xref>), whereas cortical neurons may serve as relay endpoints or amplifiers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Douglas et al., 1995</xref>). A better understanding of these dynamics may yield insight into how disorders, such as epilepsy, and dementia, emerge when interactions between brain areas are disrupted (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Paz et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Busche et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">McCormick et al., 2015</xref>). The diversity in sub-cortical spiking derived maps may also reflect differing receptive field properties in thalamus and cortex based on varying types of functional convergence described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Miller et al., 2001</xref>). Indeed, in the somatosensory whisker barrel system, evidence for ‘ensemble convergence’ has been described where input from the thalamus can extend outside of the boundaries of the corresponding cortical receptive field (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Simons and Carvell, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Linden and Schreiner, 2003</xref>). The larger diversity of maps derived from the spiking of different thalamic neurons may be expected because of the smaller size of thalamic nuclei compared to the cortex and the recording of thalamic neurons from more-varied structures. Another potential source of variance may arise from the diversity of thalamocortical impulses that can be comprised of patterns of activity ranging from tonic, 'relay' transmission consisting of high regular rates of firing to burst-like activity where firing rates are low and interspersed with high-frequency events (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Steriade and Llinas, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">McCormick and Feeser, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Sherman and Guillery, 1996</xref>). Thalamic bursting can powerfully activate neocortical circuits and has been suggested to serve a ‘wake-up’ signal to sensory cortices (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Sherman and Guillery, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Swadlow and Gusev, 2001</xref>). When we segregated our recordings into various firing configurations, we did not observe profound differences in STMs or their temporal dynamics indicating that the averaging methodology is not constrained by a particular firing pattern. However, interpreting these results is caveated by the mesoscale resolution and calcium dynamics present in the recorded data.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Applications of spike-triggered mapping</title><p>Mapping the functional connectivity around identified spiking neurons is important for understanding brain function and finding therapeutic targets for brain stimulation or brain machine interfaces.

Given that reciprocal connections between mesoscale structures are widespread, the cortical maps associated with a spiking neuron in a sub-cortical structure such as the sub-thalamic nucleus may provide clues as to how cortical activity can be manipulated to affect a sub-cortical target. This hypothesis can be tested by recording sub-cortically using electrode arrays, while stimulating regions of cortex that show coincident STMs using Channelrhodopsin-2 or other opsin-activity sensor pairs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Lim et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Rickgauer et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Zou et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Abdelfattah et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Kim et al., 2016a</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3-4"><title>Kinetics of spike-triggered mapping</title><p>By computing spike-triggered calcium imaging averages, we reduce the contribution of neurons which fire out of phase.

Slower dynamics are expected given the kinetics of GCaMP6 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Chen et al., 2013b</xref>). We have used deconvolution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Pnevmatikakis et al., 2016</xref>) to take into consideration the slower kinetics of GCaMP6 and compensate for it. Using this approach, we observed a significant acceleration of raw data but very modest effects on STMTD indicating that STMTD may already be accelerated relative to GCaMP6 kinetics by the statistical nature of spike/Ca<sup>2+</sup> transient temporal convergence. It is also possible that slower dynamics of STMTD reflect sequences of spiking activity propagating through specific polysynaptic circuits. This speculation was supported by the similar time range of STMTD and cue-triggered recall of learned temporal sequences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Xu et al., 2012</xref>).

Throughout surgery and imaging, body temperature was maintained at 37°C using a heating pad with a feedback thermistor.

Emission fluorescence was filtered using a 510–550 nm bandpass filter or collected in a multi-band mode as described below. For single wavelength green epifluorescence, we collected 12-bit images at varying time resolution (20–100 ms; i.e., 10–50 Hz) using XCAP imaging software.

We assume hemoglobin is the primary absorber in brain tissue in vivo and changes in blood volume or oxygenation affect both excitation and emission of light used for wide-field imaging (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Ma et al., 2016</xref>). Our strategy makes use of short blue wavelength reference light that is also near a hemoglobin isosbestic point.

This strategy provides a short blue light reference without the need for strobing which can limit time resolution and potentially entrain some neuronal rhythms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Iaccarino et al., 2016</xref>) and is more technically demanding from a hardware synchronization standpoint. Our strategy employs the Raspberry Picam’s RGB sensor (Waveshare Electronics RPi Camera F) to independently resolve signals attributed to blood volume changes as blue reflected light, while simultaneously collecting green epi fluorescence (GCaMP6). We used a Chroma 69013m multi-band filter 10 mm diameter mounted just over the image sensor allowing blue, green, and red signals to be simultaneously obtained in separate channels of the cameras RGB sensor with less than 10% cross talk between channels. We employ 2 Luxeon LEDs: (1) Royal-Blue (447.5 nm) LUXEON Rebel ES LED with added Brightline Semrock 438/24 nm filter to provide a short blue wavelength reflected light signal that is expected to report blood volume changes; (2) a blue 473 nm Luxeon Rebel ES LED for excitation of GCaMP6 with a Chroma 480 nm/30 nm excitation filter.

Given that the short-blue reflected light signals provided a surrogate indicator of green reflected light (they are highly positively correlated) we used this in a ratiometric correction strategy.

Averages of sensory stimulation were calculated from 20 to 40 trials of stimulation with an inter-stimulus interval of 10s.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Single unit activity analysis</title><p>Raw extracellular traces were imported into Spike2 (Cambridge Electronic Design, Cambridge, UK) or SpikeSorter software (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Swindale and Spacek, 2014</xref>) for spike sorting and analysis. Briefly, data were high pass-filtered at 1 kHz, and single spikes were detected using a threshold of 4.5 times the median of the standard deviation over 0.675. Sorting was carried out by an automated method previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Swindale and Spacek, 2014</xref>) and followed by manual visual inspection of units. For analysis, we only used only units with a peak-to-peak extracellular amplitude of at least 40 μV, a minimum of 200 spikes, and a calcium cortical response (STMTD, see next section) of at least 0.5% to improve single unit sorting isolation, STM map stability and signal-to-noise ratios for STMTD clustering (see main text), respectively.</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>Calcium imaging analysis</title><p>TIF files of raw fluorescence were imported and processed using Matlab (Mathworks, Inc. Natick, MA) or Python2.7 custom codes. For each spike, we averaged the cortical fluorescence of every pixel during the period preceding the spike (−3 to 0 s: baseline). ΔF/F<sub>0</sub> was then performed by subtracting and dividing the baseline to each frame for each spike within a time window of ±3 s. We tested additional methods for computing ΔF/F<sub>0</sub> including computing baseline from the average of the entire recording or band pass filtering the data (0.1 Hz to 6.0 Hz) but the results were similar. STA (spike-triggered average) sequences were created by averaging the ΔF/F<sub>0</sub> responses for each trial and were compared with random spike STA. STA maps (STM) were then defined as the maximum response calculated for each pixel within a time window of ±1 s.</p><p>STM temporal dynamics (STMTDs) were defined as the time course of activity of the maximally activated pixel in a region of interest. The resulting clusters were separated using k-means clustering algorithm. Putative cell classification into inhibitory and excitatory cell types was based on the full-width-half-max of each unit's positive and negative phases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Connors and Gutnick, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Pape and McCormick, 1995</xref>).</p><p>To calculate seed pixel correlation maps (SPM), the contribution of global and illumination fluctuations was subtracted from the signal of each pixel (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Vanni and Murphy, 2014</xref>) and the spontaneous activity recording sequences were temporally pass-band filtered (0.3–3 Hz). Then, cross-correlation coefficient r values between the temporal profiles of one selected pixel and all the others were calculated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">White et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Mohajerani et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Vanni and Murphy, 2014</xref>). Similarities between STM and SPM maps were performed by measuring the r-value Pearson correlation coefficient between each pair of pixels.</p><p>To compare the STM with anatomical database, brain stacks of 140 slices were downloaded from the Allen Mouse Brain Connectivity Atlas providing AAV-virus tracing database (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://connectivity.brain-map.org/">http://connectivity.brain-map.org/</ext-link>, [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Oh et al., 2014</xref>]). For each slice, the first dorsal 300 µm of brain fluorescence in the Z-axis were summed to generate partial maximum Z-projection maps similarly to previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Mohajerani et al., 2013</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>Deconvolution</title><p>We temporally deconvolved our calcium imaging pixel-by-pixel using the method presented by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Pnevmatikakis et al.

Briefly, the method uses an autoregressive approach to estimate the calcium transient as an impulse response from the data itself (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Pnevmatikakis et al., 2016</xref>). Making use of this, the time course of calcium transients is then deconvolved using a computationally efficient non-negative, sparse, constrained deconvolution.</p></sec><sec id="s4-10"><title>Cell spiking mode determination</title><p>We implemented methodology previously described for defining main spiking modes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Sherman et al., 2006</xref>) (Figure 6.5, pg 236). Briefly, the method requires determination of the distribution of each spike’s inter-spike-interval (ISI) between the previous (x-axis) and following (y-axis) spike (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>). The distribution is then plotted using logarithmic scales and naturally arising clusters are grouped or clustered. Spike groups occurring in approximately each quadrant of the plot indicate different spiking modes: first spikes in a burst (bottom right), spiking occurring during a burst (bottom left), last spikes in a burst (top left), and tonic spikes (top right). The vast majority of cortical cells we recorded in barrel cortex did not exhibit multiple classes of spiking modes (2 examples provided where some natural clustering is present: <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1A and B</xref>), and only a few of thalamic cells we recorded showed clear bursting modes (two-examples provided <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1C and D</xref>) while also passing our minimum thresholds (see Materials and methods: <bold>Single unit activity analysis</bold>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-11"><title>Single-spike motif sub-network analysis</title><p>We sought to determine whether sub-groups of spike STMs from a single cell could cluster and yield average STMs that were different than the all-spike average STM. Our approach was to group single spike motifs by similarity in a high-dimensional space (e.g. 64 × 64 pixels=4096 dimensions) and removed spontaneous motifs averages that were similar to our groupings to reveal the underlying single cell STM. The first step was to compute distributions of the cortical STMs of all spikes (which have high variability; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s4">Figure 6—figure supplement 4A</xref>) in a high dimensional space. The lack of obvious clusters indicated that there were no sub-groups of STMs present in the data which are removed by the averaging procedure. We proceeded to group the STM distributions by similarity into four (or more) partitions to reveal active sub-networks present during single spiking (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s4">Figure 6—figure supplement 4B</xref>). While inter-spike-interval (ISI) distribution were largely similar for the sub-grouped networks (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s4">Figure 6—figure supplement 4C</xref>) the resulting four sub-networks had substantial diversity indicating that (on averae) spiking occurred during different types of active cortical networks with only one of these sub-networks resembling our all-spike average STM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s4">Figure 6—figure supplement 4D</xref>; four sub-network STMs and sum at the bottom). We next identified spontaneous STMs – that is STMs occurring without spiking – that were most similar to our sub-networks to subtract their contribution and reveal the cell's component STM in the sub-network STMs. We thus grouped spontaneously occurring motifs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s4">Figure 6—figure supplement 4E</xref>) into sub-networks similar to spike triggered networks by re-using the spike generated sub-network centres (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s4">Figure 6—figure supplement 4B,F</xref>). This ensured that the spontaneous sub-networks would be similar to the spike-triggered sub-networks. The resulting spontaneous sub-networks are similar – but not identical – to the cell spike triggered sub-networks (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s4">Figure 6—figure supplement 4H</xref>; note that the sum is mostly noise as expected when summing over all activity). Importantly, when subtracting the spontaneously active sub-network STMs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s4">Figure 6—figure supplement 4H</xref>) from the spike-triggered sub-network STMs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s4">Figure 6—figure supplement 4D</xref>), we recovered STMs which represented mainly single cell spiking components and were largely similar to the overall average STM. We provide additional examples of this STM partitioning using other cortical and thalamic cells and also an example where we partitioned the STM distribution into 12 sub-networks but still recovered the all-spike average STM from each of the partitioned networks (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s5">Figure 6—figure supplement 5</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-12"><title>Code availability</title><p>A mixture of custom Python and Matlab code was used for analysis (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/catubc/sta_maps">https://github.com/catubc/sta_maps</ext-link>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-13"><title>Histology</title><p>Prior to each recording, pipettes were filled with dye (Texas red-dextran) or the rear of a laminar electrode shank (side opposite the recording sites) was painted with fluorescent 1, 1-dioctadecyl-3,3,3,3-tetramethylindocarbocyanine perchlorate (DiI, ~10% in dimethylfuran, Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR). Dye-labeled pipettes and electrodes were not used until the dimethylfuran solvent had evaporated. At the end of each experiment, animals were killed with an intraperitoneal injection of pentobarbital (24 mg). Mice were transcardially perfused with PBS followed by chilled 4% PFA in PBS. Coronal brain sections (50 µm thickness) were cut on a vibratome (Leica VT1000S).

This allows them to form a transfer function of the spatiotemporal patterns in cortex in response to spiking from a single neuron in with cortex or thalamus. These patterns may extend across multiple cortical areas, consistent with long-range connections. Further, they are more robust when derived with respect to cortical versus thalamic spikes. These data provide key, additional evidence for a highly restricted number of patterns generated by cortex, even from &quot;spontaneous&quot; activity, compared with the number of neurons in a region of interest.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>Both reviewers as well as the Reviewing editor find this to be a carefully executed set of experiments and praise to quality of the imaging over an unprecedented nearly 1 cm by 1 cm field of view. The reviewers raise excellent issues and I would like the author to respond to all comments. Regarding &quot;essential&quot; points, one reoccurring theme that will require additional analysis concerns the averaging. First, it would be very useful to see variance maps as well as average or spike triggered maps (STMs) as an extension of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figures 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">4</xref>. The two may not be scaled versions of each other if the calcium responses are nonlinear. For that reason, the authors may further consider an analysis of the covariance of the data, as opposed to only the mean, as would reveal properties of &quot;complex&quot; versus &quot;simple&quot; visual cells. Perhaps this issue is at bay with the thalamic data. An example of how to do this was reviewed in Aljadef et al. (Neuron 2016), where the calcium images would replace the visual stimuli in the analysis.</p><p>The reviewers raise three additional points that must be considered and preferably implemented. The first is the important issue of removing potential blood flow contributions, as was done by Chris Niell in a 2016 Journal of Neurophysiology manuscript. This should, ideally, be applied to the present data if at all possible. The second concerns the nature of the STM calculated from temporally isolated spikes versus spikes that are part of a burst. Given the known depression of thalamo-cortical synapses, this could likely contribute the variability of the STM data using thalamic spikes. To address this issue, the thalamic bursts can be isolated from the spike records and, as one possibility, the STM can be computed with respect to only the first spike. Lastly, the &quot;spontaneous activity&quot; may currently include sensory-evoked activity from body motion. As the authors recorded body motion, it would be germane to check if &quot;spontaneous activity&quot; in fact results from self motion, as this changes the interpretation of &quot;spontaneous activity' from internally generated to reafferent driven.</p><p>Reviewer #1:</p><p>Spontaneous activity recorded with various methods (e.g., fMRI, intrinsic signal, voltage, and Ca<sup>2+</sup> imaging) in the brain is useful to predict anatomical and functional connectivity in the brain. For example, seed pixel correlation maps (SPMs) can show the cross-correlation map of the spontaneous activity for a defined seed pixel in the images. In this study, Xiao et al. combined GCaMP imaging of an entire cortex with single neuron electrophysiological recordings, and used the spike-triggered averaging approach to determine the mesoscopic network motif linked to the recorded neurons. The spike trigger averaging approach has already been reported by Grinvald lab (Arieli et al., 1995), and the current study does not provide a new methodological framework. However, combined with state-of-the-art GCaMP imaging, Xiao et al. nicely demonstrates the power of this approach by finding subcortical to cortical network motifs, which have been difficult with optical imaging alone.</p><p>Overall, this study is technically sound. I suggest the following points to improve the quality and/or the presentation of the work.</p><p>Major issues:</p><p>1) Results section. Spike-trigger averaging of optical signals was originally reported by Grinvald lab and authors are simply adopting this approach to the large-scale GCaMP imaging. Authors need to introduce the original work in the Introduction and/or Results section.</p><p>2) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>. Authors are using single-spike events to calculate the STM. However, in GCaMP imaging, single spikes can produce only marginal response changes (ΔF/F). In addition, a single spike in a single neuron is unlikely to effectively activate all the post-synaptic neurons. Thus, it is possible that multiple-spike events (or bursts) can produce a more reliable STM. The authors could test this possibility by reanalyzing data and the results could be shown as in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C, D</xref>.</p><p>3) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>. Authors demonstrate that a conserved network motif emerges by averaging the spike-triggered maps. However, this is based on an assumption that a single spike is always linked to a single type of network motif. Is it possible that multiple motifs are linked to a single neuron and authors' approach is averaging out multiple types of motifs? Authors could, for example, try classification of the spike-triggered maps.</p><p>4) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>. Given the diversity of cell types (and projection patterns) within a defined brain region, it is possible that STM is diverse even within a defined cortical area. Did authors find such cases? (In fact, STMTD is diverse in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figures 7</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">8</xref>.) It is also possible that neurons in different cortical layers show distinct STMs even within the same area. Throughout this manuscript, box plots or beeswarm plots may be more appropriate if they show non-normal distributions with rare examples.</p><p>Reviewer #3:</p><p>Neuroscience research linking ongoing activity in brain-wide networks to that of single neurons is sorely lacking. fMRI studies have revealed interesting default brain networks that correspond to different behavioral states. The current study analyzes such patterns using widefield calcium imaging, selectively in excitatory neurons throughout dorsal cortex – arguably a useful complementary approach to the aforementioned human work given that calcium signals are more tightly linked to spiking activity. In addition, previous work using hippocampal electrophysiology and fMRI in non-human primates (Logothetis et al., Nature 2012) showed that hippocampal ripple activity during states other than active waking was linked to widespread cortical activation as well as to suppressed activity in subcortical regions (including thalamus), but few studies have taken a similar approach using widefield calcium imaging. The current study uses impressive tools, the combination of which is somewhat novel, to link spiking activity from single cortical and subcortical neurons with widespread GCaMP6 calcium activity during anesthesia and quiet waking. Further, only few studies have performed imaging with such a large field of view (9 mm x 9 mm). In general, the manuscript is well written. The successful collection of these datasets is exciting, and the combination of dense imaging, electrophysiology and behavioral information provides an extremely rich and unique dataset. However, the analyses performed do not effectively extract much of this richness, and do not, in the current form, reveal clearly interpretable insights of broad interest gained by this approach (particularly given the caveats involved in averaging across many neurons). Further, several interpretations of the data are confusing, and some key references require further consideration. These issues are discussed in detail below:</p><p>1) The authors show that seed pixel correlation maps (SPMs) are better matched to cortical single-unit spike-triggered maps (STMs) than to thalamic STMs, and that thalamic STMs are generally more diverse than cortical (specifically barrel cortex) STMs. However, as suggested by the authors in the Discussion, this is likely due, at least in part, to greater diversity across thalamic recordings from neurons in a larger number of smaller thalamic nuclei (vs. more consistently from S1 barrel region of cortex, albeit across layers) vs. recordings in a single cortical area with a large magnification factor. Further, cortical neurons within S1 are highly correlated, likely more so that nearby neurons in thalamus, further ensuring strong correlation between the cortical spiking activity and the SPM maps (since the seed cortical pixel is likely highly correlated with the cortical single-unit recording), more so that would be likely be possible with most thalamic units). The other suggested explanations for these findings made by the authors in the Discussion are far more speculative, and many would be difficult to test. Further, little effort is made to relate specific thalamic recordings from specific areas to any specific cortical patterns (e.g. did lemniscal thalamic recordings have more similar STMs to SPMs vs non-lemniscal thalamic recordings?). Given that the correlation between cortical neurons and their neighbors is likely very different than the correlation between single thalamic neurons and their neighbors, it might be helpful to compute STMs for multiunit activity in cortex and in thalamus for a given electrode contact, and then subtract a scaled version of this STM from the single unit STM – that may put the cortical and thalamic analyses on more even footing (all the more true given data in Figure 3Diii). Similar analyses could be done for high-passed LFP or CSD recordings, allowing a better sense of the relationship between a single neuron's spike with network activity, vs. the correlated spiking of that neuron and many nearby neurons. This analysis may also reveal more spatially localized patterns (e.g. for barrel cortex recordings, it might reveal relatively more barrel-specific response profiles). Similarly, for cortical recordings, one could subtract STMs in superficial recordings from STMs with simultaneously recorded neurons in deep layers, thus removing the 'columnar' component of the correlation, and allowing evaluation of residual, layer-specific contributions.</p><p>2) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref> is interesting in terms of differences between thalamic and cortical recordings, given the consistent net and prolonged suppression with thalamic STMs and net excitation with cortical STMs. While the authors mention Logothetis 2012 Nature, they don't mention that this Logothetis et al. paper (their <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>) shows hippocampal ripple-triggered excitation of most of cortex, and ripple-triggered suppression of most subcortical regions including thalamus. This could very well explain the effects seen in the current <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>, of net suppression in thalamic STMs (at most delays) and net activation for cortical STMs, as it provides evidence that cortical and thalamic neurons are likely anti-correlated during much of spontaneous activity (e.g. during ripple events). It would be worthwhile following this up – if most spontaneous cortical spiking is ripple-related and involved distributed, correlated cortical patterns, this could also partially explain why cortical STMs look more like SPMs than thalamic SPMs. This is a place where the true level and time course of activity would likely be different if STM analysis methods were used that didn't involve subtraction of GCaMP6 activity in the 3-s window prior to spike onset (see point 3c below).</p><p>3) Several analysis choices make the findings difficult to interpret: (a) there is no correction for vascular effects despite analyses spanning several seconds surrounding the spike: it is surprising that no vascular responses are seen in STMs in the GFP control, please discuss. (b) the authors suggest using deconvolution of signals as a future direction, but this would seem to be highly useful to use in the present analyses in separating GCaMp6 dynamics from neural dynamics, given the emphasis, in part, on temporal resolution (relative to fMRI). Both points (a) and (b) are effectively addressed in a study that is in some ways quite similar, by Wekselblatt et al., J Neurophys June 2016 -- a paper that is not cited by the authors. In that paper, Wekselblatt et al. nicely show the use of stimulus-evoked widefield GCaMP6 mapping across an intermediate sized cranial window in mice, after deconvolution and removal of vascular signals. (c) Another issue that is difficult to interpret is the normalization of GCaMP6 signal to a window of time prior to spike onset. Clearly this is throwing out a lot of useful information, and may distort much of the information that remains. An alternative approach might be to use a running median subtraction at each pixel, perhaps with removal of any slow drifts over long timescales, which would more effectively reveal what GCaMP6 activity is leading vs. lagging the spiking activity. (d) No discuss of the nature of the spiking activity is presented, yet burst firing (and thus, counting spikes with short ISI as similar to those with long ISI) may also distort the STMs. (e) The cortical delineation of areas is crude, and most secondary areas are not well delineated, making it difficult to assess whether any specific spatial resolution afforded by the technique actually yields insights at the level of specific higher cortical areas. (f): While it is interesting and useful to see that STM patterns become similar after averaging &gt;128 or 256 trials (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>), most of the information in the dataset is lost in this averaging process. Do subsets of spike events share a common spike-triggered pattern, albeit one that is not present on the majority of spike events, and which might be washed out by this averaging?</p><p>4) Description of the choice of epochs included in &quot;spontaneous activity&quot; is unclear. The authors do not seem to use body-tracking data that they collect and describe in Methods in order to segregate epochs of true spontaneous activity. The &quot;spontaneous activity&quot; may currently include sensory-evoked activity (i.e., internally generated spontaneous whisking), even though these behaviors were observed, as stated in &quot;Methods: Multimodal recording in awake mice.&quot;</p><p>5) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref> in interesting given the PCA patterns show differential connection with thalamic or cortical spiking, but no obvious effort was made to understand which cortical cells or thalamic cells fall into each pattern category (other than spike width analysis). What do spike autocorrelations look like? Sensory receptive fields? Layer in cortex? Location within specific thalamic nuclei? Without any such insights linking the findings to known entities, the value of this figure is somewhat low.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.19976.035</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>Essential revisions:</italic> </p><p><italic>Both reviewers as well as the Reviewing editor find this to be a carefully executed set of experiments and praise to quality of the imaging over an unprecedented nearly 1 cm by 1 cm field of view.

In the end, these approaches confirm the validity of an averaging approach; 2) Potential for changes of blood volume/oxygenation to alter fluorescence signals. We provide new data using a reference wavelength to confirm minimal effects of blood volume contamination of spike triggered average GCaMP signals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1</xref>); 3) We report that spike-triggered average maps are similar for bursting versus non-bursting neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s3">3</xref>); and 4) We now show that periods of body movement have little impact on spike triggered average maps <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s1">Figure 8—figure supplement 1</xref>).</p><p>Although not mentioned in the reviews we also take this opportunity to address verbal comments made by Matteo Carandini (at SFN during his lecture) about the Ai93 mouse and his observation of seizures. We are surprised by this observation as we have not seen activity consistent with the behavioral consequences of a seizure in our colony of these mice. We show long records of LFP activity indicating relatively normal up down states (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Author response image 1</xref>).

As suggested, we calculated spike triggered variance maps in an analogous way to the spike triggered maps and show an example of their temporal dynamics.

To do this we made use of the code provided in the supplemental information in Aljadeff et al. 2016 and used our calcium imaging in place of the visual stimuli, as suggested, following the analysis steps presented in this excellent resource. To make the computation feasible (in terms of computer time) it was necessary to down sample the imaging data to 32x32. In order to compare the resulting STA from the Aljadeff et al. 2016 with the spike triggered maps we previously calculated, we considered 6 time points. With these reduced dimensions it took 1-3 days to process a neuron depending on the length of the recording.<fig id="fig11" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.19976.031</object-id><label>Author response image 3.</label><caption><title>Spike Triggered Covariance Analysis of BCS1 Neuron.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Each calcium image was recorded each Δt = 33.33 ms (frame rate = 30 Hz), and the spikes recorded in BCS1 neuron were binned within the same interval.

At this significance level we were unable to find any significant STC feature for either cortical or subcortical neurons. The SNR of optical recordings may contribute to this so we re-tested at a more relaxed significance level of 0.05. At this level none of the n=4 cortical neurons tested had significant STC features. However, for 5 subcortical neurons of a total of n=5 tested we found significant STC features. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig12">Author response image 4</xref> illustrates this for a subcortical neuron similar to Aljadeff et al. 2016 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>.</p><p>The analysis indicates that single cortical cells were most likely associated with a single dominant map, whereas single sub-cortical cells are not only associated with dominant STA map, but also more likely to be associated with multiple STC maps. While initial STC analysis indicated that BCS1 neurons were associated with more simple maps than subcortical neurons, GCaMP images may have had lower signal to noise ratio than some of the examples in Aljadeff et al. 2016 and we have considerably less spikes making it harder to draw firm conclusions from group analysis. Therefore, we show this analysis as a reviewer/editor-only example and have not included it as supplemental or regular figure.</p><p><italic>The reviewers raise three additional points that must be considered and preferably implemented. The first is the important issue of removing potential blood flow contributions, as was done by Chris Niell in a 2016 Journal of Neurophysiology manuscript. This should, ideally, be applied to the present data if at all possible.</italic> </p><p>The reviewers mention that our data should be corrected for blood volume changes which can potentially alter conclusions regarding spike-triggered mapping.</p><p>All of the data in the original manuscript was collected with a single green epi-fluorescence wavelength and not dual wavelength imaging needed for a reflected light reference image. In the original paper we gave examples of GFP mice that would be subject to similar artifacts yet were unable to produced spike-triggered maps (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). As suggested by the reviewer these animals do show small slow transients that are typically less than 0.1% and importantly do not produce clear STA maps with known anatomical motifs.</p><p>To satisfy the reviewers concerns we have now done additional experiments using a multi-wavelength approach. We have now implemented a very similar correction to that performed by the Niell lab manuscript (Wekselblatt et al., 2016) and is also similar to work performed by the Hillman lab (Ma et al., 2016). In summary, the Niell lab implemented a strobed light presentation using alternating blue and green lights to capture GCaMP epi-fluorescence (blue illumination) and green reflectance (dim green illumination) in alternating frames. We have used a similar approach but monitor blue reflected light as our reference signal for fluorescence changes due to hemodynamics. We feel that there is some loss of time resolution using the strobed approach and it also depends very strongly on camera timing signals. There is also the issue of the flashing lights potentially stimulating/entraining the animal. Accordingly, we have developed a very similar strategy using a color RGB camera (Picam) (Murphy et al., 2016), which allows simultaneous acquisition of a short blue light reflected signal (447 nm LED and 438/24 nm filter near an isosbestic point for hemoglobin), and a green epi-fluorescence signal (GCaMP). Using the short blue reflected light signal, we now show that 438 nm reflected light is strongly correlated with 532 nm green reflected light in a control experiment (r = 0.93; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1</xref>). This analysis indicates that short blue reflected light signals can be used as a surrogate for a green reflected signal. Accordingly, we now use the short blue reflected light signal in a division strategy very similar to previous approaches (Sirotin and Das, 2010; Ma et al., 2016; Wekselblatt et al., 2016). The division was performed after both frame-by-frame signals were converted a ΔF/F<sub>0</sub> and employed a green/blue weight of 1. We have tried weightings than &gt;1.0 for the short blue signal, but found that some aspects of the kinetics were over-corrected. This new analysis dampens non-specific fluctuations associated with blood volume changes, which are aggravated in the awake state. We now show using validation with green light reflection, as well as GFP mice and that our strategy results in a reduction in baseline noise.</p><p>However, after implementing this corrective strategy, we find little change in spike-triggered map activity consistent with control investigations of functional connectivity or task-related connectivity in GFP animals in experiments done previously by our lab (Vanni and Murphy, 2014; Murphy et al., 2016; Silasi et al., 2016). Furthermore, notable features, such as some areas showing apparent cortical inhibition (reductions in calcium activity) were also preserved in the new corrected analysis. We now include this new data as a supplemental figure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1</xref>) and outline the procedure in the Materials and methods and Results section. Given that the correction does not have a large impact and failed to change the appearance of the maps we have kept the original figures as is (they cannot be corrected given they reflect a single wavelength) and now point readers to the new confirmatory experiments and previous papers using the GFP-mouse controls (Vanni and Murphy, 2014; Murphy et al., 2016; Silasi et al., 2016).</p><p>See amended text from Materials and methods:</p><p>“In some experiments (as indicated), we employed a multi-wavelength strategy to correct for potential green epifluorescence signals that were associated with non-calcium dependent events. […]While the shorter blue wavelength light will scatter more than a green strobed reflected light signal used by others (Ma et al., 2016; Wekselblatt et al., 2016), our analysis of green reflected light and short blue reflected light, indicating that two were highly correlated, suggests that the major artifacts we observe are associated with large blood volume changes in superficial cortical layers.”</p><p>See amended text from Results section:</p><p>“Other potential sources of error include apparent changes in GCaMP6 signal due to alterations in blood volume or oxygenation (Ma et al., 2016; Wekselblatt et al., 2016). […]Furthermore thalamic STA maps and STA dynamic plots still indicated cases where thalamic spiking was associated with cortical inhibition. For these reasons we have attempted to correct other STA maps using this multi-wavelength procedure.”</p><p><italic>The second concerns the nature of the STM calculated from temporally isolated spikes versus spikes that are part of a burst. Given the known depression of thalamo-cortical synapses, this could likely contribute the variability of the STM data using thalamic spikes. To address this issue, the thalamic bursts can be isolated from the spike records and, as one possibility, the STM can be computed with respect to only the first spike.</italic> </p><p>It is conceivable that averaging over many spikes could mask spatial heterogeneity observed in sub-groups of spikes. Therefore, we performed additional analyses where we classified spike triggered STMs and STMTDs into sub-groups based on spiking modes (bursting vs. tonic) or motif similarity in a high-dimensional space – with the goal of determining whether during different types of active cortical dynamics our single spike-sorted neurons contribute different types of STMs or temporal dynamics (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s5">5</xref>).</p><p>We searched for STM sub-groups by dividing all spikes from a single cell into bursting versus tonic modes. We implemented methodology previously described for defining the main spiking modes of a single cell (Sherman and Guillery, 2006; Figure 6.5, pg 236). Briefly, the method requires computing the distribution of each spike’s inter-spike-interval (ISI) between the previous (x-axis) and following (y-axis) spike (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>). The resulting pre- and post-spike 2D distribution is then plotted using logarithmic scales and naturally arising clusters are grouped or clustered. Spike groups occurring in approximately each quadrant of the plot indicate different spiking modes: first spikes in a burst (bottom right), spiking occurring during a burst (bottom left), last spikes in a burst (top left), and tonic spikes (top right). The vast majority of cortical cells we recorded in barrel cortex did not exhibit multiple classes of spiking modes, however we provide 2 examples where some natural clustering is present (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>(Ai) and (Bi)). The spike sub-groups representing different spiking modes yielded very similar STMs and motifs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>(Aii) and (Bii)) and similar STMTDs in the area of highest activation, i.e. left barrel cortex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref> (Aiii) and (Biii)). We also provide examples of two identified thalamic cells which showed more apparent spiking modes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>(C) and (D)). The thalamic cells we identified showed better bursting versus tonic clusters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref> (Ci) and (Di)) but much like cortical cells their STM and STMTDs were largely stable across the clustered spiking modes. The 3 cortical and 4 thalamic cells provided in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref> did not exhibit clear spiking modes. For those cells we implemented a simpler methodology and compared all-spike STMs against STMs generated by spikes preceded by at least 500ms of silence as indicative of bursting activity following a period of quiescence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplements 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s3">3</xref>). Using both of these methodologies to divide spiking times into different modes we found that both STMs and STMTDs across spiking modes are similar to the all-spike average STMs in both cortical and thalamic cells examined.</p><p>We additionally sought to determine whether single-spike motifs were similar to each other and formed natural clusters in a high-dimensional representation space. There were no naturally arising clusters suggesting that single spikes occur during many phases of ongoing, i.e. spontaneous, cortical activity. Accordingly, we manually partitioned the motifs into several (4 to 12) groups by similarity and after removing the spontaneous component we were able to recover the all-spike average STMs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s4">Figure 6—figure supplement 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s5">5</xref>; see Methods). This single-spike motif sub-grouping suggests that: (i) cells fire during many different ongoing cortical states; and (ii) that despite the high degree of variability single cell spikes appear to correlate with (or possible contribute to) similar overall STM patterns. Given that single spike motifs are very diverse (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s4">Figure 6—figure supplement 4</xref>(A)) our approach was to project single-spike STMs into a high-dimensional space, compute their distributions and search for clusters or manually partition the resulting distributions. There were no natural groups in the resulting high-dimensional distribution so we partition the data into 4 (or more) sub-groups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s4">Figure 6—figure supplement 4</xref>(B), see also <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s5">Figure 6—figure supplement 5</xref>). The resulting 4 “sub-networks” represent (on average) qualitatively different types of ongoing cortical activity during which our cell fires action potentials. While these partitions were manually created, we were interested in determining whether they could generate STMs that resembled all-spike average STMs and whether this was independent of the number of partitions. The 4 partitions chosen generated somewhat different STMs, only one of which strongly resembled our all-spike average STM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s4">Figure 6—figure supplement 4</xref>(D); all spike average is bottom STM). The inter-spike-interval (ISI) distributions during activation of these sub-networks is also similar across all partitions further suggesting that this partitioning method did not identify highly bursting or tonic periods of activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s4">Figure 6—figure supplement 4</xref>(C)). Because we had enforced a manual STM-space partition, our resulting sub-network STM averages contained an offset that essentially represented ongoing “spontaneous” cortical activity particular to each STM-space partition. Accordingly, we sought to remove this spontaneous component by carrying out the same partitioning method – but this time on spontaneous activity (i.e. not using single spike triggers). The distribution of spontaneous STMs (i.e. ongoing STMs not related to our cell spiking) also have substantial variability (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s4">Figure 6—figure supplement 4</xref>(E)). We next projected all spontaneous motifs into an STM-space but partitioned this space based on the sub-network centres derived previously (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s4">Figure 6—figure supplement 4</xref>(B) and (D)). This guaranteed that the 4 STMs derived from spontaneous activity would be the closest to our spike-triggered STMs. The spontaneous activity motifs showed a very strong ISI distributions peak at ~33ms (i.e. single-frame time) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s4">Figure 6—figure supplement 4</xref>(G)) indicating that STMs that were neighbouring in time (i.e. separated by single frames) were substantially more likely to be in the same region of STM-space and to be grouped together. This is expected as transitions meso-scale cortical dynamics usually last several frames at our 30Hz sampling rate. The sum of the 4 spontaneous STMs yield an STM with an approximately 0% ΔF/F<sub>0</sub> value – which is expected when averaging all spontaneous motifs (or frames) during a recording (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s4">Figure 6—figure supplement 4</xref>(H) bottom STM). The last step is to remove the spontaneously activity STMs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s4">Figure 6—figure supplement 4</xref>(H)) from the single cell spike-triggered sub-networks (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s4">Figure 6—figure supplement 4</xref>(D)). The results reveal that the 4 partition STMs reduce to the all spike average STMs. This analysis supports the averaging method of computing STMs: despite firing during different types of cortical dynamics, single cells contribute to – and participate in – ongoing dynamics in a stereotyped way that is represented by the all-spike STM average.</p><p>We further applied this partitioning method on additional cells: two cortical and two thalamic cells with similar results (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s5">Figure 6—figure supplement 5</xref>). We also tested a 12 partition approach (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s5">Figure 6—figure supplement 5</xref>(C)) and showed that when subtracting spontaneously activity STMs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s5">Figure 6—figure supplement 5</xref>(C)(ii)) from the spike triggered STM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s5">Figure 6—figure supplement 5</xref>(C)(i)) we obtain STMs that are very similar to the all-spike averages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s5">Figure 6—figure supplement 5</xref>(C)(iii)). This generally confirms that average based STMs are representative of a single cell’s contribution to ongoing cortical activity.</p><p>See amended text from Materials and methods:</p><p>“Cell Spiking Mode Determination. We implemented methodology previously described for defining main spiking modes (Sherman et al., 2006) (Figure 6.5, pg 236). […]We provide additional examples of this STM partitioning using other cortical and thalamic cells and also an example where we partitioned the STM distribution into 12 sub-networks but still recovered the all-spike average STM from each of the partitioned networks (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s5">Figure 6—figure supplement 5</xref>).”</p><p>See amended text from Results section:</p><p>“Our analysis indicates that averaging GCaMP cortical motifs from all spikes of a single cell produces converging STMs and STMTDs.

Notable differences include the neuronal specificity of the GCaMP imaging signals, as well relatively wider field of view and additional information concerning sub-cortical spiking neurons.</p><p><italic>2) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>. Authors are using single-spike events to calculate the STM. However, in GCaMP imaging, single spikes can produce only marginal response changes (</italic>Δ<italic>F/F). In addition, a single spike in a single neuron is unlikely to effectively activate all the post-synaptic neurons. Thus, it is possible that multiple-spike events (or bursts) can produce a more reliable STM. The authors could test this possibility by reanalyzing data and the results could be shown as in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C, D</xref>.</italic> </p><p>The reviewer raises an important point regarding the potential nuanced relationship between the pattern of cell firing and the efficacy in producing a reliable STM. The reviewer suggests that in the case of GCaMP imaging, individual spikes may not go readily detected. We reference papers which show that GCaMP6 can detect individual spikes in vivo (Chen et al., 2013). However, we feel we must clarify that our intention is not to imply a causal relationship between the unitary contributions of a single cell’s spiking activity to mesoscale cortical calcium activity or that our method requires the faithful detection of individual spikes. Instead, we interpret the single cell spiking activity as being correlated with the activation of these large cortical networks and likely acting in synchrony with other cells. However, the issue of averaged cell firing pattern diversity and its impact on STMs is important and explored in greater detail in our response to the Essential Revisions Comment #3.</p><p><italic>3) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>. Authors demonstrate that a conserved network motif emerges by averaging the spike-triggered maps. However, this is based on an assumption that a single spike is always linked to a single type of network motif. Is it possible that multiple motifs are linked to a single neuron and authors' approach is averaging out multiple types of motifs? Authors could, for example, try classification of the spike-triggered maps.</italic> </p><p><italic>The reviewer raises an excellent point and it is not our intention to imply that a single spike is always linked to a single type of network motif but rather that the average response yields a pattern consistent with these consensus maps. However, one of our principle conclusions is that numerous, diverse sub-networks of cortical activity patterns exist and can be linked with the activity of a single cell as illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplements 1</xref> to 5). The discussion of averaging and heterogeneity and our new analyses are described in detail in our response to the Essential Revisions Comment #3.</italic></p><p><italic>4) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>. Given the diversity of cell types (and projection patterns) within a defined brain region, it is possible that STM is diverse even within a defined cortical area. Did authors find such cases? (In fact, STMTD is diverse in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref> and 8.) It is also possible that neurons in different cortical layers show distinct STMs even within the same area. Throughout this manuscript, box plots or beeswarm plots may be more appropriate if they show non-normal distributions with rare examples.</italic> </p><p>As mentioned, given the strong agreement between seed pixel maps and single neuron spike-triggered maps in cortex, we do not expect a lot of averaged-STM diversity. In the original submitted manuscript we provided “contour” plot analysis and quantification of individual STM maps across laminar depth (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A and B</xref>). We found that they were largely super-imposed and somewhat invariant across cortical depth. In the revised manuscript, we better highlight these findings with new analyses where we illustrate the STMs generated by single unit activity, multi-unit activity, and LFP across laminar depths from cortical and subcortical recordings (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>).</p><p>Another consideration is that we insert the electrode using an angular tilt (45°) to achieve an approximately vertical penetration to the curved cortical surface such that the electrode is roughly recorded in the same functional cortical column. In the same functional column, the single neuron related functional maps may be more likely similar, even there are diverse cell types. We have also replaced the bar graph in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref> with a box plot.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic> </p><p><italic>[…] 1) The authors show that seed pixel correlation maps (SPMs) are better matched to cortical single-unit spike-triggered maps (STMs) than to thalamic STMs, and that thalamic STMs are generally more diverse than cortical (specifically barrel cortex) STMs. However, as suggested by the authors in the Discussion, this is likely due, at least in part, to greater diversity across thalamic recordings from neurons in a larger number of smaller thalamic nuclei (vs. more consistently from S1 barrel region of cortex, albeit across layers) vs. recordings in a single cortical area with a large magnification factor. Further, cortical neurons within S1 are highly correlated, likely more so that nearby neurons in thalamus, further ensuring strong correlation between the cortical spiking activity and the SPM maps (since the seed cortical pixel is likely highly correlated with the cortical single-unit recording), more so that would be likely be possible with most thalamic units). The other suggested explanations for these findings made by the authors in the Discussion are far more speculative, and many would be difficult to test. Further, little effort is made to relate specific thalamic recordings from specific areas to any specific cortical patterns (e.g. did lemniscal thalamic recordings have more similar STMs to SPMs vs non-lemniscal thalamic recordings?). Given that the correlation between cortical neurons and their neighbors is likely very different than the correlation between single thalamic neurons and their neighbors, it might be helpful to compute STMs for multiunit activity in cortex and in thalamus for a given electrode contact, and then subtract a scaled version of this STM from the single unit STM – that may put the cortical and thalamic analyses on more even footing (all the more true given data in Figure 3Diii). Similar analyses could be done for high-passed LFP or CSD recordings, allowing a better sense of the relationship between a single neuron's spike with network activity, vs. the correlated spiking of that neuron and many nearby neurons. This analysis may also reveal more spatially localized patterns (e.g. for barrel cortex recordings, it might reveal relatively more barrel-specific response profiles). Similarly, for cortical recordings, one could subtract STMs in superficial recordings from STMs with simultaneously recorded neurons in deep layers, thus removing the 'columnar' component of the correlation, and allowing evaluation of residual, layer-specific contributions.</italic> </p><p>Reviewer 3 is generally positive about the work and appreciates the linkage between wide-scale cortical activity and studies which have examined event-related activation using fMRI imaging.</p><p>The reviewer makes a number of good points, mostly about better examining the relationship between individual neurons and the ensemble brain activity.</p><p>1) The reviewer wonders about our interpretation of findings which compare diversity in cortical spike-triggered GCaMP maps for spike trains produced by cortical versus sub-cortical neuron groups. They acknowledge our discussion points, including diversity being attributed to the physical layout of the thalamus versus cortex and the ability to record from potentially more diverse neurons in the thalamus given the relatively smaller structure over which things are mapped. Accordingly, they suggest experiments to place subcortical thalamic neurons on more even footing with cortical neurons. These include making a spike-triggered single cortical neuron map in which multi-unit activity or LFP-triggered activity has been subtracted away. This would potentially allow the contributions of individual cortical neurons to be more easily seen.</p><p>This is a great suggestion and we have already done preliminary studies using single-channel MUA spiking (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">2</xref>). We also computed band-passed LFP triggered STMs for Delta (0.1-4Hz), Theta (4-8Hz) and Gamma (25-100Hz). LFP triggered STMs were computed using 60 second periods by multiplying the average LFP amplitude in each imaging time frame. Thus, imaging frames where the average LFP amplitude was large and positive contributed substantially to the STM, whereas frames where the average LFP values were closer to zero did not (negative LFP values were clipped). The findings for both cortical and subcortical recordings are that MUA triggered STMs are similar to single-unit STMs in cortex while LFP triggered STMs – representing mostly synaptic and some spiking activity, were substantially different from single cell and MUA triggered STMs and across different LFP frequency bands. However, it is important to note that LFP amplitude (or power-) -triggered maps have very low ΔF/F values, for example most have peak ΔF/F values &lt; 0.05% (whereas single-unit or MUA peaks are between 1%-5%). Nonetheless, cortical LFP triggered maps do reveal anatomically discrete maps (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>). However, while there appear to be some slight differences across layers, the differences do not appear to be substantial or systematic. It is likely that as LFP contains mostly synaptic and some spiking activity from within a region with radius of at least 250μm (Buzsaki et al., 2012) the STMs may represent average activity from larger neighbouring regions thus blurring the overall effect of local LFP activity.</p><p>In response to the reviewer’s suggestions that we subtract “a scaled version” of MUA based STM from single-unit STM, unfortunately the results appear largely as very noisy maps (i.e. maps with &lt;1% ΔF/F values that have no ROI specificity). This is due to the similarities between single-unit and MUA STMs before subtraction. However, we agree overall that this general direction could be pursued further in future work to determine whether the limit of the GCaMP temporal and spatial resolution allows for more nuanced single-unit STMs to be obtained by removing common baselines.</p><p>See amended text from Results section:</p><p>“We have also assessed other means of generating event triggered maps including MUA and LFP frequency bands. […] In contrast, in the case of GCaMP6 higher frequency components are closer to hemodynamic and other noise sources making analysis more challenging.”</p><p><italic>2) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref> is interesting in terms of differences between thalamic and cortical recordings, given the consistent net and prolonged suppression with thalamic STMs and net excitation with cortical STMs. While the authors mention Logothetis 2012 Nature, they don't mention that this Logothetis et al. paper (their <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>) shows hippocampal ripple-triggered excitation of most of cortex, and ripple-triggered suppression of most subcortical regions including thalamus. This could very well explain the effects seen in the current <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>, of net suppression in thalamic STMs (at most delays) and net activation for cortical STMs, as it provides evidence that cortical and thalamic neurons are likely anticorrelated during much of spontaneous activity (e.g. during ripple events). It would be worthwhile following this up – if most spontaneous cortical spiking is ripple-related and involved distributed, correlated cortical patterns, this could also partially explain why cortical STMs look more like SPMs than thalamic SPMs. This is a place where the true level and timecourse of activity would likely be different if STM analysis methods were used that didn't involve subtraction of GCaMP6 activity in the 3-s window prior to spike onset (see point 3c below).</italic> </p><p>We thank the reviewer for highlighting these findings from Logothetis et al. As we did not record simultaneously from the hippocampus we cannot definitely comment on the relationship between thalamic spiking activity and the observation of net cortical inhibition with respect to hippocampal ripples in our experiments. However, the data presented in Logothetis et al. are remarkable and consistent with this interpretation and we now more clearly discuss our observations in this interesting context in our revised Discussion.</p><p>See amended text in Discussion section:</p><p>“The approach is probably most analogous to event-triggered MRI imaging from the standpoint of larger spatial scale (Logothetis et al., 2012). […] However, as we did not record simultaneously from hippocampus we cannot definitively comment on whether these observations necessarily correspond to hippocampal ripple events.”</p><p>With respect to the specific comment of “the true level and time course” of activity, we have addressed this in greater detail in regard to the reviewer suggestion of implementing a running median subtraction in comment (3C).</p><p><italic>3) Several analysis choices make the findings difficult to interpret: (a) there is no correction for vascular effects despite analyses spanning several seconds surrounding the spike: it is surprising that no vascular responses are seen in STMs in the GFP control, please discuss. (b) the authors suggest using deconvolution of signals as a future direction, but this would seem to be highly useful to use in the present analyses in separating GCaMp6 dynamics from neural dynamics, given the emphasis, in part, on temporal resolution (relative to fMRI). Both points (a) and (b) are effectively addressed in a study that is in some ways quite similar, by Wekselblatt et al., J Neurophys June 2016 -- a paper that is not cited by the authors. In that paper, Wekselblatt et al. nicely show the use of stimulus-evoked widefield GCaMP6 mapping across an intermediate sized cranial window in mice, after deconvolution and removal of vascular signals.</italic> </p><p>The reviewer notes that there is no correction for potential vascular effects despite the signals spanning several seconds around the spike and it is surprising that we do not see vascular responses in the spike-triggered maps from GFP controls. We have more thoroughly addressed this point in our response to the Essential Revisions (comment 2) and now report new data using a normalization procedure in a new supplemental figure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1</xref>). In our characterization of this strategy, we have also done additional GFP mice. In no case do we see a clear reduction in baseline signal. Perhaps this is because spike-triggered maps are relatively discreet events and are not associated with global changes in activity which could potentially recruit hemodynamic responses. Another issue the reviewer brings up is the normalization of GCaMP signals to an average time window. We should note that in the spike-triggered average movies and images of temporal dynamics that we do indeed show imaged which reflect relative changes in ΔF over F during the preceding time. We have also attempted to implement the median subtraction approach.</p><p>The reviewer suggests a temporal deconvolution for signals to improve time resolution. We have now performed such an analysis and report these results (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>). While sharpening the kinetics for raw data the procedure does not significantly change maps and it was not applied to all data.</p><p><italic>(c) Another issue that is difficult to interpret is the normalization of GCaMP6 signal to a window of time prior to spike onset. Clearly this is throwing out a lot of useful information, and may distort much of the information that remains. An alternative approach might be to use a running median subtraction at each pixel, perhaps with removal of any slow drifts over long timescales, which would more effectively reveal what GCaMP6 activity is leading vs. lagging the spiking activity.</italic> </p><p>The reviewer suggests different methods for averaging calcium activity frames, in particular a “running median” method. We previously employed two different methods including a “global signal regression” method in which the baseline fluorescence is the mean of the entire ~5 minute recording stack. We also employed a low-band pass filtering method where the entire image stack was filtered at 0.1Hz-6Hz. The STMs provided by these methods appeared to be largely similar to the sliding window methodology likely because averaging over 3sec, 5 minutes or low-band pass filtering yield similar components in the calcium signal.</p><p>Slow drifts were very occasionally observed during recordings. However, in the initial manuscript, STA generated from random spike times, not carrying neuronal activity but still affected by slow drifts in the same manner, were used for correction (by subtraction, see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig13">Author response image 5</xref>). The use of running median gives the same results on slow drift but in contrast to random spike STA, a median window has to be determine and if inappropriately set, could remove important components such as depression. For this reason this normalization strategy, while otherwise elegant, was avoided.<fig id="fig13" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.19976.033</object-id><label>Author response image 5.</label><caption><title>Running median and random spike normalization.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) STA from real spikes (1<sup>st</sup> line), random spikes (2<sup>nd</sup> line) and real spikes after running median filtering (3<sup>rd</sup> line). 4<sup>th</sup> and 5<sup>th</sup> lines are subtractions of STA by random spikes and running median respectively.

However, post-spike depression (black arrow) at ∼1s was only preserved by using random spikes correction.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.19976.033">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.19976.033</ext-link></p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="x-tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-19976-resp-fig5-v2"/></fig></p><p><italic>(d) No discuss of the nature of the spiking activity is presented, yet burst firing (and thus, counting spikes with short ISI as similar to those with long ISI) may also distort the STMs.</italic> </p><p>We have now addressed the issue of the potential relationship of burst firing and STMs in our response to the Essential Revisions Comment #3.</p><p><italic>(e) The cortical delineation of areas is crude, and most secondary areas are not well delineated, making it difficult to assess whether any specific spatial resolution afforded by the technique actually yields insights at the level of specific higher cortical areas.</italic> </p><p>The reviewer would like to see better delineation of secondary cortical areas. Unfortunately, using a bilateral imaging window implant, we do not have optical access to most secondary somatosensory areas. We have replaced the figure panel in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref> with an enlarged and more clearly defined cortical reference atlas and updated table of regions-of-interest and abbreviations used to better elucidate our imaging perspective.</p><p>Regarding spatial resolution, we have revised the Methods section to include acknowledgement of the spatial resolution of our imaging and references to our previous work from which these measurements are described in detail.</p><p>See the amended text in Materials and methods:</p><p>“In order to reduce file size and minimize the power of excitation light used, we typically bin camera pixels (8 × 8) thus producing a resolution of 68 µm/pixel. These imaging parameters have been used previously for voltage sensitive dye imaging (Mohajerani et al., 2013) as well as anesthetized GCaMP3 imaging of spontaneous activity in mouse cortex (Vanni and Murphy, 2014) and awake GCaMP6 imaging in mouse cortex with chronic window (Silasi et al., 2016).”</p><p><italic>(f): While it is interesting and useful to see that STM patterns become similar after averaging &gt;128 or 256 trials (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>), most of the information in the dataset is lost in this averaging process. Do subsets of spike events share a common spike-triggered pattern, albeit one that is not present on the majority of spike events, and which might be washed out by this averaging?</italic> </p><p>We have now addressed the issue of heterogeneity of STMs and the use of averaging in our response to the Essential Revisions Comment #3.</p><p><italic>4) Description of the choice of epochs included in &quot;spontaneous activity&quot; is unclear. The authors do not seem to use body-tracking data that they collect and describe in Methods in order to segregate epochs of true spontaneous activity. The &quot;spontaneous activity&quot; may currently include sensory-evoked activity (i.e., internally generated spontaneous whisking), even though these behaviors were observed, as stated in &quot;Methods: Multimodal recording in awake mice.&quot;</italic> </p><p>We have now addressed the issue of the potential contribution of active behaviours in our response to the Essential Revisions Comment #4.</p><p><italic>5) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref> in interesting given the PCA patterns show differential connection with thalamic or cortical spiking, but no obvious effort was made to understand which cortical cells or thalamic cells fall into each pattern category (other than spike width analysis). What do spike autocorrelations look like? Sensory receptive fields? Layer in cortex? Location within specific thalamic nuclei? Without any such insights linking the findings to known entities, the value of this figure is somewhat low.</italic> </p><p>Our results presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref> indicate that single cortical and thalamic cells participate in ongoing contralateral barrel cortex activating/depressing dynamics that fall into 2 or 3 discrete groups, respectively. The reviewer’s question of whether this grouping correlates with other single cell properties or whether it may be a novel intrinsic single cell property is very interesting but we were not able to identify correlations given our available datasets. Our cell-type, i.e. inhibitory versus excitatory, classification did not show correlation between PCA clusters and cell type. Additionally, we did not carry out stimulus paradigms to allow us to compute receptive fields for our barrel cortex cells. However, we did not find a correlation between cortical layers and PCA clusters nor between VPM and VPL nuclei and specific PCA clusters. Lastly, we did not pursue spike autocorrelation analysis as it would require classification or grouping of autocorrelation results which would go beyond the scope of our work. We anticipate that further work with substantially larger numbers of single cells may better classify activation/depression dynamics and allow for the use of multiple ROIs (e.g. barrel, motor, retrosplenial). We agree that the alternative, i.e. that single cells may have intrinsic properties that bias them to participating in networks acting on substantially different temporal scales, is certainly a topic worth investigating further.</p><p>See amended text in Results section:</p><p>“This classification showed that ~80% cortical neurons were associated with a pure cortical excitation profile (pattern #1) and 20% triggered inhibition (pattern #2). […] We suggest future work with larger datasets and multiple cortical/subcortical areas could address the question of whether STMTD classification are a novel intrinsic single-cell property.”</p></body></sub-article></article>
