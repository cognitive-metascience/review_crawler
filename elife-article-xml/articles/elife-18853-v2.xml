More than 60 years ago, cristae were discovered as characteristic elements of mitochondria that harbor the protein complexes of oxidative phosphorylation, but how cristae are formed, remained an open question. Here we present experimental results obtained with yeast that support a novel hypothesis on the existence of two molecular pathways that lead to the generation of lamellar and tubular cristae. Formation of lamellar cristae depends on the mitochondrial fusion machinery through a pathway that is required also for homeostasis of mitochondria and mitochondrial DNA. Tubular cristae are formed via invaginations of the inner boundary membrane by a pathway independent of the fusion machinery. Dimerization of the F<sub>1</sub>F<sub>O</sub>-ATP synthase and the presence of the MICOS complex are necessary for both pathways. The proposed hypothesis is suggested to apply also to higher eukaryotes, since the key components are conserved in structure and function throughout evolution.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.18853.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.18853.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.18853.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Cells contain compartments called mitochondria, which are often called the powerhouses of the cell because they provide energy that drives vital cellular processes. Mitochondria have two membranes: an outer and an inner membrane. The outer membrane separates the mitochondria from the rest of the cell. The inner membrane is elaborately folded and the folds – called cristae – create a larger space to accommodate all of the protein machinery involved in producing energy. The cristae can be shaped as flat sac-like structures called lamellar cristae or as tubes known as tubular cristae.</p><p>Mitochondria are dynamic and are constantly fusing with other mitochondria and splitting up. Even though the internal architecture of mitochondria was first revealed around 60 years ago, it is still not clear how the cristae form. Harner et al. now address this question in yeast cells by combining imaging, biochemistry and genetic approaches.</p><p>The experiments show that lamellar cristae form when two mitochondria fuse with each other. The outer membranes merge and then the inner membranes start to fuse around their edges to generate the sac-like structure of lamellar cristae. A yeast protein called Mgm1 (known as Opa1 in mammals) drives the fusion of the inner membranes, but this process only takes place when enzymes called F<sub>1</sub>F<sub>O</sub>-ATP synthases on the inner membrane form pairs with one another. These F<sub>1</sub>F<sub>O</sub>-ATP synthase pairs stabilize the cristae membranes as they curve to form the sac-like structure. Later on, the formation of a group of proteins called the MICOS complex halts the fusion process to prevent the lamellar cristae from completely separating from the rest of the inner membrane.</p><p>Harner et al. also found that tubular cristae form using a different mechanism when the inner membrane of the mitochondria grows inwards. This process also requires pairs of F<sub>1</sub>F<sub>O</sub>-ATP synthases and the MICOS complex, but does not involve Mgm1/Opa1. Together, these findings show that lamellar and tubular cristae in yeast form using two different mechanisms. Since the key components of these mechanisms are also found in virtually all other eukaryotes, the findings of Harner et al. are also likely to apply to many other organisms including animals.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.18853.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.18853.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group

eukaryotic cell. They perform respiration-dependent energy transduction to generate proton-motive force and ATP, and house a large number of metabolic enzymes. They have their own genetic system but are closely connected with the rest of the cell by a number of pathways, such as metabolite, protein and lipid transport, protein quality control, autophagy and apoptosis. Light microscopy has revealed mitochondria as threadlike bodies that form three-dimensional networks. Mitochondria are dynamic organelles undergoing continual fission and fusion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bereiter-Hahn and Vöth, 1994</xref>). The dynamics of mitochondria is essential for their function as well as maintenance, inheritance and integrity of their DNA (mtDNA). Recent research has revealed the involvement of this organelle in a multitude of human pathological conditions, including neurodegeneration, cardiomyopathies, metabolic diseases and cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Chan, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Costa and Scorrano, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Itoh et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Mourier et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Nunnari and Suomalainen, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Pickrell and Youle, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Youle and van der Bliek, 2012</xref>).</p><p>Mitochondrial ultrastructure, also referred to as the mitochondrial architecture, is intimately linked to the function and homeostasis of this organelle, and has therefore been investigated in a large number of cell types, tissues and organisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Fawcett, 1981</xref>). There is a considerable diversity in mitochondrial architecture, but common basic structural elements can be recognized (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Mannella, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Perkins et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Sun et al., 2007</xref>). Mitochondria are delimited from the cytosol by the outer membrane (OM). The inner membrane (IM) is composed of the inner boundary membrane (IBM) and the crista membranes. The cristae are invaginations of the IM into the interior of the mitochondria (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). In most cases they form lamellae, but tubules are also observed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Fawcett, 1981</xref>). Crista junctions (CJs) join the cristae with the IBM. They represent small ring or slot like openings that connect the intermembrane space with the intracrista space. The IM encloses the matrix space. Cristae do not cross the matrix space completely, but they are closed by strongly bent crista rims. Septa completely cross the matrix space and separate it into distinct compartments. They are virtually absent in wild type (WT) cells, but are frequent in a variety of mutant cells. Continuous protein and lipid import leads to generation of curved septa which can be seen as onion-like structures in cross sections (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). Over the past 20 years a number of proteins have been identified which play key roles in mitochondrial function, dynamics and homeostasis. Still, our knowledge concerning the molecular mechanisms that determine the formation and maintenance of mitochondrial architecture is quite limited.<fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.18853.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Schematic representation of the ultrastructure of the mitochondria.</title><p>Upper panel, a wild type mitochondrion containing a crista. Lower left panel, a mitochondrion containing a septum.

With this as a guiding principle, we have addressed a central question of the molecular biology of mitochondria, the mechanisms of the biogenesis and maintenance of cristae. This question is open ever since the structural organization of mitochondria was discovered (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Palade, 1953</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Sjostrand and Hanzon, 1954</xref>).</p><p>Our approach has led us to an entirely novel hypothesis on the formation and homeostasis of cristae and CJs. Based on our results we present a model that postulates the existence of two different pathways of crista formation and is fully consistent with published data on mitochondrial structure, function and dynamics in yeast and mammalian cells. In the first pathway, two IBM sheets are converted into a single lamellar crista upon fusion of mitochondria. This process not only requires Mgm1, the dynamin-like fusion protein of the IM, but also the dimeric form of the F<sub>1</sub>F<sub>O</sub>-ATP synthase (F<sub>1</sub>F<sub>O</sub>) and the MICOS complex. Mgm1 appears to mediate fusion of the IM only when dimeric F<sub>1</sub>F<sub>O</sub> is available to stabilize bending of the newly formed crista membrane and to thereby generate crista rims. Assembly of the MICOS complex is proposed to limit the fusion process by forming a CJ. In the second pathway, crista formation is independent of Mgm1, but dependent on dimeric F<sub>1</sub>F<sub>O</sub> and MICOS. It entails formation of tubular cristae and not of lamellar cristae. Our results suggest a mechanism by which growth of membranes from the IBM, driven by the influx of newly synthesized proteins and lipids, creates these tubular cristae. Importantly, all proteins found to be involved in crista biogenesis are conserved from yeast to human, emphasizing the general importance of this process.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Mgm1 plays a direct role in cristae formation</title><p>The dynamin-related GTPase, Mgm1 (yeast)/Opa1 (higher eukaryotes), is essential for fusion of the mitochondrial IM. Its deletion in yeast leads to fragmentation of mitochondria and loss of respiration-dependent growth as well as of mtDNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Cipolat et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Jones and Fangman, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Meeusen et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Song et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Wong et al., 2000</xref>). Previous EM analyses showed an altered IM structure in ∆<italic>mgm1</italic> cells that includes the loss of cristae (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Sesaki et al., 2003</xref>). Consistent with these observations, quantitative EM of ∆<italic>mgm1</italic> cells revealed mitochondrial profiles that were mainly empty or contained one or a few septa. Vesicular and crista-like membranes were present only to a minor extent (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). Moreover, the levels of mitochondrial respiratory components were strongly reduced (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>).</p><p>These observations raised the possibility that Mgm1 is required for the formation of cristae. Cristae membranes accommodate the respiratory chain complexes which consist of both nuclear and mitochondria-encoded subunits. Thus, it is conceivable that loss of mtDNA first leads to the loss of respiratory chain complexes and then indirectly also to the loss of cristae. Alternatively, Mgm1 might be required for cristae formation, and in the absence of cristae mtDNA is not maintained. To discriminate between these two scenarios, we made use of the temperature sensitive <italic>mgm1-5</italic> mutant in which a shift to non-permissive temperature leads to the inactivation of the protein and concomitant fragmentation and alteration of mitochondrial ultrastructure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Meeusen et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Wong et al., 2000</xref>). We performed quantitative EM of WT and <italic>mgm1-5</italic> cells grown at 25°C, shifted to 37°C for 25 min, and back again to 25°C for 30 min. In WT cells almost only cristae were present and no significant changes were observed upon exposure to 37°C and return to 25°C (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A and B</xref>). In <italic>mgm1-5</italic> cells grown at 25°C, cristae made up about 70%; apparently the temperature sensitive mutant was leaky. Exposure to 37°C and thus inactivation of Mgm1 led to a drastic loss of cristae (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A and B</xref>). We expected that a time period of 25 min, which is much less than one generation time of yeast, would be too short to result in loss of mtDNA. Indeed, staining of mtDNA and test on respiratory competence revealed no loss of functional mtDNA upon exposure to 37°C for 25 min (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3</xref>). However, longer exposure (72 hr) of <italic>mgm1-5</italic> cells to non-permissive temperature led to inhibition of cell growth on respiratory medium (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3</xref>). Strikingly, upon return of the <italic>mgm1-5</italic> cells to 25°C for 30 min cristae reappeared and septa were reduced, comparable to the situation before incubation at non-permissive temperature (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A and B</xref>). Interestingly, mitochondrial respiratory complexes in both WT and mutant, as determined for Complex III and IV, remained intact during the temperature shifts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s4">Figure 2—figure supplement 4</xref>).<fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.18853.004</object-id><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Mgm1 controls mitochondrial ultrastructure.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Inactivation of Mgm1 leads to rapid loss, and reactivation to the rapid regeneration of cristae.

These results show that the disappearance and reappearance of cristae are rapid and depend on functional Mgm1. We conclude that the formation of lamellar and tubular cristae relies on two different pathways. Moreover, Mgm1 plays a direct role in the formation and maintenance of lamellar but not of tubular cristae.<media content-type="glencoe play-in-place height-250 width-310" id="media1" mime-subtype="mp4" mimetype="video" xlink:href="elife-18853-media1.mp4"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.18853.009</object-id><label>Video 1.</label><caption><title>3D reconstruction with modelling of a mitochondrion in wild type cells.</title><p>Grey, OM; green, IBM and cristae connected to the IBM; blue, tubular cristae without visible connection to the IBM.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.18853.009">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.18853.009</ext-link></p></caption></media><media content-type="glencoe play-in-place height-250 width-310" id="media2" mime-subtype="mp4" mimetype="video" xlink:href="elife-18853-media2.mp4"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.18853.010</object-id><label>Video 2.</label><caption><title>3D reconstruction with modelling of a mitochondrion in <italic>mgm1-5</italic> cells incubated for 25 min at 37°C.</title><p>Grey, OM; green, IBM and cristae connected to the IBM.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.18853.010">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.18853.010</ext-link></p></caption></media></p><p>To further study the role of Mgm1 in cristae formation we first explored where Mgm1 is exactly located in mitochondria. Quantitative immuno-EM revealed that the majority of Mgm1 was localized to the OM/IBM and only about one third to the matrix/crista space (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). Mgm1 is present in two isoforms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Shepard and Yaffe, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Wong et al., 2000</xref>). l-Mgm1 contains a transmembrane helix that anchors it to the IM; in contrast, s-Mgm1 lacks the transmembrane helix and was reported to be present at the IBM or OM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Sesaki et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Wong et al., 2000</xref>) and a short form of Opa1 was found to be co-localized with the OM fission machinery (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Anand et al., 2014</xref>). Importantly, both l-Mgm1 and s-Mgm1 forms are required for Mgm1 function in mitochondrial fusion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">DeVay et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Zick et al., 2009</xref>). To test where s-Mgm1 is located, we generated sub-mitochondrial vesicles by sonication and separated them by gradient density centrifugation. Remarkably, s-Mgm1 co-fractionated with the outer membrane marker Tom70, indicating that it is associated with the outer membrane (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). These data suggest that Mgm1 could interact with the OM in the course of IM fusion. Thus, as outlined below, it is possible that after fusion of the OM a septum is formed by IMs that are not yet fused, and that Mgm1 at IM/OM contact sites initiates the conversion of these septa membranes into a crista membrane by IM fusion.<fig id="fig3" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.18853.011</object-id><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>Mgm1 is present at the mitochondrial inner and outer membranes.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Distribution of Mgm1 between OM/IBM and cristae.

Deletion of Su e or Su g leads to the formation of membrane sheets that are crossing the matrix space completely and to onion-like structures. Examination of a large number of EM sections showed that these membrane sheets are not cristae as previously assumed, but septa. Onions represent cross sections of curved septa (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). This is also apparent upon tomographic reconstruction of isolated mitochondria from cells lacking dimeric F<sub>1</sub>F<sub>O</sub> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Davies et al., 2012</xref>). A fundamental difference between cristae and septa is that crista membranes are strongly bent to generate crista rims and thus the sac-like crista structure, whereas septa are not closed but divide the matrix into membrane-limited subcompartments. In spite of this drastic alteration of mitochondrial architecture, growth is only moderately retarded under respiratory conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Paumard et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Rabl et al., 2009</xref>). It is presently unknown how and when during crista formation this bending is taking place. We localized fully assembled F<sub>1</sub>F<sub>O</sub> by detection of its subunit F<sub>1</sub>β and found it almost exclusively in the crista membranes of WT mitochondria (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). In the Su e deletion mutant, however, the fraction of monomeric F<sub>1</sub>F<sub>O</sub> detected in the IBM was increased by a factor of three in comparison to WT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). This observation is compatible with the assumption that the distribution of F<sub>1</sub>F<sub>O</sub> in cristae and IBM correlates with its oligomeric state. Similar to F<sub>1</sub>β, Su e was present in crista membranes of WT mitochondria (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>). Very low levels of F<sub>1</sub>β, monomeric F<sub>1</sub>F<sub>O</sub> and unassembled Su e may exist in the IBM into which new components are continually being inserted, but dimeric F<sub>1</sub>F<sub>O</sub> is present almost exclusively in cristae and does not assemble in the planar IBM. Thus, the assembly of dimeric F<sub>1</sub>F<sub>O</sub> is likely to take place during the formation of cristae when the bending of membranes has to occur.<fig id="fig4" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.18853.012</object-id><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><title>Localization and dimerization of F<sub>1</sub>F<sub>O</sub> are relevant to mitochondrial architecture.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Distribution of F<sub>1</sub>F<sub>O</sub> between IBM and cristae in WT cells.

Since CJs are essential elements of cristae, we asked whether MICOS has a function in the formation of cristae. A so far unanswered question is whether the cristae in WT and the stacked membranes in the Δ<italic>mic60</italic> mutant differ in their functions. The protein composition of these mitochondria is very similar to that of WT cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Harner et al., 2014</xref>).

To analyze whether there is a difference in the distribution of IM proteins in the stacked membranes in the ∆<italic>mic60</italic> mutant as compared to WT cristae, we examined the distribution of F<sub>1</sub>β and the cytochrome c oxidase subunit Cox5a by immuno-EM. F<sub>1</sub>β was found almost exclusively in the IM stacks of ∆<italic>mic60</italic> mitochondria as in WT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>). Likewise, the distribution of Cox5a between the IBM and the cristae in WT cells and between IBM and the internal membranes in the ∆<italic>mic60</italic> mutant was almost identical (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>). The fact that the distribution of these two proteins is not changed in mitochondria of ∆<italic>mic60</italic> cells suggests that CJs are not required for assembly of protein complexes in the mitochondria and integration into crista membranes.

Its deletion leads to the formation of a highly branched and interconnected mitochondrial network (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bleazard et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Otsuga et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Smirnova et al., 1998</xref>). Loss of Mgm1 in cells depleted of Dnm1 does not lead to loss of cristae (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Sesaki et al., 2003</xref>). This surprising observation appeared to contradict our suggestion that Mgm1 is directly required for crista formation and maintenance. To resolve this apparent discrepancy, we first analyzed the ultrastructure of mitochondria in the ∆<italic>dnm1</italic> mutant. We observed that mitochondrial architecture differed significantly from that in WT. These mitochondria are considerably enlarged, densely filled with vesicular profiles and short tubular cristae, while CJs are abundant along the IBM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>). In comparison to WT, the number of cristae with lamellar structure was found to be much lower as highlighted by electron tomography. 3D reconstruction revealed that the vesicular profiles mostly represent interconnected highly convoluted and branched tubular structures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>; <xref ref-type="other" rid="media3">Video 3</xref>). These tubules seem to have the ability to fuse and to branch. Interestingly, we identified tubular cristae also in WT cells by tomography, albeit much less frequently (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>; <xref ref-type="other" rid="media1">Video 1</xref>). Normal levels of components of OXPHOS as well as assembled MICOS and dimeric F<sub>1</sub>F<sub>O</sub> were present in these mitochondria (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C and D</xref>). Notably, the level of the assembled MICOS complex in the ∆<italic>dnm1</italic> mutant was significantly increased. This is consistent with the higher number of cristae and CJs in this mutant. The necessity for the accommodation of OXPHOS and other membrane proteins likely requires an increase of the number of cristae since the surface area of tubular cristae compared to lamellar cristae is much lower. In summary, we reasoned that the mitochondrial network is in an almost completely fused state in the absence of Dnm1, and thus the rate of fusion is strongly decreased. The diminished Mgm1 activity might then result in a drastically reduced formation of lamellar cristae and massive production of tubular cristae.<fig id="fig6" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.18853.014</object-id><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><title>Structure and protein composition of cristae in cells deficient in Dnm1.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Ultrastructure and quantitative evaluation of mitochondria in Δ<italic>dnm1</italic> cells grown on YPG (scale bars, 0.2 µm).

Indeed, we observed mitochondria with numerous tubular cristae (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1</xref>), supporting the idea that tubular cristae are the predominant type in the absence of fusion activity. However, this phenotype was observed to a much lesser degree than in the △<italic>dnm1</italic>△<italic>mgm1</italic> mutant. Strikingly, △<italic>dnm1</italic>△<italic>fzo1</italic> cells quite frequently contained constricted mitochondria and mitochondria with septa (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1</xref>). Since it has been repeatedly suggested that a separate Dnm1-independent fission mechanism exists for the IM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Gorsich and Shaw, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Ishihara et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Westermann, 2010</xref>), we consider it possible that these structures represent division events of the IM in the absence of OM fusion. This could then provide Mgm1 with suitable inner membrane structures for the formation of lamellar cristae and explain why the cristae phenotype of △<italic>dnm1</italic>△<italic>fzo1</italic> is less severe than that of △<italic>dnm1</italic>△<italic>mgm1.</italic> Together, these observations suggest that mitochondrial fusion is important for generating crista structure.</p><p>We further investigated the mitochondria in the ∆<italic>dnm1</italic>∆<italic>mic60</italic> mutant; they displayed a virtually complete absence of cristae and CJs. Vesicular-tubular profiles, often located close to the IBM and associated with sheet-like membrane structures, were present in the interior of the mitochondria. Tomographic reconstructions revealed a rather corrugated and perforated appearance, in contrast to the planar structure of WT lamellar cristae. Therefore, these membranes are most likely formed by association of extended tubules, which partly fuse with each other (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7F</xref>; <xref ref-type="other" rid="media5">Video 5</xref>). Interestingly, in contrast to the Δ<italic>dnm1</italic>Δ<italic>mgm1</italic> mutant, growth of Δ<italic>dnm1</italic>Δ<italic>mic60</italic> cells was very slow on respiratory medium (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>) and the rate of mtDNA loss was higher in this mutant, indicating that in the absence of fully functional Mgm1, MICOS and thereby CJs and tubular cristae contribute to maintenance of mtDNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>). The steady state levels of the mitochondrial proteins analyzed were similar to those in Δ<italic>dnm1</italic> cells. MICOS components were an exception, as they were reduced to different degrees. This was, however, also observed with the △<italic>mic10</italic> or △<italic>mic60</italic> single deletion mutants. The level of Cox2, a mitochondrial gene product, was also reduced (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref>). We suggest that in Δ<italic>dnm1</italic>Δ<italic>mic60</italic> mutant, in contrast to the Δ<italic>mic60</italic> single mutant in which lamellar cristae can be made, the proteins and lipids imported into the mitochondria invaginate the IBM.

Furthermore, the drastically altered membrane structures present in cells lacking Dnm1 and at the same time MICOS core components or Su e cannot substitute for lamellar and tubular cristae to maintain mtDNA and respiratory growth.</p></sec><sec id="s2-6"><title>Discussion</title><p>Major advances have been made in our understanding of the biogenesis of mitochondrial protein complexes and supercomplexes, but the biogenesis of mitochondrial architecture, the next higher level of organization, has been investigated to a much lesser degree. In particular, organization and formation of the cristae are poorly understood. We report here on novel and basic insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying the formation of lamellar and of tubular cristae, and the key factors involved in these pathways.</p><p>Three factors have decisive functions in the biogenesis of cristae: Mgm1, the dimeric F<sub>1</sub>F<sub>O</sub>-ATP synthase, and the MICOS complex. Based on our findings and the literature about these three factors and their interactors, we developed a hypothesis that postulates the existence of two distinct mechanisms for the generation of lamellar and tubular cristae. Regarding the formation of lamellar cristae, a first important issue is how Mgm1 performs fusion of the mitochondrial IM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8A</xref>). It is known that dysfunction of the components that mediate mitochondrial membrane fusion, Fzo1, Ugo1, and Mgm1, leads to loss of mtDNA and loss of cristae, concomitant with septa formation and inhibition of IM fusion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Hermann et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Hoppins et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Meeusen et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Sesaki et al., 2003</xref>). It was shown that Fzo1 in the OM interacts with the IM, and Mgm1 in the inner membrane interacts physically with Fzo1 and Ugo1 in the OM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Fritz et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Sesaki et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Wong et al., 2003</xref>). Both l-Mgm1 anchored in the IM and s-Mgm1 bound to the OM are required for fusion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">DeVay et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Zick et al., 2009</xref>). These observations suggest a mechanism by which progression of IM fusion takes place at sites where IM and OM are in close contact (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8A</xref>). Fusion of the OM by Fzo1 would first generate a mitochondrion with a planar septum consisting of non-fused IM. Tethering of these two IMs by Mgm1 could take place at the IM surface in contact with the OM. According to our hypothesis, the fusion of the IM is then initiated by Mgm1 and proceeds along the IM-OM contacts, thereby generating a membrane sac protruding into the matrix. Shifting the temperature sensitive <italic>mgm1-5</italic> mutant to non-permissive temperature leads to rapid fragmentation of mitochondria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Meeusen et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Wong et al., 2000</xref>). Quantitative EM analysis of this process reveals that, in addition to fragmentation, a rapid and extensive loss of cristae takes place, while septa are formed. These findings strongly suggest that the activity of Mgm1 not only is required for fusion but also for maintenance of cristae. Importantly, cristae are rapidly regenerated upon reactivation of Mgm1. Equally important, mtDNA is retained during inactivation of Mgm1 and remains functional. Thus, it is not the loss of mtDNA that causes loss of cristae and formation of septa, emphasizing a role of Mgm1 in crista maintenance.<fig id="fig8" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.18853.020</object-id><label>Figure 8.</label><caption><title>Model of the formation of cristae by the fusion dependent and independent pathways.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Formation of lamellar cristae by the fusion dependent pathway.

The fusion rate of mitochondria in wild type cells has been measured by live cell microscopy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Jakobs et al., 2003</xref>). Under steady-state conditions at least one fusion and one fission event was observed per minute and cell. This rate is apparently determined by regulatory processes that ensure a balance of fusion and fission. In contrast, fusion of the IM in <italic>mgm1-5</italic> mutant cells by reactivation of Mgm1 is likely to reflect an entirely different situation. Here, the conversion of a septum to a crista requires only the time of IM fusion by Mgm1 which upon its reactivation is immediately ready to function. The overall process of mitochondrial fusion requires a multitude of steps, including fusion of the OM. Fusion of the IM likely represents one of the fastest steps. Notably in this context, fusion intermediates have not been identified convincingly in intact cells. These conclusions are in good agreement with observations that acute ablation of Opa1 in mouse embryonic fibroblasts leads to disorganized cristae and reduced respiratory function, but maintenance of mtDNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Cogliati et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>The conversion of two membranes into a single one by Mgm1 entails the necessity to bend the membrane. Very interestingly, recent experiments with reconstituted vesicles have revealed that Mgm1 mediates membrane bending (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Rujiviphat et al., 2015</xref>). Bending of crista membranes takes place only when the F<sub>1</sub>F<sub>O</sub>-ATP synthase can dimerize (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Davies et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Rabl et al., 2009</xref>). Therefore, it is reasonable to assume that bending of crista membranes takes place concurrently with the fusion process, and dimeric F<sub>1</sub>F<sub>O</sub>-ATP synthase is required to stabilize the bending of the membrane. Importantly, according to our model, in the absence of Su e, a dimerization component of the F<sub>1</sub>F<sub>O</sub>-ATP synthase, fusion of IM by Mgm1 cannot take place. Rather, OM fusion still occurs in the absence of IM fusion and septa are generated. The continual import of proteins and lipids then leads to expansion of the septa membranes. This expansion may cause the curved structures of septa that in EM sections appear as onion-like profiles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>).</p><p>Our hypothesis proposes that fusion of IM is halted by the assembly of MICOS complexes, leading to the generation of a CJ and thereby represents the final step in the formation of lamellar cristae (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8A</xref>). In agreement with this speculation, we found that the MICOS component Mic10 is preferentially located at sites where septa merge with the IMS, the septum junctions. Our hypothesis does not exclude a stabilizing function of MICOS for cristae. Since membrane proteins and protein complexes can shuttle between cristae and the IBM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Vogel et al., 2006</xref>), it seems likely that a major reason for crista stability is the continued presence and activity of Mgm1. In addition, our hypothesis provides a rational explanation for the generation of the stacked closed membrane sheets lacking connection with the IBM that are formed in the absence of functional MICOS complex. In the absence of the MICOS core components, Mic60 and Mic10, fusion proceeds as in WT cells, but cannot be halted (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8A</xref>). Interestingly, a very similar mechanism was suggested for the fusion of vacuoles, the yeast homolog of lysosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Wickner, 2010</xref>). Upon fusion of vacuoles an internal vesicle is generated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Wang et al., 2002</xref>). It might well be that these vesicles are generated like the internal stacks in Mic10 or Mic60 deletion mutants. According to our hypothesis, during fusion septa membranes and the nascent crista membrane form a continuum. This allows free distribution of proteins between the IBM and the nascent crista membrane. This would also explain the similarity of the composition of intramitochondrial membrane sheets, made in the absence of MICOS, to crista membranes as well as their full functionality in mediating OXPHOS.</p><p>After completion of fusion and formation of CJs, cristae may grow by uptake of newly synthesized proteins, along with assembly of subunits of the F<sub>1</sub>F<sub>O</sub>-ATP synthase, which extend the crista rims. Thus, our hypothesis also offers an explanation of how the characteristic shape of lamellar cristae is generated and how cristae can expand.</p><p>Our results also suggest the existence of a second pathway of crista biogenesis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8B</xref>). In this pathway, import of newly synthesized proteins and lipids into the IBM and passage through CJs leads to the formation of tubular cristae. Assembly of CJs can take place since a pool of MICOS subunits is present in the IBM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Harner et al., 2011</xref>). Interestingly, oligomeric forms of the MICOS subunit Mic10 can induce membrane curvature in vitro and were suggested to form CJs in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Barbot et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Bohnert et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Milenkovic and Larsson, 2015</xref>). We propose that the shape of CJs formed by the MICOS complex determines the tubular shape of nascent cristae. Dimerization of F<sub>1</sub>F<sub>O</sub> would stabilize bending of the tubular cristae, very much like it stabilizes the rims of lamellar cristae. Interestingly, regular helical zipper-like structures of presumably dimeric F<sub>1</sub>F<sub>O</sub> were observed at the surface of the tubular cristae of the protist <italic>Paramecium multimicronucleatum</italic> by scanning EM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Allen et al., 1989</xref>). Remarkably, in the absence of both Dnm1 and functional MICOS, tubules are formed. We suggest that they are generated by the continual influx of proteins and lipids and shaped by dimeric F<sub>1</sub>F<sub>O</sub>. Since CJs are not formed, these tubules are rather unstable, having a high tendency to fuse and to generate bizarre corrugated networks, and are not functional in OXPHOS and maintenance of mtDNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8C</xref>). This points to a correlation between presence of cristae and mtDNA. In fact, mtDNA, condensed in nucleoids, was reported to be bound to crista membranes, possibly to crista rims (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Kopek et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Kukat and Larsson, 2013</xref>).</p><p>This second pathway of crista biogenesis suggested in our hypothesis becomes apparent when fission is compromised. In this situation, the mitochondrial network is virtually completely fused and Mgm1-dependent fusion activity should be drastically reduced. The lack of requirement of Mgm1 in this pathway provides a rational explanation for the most surprising observation that Mgm1 can be deleted in the Dnm1 deletion background without loss of cristae. Residual formation of lamellar cristae in the absence of Dnm1 can be explained by residual fusion and fission activity of mitochondria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Gorsich and Shaw, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Ishihara et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Westermann, 2010</xref>). The virtually complete lack of lamellar cristae in cells deficient in both Dnm1 and Mgm1 further supports this assumption. Most interestingly, a study on the role of Opa1 in mitochondrial cristae remodeling showed that mitochondria isolated from mouse embryonic fibroblasts lacking functional Opa1 lacked lamellar cristae; instead, these mitochondria contained short tubular-type cristae (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Frezza et al., 2006</xref>). These observations are not only in very good agreement with our conclusions on a direct role of Mgm1 in crista formation, but also point to the conservation of its role in crista biogenesis in mammalian cells.</p><p>Can both pathways of crista biogenesis coexist? This is clearly the case in yeast, as we observed lamellar and, to a lower extent, tubular cristae in WT cells. Inspection of a large number of published EM images of mitochondria from different cell types reveals a bias to lamellar vs. tubular cristae. For example, lamellar cristae dominate in pancreatic cells and hepatocytes, whereas in steroidogenic cells tubular cristae are the principle architectural feature. A mixed situation prevails in certain types of muscle cells where both lamellar and tubular profiles can be recognized (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Blinzinger et al., 1965</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Fawcett, 1981</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Hanaki et al., 1985</xref>). Tomographic reconstruction is the optimal approach to determine precisely the distribution of these two types of cristae. Such a study has been performed with cerebellar neuronal cells and revealed lamellar and tubular cristae that are regularly connected by sites of fusion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Perkins et al., 1997</xref>). Furthermore, the differentiation of isolated zona glomerulosa cells of rat adrenal cortex triggered by treatment with adrenocorticotropic hormone leads to a drastic change of the corticoid hormones synthesized and to a concomitant transformation of the crista structure from mainly “lamellar-tubular” to “tubular-convolute” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Andreis et al., 1990</xref>). Interestingly, steroidogenesis in human trophoblasts was reported to be dependent on the activity of Opa1. During developmental induction of the steroidogenic pathway, Opa1 levels decreased and steroid formation increased. Manipulations of cells to increase Opa1 levels led to decreased efficiency of steroidogenesis. At the same time, crista structure was observed to be remodeled (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Wasilewski et al., 2012</xref>). Altogether, many basic questions need to be answered, including how mitochondrial architecture is modulated in response to metabolic and developmental requirements, how the state of cellular differentiation affects mitochondrial ultrastructure and why specific crista structures are necessary for specific cellular functions.</p><p>In conclusion, our investigation of the determinants of mitochondrial architecture has led us to an entirely novel concept of pathways of mitochondrial biogenesis. Since the identified key players are highly conserved from yeast to human, our study has immediate relevance for the relationship of structure and function of mammalian mitochondria of different tissues under normal and dysfunctional conditions. Finally, our results emphasize that understanding inheritance and homeostasis of mitochondria requires an integrated view on their three-dimensional architecture and the molecular topological functions of the various key players involved.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s3-1"><title>Yeast strains and growth conditions</title><p><italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> strains YPH499 or W303 were used as wild type (WT).

Mitochondria are cellular organelles with a characteristic shape and inner architecture. The most fascinating ultrastructural feature of mitochondria is the presence of numerous, heterogeneously shaped invaginations of the inner membrane that are the main sites of oxidative phosphorylation in eukaryotic cells and have been termed cristae membranes. Cristae are considered to represent a specialized micro-compartment within mitochondria that is ideally suited to support ATP synthesis by chemiosmotic coupling. Surprisingly, very little is known about the mechanisms of cristae biogenesis. It has been shown that dimerization and oligomerization of ATP synthase complexes and the MICOS complex that connects cristae membranes to the peripheral inner membrane regions are critical for normal cristae morphology and function. But a comprehensive and conclusive model how differently shaped cristae are formed has been lacking.</p><p>Harner et al. developed a very elegant hypothesis to explain the formation of different types of cristae. The authors classified the cristae into lamellar cristae and tubular cristae and then analyzed those different crista structures in various yeast deletion and temperature-sensitive mutants by EM. They found that lamellar cristae are formed by Mgm1, which mediates inner membrane fusion, in cooperation with the MICOS complex, the crista junction forming machinery, and the ATPase dimer, which forms highly bended crista rims. On the other hand, they found that tubular cristae are formed by the MICOS complex and ATPase dimer, but not by Mgm1. They proposed a new model on how the IM fusion by Mgm1 leads to lamellar cristae together with the MICOS complex and ATPase dimer. This overall conclusive hypothesis is consistent with earlier studies on mitochondrial morphology and dynamics and several key points are supported by new experimental data. The cornerstones of this model are: 1) Tubular and lamellar cristae are formed via different mechanisms. 2) Both pathways require the dimerization of ATP synthase and the MICOS machinery. 3) Tubular cristae are formed by triggering inner membrane invaginations, probably at MICOS complexes, that grow through vectorial transport of proteins and lipids into the emerging tubule. 4) Formation of lamellar cristae additionally requires the inner membrane fusion activity of Mgm1/OPA1. 5) The inner membrane fusion activity of Mgm1 is limited to sites of mitochondrial outer and inner membrane contacts. 6) Therefore, inner membrane fusion events leave behind double membrane sheets derived from the original sites of inner membrane tethering that finally become lamellar cristae. 7) Membrane bending at the rims of these new-born lamellar cristae is stabilized by dimerization and oligomerization of ATP synthase complexes. 8) Mgm1-mediated inner membrane fusion is stopped at the position of inner membrane MICOS complexes leading to the formation of crista junctions. In this way the MICOS complex prevents the complete detachment of the inner membrane fusion septum from the peripheral inner membrane.</p><p>The experiments were conducted carefully and the experimental quality is very high. The findings reported in this manuscript provide an important basis for future studies on the mechanism of formation and regulation of the complex mitochondrial membrane architecture.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The data presented in this study clearly support: (i) the direct involvement of Mgm1 activity in cristae formation; (ii) the origin of the internal membrane stacks observed in MICOS-deficient mutants from cristae-like structures, and (iii) the strong prevalence of tubular cristae in mitochondria with reduced Mgm1 activity, like in Dnm1-deficient cells. These are important new findings that were possible mainly by the elegant combination of yeast mutants and advanced electron cryo-tomography technology. Although very thoughtful, elegant and consistent with the available literature, the further proposals on the mechanisms of cristae formation remain hypothetical. The hypothetical nature of the suggested model should be emphasized in the paper, including title and abstract. The manuscript should be rewritten to clearly state that the authors present a novel hypothesis that is based in important parts on the data shown, but you may also choose to point out which future studies will be interesting to address various aspects of the hypothesis.</p><p>2) The finding that the loss of cristae upon transient inactivation of Mgm1 can be reversed rapidly (within a time period of 25 min) is novel and very interesting. What is the possible mechanism of such a quick disappearance of cristae without degradation of respiratory chain complexes or ATPases upon shift to 37°C? Similarly, Mgm1-mediated crista re-formation should depend on mitochondrial fusion, but such fusion may not be that frequent after temperature down-shift to 25°C. An explanation of this point is required.</p><p>Since 25 min is much less than one generation time in yeast, this result implies a very high turnover of cristae membranes also in healthy cells. Is there evidence for such a phenomenon? Since the respiratory competence of the cells is maintained, what happens to the respiratory chain complexes when cristae disappear? What is the morphology of the remaining cristae in the mgm1 conditional mutant after the short heat shock? Finally, when the mgm1 conditional mutant is shifted back to 25°C after the short heat shock, cristae re-appear. Is the overall morphology of the mitochondrial network also restored?</p><p>It should be discussed if Mgm1 may affect inner membrane morphology independently of its role in inner membrane fusion. A novel function of Mgm1 in cristae biogenesis may also proceed via inner membrane fusion in the absence of outer membrane fusion; thus, lamellar cristae may arise via Mgm1-mediated lateral fusion of tubular cristae. Is there a requirement for outer membrane fusion in the generation of lamellar cristae? What is known about cristae architecture in a double deletion of Dnm1 and Fzo1?</p><p>3) Since the observation of crista structures requires EM analyses, it is difficult to follow the process of cristae formation at a high time-resolution. Therefore most of the data except for <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> are the consequences of steady-state depletion of the components (Dnm1, Mic60, Su e etc.) involved in mitochondrial structural dynamics, with the risk of possible secondary effects. On the other hand, the authors showed that cristae formation and disappearance are rather rapid processes that takes place within 25 min in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>. Thus, temperature-sensitive mutants or promoter shut-off of those components could be used to minimize the possibility of secondary effects arising from the steady-state depletion. This may be beyond the scope of the present work, but these points should be discussed and where possible complemented by experimental findings.</p><p>4) The authors argue that dimeric ATP synthase, which generates membrane curvature, as well as MICOS, which stabilizes crista junctions, are required for the generation of both types of cristae. It should be discussed that MICOS mutants lack crista junctions, yet do contain cristae-like lamellar inner membrane compartments, as the authors also demonstrate. Moreover, they show that dnm1-δ mic60-δ mitochondria contain tubular as well as lamellar internal membranes. Thus, MICOS or at least Mic60 may not be strictly required for cristae biogenesis, but for crista junction maintenance.</p><p>ATP synthase dimers are evidently required for the biogenesis of tubular cristae. The authors suggest that septated inner membranes may arise upon fusion of the outer membrane that is not followed by inner membrane fusion due to lack of membrane curvature. This hypothesis is exciting. A su e-δ fzo1-ts strain would be interesting here. The authors report that the levels of assembled MICOS complexes are reduced in the absence of Su e and thus ATP synthase dimerization, but increased in the absence of Dnm1. Many different forms and subcomplexes of MICOS have been suggested, which raises the question, what is the nature of the molecular species detected with Mic27 antibodies in native gels western blots? Does MICOS dissociate into the recently demonstrated Mic10- and Mic60-containing subcomplexes in Su e-deficient mitochondria? Why does Dnm1 depletion enhance the level of the assembled MICOS complex? The authors reasoned that the decreased Dnm1 activity results in reduced formation of lamellar cristae, but why do tubular cristae structures increase?</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were requested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for resubmitting your work entitled &quot;An evidence-based hypothesis on the homeostasis of mitochondrial architecture&quot; for further consideration at <italic>eLife</italic>.

These are important new findings that were possible mainly by the elegant combination of yeast mutants and advanced electron cryo-tomography technology. Although very thoughtful, elegant and consistent with the available literature, the further proposals on the mechanisms of cristae formation remain hypothetical. The hypothetical nature of the suggested model should be emphasized in the paper, including title and abstract. The manuscript should be rewritten to clearly state that the authors present a novel hypothesis that is based in important parts on the data shown, but you may also choose to point out which future studies will be interesting to address various aspects of the hypothesis.</italic></p><p>According to the advice by the referees we have rewritten Title, Abstract, Introduction, Results and Discussion to point out that we present a hypothesis based on our results. We also have added several sentences to the end of the Discussion to point out at least a few of the numerous new aspects that are opened by our study.</p><p><italic>2) The finding that the loss of cristae upon transient inactivation of Mgm1 can be reversed rapidly (within a time period of 25 min) is novel and very interesting. What is the possible mechanism of such a quick disappearance of cristae without degradation of respiratory chain complexes or ATPases upon shift to 37°C? Similarly, Mgm1-mediated crista re-formation should depend on mitochondrial fusion, but such fusion may not be that frequent after temperature down-shift to 25°C. An explanation of this point is required.</italic></p><p>The rate of mitochondrial fusion in yeast, as defined by the number of fusion events per min and cell, has been determined to be about 1 event or higher. The fusion events measured in this way comprise quite a number of steps including establishing contact with another mitochondrion, fusion of the outer membrane, all complex reactions. The situation in the experiment addressed here is very different since the OM is fused and the reactivated Mgm1 is ready for immediately starting fusion of two aligned membranes. In fact, the experiment suggested by one of the referees, the analysis of the mitochondrial morphology in <italic>mgm1-5</italic> cells upon temperature shifts, points also in this direction (see also further down). Cristae reappear faster than the mitochondrial network. This indicates, that reactivated Mgm1 does use the septa formed at non-permissive temperature to make new cristae. Therefore, in this special situation the generation of cristae seems to be independent of an outer membrane fusion event. We have now explained this in more detail in the Discussion section (third paragraph).</p><p>It would certainly be very interesting to try to measure the various step times, but this is practically impossible in view of the lack of the necessary tools. However, we have commented on this in the revised manuscript to clarify the situation.</p><p><italic>Since 25 min is much less than one generation time in yeast, this result implies a very high turnover of cristae membranes also in healthy cells. Is there evidence for such a phenomenon? Since the respiratory competence of the cells is maintained, what happens to the respiratory chain complexes when cristae disappear? What is the morphology of the remaining cristae in the mgm1 conditional mutant after the short heat shock? Finally, when the mgm1 conditional mutant is shifted back to 25°C after the short heat shock, cristae re-appear. Is the overall morphology of the mitochondrial network also restored?</italic></p><p>A) We have analyzed the assembly state of Complex III of the respiratory chain by BNGE. Complex III of <italic>mgm1-5</italic> incubated at 37°C cannot be distinguished from that of the mutant grown at 25°C nor from that of wild type. Please find the respective data in the text (subsection “Mgm1 plays a direct role in cristae formation”, second paragraph) and in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s4">Figure 2—figure supplement 4</xref>.</p><p>B) We performed a tomographic analysis and most interestingly found that the remaining cristae in the <italic>mgm1-5</italic> mutant after exposure to 37°C are tubular. This further strongly supports our hypothesis that lamellar cristae are formed by Mgm1 mediated inner membrane fusion. These data are now added to the manuscript (subsection “Mgm1 plays a direct role in cristae formation”, fourth paragraph and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>). In addition, we provide two further videos (<xref ref-type="other" rid="media2">Video 2</xref>).</p><p>C) We determined the morphology of the mitochondria during the whole temperature shift experiment showing fragmentation and reformation of the mitochondrial network after return to 25°C. We provide these data in the third paragraph of subsection “Mgm1 plays a direct role in cristae formation” and in the new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>.</p><p><italic>It should be discussed if Mgm1 may affect inner membrane morphology independently of its role in inner membrane fusion. A novel function of Mgm1 in cristae biogenesis may also proceed via inner membrane fusion in the absence of outer membrane fusion; thus, lamellar cristae may arise via Mgm1-mediated lateral fusion of tubular cristae. Is there a requirement for outer membrane fusion in the generation of lamellar cristae? What is known about cristae architecture in a double deletion of Dnm1 and Fzo1?</italic></p><p>A) The referee is right in pointing out that one cannot rule out an additional role of Mgm1. We also do not rule out that lamellar or tubular cristae can fuse to a certain extent. We would, however, exclude a role of Mgm1 in lateral fusion of tubular cristae to form lamellar cristae. This is because all major domains of Mgm1 that are required for fusion activity are located on the inside of tubular cristae and therefore would have the wrong topology for being able to catalyze fusion.</p><p>B) The shift and backshift experiments with <italic>mgm1-5</italic> show that fusion of septa occurs when the outer membrane is fused. In the situation when two mitochondria fuse, initially the outer membrane must fuse.</p><p>C) We have generated the △<italic>dnm1</italic> △<italic>fzo1</italic> double deletion strain and analyzed the cristae in this mutant. These experiments are now included in the Results section (subsection “Mitochondrial fusion/fission dynamics contributes to the formation of lamellar cristae”, second paragraph; and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement <underline>1</underline></xref>). In short, they show that also in this mutant tubular crista are formed, but not to the same extent as in the △<italic>dnm1</italic> △<italic>mgm1</italic> double mutant, which is explained by Dnm1 independent IM fission in the absence of Fzo1.</p><p><italic>3) Since the observation of crista structures requires EM analyses, it is difficult to follow the process of cristae formation at a high time-resolution. Therefore most of the data except for <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> are the consequences of steady-state depletion of the components (Dnm1, Mic60, Su e etc.) involved in mitochondrial structural dynamics, with the risk of possible secondary effects. On the other hand, the authors showed that cristae formation and disappearance are rather rapid processes that takes place within 25 min in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>. Thus, temperature-sensitive mutants or promoter shut-off of those components could be used to minimize the possibility of secondary effects arising from the steady-state depletion. This may be beyond the scope of the present work, but these points should be discussed and where possible complemented by experimental findings.</italic></p><p>Yes, we agree, steady state depletion of components is not without the risk of secondary effects. We agree also that more ts-mutants would be desirable. Promoter shutoff would certainly also be useful. We will certainly aim for obtaining more ts-mutants in particular mutants of subunits of F<sub>1</sub>F<sub>O</sub>–ATP synthase required for dimerization and of MICOS components. On the other hand, such mutants are often leaky and can pose problems of other kinds.</p><p><italic>4) The authors argue that dimeric ATP synthase, which generates membrane curvature, as well as MICOS, which stabilizes crista junctions, are required for the generation of both types of cristae. It should be discussed that MICOS mutants lack crista junctions, yet do contain cristae-like lamellar inner membrane compartments, as the authors also demonstrate. Moreover, they show that dnm1-δ mic60-δ mitochondria contain tubular as well as lamellar internal membranes. Thus, MICOS or at least Mic60 may not be strictly required for cristae biogenesis, but for crista junction maintenance.</italic> </p><p>A) This is an important and interesting point. Indeed, the internal membranes in the Mic60 and Mic10 deletion mutants are very much like normal cristae. We consider it as strength of our hypothesis that we can explain for the first time, how these membranes are made and that they are able to perform OXPHOS and other crista functions. According to the advice of the referee we have extended the Discussion to make this issue very clear (fifth paragraph).</p><p>B) The tubular membrane structures in dnm1-δ mic60-δ mitochondria that accumulate and have the tendency to fuse or break into vesicles are quite weird. We explain this by the lack of crista junctions which do not form regular tubular cristae but simply deliver the incoming proteins and lipids into the mitochondrial interior, because the inner boundary membrane cannot be expanded. We believe that such membranes must have a tendency to fuse like lipid vesicles in contrast to the well-organized normal membrane structures. Indeed, these cells grow extremely poorly, lose mitochondrial DNA and die rapidly. We believe that they cannot be used to argue about the behavior of normal mitochondrial membranes.</p><p><italic>ATP synthase dimers are evidently required for the biogenesis of tubular cristae. The authors suggest that septated inner membranes may arise upon fusion of the outer membrane that is not followed by inner membrane fusion due to lack of membrane curvature. This hypothesis is exciting. A su e-δ fzo1-ts strain would be interesting here. The authors report that the levels of assembled MICOS complexes are reduced in the absence of Su e and thus ATP synthase dimerization, but increased in the absence of Dnm1. Many different forms and subcomplexes of MICOS have been suggested, which raises the question, what is the nature of the molecular species detected with Mic27 antibodies in native gels western blots? Does MICOS dissociate into the recently demonstrated Mic10- and Mic60-containing subcomplexes in Su e-deficient mitochondria? Why does Dnm1 depletion enhance the level of the assembled MICOS complex? The authors reasoned that the decreased Dnm1 activity results in reduced formation of lamellar cristae, but why do tubular cristae structures increase?</italic></p><p>A) Su e is epistatic over the other key components discussed here. Deletion of Su e always leads to mitochondria with septa or onion-like mitochondria. Therefore, we have not made this mutant.</p><p>B) We have no experimental evidence that MICOS dissociates into distinct subcomplexes. However, we cannot rule this out. It might be possible that these subcomplexes are not detectable with our antibodies. We analyzed the molecular composition of the Mic27 containing complex in the Su e deletion strain and found no difference as compared to WT. The question about the role of MICOS subcomplexes in MICOS assembly is certainly very interesting question and it would be worthwhile to follow it in a detailed investigation in view of the results of Bohnert et al., 2015; Friedman et al., 2015; Zerbes et al., 2016. We believe that this would require a separate extensive study.</p><p>C) We observe that the number of crista junctions increase markedly in the <italic>∆dnm1</italic> and in the <italic>∆dnm1∆mgm1</italic> deletion mutants. We interpret this by the necessity of these mitochondria to accommodate their OXPHOS and other components. The surface area generated by lamellar cristae is clearly much higher than by a tubule when related to a crista junction. We are mentioning this now in the text (subsection “Mitochondria lacking Dnm1 show altered crista structure”).</p></body></sub-article></article>
