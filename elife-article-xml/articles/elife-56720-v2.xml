Disease characteristics include epidermal hyperplasia, infiltration of leukocytes in the dermis and erythema (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Dainichi et al., 2018</xref>). Long-term activation of the immune system in the skin can also lead to tissue damage in other organs, and psoriasis is generally regarded as a systemic disease. Consequently, numerous comorbidities, including psoriatic arthritis, inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and cardiovascular disease, are associated with psoriasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Greb et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>Genome-wide association studies have revealed over 60 loci that contribute to the development of psoriasis. These include candidate genes involved in skin barrier function and the immune response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Liang et al., 2017a</xref>). It is thought that many low risk genetic variants together with environmental factors increase the predisposition of individuals to psoriasis development. Psoriasis vulgaris (PV), the most common form, is characterised by stable erythematous scaly plaques, predominantly located on knees and elbows, in which the adaptive immune system predominates. In contrast, generalised pustular psoriasis (GPP), a very rare form of the disease that is characterised by widespread diffuse skin inflammation and sub-corneal pustules (Munro’s microabscesses and spongiform pustules of Kogoj), involves massive infiltration of neutrophils in the skin. GPP patients also experience acute exacerbations (flare ups) involving development of new skin lesions which can cover &gt;70% of the body surface, fever, cheilitis (scaling and superficial ulceration of the lips), diarrhoea and dehydration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Ly et al., 2019</xref>). GPP exacerbations, which often meet the criteria for systemic inflammatory response syndrome, involve neutrophil infiltration in multiple organs, are difficult to treat and associated with significant morbidity and mortality (3–7%) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Gooderham et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>Gain-of-function, highly penetrant (&gt;90%) and dominantly acting mutations within the <italic>CARD14</italic> gene can trigger the development of PV or GPP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Jordan et al., 2012b</xref>). CARD14 (CARMA2) is a member of the CARMA family of scaffolding proteins that includes CARD11 (CARMA1) and CARD10 (CARMA3) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Lu et al., 2019</xref>). Each of these proteins has a similar domain structure, comprising an N-terminal CARD domain, followed by a coiled-coil (CC) domain, and a C-terminal MAGUK domain (PDZ-SH3-GUK). CARD11 and CARD10 play critical roles in the activation of NF-κB transcription factors following ligation of antigen receptors and G-protein-coupled receptors, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Lu et al., 2019</xref>). NF-κB, composed of dimers of Rel polypeptides, regulates gene expression by binding to κB elements in the promoters and enhancers of multiple target genes that control immune and inflammatory responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Zhang et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>The structural similarity to CARD11 and CARD10 suggests a role for CARD14 in NF-κB activation. Consistent with this, the highly penetrant <italic>CARD14</italic><sup>E138A</sup> psoriasis-associated mutation, first identified as a sporadic mutation in a child suffering from GPP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Jordan et al., 2012b</xref>), induces CARD14 interaction with BCL10 (B cell lymphoma protein 10) and the paracaspase MALT1 (mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue lymphoma translocation protein 1) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Howes et al., 2016</xref>). This complex triggers activation of the IκB kinase (IKK) complex, the central activator of NF-κB transcription factors, leading to constitutive activation of NF-κB and expression of pro-inflammatory cytokine/chemokine genes in keratinocytes in the absence of exogenous stimulation.</p><p>Recent studies have investigated how psoriasis-associated <italic>CARD14</italic> mutations induce skin inflammation by generating knock-in mice expressing the mouse equivalent CARD14 variants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Mellett et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Sundberg et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Wang et al., 2018</xref>). These mice develop psoriasiform skin inflammation that is partially dependent on the cytokines IL-17A and IL-23, which play important roles in human psoriasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Greb et al., 2016</xref>). Although these studies have confirmed the importance of CARD14 mutations in inducing skin inflammation, the constitutive nature of the knock-in mutations generated have precluded detailed study of disease pathogenesis. Furthermore, the constitutive <italic>CARD14</italic><sup>E138A</sup> mutation is associated with embryonic or peri-natal lethality, preventing analysis of disease in adult skin. To circumvent these limitations, we generated a new knock-in mouse allele <italic>Card14</italic><sup>LSL-E138A</sup> that allows conditional expression of the human <italic>CARD14</italic><sup>E138A</sup> mutation in the homologous mouse locus following tamoxifen injection. The inducible nature of this mutation allowed us to study the direct effects of CARD14<sup>E138A</sup> signalling, rather than potentially indirect secondary or tertiary consequences of constitutively expressed CARD14<sup>E138A</sup>. Tamoxifen-induced expression of <italic>Card14</italic><sup>E138A</sup> in adult mice also ruled out any developmental effects of CARD14<sup>E138A</sup> signalling on skin inflammation.</p><p>We present evidence that conditional heterozygous expression of CARD14<sup>E138A</sup> in adult mice rapidly promoted psoriasiform skin inflammation, which was independent of adaptive immune cells and due to signalling in keratinocytes. However, homozygous expression of CARD14<sup>E138A</sup> induced rapid weight loss, temperature reduction and extensive neutrophil infiltration in multiple organs. This severe systemic phenotype resulted from CARD14<sup>E138A</sup> signalling in keratinocytes and showed striking similarities to an acute flare of GPP in human patients. Heterozygous and homozygous phenotypes were both ameliorated by antibody neutralisation of tumour necrosis factor (TNF). Our findings suggest that specific blockade of the CARD14 signalling pathway in keratinocytes would inhibit the systemic inflammatory syndrome that can develop in GPP patients with activating CARD14 mutations.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>Human and mouse CARD14 proteins are highly homologous, with 77% amino acid identity overall and 80% identity in the coiled-coil region in which the <italic>CARD14</italic><sup>E138A</sup> mutation is located (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>). To study how CARD14<sup>E138A</sup> mutation induces skin inflammation, we developed a conditional knock-in mouse strain, <italic>Card14<sup>LSL-E138A/LSL-E138A</sup></italic>, in which a floxed minigene (exons 4–22) encoding wild type (WT) C-terminus of CARD14 linked to a 3xFLAG tag was inserted between exons 3 and 4 of the <italic>Card14</italic> locus and an E138A point mutation was introduced into endogenous <italic>Card14</italic> exon 5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref>).

The middle and lower back skin of the heterozygous mice was largely clear of visible scaling, although areas of skin that were easily accessible to the mice (upper back and beneath the chin) often presented fine scales. In contrast, large areas of back skin in the homozygous mice, including sections less easy to scratch, were covered in fine scales (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1A</xref>).

Although homozygous mice appeared emaciated and dehydrated, the stomachs were full of food and much enlarged. The livers of the homozygous mice often appeared unusually pale. Histological examination of the ear and lower back skin revealed a similar extent of acanthosis present in heterozygous and homozygous mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>).

Tamoxifen induction of CARD14<sup>E138A</sup> in heterozygous <italic>Card14</italic><sup>LSL-E138A/+</sup><italic>Rosa26</italic><sup>CreERT2</sup> mice induced skin inflammation phenotypically similar to psoriasis, while homozygous <italic>Card14</italic><sup>LSL-E138A/LSL-E138A</sup> <italic>Rosa26</italic><sup>CreERT2/+</sup> mice developed skin inflammation and a severe systemic disease. Both phenotypes were driven by CARD14<sup>E138A</sup> signalling in keratinocytes and dependent on TNF.</p><p>Earlier immunohistochemical studies showed that CARD14 protein was expressed in the basal layer in human skin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Jordan et al., 2012b</xref>). In contrast, our analyses of mouse skin found that CARD14 was expressed at low levels in undifferentiated keratinocytes, and its expression increased with differentiation both at the RNA and protein level. These results suggest that the localisation of CARD14 expression differs between mouse and human skin. However, the present study also found that CARD14 protein expression increased in human keratinocytes differentiated in vitro. Furthermore, a similar trend was found in publicly available RNA sequencing datasets in which human keratinocytes were differentiated in vitro (GSE73305) and in organotypic epidermal tissue (GSE52954). It will be important to determine whether CARD14 protein levels similarly increase as keratinocytes differentiate in human skin. Nevertheless, regardless of apparent differences in CARD14 distribution between mouse and human, the predominant localisation of CARD14 in the skin is consistent with a function in sensing harmful stimuli, such as pathogens, at the interface between the organism and the environment.</p><p>Psoriasis-associated <italic>CARD14</italic> mutations are not linked with inflammatory gut phenotypes, although CARD14 is also expressed at high levels in the gastro-intestinal tract in humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Fuchs-Telem et al., 2012</xref>).

Consistent with this, tamoxifen induction of CARD14<sup>E138A</sup> in <italic>Card14</italic><sup>LSL-E138A/+</sup><italic>Rosa26</italic><sup>CreERT2</sup> mice promotes the expression of pro-inflammatory genes and recruitment of S100A9<sup>+</sup> myeloid cells in the colon. However, CARD14<sup>E138A</sup> expression in the colon was not sufficient to cause any gut tissue damage. These results are similar to the effects of expressing a constitutively active IKK2 mutant in IECs in IKK2[EE]<sup>IEC</sup> mice, which also induces expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines in the gut and inflammatory cell infiltration without causing overt tissue damage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Guma et al., 2011</xref>). IKK2[EE]<sup>IEC</sup> mice, however, develop destructive acute inflammation, with intestinal barrier disruption and bacterial translocation following dextran sulfate sodium (DSS) or lipopolysaccharide (LPS) administration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Guma et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Vlantis et al., 2011</xref>).

Alternatively, psoriasis can be an active severe disease with extensive body surface coverage, involving elevated levels of cytokines and inflammatory markers in the blood and systemic inflammation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Christophers and van de Kerkhof, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Schön, 2019</xref>). This is mainly driven by cells of the innate immune system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Liang et al., 2017a</xref>). Acute induction of CARD14<sup>E138A</sup> in <italic>Card14</italic><sup>LSL-E138A/+</sup><italic>Rosa26</italic><sup>CreERT2/+</sup> mice induced widespread skin lesions in back skin and ears that lacked defined borders. This primarily involved infiltration of innate immune cells into the skin and did not require adaptive immune cells. Prolonged CARD14<sup>E138A</sup> signalling in <italic>Card14</italic><sup>LSL-E138A/+</sup><italic>Rosa26</italic><sup>CreERT2/+</sup> mice promoted the development of clearly delineated plaques on the ears with reduced acanthosis in back skin, suggesting less severe skin disease overall. These changes correlated with decreased skin expression of pro-inflammatory genes, decreased serum levels of key pro-inflammatory cytokines and more extensive infiltration of T cells into the skin. Acute expression of CARD14<sup>E138A</sup> in <italic>Card14</italic><sup>LSL-E138A/+</sup><italic>Rosa26</italic><sup>CreERT2</sup> and <italic>Card14</italic><sup>LSL-E138A/LSL-E138A</sup> <italic>Rosa26</italic><sup>CreERT2/+</sup> mice, therefore, appeared to model aspects of active psoriasis. In contrast, chronic CARD14<sup>E138A</sup> signalling in <italic>Card14</italic><sup>LSL-E138A/+</sup><italic>Rosa26</italic><sup>CreERT2</sup> mice resulted in a phenotype more similar to mild, stable disease in psoriatic patients. Further research using this model will help to elucidate what factors mediate the transition from acute to chronic lesion.</p><p>The fold changes of the majority of proinflammatory genes analyzed at d5 in <italic>Card14</italic><sup>LSL-E138A/+</sup><italic>Krt14</italic><sup>CreERT2/+</sup> with respect to controls were lower than the fold changes of the <italic>Card14</italic><sup>LSL-E138A/+</sup><italic>Rosa26</italic><sup>CreERT2/+</sup> mice. The <italic>Krt14</italic><sup>CreERT2</sup> driver can induce ‘leaky’ expression of Cre (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Vasioukhin et al., 1999</xref>) consistent with some <italic>Card14</italic><sup>E138A/+</sup> <italic>Krt14</italic><sup>CreERT2/+</sup> mice presenting with an inflammatory skin phenotype without tamoxifen injection. Although such mice were excluded from our analyses, it is possible that low concentrations of active Cre in uninduced mice resulted in the expression of limiting amounts of CARD14<sup>E138A</sup> which chronically activated NF-κB without promoting overt skin inflammation. This may have reduced the fold changes after tamoxifen injection due to negative feedback regulation as seen at 1 m post-tamoxifen injection in <italic>Card14</italic><sup>LSL-E138A/+</sup> <italic>Rosa26</italic><sup>CreERT2/+</sup> mice. It is also possible that reduced tamoxifen-induction of skin gene expression in <italic>Card14</italic><sup>E138A/+</sup> <italic>Krt14</italic><sup>CreERT2/+</sup> mice was due to differences to different expression levels of Cre protein between the two Cre-drivers, which use distinct promoters. Regardless, the induced genes were the same in both Cre drivers and the phenotype of both het and hom mice in the <italic>Krt14</italic><sup>CreERT2/+</sup> background was similar to the <italic>Rosa26</italic><sup>CreERT2/+</sup> histologically and systemically demonstrating that CARD14<sup>E138A</sup> signalling in keratinocytes alone is sufficient to induce skin and systemic inflammation.</p><p>Earlier studies have described the phenotypes of knock-in mice constitutively expressing activated CARD14 variants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Mellett et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Sundberg et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Wang et al., 2018</xref>). Heterozygous <italic>Card14</italic><sup>ΔE138/+</sup>, <italic>Card14</italic><sup>E138A/+</sup> and C<italic>ard14</italic><sup>ΔQ136/+</sup> mice develop skin inflammation similar to heterozygous <italic>Card14</italic><sup>LSL-E138A/+</sup><italic>Rosa26</italic><sup>CreERT2/+</sup> mice following tamoxifen induction. In both <italic>Card14</italic><sup>ΔE138/+</sup> and C<italic>ard14</italic><sup>ΔQ136/+</sup>mice, blocking the IL-17A/IL-23 axis ameliorates skin inflammation. Anti-IL-17A also reduced the acanthosis that develops in the back skin of <italic>Card14</italic><sup>LSL-E138A/+</sup><italic>Rosa26</italic><sup>CreERT2/+</sup> mice 5d after tamoxifen induction, but did not reduce acanthosis in ears or profoundly alter expression of pro-inflammatory genes. Acute induction of skin inflammation by CARD14<sup>E138A</sup>, therefore, is relatively independent of IL-17A and rather driven by overproduction of TNF by keratinocytes. Furthermore, inducible expression of CARD14<sup>E138A</sup> promoted the acute and chronic development of skin inflammation independently of adaptive immune cells (and T cell production of IL-17A). It will be important to test whether anti-TNF treatment could prevent chronic skin inflammation induced by CARD14<sup>E138A</sup>.</p><p>The absence of a requirement for adaptive immune cells for the development of skin inflammation in <italic>Card14</italic><sup>LSL-E138A/+</sup><italic>Rosa26</italic><sup>CreERT2/+</sup> mice contrasts with a published study by Wang et al. where the inflammatory skin phenotype in mice constitutively expressing CARD14<sup>ΔQ136</sup> was reduced by RAG1 deficiency. However, our data resemble other murine models of skin inflammation originating from constitutive signalling in keratinocytes where the absence of adaptive immune cells does not ameliorate skin disease and can even exacerbate it (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Leite Dantas et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Uluçkan et al., 2019</xref>). Accordingly, in the absence of Tregs, innate immune cells play a more significant role in the imiquimod-induced psoriasis-like skin pathology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Hartwig et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Stockenhuber et al., 2018</xref>). C<italic>ard14</italic><sup>ΔQ136/+</sup> mice only displayed a histopathologic phenotype in tail skin, but not ear skin. It is possible that the adaptive immune system plays different roles in these different anatomical regions. Alternatively, the inflammatory skin phenotype that develops in C<italic>ard14</italic><sup>ΔQ136/+</sup> mice may involve developmental alterations that occur in utero that require adaptive immune cells.</p><p>Systemic disease was not described in mice constitutively expressing the CARD14<sup>E138A</sup> variants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Mellett et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Sundberg et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Wang et al., 2018</xref>), with all analyses focusing only on inflammatory skin phenotypes . However, heterozygous <italic>Card14</italic><sup>E138A/+</sup> mice have reduced survival after birth, while <italic>Card14</italic><sup>ΔE138A/ΔE138A</sup> mice die in utero or shortly following birth. It is possible that variant CARD14 signalling during early life induces a severe, systemic disease in these strains that decreases survival. In addition, in utero expression of variant CARD14 could mean that, by the time of analysis of surviving adult mice, the disease state may have already developed from severe/active to mild/stable. In line with this, the inflammatory back skin phenotype, which coincided with severe disease in <italic>Card14</italic><sup>LSL-E138A/LSL-E138A</sup> <italic>Rosa26</italic><sup>CreERT2/+</sup> mice, was not evident in constitutive <italic>Card14</italic><sup>ΔQ136/+</sup> mice, and only briefly detected (between 5 and 7 days of age) in constitutive <italic>Card14</italic><sup>ΔE138A/+</sup> mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Wang et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>Our analyses of <italic>Card14</italic><sup>LSL-E138A/+</sup><italic>Rosa26</italic><sup>CreERT2</sup> mice and <italic>Card14</italic> <sup>LSL-E138A/ LSL-E138A</sup> <italic>Rosa26</italic><sup>CreERT2/+</sup> mice revealed a <italic>Card14<sup>E138A</sup></italic> gene dosage effect, with increased CARD14<sup>E138A</sup> expression inducing a more severe acute phenotype. This presumably explains why <italic>CARD14</italic> psoriasis-associated mutations are generally heterozygous. Weaker NF-κB activating variants, such as <italic>CARD14</italic><sup>G117S</sup>, have been found in their homozygous forms in children with severe psoriasis suggesting that the overall level of NF-κB activation is important (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Craiglow et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Israel and Mellett, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Sugiura et al., 2015</xref>).

These included skin disease that covered the majority of the body surface and hypothermia, the mouse equivalent of human fever (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Gordon, 2005</xref>). The extensive scaling of mutant mouse lips also appeared to resemble cheilitis, a common manifestation of GPP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Ly et al., 2019</xref>). Although pustules were not macroscopically visible (perhaps reflecting differences between human and mouse skin), histological analysis revealed extensive pustule formation within the epidermis and stratum corneum following CARD14<sup>E138A</sup> expression. <italic>Card14</italic><sup>LSL-E138A/LSL-E138A</sup> <italic>Rosa26</italic><sup>CreERT2/+</sup> mice also presented with myeloid cell infiltration in multiple vital organs and evidence of multi-organ dysfunction, similar to patients with GPP.

The present study indicates that constitutive CARD14<sup>E138A</sup> activation of NF-κB in keratinocytes is sufficient to promote skin inflammation and systemic inflammatory disease. This raises the possibility that it may be feasible to develop topical medicines that block CARD14 signalling in the skin to treat CARD14-induced psoriasis and systemic inflammation.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th>Reagent type <break/>(species) or <break/>resource</th><th>Designation</th><th>Source or <break/>reference</th><th>Identifiers</th><th>Additional <break/>information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Genetic Reagent (<italic>M. musculus</italic>)</td><td><italic>Card14</italic><sup>LSL-E138A</sup></td><td>Taconic</td><td>MGI:6111507</td><td>Mice were bred into the C57BL6/J background for &gt; 8 generations by the Ley lab.

Tails were cut longitudinally and bone removed. After cutting into 3 segments, the pieces were floated in cold 5 mg/ml Dispase (Thermo Fisher, 17105–041) for 4 hr at 4°C. The epidermis was then separated with forceps, and washed in cold PBS twice. Epidermis was floated in TrypLE select (Thermo fisher, 12563011) for 10 min at 37°C to detach the keratinocytes. After TrypLE incubation, epidermis was further minced with forceps and aspirated through a pipette 20 times. The suspended keratinocytes were then transfered into a 50 ml falcon with a filter on the top (100 µm) and centrifuged to pellet the cells. Keratinocytes were cultured in 7 µg/ml Collagen 1 coated plates (Thermo Fisher, A1048301) with CNT-57 medium for 2 days and then changed to CNT-02 for 5d (CELLnTEC, Bern, Switzerland). The medium was changed every second day. Normal human epidermal keratinocytes (NHEK) were purchased from Lonza and cultured in CNT-57 medium.</p><p>For differentiation studies, cells were seeded in six-well plates (Thermo Fisher) and grown to pre-confluence, then 2 mM CaCl<sub>2</sub> was added and lysates were obtained at the indicated culture times.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Histopathology and immunohistochemistry</title><p>Excised Tissues were fixed in 10% neutral buffered formalin for 48 hr at RT, then stored in 70% ethanol. Tissues were embedded in paraffin and sections (5 μm) were stained with hematoxylin and eosin (H and E). Pictures were taken with a Nikon Eclipse 90i microscope. For acanthosis (epidermal thickness) quantification, 3 measurements from the basement membrane to the stratum corneum were taken for each 10x magnification picture using Image J (NIH, Bethesda). For each mouse, 3 pictures were taken.</p><p>For immunohistochemistry, tissue sections were dewaxed three times in xylene for 1 min. Slides were then immersed in a series of decreasing concentrations of ethanol (1 min incubations) ending with distilled water. Heat-mediated antigen retrieval was conducted for Ki67 (Abcam ab16667) and Involucrin (in house) staining. Briefly, slides were immersed in a preheated solution of pH 6 Citrate buffer and further heated for 15 min in a microwave. For S100A9 (2b10 clone; in house) staining, antigen retrieval involved incubation of slides in 0.1% Trypsin solution for 15 min at 37°C. After antigen retrieval, endogenous peroxidases were blocked in 1.6% H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> in PBS for 10 min followed by distilled water for 5 min. The corresponding normal serum diluted to 10% in 1%BSA/PBS was applied for 10 min, at RT. After blocking, anti-KI67 (1/350), anti-involucrin (1/800), anti-S100A9 (1/1000) or anti-Endomucin (Santa Cruz, sc-65495 1/400) was added to slides, which were incubated overnight at 4°C. Antibody excess was washed from slides by three PBS immersions. The corresponding HRP-linked secondary antibody was applied for 45 min at RT and then washed 3x with PBS. Avidin-biotin complex solution was applied for 30 min at RT and washed 3x with PBS. DAB solution was used to develop the signal and the reaction terminated with distilled water. To count dermal infiltrating cells (S100A9) or epidermal Ki67+ cells, three pictures per sample were randomly taken at 10x magnification, the number of infiltrating cells or Ki67<sup>+</sup> cells were counted and the average between the three pictures calculated.</p><p>For <italic>Card14</italic> mRNA detection in tissue, RNAscope Probe - Mm-Card14 Cat No 476041 was used following manufacturer’s instructions (ACDBio). For <italic>Tnfa</italic> mRNA detection in tissue, RNAscope Probe- Mm-TNFa Cat No. 311081 was used. For localisation of <italic>Tnfa</italic> with different cell types, the following antibodies were used: CK5 (Abcam, ab52635 at 1/6000) for keratinocytes; CD3 (Abcam, ab134096 at 1/750) for T cells and Ly6g (BD Pharmigen, 551459 at 1/500) for neutrophils. RNAscope staining was performed first, followed by IHC. Bound antibodies were visualised using Blue chromogen (Vector, SK-5300) for 3–15 min at RT.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Protein lysates and western blot</title><p>Mouse tissues were lysed in radioimmunoprecipitation assay (RIPA) buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl, 2 mM EDTA, 1 mM sodium pyrophosphate, 50 mM sodium fluoride, 1 mM sodium vanadate, 0.1% SDS, 1% Triton-X, 0.5% deoxycholate and protease inhibitor cocktail (Roche 11836170001)). Protein levels were quantified (Pierce BCA protein assay, Thermo Scientific) and normalised. Lysates were boiled in Laemmli buffer, resolved by SDS-PAGE and transfered to a PVDF membrane (Trans-Blot Turbo Transfer Packs, Biorad). Membranes were blocked for 1 hr at RT with 5% skimmed milk and incubated with anti-FLAG M2 (Sigma F1804); or anti-Hsp90 (Santa Cruz; sc-7947).

in humans, a mutation has been found in the CARD14 molecule. In the present paper, a murine model with this mutation <italic>Card14</italic><sup>E138A</sup> was developed. The study shows that induced expression of this mutant in the skin drives a psoriasis phenotype in mice. An important finding is that neutralization of TNFα is more effective than neutralization of IL-17A, at least in the acute phase. In addition, the investigations suggest that anti-inflammatory therapies that target CARD14 signaling in keratinocytes, rather than systemic biologicals, might be an effective treatment early in disease progression.</p><p><bold>Decision letter after peer review:</bold></p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;CARD14<sup>E138A</sup> signalling in keratinocytes induces TNF-dependent skin and systemic inflammation&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, including Carla V Rothlin as the Reviewing Editor and Reviewer #1, and the evaluation has been overseen by Jos van der Meer as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Ellen Vandenbogaard (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>We would like to draw your attention to changes in our revision policy that we have made in response to COVID-19 (https://elifesciences.org/articles/57162). Specifically, when editors judge that a submitted work as a whole belongs in <italic>eLife</italic> but that some conclusions require a modest amount of additional new data, as they do with your paper, we are asking that the manuscript be revised to either limit claims to those supported by data in hand, or to explicitly state that the relevant conclusions require additional supporting data.</p><p>Our expectation is that the authors will eventually carry out the additional experiments and report on how they affect the relevant conclusions either in a preprint on bioRxiv or medRxiv, or if appropriate, as a Research Advance in <italic>eLife</italic>, either of which would be linked to the original paper.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>The authors developed and characterized an inducible murine model for <italic>Card14</italic><sup>E138A</sup>, a psoriasis-associated mutation in humans. Importantly, this approach enables them to report that induced expression of this mutant in the skin is sufficient for driving a psoriasis phenotype in mice. They also find that neutralization of TNFα provides a more effective therapeutic effect than neutralization of IL-17A, at least in the acute phase. The authors also generated homozygous mutant mice, which display more severe systemic effects, demonstrating a clear gene dosage effect for this mutation. The study is of significant relevance to the field, well-designed and robustly performed. Below we outline a series of revisions to strengthen or clarify the authors' conclusions.</p><p>Revisions for this paper:</p><p>1) The authors have modeled a human mutation into the mouse <italic>Card14</italic> gene. Can the authors add a comparison on the murine gene and the human ortholog in terms of their homology?</p><p>2) The authors defined the expression of CARD14 through western blot and RNAscope approaches. The results are in line with previously published murine data, as well as with single cell sequencing data from the Kaspar lab (http://kasperlab.org/mouseskin). However, the results seem to be in contrast to protein expression profiles reported in human skin, in which CARD14 protein is mostly found in basal cells (of note: Figure 1B also shows signal in basal cells). This requires a thorough analysis or at least a discussion on the differences between mice and human and potential consequences for disease mechanisms.</p><p>3) Throughout the manuscript, the authors link their results to 'psoriasis' (e.g. disease markers, therapeutic response). However, the investigated CARD14 mutation is related to GPP, not (or to a lesser extent) to other psoriasis endotypes like PV (Berki et al., 2015). The characterization of the inflammatory response includes several markers (e.g. KI67, S100A9, cytokines and chemokines). But most are not considered specific for psoriasis, and are related to skin inflammation or an activated epidermis in general. Therefore, a more comprehensive analysis including more specific markers for psoriasiform inflammation would be preferable. It would be also ideal to compare these findings with data on these markers in human psoriasis, and comparing GPP vs. PV. This would allow the discrimination of the model phenotype and specification of the model being a true GPP or PV model. For example, RNAseq analysis would allow for such a comparison given the publicly available RNAseq data sets from psoriasis, atopic dermatitis and other inflammatory skin conditions.</p><p>4) The authors assess the contribution of adaptive immunity to the phenotypes described by crossing <italic>Card14</italic> mutants to Rag1<sup>-/-</sup> mice. As no significant differences are detected in the absence of T cells and B cells, the authors conclude that adaptive immunity was not required for acute skin inflammation. This is in keeping with the relatively short time of evaluation after the induction of expression of the mutant <italic>Card14</italic> (5 days). Is adaptive immunity relevant at later stages of the model. If so, is anti-TNF still therapeutically effective?</p><p>5) The study included the analysis of different cytokines (Figures 1 and 2). The results raise the question as to whether ubiquitous or KC-specific expression of <italic>Card14</italic><sup>E138A</sup> result in a different inflammatory profile. A table listing all the cytokines tested and their outcome in both setting would be beneficial to easily compare and contrast between the two models. Along the same line, it would be ideal to include measurements on the cellular infiltrate in the KC-specific model.</p><p>6) There are a number of experiments in which controls are missing. For example, include control <italic>Card14</italic><sup>+/+</sup><italic>Rosa26</italic><sup>CreERT2/+</sup> in Figure 3C, Figure 3—figure supplement 1B.</p><p>7) The data in Figure 6—figure supplement 2D is relevant and would be ideal to be included in a main figure. We also suggest to include this in the main figure and replace the pictures shown in Figure 6C.</p><p>8) The finding that systemic effects are mediated through keratinocyte-driven severe skin inflammation is highly interesting and could have clinical impact. This finding deserves to be better highlighted in the manuscript. This may also suggest that patients could benefit, early in disease progression, from local anti-inflammatory therapies specifically targeting the keratinocytes, rather than systemic biologicals.</p><p>Revisions expected in follow-up work:</p><p>1) We recognize that a more detailed characterization of the model and its comparison with data sets on human psoriasis, GPP and PV would require significant additional experiments and can be performed as a follow up work. A discussion on how such an approach can complement the current findings to discriminate this with other disease models would be ideal.</p><p>2) If the authors have not tested the efficacy of anti-TNF beyond the acute period, they should clarify that this would be important to be tested in follow up work.</p><p>3) We recognize that a thorough comparative analysis on CARD14 expression between mouse and human samples would require significant additional experiments and can be performed as a follow up work. A discussion on the implications of differential expression is warranted for this report.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.56720.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Revisions for this paper:</p><p>1) The authors have modeled a human mutation into the mouse Card14 gene.

The results are in line with previously published murine data, as well as with single cell sequencing data from the Kaspar lab (http://kasperlab.org/mouseskin). However, the results seem to be in contrast to protein expression profiles reported in human skin, in which CARD14 protein is mostly found in basal cells (of note: Figure 1B also shows signal in basal cells). This requires a thorough analysis or at least a discussion on the differences between mice and human and potential consequences for disease mechanisms.</p></disp-quote><p>Two studies have suggested that human CARD14 is expressed in the basal layer of the epidermis based IHC analyses. In Jordan et al., 2012, a Sigma antibody (HPA023388) was used to stain frozen skin sections. The second study (Fuchs-Telem et al., 2012), investigating the role of CARD14 in PRP, showed basal staining apparently using a different CARD14 antibody (NBP1-88598; Novus Biological). However, this antibody actually appears to be identical to the Sigma antibody (same immunogen sequence, same host species and same staining pictures used to advertise the antibody). Both suppliers have discontinued these antibodies and no staining with these reagents are reported for CARD14 in the human protein atlas.</p><p>We have tried the Sigma CARD14 antibody ourselves for western blotting (J.M. and S.C.L.). Using lysates from HACAT cells overexpressing CARD14-FLAG, the antibody failed to detect any specific signal although the recombinant CARD14 was clearly detected with anti-FLAG. Jordan et al., 2012 performed a negative control stained with 1% serum in lieu of the primary antibody. While this controls for unspecific retention of primary antibodies by the tissue, it does not control for unspecific binding of the specific CARD14 antibody (a better control for unspecific binding would be CARD14 knock out tissue or antibody adsorption with CARD14 recombinant protein prior to staining). Fuchs-Telem et al., 2012 do not show any negative controls. We are concerned that the basal staining with the commercial CARD14 antibodies do not actually show CARD14 protein levels and do not feel that it is possible at this stage to make a definitive statement about differences in CARD14 expression in the skin of mice and humans.</p><p>Nevertheless, similar to mouse keratinocytes, we found that differentiation of human keratinocytes increased levels of CARD14 protein and mRNA (Figure 1—figure supplement 1E and F). This is consistent with published RNA sequencing data with cultured human keratinocytes and organotypic epidermis (Bin et al., 2016) (Lopez-Pajares et al., 2015). It will be important to determine whether CARD14 protein levels similarly increase as keratinocytes differentiate in human skin and to confirm CARD14 protein expression in the basal layer using different CARD14 antibodies with validated specificity.</p><p>We have modified the text in the Results describing CARD14 localization to take in to account these considerations:</p><p>“RNAscope analysis revealed that <italic>Card14</italic> mRNA expression in healthy mouse skin was restricted to the upper (most differentiated) keratinocytes, the outer root sheath of the hair and sebocytes in the skin (Figure 1B). […] The <italic>CARD14</italic> mRNA expression data agree with published transcriptomic datasets of differentiating human keratinocytes (Bin et al., 2016) and organotypic epidermis (Lopez-Pajares et al., 2015) (Figure 1—figure supplement 1G).”</p><p>Additionally, RNAscope staining of <italic>Card14</italic> in the skin of <italic>Card14<sup>LSL-E138A/+</sup>Rosa26<sup>CreERT2/+</sup></italic> mice 5 days after tamoxifen induction has been included (Figure 3—figure supplement 2A), with the accompanying text:</p><p>“Expression of <italic>Card14</italic> mRNA in the skin of <italic>Card14</italic><sup>LSL-E138A/+</sup><italic>Rosa26</italic><sup>CreERT2/+</sup> mice 5d after tamoxifen injection was preferentially localized to the suprabasal layers of the epidermis (Figure 3—figure supplement 2A). […] These results suggest that keratinocytes are the main source of TNF driving skin inflammation.”</p><p>Importantly, the new <italic>Tnfα</italic> RNAscope data added indicate that TNF is mainly produced by skin keratinocytes in <italic>Card14</italic><sup>LSL-E138A/+</sup><italic>Rosa26</italic><sup>CreERT2/+</sup> mice following tamoxifen induction, consistent with CARD14<sup>E138A</sup> signaling in keratinocytes driving skin inflammation.</p><p>Finally, we have now added text about CARD14 epidermal expression in the Discussion:</p><p>“Earlier immunohistochemical studies established that CARD14 protein was expressed in the basal layer in human skin (Jordan et al., 2012b). […] Nevertheless, regardless of apparent differences in CARD14 distribution between mouse and human, the predominant localization of CARD14 in the skin is consistent with a function in sensing harmful stimuli, such as pathogens, at the interface between the organism and the environment.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Throughout the manuscript, the authors link their results to 'psoriasis' (e.g. disease markers, therapeutic response). However, the investigated CARD14 mutation is related to GPP, not (or to a lesser extent) to other psoriasis endotypes like PV (Berki et al. JID 2015). The characterization of the inflammatory response includes several markers (e.g. KI67, S100A9, cytokines and chemokines). But most are not considered specific for psoriasis, and are related to skin inflammation or an activated epidermis in general. Therefore, a more comprehensive analysis including more specific markers for psoriasiform inflammation would be preferable. It would be also ideal to compare these findings with data on these markers in human psoriasis, and comparing GPP vs. PV. This would allow the discrimination of the model phenotype and specification of the model being a true GPP or PV model. For example, RNAseq analysis would allow for such a comparison given the publicly available RNAseq data sets from psoriasis, atopic dermatitis and other inflammatory skin conditions.</p></disp-quote><p>To answer this important point, we have included new data (Figure 5—figure supplement 1, Figure 5—figure supplement 2 and Figure 5—figure supplement 3). The following subsection was added to the Results section to describe these figures:</p><p>“Comparison of the CARD14<sup>E138A</sup> skin transcriptome with human psoriatic skin transcriptome”.</p><p>We have also added a discussion of these comparisons in the Discussion section:</p><p>“The skin transcriptome of <italic>Card14</italic><sup>LSL-E138A/+</sup><italic>Rosa26</italic><sup>CreERT2</sup> mice also shared similarities with the skin transcriptome of the GPP patient expressing the <italic>CARD14</italic><sup>E138A</sup> variant. The increased expression of <italic>Steap1</italic> and <italic>Steap4</italic> mRNAs in the skin of <italic>Card14</italic><sup>LSL-E138A/+</sup><italic>Rosa26</italic><sup>CreERT2</sup> mice after tamoxifen injection is particularly interesting since these genes have been found to be upregulated in several types of pustular psoriasis and are known to be important in neutrophil chemotaxis (Liang et al., 2017b).”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) The authors assess the contribution of adaptive immunity to the phenotypes described by crossing Card14 mutants to Rag1<sup>-/-</sup> mice. As no significant differences are detected in the absence of T cells and B cells, the authors conclude that adaptive immunity was not required for acute skin inflammation. This is in keeping with the relatively short time of evaluation after the induction of expression of the mutant Card14 (5 days). Is adaptive immunity relevant at later stages of the model. If so, is anti-TNF still therapeutically effective?</p></disp-quote><p>To address this question, we have included new experiments which investigate the importance of the adaptive immune system for skin inflammation induced by chronic CARD14<sup>E138A</sup> signaling (Figure 4—figure supplement 1).</p><p>The following text was added at the Results section to describe these new data:</p><p>“To investigate the role of the adaptive immune system in skin pathology induced by prolonged CARD14<sup>E138A</sup> signaling, <italic>Card14</italic><sup>LSL-E138A/+</sup><italic>Rosa26</italic><sup>CreERT2/+</sup><italic>Rag1</italic><sup>-/-</sup> mice were analyzed 1m after tamoxifen injection. […] Thus, the adaptive immune system was not required for skin inflammation induced by chronic CARD14<sup>E138A</sup> signaling.”</p><p>The following text was added at the Discussion section:</p><p>“The absence of a requirement for adaptive immune cells for the development of skin inflammation in <italic>Card14</italic><sup>LSL-E138A/+</sup><italic>Rosa26</italic><sup>CreERT2/+</sup> mice contrasts with a published study by Wang et al. where the inflammatory skin phenotype in mice constitutively expressing CARD14<sup>∆Q136</sup> was reduced by RAG1 deficiency. […] Alternatively, the inflammatory skin phenotype that develops in C<italic>ard14</italic><sup>∆Q136/+</sup> mice may involve developmental alterations that occur in utero that require adaptive immune cells.”</p><p>Unfortunately, we have not been able to investigate the role of TNF at later time points after tamoxifen injection due to the lockdown closure of the Crick laboratories. We plan to investigate whether anti-TNF blocks the inflammatory effects of chronic CARD14<sup>E138A</sup> signaling when the Institute reopens.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) The study included the analysis of different cytokines (Figures 1 and 2). The results raise the question as to whether ubiquitous or KC-specific expression of Card14<sup>E138A</sup> result in a different inflammatory profile. A table listing all the cytokines tested and their outcome in both setting would be beneficial to easily compare and contrast between the two models. Along the same line, it would be ideal to include measurements on the cellular infiltrate in the KC-specific model.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewers for this suggestion. Unfortunately, we have not performed an RNAseq analysis of the skins of the <italic>Card14</italic><sup>E138A/+</sup><italic>Krt14</italic><sup>CreERT2</sup> mice and only checked the expression of selected proinflammatory transcripts relevant in skin inflammation by qRT-PCR. Nevertheless, we were able to show that keratinocyte-specific expression of CARD14<sup>E138A</sup> upregulated the expression of the same genes induced by ubiquitous CARD14<sup>E138A</sup> expression.</p><p>We have included Figure 2—figure supplement 2 comparing the fold changes of the assessed gene products.</p><p>The following text was added in the Results section:</p><p>“Some <italic>Card14</italic><sup>E138A/+</sup><italic>Krt14</italic><sup>CreERT2/+</sup> mice presented a visible skin phenotype without tamoxifen injection, which could be due to leaky expression of Cre allowing basal expression of CARD14<sup>E138A</sup>, these were excluded from experiments. […] Nevertheless, these experiments showed that CARD14<sup>E138A</sup> signalling in keratinocytes alone was sufficient to induce skin inflammation.”</p><p>And we discussed the results in the following paragraph of the Discussion section:</p><p>“The fold changes of the majority of proinflammatory genes analyzed at d5 in <italic>Card14</italic><sup>LSL-E138A/+</sup><italic>Krt14</italic><sup>CreERT2/+</sup> with respect to controls were lower than the fold changes of the <italic>Card14</italic><sup>LSL-E138A/+</sup><italic>Rosa26</italic><sup>CreERT2/+</sup> mice. […] Regardless, the induced genes were the same in both Cre drivers and the phenotype of both het and hom mice in the <italic>Krt14</italic><sup>CreERT2/+</sup> background was similar to the <italic>Rosa26</italic><sup>CreERT2/+</sup> histologically and systemically demonstrating that CARD14<sup>E138A</sup> signaling in keratinocytes alone is sufficient to induce skin and systemic inflammation.”</p><p>Unfortunately, we have not been able to perform experiments to characterize the immune cell infiltrate in the <italic>Card14</italic><sup>LSL-E138A/+</sup><italic>Krt14</italic><sup>CreERT2/+</sup> background due to closure of the Crick laboratories during the pandemic.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) There are a number of experiments in which controls are missing. For example, include control Card14<sup>+/+</sup> Rosa26<sup>CreERT2/+</sup> in Figure 3C, Figure 3—figure supplement 1B.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewers for pointing out this omission. We have now included controls in all the figure panels.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7) The data in Figure 6—figure supplement 2D is relevant and would be ideal to be included in a main figure.

This finding deserves to be better highlighted in the manuscript. This may also suggest that patients could benefit, early in disease progression, from local anti-inflammatory therapies specifically targeting the keratinocytes, rather than systemic biologicals.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewers for point out this important point. We have now modified the text to highlight the potential translational impact of our study:</p><p>Abstract:</p><p>“These results suggest that anti-inflammatory therapies specifically targeting keratinocytes, rather than systemic biologicals, might be effective for GPP treatment early in disease progression.”</p><p>Introduction:</p><p>“This severe systemic phenotype resulted from CARD14<sup>E138A</sup> signaling in keratinocytes and showed striking similarities to an acute flare of GPP in human patients. […] Our findings suggest that specific blockade of the CARD14 signaling pathway in keratinocytes would inhibit the systemic inflammatory syndrome that can develop in GPP patients with activating CARD14 mutations”</p><p>Discussion:</p><p>“The present study indicates that constitutive CARD14<sup>E138A</sup> activation of NF-кB in keratinocytes is sufficient to promote skin inflammation and systemic inflammatory disease. This raises the possibility that it may be feasible to develop topical medicines that block CARD14 signaling in the skin to treat CARD14-induced psoriasis and systemic inflammation.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Revisions expected in follow-up work:</p><p>1) We recognize that a more detailed characterization of the model and its comparison with data sets on human psoriasis, GPP and PV would require significant additional experiments and can be performed as a follow up work. A discussion on how such an approach can complement the current findings to discriminate this with other disease models would be ideal.</p></disp-quote><p>We have been able to address this point with new bioinformatic analyses, comparing human skin disease and mouse transcriptomics. The results are included in the article in Figure 5—figure supplements 1, 2 and 3 and described in the subsection “Comparison of the CARD14<sup>E138A</sup> skin transcriptome with human psoriatic skin transcriptome”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) If the authors have not tested the efficacy of anti-TNF beyond the acute period, they should clarify that this would be important to be tested in follow up work.</p></disp-quote><p>We have not been able to investigate the effect of anti-TNF on skin inflammation induced by chronic CARD14<sup>E138A</sup> signaling due to the coronavirus pandemic. However, we plan to perform experiments to address this question in the future.
