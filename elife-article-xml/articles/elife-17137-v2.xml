effectiveness in these patients. To this end, we sought to develop a combination strategy to enhance the antitumor activity of ALK inhibitor monotherapy in human neuroblastoma cell lines and xenograft models expressing activated ALK. Herein, we report that combined inhibition of ALK and MDM2 induced a complementary set of anti-proliferative and pro-apoptotic proteins. Consequently, this combination treatment synergistically inhibited proliferation of <italic>TP53</italic> wild-type neuroblastoma cells harboring <italic>ALK</italic> amplification or mutations in vitro, and resulted in complete and durable responses in neuroblastoma xenografts derived from these cells. We further demonstrate that concurrent inhibition of MDM2 and ALK was able to overcome ceritinib resistance conferred by MYCN upregulation in vitro and in vivo. Together, combined inhibition of ALK and MDM2 may provide an effective treatment for <italic>TP53</italic> wild-type neuroblastoma with <italic>ALK</italic> aberrations.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.17137.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.17137.001</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>Neuroblastoma</kwd><kwd>ALK</kwd><kwd>MDM2</kwd><kwd>TP53</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100004336</institution-id><institution>Novartis</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Li</surname><given-names>Fang</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The research was funded by Novartis, Inc., where all authors were employees at the time the study was conducted.

It remains a leading cause of childhood cancer-related death despite the use of multimodal dose-intensive chemotherapy, radiation therapy and immunotherapeutic strategies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Smith et al., 2010</xref>). More effective therapeutic approaches are needed to improve cure rates among children with high-risk neuroblastoma while minimizing treatment-related toxicity. Recent efforts have been directed toward the development of new treatment strategies targeting validated molecular abnormalities underlying the malignant process.</p><p>Highly penetrant, heritable <italic>ALK</italic> mutations have been identified as the major cause of familial neuroblastoma. Somatic mutations in <italic>ALK</italic> are also found as oncogenic drivers in up to 10% of sporadic neuroblastoma with a gene amplification frequency of approximately 2% (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chen et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">George et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Janoueix-Lerosey et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Mossé et al., 2008</xref>). These mutations cause single amino acid substitution in the ALK kinase domain and result in autophosphorylation and constitutive activation of the RTK. The most frequently mutated residues, R1275, F1174 and F1245, account for 85% of mutations in ALK (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bresler et al., 2014</xref>). The discovery of germline and somatic activating mutations in <italic>ALK</italic> provides a molecular rationale and a tractable target for treating neuroblastoma.</p><p>Crizotinib is a small-molecule adenosine triphosphate (ATP)-competitive inhibitor that has activity against ALK, MET and ROS1 RTKs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Cui et al., 2011</xref>). Therapy with crizotinib has significant clinical activity in patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), anaplastic large cell lymphoma (ALCL) and inflammatory myofibroblastic tumor (IMT) that harbor <italic>ALK</italic> rearrangements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Kwak et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Mossé et al., 2013</xref>). The marked clinical success of crizotinib in treating <italic>ALK</italic>-positive NSCLC tumors led to an early phase clinical trial in patients with recurrent or refractory neuroblastoma (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Mossé et al., 2013</xref>). However, only one of 11 neuroblastoma patients with known <italic>ALK</italic> mutations responded in this study. Ceritinib is a second-generation ALK inhibitor that has 20-fold higher potency against ALK than crizotinib in enzymatic assays (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Marsilje et al., 2013</xref>). It has demonstrated marked clinical activity in both crizotinib-naive and crizotinib-relapsed <italic>ALK</italic>-positive NSCLC patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Shaw et al., 2014</xref>). In a phase I study of pediatric cancer, 14 neuroblastoma patients with known <italic>ALK</italic> mutations were treated with ceritinib (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Birgit Geoerger et al., 2015</xref>). To date, only two patients showed partial responses, and one patient with ALK F1174L mutated neuroblastoma had shrinkage of a retroperitoneal mass. Overall, the responses of relapsed neuroblastoma with known <italic>ALK-</italic>activating mutations to crizotinib or ceritinib were not optimal for such targeted therapies.</p><p>ALK F1174L and F1174C mutations were identified as acquired resistance mutations in oncogenic ALK fusion proteins during crizotinib and ceritinib treatments, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Friboulet et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Sasaki et al., 2010</xref>). Biochemical analyses revealed that the F1174L mutation increased ATP-binding affinity of ALK and reduced its susceptibility to crizotinib inhibition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bresler et al., 2014</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bresler et al., 2011</xref>). In a recent study, Infarinato and colleagues have shown that PF06463922, a highly potent ALK inhibitor for wild-type ALK and various ALK mutants, exhibits superior antitumor activity in neuroblastoma xenografts harboring the ALK F1174L mutation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Infarinato et al., 2016</xref>), providing a rationale for assessing the efficacy of newer generation ALK inhibitors in clinical trials for treating patients with <italic>ALK</italic>-mutated neuroblastoma. However, the majority of the tumors that harbor the crizotinib- and ceritinib-sensitive ALK R1275Q mutation did not respond in the trials of crizotinib and ceritinib in neuroblastoma patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Mossé et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Birgit Geoerger et al., 2015</xref>). These results suggest that the low response rates in these clinical studies is not likely to be solely attributed to the inherent primary resistance caused by the ALK F1174 substitutions in neuroblastoma. In addition, <italic>ALK</italic> mutations have been identified in both low- and high-risk neuroblastoma with equal frequency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bresler et al., 2014</xref>), suggesting that activated ALK cooperates with other oncogenic aberrations to define high- versus low-risk tumors. For example, <italic>ALK</italic> mutations are frequently observed in <italic>MYCN</italic>-amplified neuroblastomas, and most of <italic>ALK</italic> amplifications co-occur with <italic>MYCN</italic> amplification (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">George et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bresler et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bagci et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">De Brouwer et al., 2010</xref>). ALK mutations that co-occur with <italic>MYCN</italic> amplification are biased toward F1174 substitutions. Constitutively, activated ALK synergizes with MYCN overexpression in inducing neuroblastoma in animal models, and the co-occurrence of ALK F1174 mutations and <italic>MYCN</italic> amplification defines a subset of neuroblastoma patients with particularly poor outcome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Berry et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Heukamp et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Zhu et al., 2012</xref>). Therefore, the co-occurrence of mutations in <italic>ALK</italic> with dysregulation in other oncogenic drivers, such as <italic>MYCN</italic> amplification, may further limit the activity of single-agent ALK inhibitors.</p><p>Combinatorial therapies that target other signaling pathways in addition to ALK may be required to improve the effectiveness of ALK inhibitors in neuroblastomas that harbor <italic>ALK</italic> aberrations. In this study, we assessed the antitumor activity of ceritinib in combination with NVP-CGM097, a potent and selective small molecule inhibitor of MDM2, in <italic>ALK</italic>-mutated or <italic>ALK</italic>-amplified neuroblastoma models. MDM2 functions as an E3 ubiquitin ligase that targets p53 for proteasome-mediated degradation. p53 protein plays a critical role in tumor suppression by regulating the expression of genes involved in cell cycle arrest and apoptosis. Thus, CGM097 exerts its antitumor effects by stabilizing p53 and activating p53 pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Jeay et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Weisberg et al., 2015</xref>). However, to elicit these responses, tumor cells must possess wild-type or functional p53 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Jeay et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Weisberg et al., 2015</xref>). In contrast to the high frequency of <italic>TP53</italic> mutations observed in many human cancers of adults, mutations of <italic>TP53</italic> have been reported in less than 2% of neuroblastomas at diagnosis and 15% at relapse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Carr-Wilkinson et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Tweddle et al., 2003</xref>). Here, we report that the combination of ceritinib with CGM097 promotes apoptosis in <italic>ALK</italic> mutant/<italic>TP53</italic> wild-type neuroblastoma cell lines and results in complete tumor regression and markedly prolonged survival in neuroblastoma xenograft models. In addition, ceritinib and CGM097 combination overcomes acquired ceritinib resistance caused by MYCN upregulation in an ALK-driven neuroblastoma model. Our study as well as the exceptionally low rate of <italic>TP53</italic> mutations in neuroblastoma provides the rationale for testing combinatorial inhibition of ALK and MDM2 as a therapeutic approach for treating <italic>TP53</italic> wild-type neuroblastomas with aberrantly activated ALK.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Treatment of single-agent ALK inhibitors is not sufficient for maximal antitumor effect in neuroblastoma models expressing constitutively activated ALK</title><p>We first examined the anti-proliferative and cytotoxic effect of four ALK inhibitors – crizotinib, ceritinib, alectinib and PF06463922 – in four neuroblastoma cell lines that harbor <italic>ALK</italic> aberrations.

Crizotinib, ceritinib and alectinib have been approved by multiple health authorities to treat advanced NSCLC harboring ALK rearrangements, whereas PF06463922 is a next-generation ALK inhibitor with higher potency and selectivity and appears to be active against all known clinically acquired ALK mutations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Johnson et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Zou et al., 2015</xref>).

Consistent with prior observations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Infarinato et al., 2016</xref>), PF06463922 caused a partial growth inhibition in cell lines with the ALK F1174L mutation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>), presumably due to the high specificity of PF06463922 for ALK. In addition, the IC<sub>50</sub> values for the four ALK inhibitors in the F1174L neuroblastoma cell lines were 10 to 100-fold higher than the IC<sub>50</sub> values in Ba/F3 cells expressing EML4-ALK F1174L mutant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Zou et al., 2015</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). These data suggest that, in addition to ALK signaling, other pathways may contribute to the survival of the F1174L-mutated neuroblastoma cells. To further assess the activity of ceritinib against neuroblastoma tumors that harbor the F1174L mutation in vivo, we examined the antitumor effect of ceritinib in SH-SY5Y xenograft tumors in mice. Treatment of ceritinib showed limited efficacy in SH-SY5Y xenograft tumors, resulting in slower tumor growth compared with vehicle-treated mice (Figure 3A and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Figure 3—source data 1</xref>). Altogether, these data suggest that ALK inhibition alone is not sufficient to achieve durable and deep responses in neuroblastoma tumors that contain ALK aberrations, and that a combination therapy that consists of an ALK inhibitor and a second agent is required.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Concurrent activation of the tumor suppressor p53 and inhibition of ALK synergistically suppress neuroblastoma growth</title><p>Small-molecule MDM2 antagonists that disrupt the interaction between p53 and MDM2 to activate the p53 pathway have shown initial signs of antitumor efficacy in patients with solid and hematologic malignancies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Andreeff et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Ray-Coquard et al., 2012</xref>). MDM2 antagonists function through activation of p53 and hence efficacy of this therapeutic class is restricted to tumors that retain wild-type <italic>TP53</italic>. Mutations in <italic>TP53</italic> occur rarely in neuroblastoma (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Tweddle et al., 2003</xref>), and p53 pathway is mainly inactivated through mechanisms that affect stability and nuclear shuttling of p53 protein, such as MDM2 amplification and p14ARF impairment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Carr-Wilkinson et al., 2010</xref>). These tumors should remain amenable to MDM2 inhibition. In order to test this, we examined the anti-proliferative effect of the MDM2 inhibitor CGM097 in a panel of neuroblastoma cell lines, including five <italic>TP53</italic> mutant and six <italic>TP53</italic> wild-type cell lines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>).

To test this hypothesis, we exposed the four neuroblastoma cell lines that harbor <italic>ALK</italic> aberrations to combinations of ceritinib and CGM097. Of these four cell lines, one carried <italic>TP53</italic> mutation (KELLY), and the rest were <italic>TP53</italic> wild-type (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>). Cells were exposed to ceritinib and CGM097 at concentrations ranging from 0 to 3.3 µM and cell proliferation was measured at 72 hr. The 64 different combinations for each cell line are depicted in a dose matrix in which percentages of growth inhibition relative to non-treated cells are indicated and visualized using a color scale (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). A combination index that measures dose shifting when combination treatments achieve a 50% growth inhibitory effect was calculated from the isobologram for each cell line to represent the strength of synergy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Lehár et al., 2009</xref>). An examination of these matrices indicates that the combinations of ceritinib and CGM097 at the concentrations greater than 100 nM resulted in improved growth inhibition compared to treatments with either compound alone in all three <italic>TP53</italic> wild-type cell lines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). Isobologram analysis revealed that the effects of combining ceritinib and CGM097 were synergistic in these three cell lines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). In contrast to the <italic>TP53</italic> wild-type cell lines, CGM097 alone was completely ineffective in inhibiting the growth of the <italic>TP53</italic>-mutated KELLY cells, and no improved growth inhibition of the combination was observed in these cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B and C</xref>).</p><p>To elucidate the molecular mechanism of synergy between the ALK and MDM2 inhibitor, we examined their effects on protein signaling and pathway modulation. Effective target inhibition was achieved with CGM097, as evident by an accumulation in p53 protein itself and the induction of p53 direct effectors, p21 and MDM2 proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). Ceritinib caused a reduction of phospho-ALK, phospho-AKT and phospho-ERK signaling, likewise demonstrating effective target and pathway inhibition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). As expected, CGM097 was unable to induce p53 protein or its downstream effectors in <italic>TP53</italic> mutant KELLY cells as expected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). When the components in the cell cycle and apoptosis pathways were examined, CGM097 caused induction of p21 and PUMA, while ceritinib caused induction of p27 and Bim (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). Therefore, together ceritinib and CGM097 induced a complementary, yet non-overlapping set of anti-proliferative and apoptosis-stimulating molecules, which resulted in synergistic antitumor effects (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). Only when combined, the two compounds could cause significant increase of cleaved PARP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>), suggesting that the combination leads to cell death.</p><p>Given the improved in vitro efficacy of combined ALK and MDM2 inhibition, we next determined whether ceritinib in combination with CGM097 was effective in the neuroblastoma mouse xenograft models. Mice bearing tumor xenografts were treated with vehicle, ceritinib, CGM097 or both. CGM097 was not effective in NB-1 (<italic>ALK</italic> amplified), SH-SY5Y (ALK F1174L) and NB-1643 (ALK R1275Q) models (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Figure 3—source data 1</xref>).

Ceritinib monotherapy was partially effective in the SH-SY5Y and NB-1643 models, resulting in slower tumor growth compared with the vehicle-treated group (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Figure 3—source data 1</xref>). In contrast to the limited or transient responses to the single-agent treatments, the combination led to complete and durable tumor regressions throughout treatment period in NB-1, SH-SY5Y and NB-1643 models (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Figure 3—source data 1</xref>).

The recurrent tumors remained sensitive to the combination treatment (data not shown), suggesting that the residual disease was not completely eliminated in a subset of animals.

To identify the molecular mechanism that allowed these tumors to grow out in the presence of continued ALK inhibition, we sequenced poly(A)-selected RNA extracted from tissues of NB-1 tumors that progressed on ceritinib treatment and those treated with a vehicle to identify differentially expressed genes between these two groups. We found a marked increase in the expression of a group of genes in the ceritinib-resistant tumors when we plotted the gene expression levels of the ceritinib-resistant tumors versus those of the vehicle-treated tumors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3-data">Supplementary file 1</xref>). Interestingly, the majority of these genes upregulated in the ceritinib-resistant tumors encode RPS and RPL proteins of the small and large ribosomal subunits and translation elongation factors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>).

With the selective upregulation of genes encoding proteins of the small and large ribosomal subunits in the ceritinib resistant tumors, we hypothesized that the expression of MYCN might be increased in these tumors.

Initially, a large portion of the cells was killed or showed no signs of proliferation. After 3 weeks of treatment, the cells grew out in the presence of 0.2 µM ceritinib. The resultant cell line, NB-1R, showed significantly decreased sensitivity to ceritinib as compared to the parental cell line (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>). Similar to the observations made in the ceritinib-resistant NB-1 xenografts, Western blot analysis of these ceritinib-resistant cells revealed markedly increased expression of MYCN (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>). However, ALK signaling was strongly suppressed in the resistant cells, as exemplified by reduced levels of phospho-ALK, phospho-AKT and phospho-ERK (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>). We further developed PF06463922-resistant SH-SY5Y and KP-N-RT-BM-1 cells by treating the parental cells with 1 µM of PF06463922 for 3 to 4 months (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1A</xref>). To achieve adequate ALK inhibition while avoiding the off-target effects associated with high concentrations of ceritinib, we chose PF06463922 as the ALK inhibitor for these two cell lines because it is more potent against the ALK F1174L mutation than ceritinib. The levels of MYCN were again markedly increased in these two PF06463922-resistant cell lines compared to their parental cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1B</xref>).

In the absence of doxycycline, no reduction of MYCN protein was observed in the <italic>MYCN</italic> shRNA-expressing NB-1R cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>). In contrast, exposure to doxycycline led to a dose-dependent reduction in MYCN protein levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>). While MYCN knockdown in DMSO-treated NB-1R cells did not significantly affect the cell viability, downregulation of MYCN restored the sensitivity of the NB-1R cells to ceritinib (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>), suggesting that both ALK inhibition and reduction in MYCN level are required for inhibiting the growth of NB-1R cells. In addition, shRNA-mediated downregulation of MYCN resulted in increased levels of phospho-ALK but had no effect on the expression of p53 and p21 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2</xref>).</p><p>The contradictory roles of the MYC family in promoting cell proliferation and sensitizing cells to apoptosis have been well established (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Meyer and Penn, 2008</xref>). MYC deregulation activates the p53 pathway and triggers apoptosis, which serves as a major mechanism for preventing MYC-mediated tumorigenesis. Tumors are able to evade MYC-induced apoptosis by introducing defects in the p14ARF-MDM2-p53 axis and its effectors and regulators, and restoring the abrogated p53 pathway may provide an approach to force MYC-deregulated tumors to undergo apoptosis. In the absence of <italic>TP53</italic> mutations, defects in the p53 pathway, in general, allow neuroblastoma cells to circumvent the safeguard against MYCN-driven neoplasia. Our RNA-Seq data revealed that <italic>TP53</italic> gene remained wild-type in the ceritinib-resistant NB-1R cells, as in the parental NB-1 cells. However, expression of p21, one of the major p53 transcriptional target genes, was strongly decreased in the ceritinib-resistant cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>), indicating that the p53 signaling might be impaired in the NB-1R cells.</p><p>To determine if activating the p53 pathway and increasing the expression of p21 could restore the sensitivity to ceritinib, we treated the NB-1R cells with CGM097 alone or in combination with ceritinib for 16 hr. CGM097 treatment resulted in an increase in p53 expression and induction of its target genes, including p21, MDM2 and PUMA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F</xref>). In addition, CGM097 restored the sensitivity of the NB-1R, SH-SY5YR and KP-N-RT-BM-1R cells to ceritinib or PF06463922 to a level comparable to that in the parental cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5G</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1C</xref>). Ceritinib in combination with CGM097 caused increased anti-proliferative activity and decreased viability of NB-1R cells compared to either agent alone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5G</xref>), presumably through induction of stronger apoptosis, evident by induction of cleaved PARP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F</xref>).</p><p>To further assess the activity of combination of ceritinib with CGM097 in overcoming the acquired resistance to ceritinib monotherapy in vivo, we treated NB-1 tumor-bearing mice with vehicle, ceritinib alone, CGM097 alone or ceritinib plus CGM097. When the animals in the ceritinib-treated group became resistant to ceritinib (tumor sizes reached 400–500 mm<sup>3</sup>), they were randomized again into two groups and the treatments were switched to either CGM097 monotherapy or combination of ceritinib with CGM097. Under CGM097 monotherapy treatment, tumors continued to grow (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5H</xref>). In contrast, the combination treatment led to fast tumor regressions (red curve in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5H</xref>). The ceritinib-resistant tumors that switched to CGM097 monotherapy continued to grow to 800–900 mm<sup>3</sup> and were re-challenged with the combination of ceritinib and CGM097. The combination treatment once again caused complete tumor regressions in these tumors (green curve in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5H</xref>). CGM097 alone could not reverse the outgrowth of ceritinib-resistant tumors (dark blue curve in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5H</xref>), indicating that both ALK inhibition and p53 activation are required for inhibiting the growth of ceritinib-resistant tumors. The occurrence of resistance was prevented all together when the tumors were treated with ceritinib in combination with CGM097 from the start (grey curve in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5H</xref>), similar to the results shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>. Taken together, these data strongly suggest that combined inhibition of ALK and MDM2 in <italic>TP53</italic> wild-type neuroblastoma with ALK aberrations may provide an effective therapeutic modality capable of preventing as well as overcoming the resistance observed with the ALK inhibitor monotherapy.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Although the identification of activating <italic>ALK</italic> mutations and the demonstration of the oncogenic role of mutant ALK have established ALK as a therapeutic target in neuroblastoma, clinical studies of crizotinib and ceritinib in pediatric cancers have shown that patients with <italic>ALK</italic>-mutated neuroblastoma responded less favorably than pediatric patients with <italic>ALK</italic>-rearranged tumors, such as ALCL and IMT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Mossé et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Birgit Geoerger et al., 2015</xref>). In the rare cases where the neuroblastoma patients had objective responses, their tumor cells expressed the ALK R1275Q mutation. Previous preclinical work has shown that crizotinib inhibited growth of neuroblastoma xenografts expressing ALK R1275Q or amplified wild-type ALK, but failed to inhibit growth of xenografts harboring F1174L-mutated ALK (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bresler et al., 2011</xref>). ALK F1174 mutations arose as acquired resistance mutations in oncogenic ALK fusion proteins during crizotinib and ceritinib treatments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Friboulet et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Sasaki et al., 2010</xref>), suggesting that F1174L may cause primary resistance to certain ALK inhibitors in neuroblastoma. PF06463922 is a highly potent ALK inhibitor that is active against a range of ALK mutations, including F1174L. It has single-agent antitumor activity in neuroblastoma xenografts that express the three most common <italic>ALK</italic> mutations – F1174L, R1275Q and F1245C (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Infarinato et al., 2016</xref>), providing the rationale to test more potent ALK inhibitors in clinic. However, there are still limitations likely associated with treating <italic>ALK</italic>-aberrant neuroblastoma with single-agent ALK inhibitors, including the newer generation inhibitors. In the clinical studies of crizotinib and ceritinib in pediatric patients with <italic>ALK</italic>-driven neuroblastoma, most tumors harboring R1275Q-mutated ALK did not respond to the treatments even although cells with the R1275Q mutation are sensitive to both drugs. In this preclinical study, consistent with the observations made by other groups (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Infarinato et al., 2016</xref>), we found that PF06463922 treatment only led to 25% to 50% inhibition in cell lines expressing the ALK F1174L mutation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Tumor cell plasticity may render the remaining cells resistant to PF06463922 and eventually lead to recurrences during long-term treatments, which is the typical case with single-agent therapies. Multiple epidemiological studies on the distribution of <italic>ALK</italic> mutations in relation to <italic>MYCN</italic> status and other genomic parameters have revealed the co-occurrence of <italic>ALK</italic> mutations and <italic>MYCN</italic> amplification in neuroblastoma (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bagci et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">De Brouwer et al., 2010</xref>), indicating that additional oncogenic drivers exist other than ALK. Moreover, F1174L is significantly overrepresented in tumors with <italic>MYCN</italic> amplification, and almost all <italic>ALK</italic>-amplified tumors are also <italic>MYCN</italic>-amplified. All these findings suggest that the challenge for treating <italic>ALK</italic>-driven neuroblastomas is to overcome de novo resistance and combinatorial therapies are required to maximize the clinical benefit of ALK inhibition in neuroblastoma with ALK aberrations.</p><p>Previous studies have shown that ALK inhibition synergizes with chemotherapy or CDK4 inhibition in preclinical models of neuroblastoma (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Krytska et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Wood et al., 2016</xref>), and a clinical trial (NCT02780128) for testing the combination of ceritinib and ribociclib in <italic>ALK</italic>-mutant neuroblastoma patients is ongoing. In our study, several lines of evidence prompted us to assess the effectiveness of the combination of ceritinib and CGM097 in neuroblastoma models expressing activated ALK. First, activation of p53 signaling by MDM2 inhibitors provides a therapeutic approach for tumors that retain wild-type <italic>TP53</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Jeay et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Weisberg et al., 2015</xref>). In contrast to the high mutation rate of <italic>TP53</italic> in adult cancers, mutational inactivation of <italic>TP53</italic> occurs in less than 2% of neuroblastoma tumors at diagnosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Tweddle et al., 2003</xref>). The rate of <italic>TP53</italic> mutations increases to 15% in relapsed neuroblastoma (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Carr-Wilkinson et al., 2010</xref>). However, the p53 pathway is mainly inactivated via other mechanisms, such as MDM2 amplification and p14ARF impairment, in relapsed neuroblastoma (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Carr-Wilkinson et al., 2010</xref>). These tumors should remain amenable to MDM2 inhibition. Second, MDM2 inhibition leads to increases in p53 levels and cell death in neuroblastoma through induction of cell cycle arrest and apoptosis. In agreement with our own work using CGM097 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>), targeted disruption of the MDM2/p53 interaction by the small molecule MDM2 antagonists, such as nutlin-3 and RG7388, suppresses the proliferation of both chemoresistant and sensitive neuroblastoma cell lines with wild-type <italic>TP53</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chen et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Van Maerken et al., 2009</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">2006</xref>). Finally, <italic>ALK</italic> mutations and <italic>MYCN</italic> amplification co-occur in a subset of neuroblastoma patients, emphasizing the need to target both oncogenes. Although it remains difficult to inhibit MYCN directly, disruption of the MDM2-p53 interaction by MDM2 inhibitors may provide an effective strategy for treating <italic>MYCN</italic>-amplified neuroblastoma. <italic>MYCN</italic>-amplified and <italic>TP53</italic> wild-type neuroblastoma cell lines show remarkable sensitivities to MDM2 antagonists in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chen et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Van Maerken et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Gamble et al., 2012</xref>). In addition, MDM2 contributes to tumorigenesis in a <italic>MYCN</italic>-driven transgenic mouse model for neuroblastoma, and its haploinsufficency reduces MYCN-driven tumor incidence and inhibits tumor growth via p53-mediated apoptosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chen et al., 2009</xref>). In this study, we have demonstrated that treatment with ceritinib in combination with CGM097 synergistically inhibits the proliferation of <italic>ALK</italic>-mutated and <italic>TP53</italic> wild-type neuroblastoma cell lines in vitro and results in a shrinkage of tumor volumes below palpable detection in vivo, providing evidence for the effectiveness of combined inhibition of ALK and MDM2.</p><p>Resistance to targeted therapies remains a major problem in treatment of cancer patients. In most cases, tumors develop resistance to single-agent cancer therapeutics within a few months. To our knowledge, this is the first work that shows upregulation of MYCN acts as a mechanism by which ALK-driven neuroblastoma cells develop resistance to ALK inhibitors. We found that <italic>ALK</italic>- and <italic>MYCN</italic>-amplified NB-1 cells rapidly develop resistance to ceritinib even though they are extremely sensitive to ceritinib in culture with an IC50 value less than 50 nM. Several elegant studies in transgenic zebrafish and mouse models have already demonstrated synergistic effect of expressing activated ALK together with MYCN on inducing neuroblastoma (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Berry et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Heukamp et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Zhu et al., 2012</xref>). Mutationally activated ALK may suppress the apoptotic response induced by MYCN, and prolonged treatment with ALK inhibitors can shift the equilibrium between pro-survival and pro-apoptotic pathways, which enables a subset of tumors cells to survive. However, additional stress, such as exposure to MDM inhibitors, can disrupt the balance established by ALK inhibition and lead the cells that become resistant to ALK inhibitors toward apoptosis. The detailed mechanisms underlying these effects remain to be determined. Given the observations that ALK F1174L occurs at a higher frequency in <italic>MYCN</italic>-amplified tumors and almost all <italic>ALK</italic>-amplified tumors are also <italic>MYCN</italic>-amplified, it is unlikely that durable responses can be achieved by targeting ALK alone. In this study, we have shown that CGM097, when combined with ceritinib, is able to prevent and overcome the resistance conferred by MYCN upregulation through, at least in part, restoring the defects in p53 pathways and promoting apoptosis.</p><p>Some limitations of this study should be considered. Although ceritinib in combination with CGM097 induced complete and sustained tumor regression for the duration of the treatment in xenograft mouse models of neuroblastoma, tumor growth was observed 2 to 8 weeks after discontinuation of the treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). The recurrent tumors still responded to the combinatorial treatment after it was restarted (data not shown), suggesting that the treatment did not eliminate the residual disease. It will be interesting to test whether a more potent ALK inhibitor, such as PF06463922, in combination with CGM097 or other MDM2 antagonists can delay or prevent tumor regrowth after treatment termination. In addition, future work will be needed to assess the extent to which our findings can be extrapolated to xenograft models that express F1245C.</p><p>In summary, our results show that CGM097 significantly enhances the antitumor activity of ceritinib in neuroblastoma with aberrantly activated ALK by inducing a complementary set of anti-proliferative and pro-apoptotic signaling. We also find that neuroblastoma cell lines with <italic>ALK</italic> aberrations develop resistance to ALK inhibition as a result of MYCN upregulation. Induction of p53 by CGM097 in these ALK inhibition-resistant tumor cells restores their sensitivity. These findings support the clinical evaluation of combined inhibition of ALK and MDM2 as a therapeutic approach in <italic>TP53</italic> wild-type neuroblastoma with constitutively activated ALK.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Cell lines and culture</title><p>The neuroblastoma cell lines used in this study and their <italic>ALK</italic>, <italic>MYCN</italic> and <italic>TP53</italic> genetic status are listed in <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>.

Your article has been favorably evaluated by Tony Hunter (Senior Editor) and three reviewers, one of whom, Chi Van Dang, is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a response to the significant concerns raised before a formal a revised manuscript is invited.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>Wang and colleagues determine that combination therapy of ALK inhibitor ceritinib with MDM2 inhibitor CGM097 cooperate in vitro and in vivo, and promote apoptosis in vitro ALK mutant/WT TP53 neuroblastoma cell lines. Combination therapy caused regression and increased survival in neuroblastoma xenograft models derived from two of these lines. Additionally, they report that ceritinib resistance may be caused by MYCN upregulation, and can be rescued by combination therapy. This work is of interest in the field given the challenges of inhibiting full-length mutant ALK in neuroblastoma. The major weakness is the limited in vitro and in vivo testing in models not fully representative of ALK alterations identified in patients, and the lack of data in ALK wild-type models to support this combination in a biomarker-driven population. While the mechanism for synergy by activation of non-overlapping pro-apoptotic and anti-proliferative proteins is well-supported, the mechanism for efficacy of CGM097 and combination therapy for ceritinib-resistant tumor lines is less clear, with the connection to MYCN relatively tenuous.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The cell line and xenograft sample set is insufficient given the breadth of publications in this field, and should be expanded in order to provide robust rationale for dual targeting of ALK and MDM2 in ALK-driven neuroblastoma models. The 4 cell lines screened (1 with ALK amplification and 3 with the same ALK F1174L mutation) are not representative of all 3 hot spot mutations found in patient samples, and no ALK wild-type models are evaluated in vitro or in vivo- this is problematic. A model harboring an R1275Q mutation should be tested, since this represents the most common ALK mutation in neuroblastoma and it is even referenced by the authors (Introduction, fourth paragraph) that the clinical responses reported in patients with this crizotinib/ceritinib-sensitive mutation is underwhelming. The in vivo experiments should also be expanded to models harboring the R1275Q mutation (and F1245), and would be more robust if the combination was tested in patient-derived xenografts as opposed to conventional xenografts generated from the cell lines. Several recent publications focused on ALK inhibition strategies in neuroblastoma show persuasive activity in PDX models, including compelling data in several such models with single agent PF06463922. The combination data with ceritinib/CGM907 presented here is limited and not convincingly superior.</p><p>2) Why was CGM097 used as opposed to HDM201, which is the compound in clinical trials?</p><p>3) The authors comment that &quot;ALK mutations are frequently observed in MYCN-amplified neuroblastomas&quot; and again reference the &quot;co-occurrence of ALK mutations and MYCN amplification&quot; in the Discussion. Important to note that in the largest series reporting the frequency and spectrum of ALK mutations in neuroblastoma (Bresler et al., Cancer Cell 2014), ALK mutations were found in 10.9% of MYCN-amplified tumors versus 7.2% of those without MYCN amplification (not a major difference). Additionally, the Discussion states that &quot;ALK mutations and MYCN amplification co-occur in a subset of neuroblastoma patients with the poorest clinical outcome…,&quot; – this is not accurate. While patients with both amplified MYCN and F1174-mutated ALK had a significantly worse event-free survival than patients with neither, patient outcome did not differ significantly according to the location of the mutation in any analysis done in the Bresler et al. paper reporting on close to 1600 patients.</p><p>4) Despite compelling initial anti-tumor activity in the 2 in vivo models tested, tumors recurred shortly after discontinuation of therapy. In a recent paper by Krytska et al. (CCR 2015), crizotinib combined with standard cytotoxic agents sensitized ALK-mutant neuroblastoma xenografts with wild-type p53. When this combination was evaluated in SY5Y xenografts (same model tested with ceritinib/CGM907), known to be crizotinib-resistant, sustained complete tumor regressions were reported and maintained for 24-weeks post cessation of treatment. No reference is made to this paper and it is not clear how or if the ceritinib/CGM907 combination could be complementary or superior.</p><p>5) in vitro signaling data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>) do not persuasively show that dual targeting of ALK and MDM2 induced further activation of p53 or MDM2 compared to single agent MDM2 inhibition with CGM907; nor does the combination convincingly cause a significant increase of cleaved PARP, as noted by the authors. Additionally, the immunoblotting does not appear to show more profound downregulation of pERK and pAKT with the combination. Investigators should look for on-target activity in vivo, as kinetics of response are likely to differ.</p><p>6) The experiment showing that sensitivity to ceritinib in NB-1R could be restored by knocking down the expression of MYCN was elegant and suggests a role of MYCN in this model of resistance. It would be informative to assess whether MYCN downregulation (genetically and pharmacologically) impacts P-ALK levels.</p><p>7) In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>, the authors suggest that p53 signaling might be impaired in the NB-1R cells. However, this suggestion does not correlate with higher sensitivity of to CGM097 in these cells compared to the sensitive counterpart cells (NB-1) – <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4G</xref>. Also in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>, p53 levels are very similar in both cell lines and do not correlate with the differences seen in p21 levels. Is it possible that p21 levels in these cells are being modulated by MYCN instead, as has previously been suggested (Iraci et al., 2011)?</p><p>8) Similarly to data shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref> in the sensitive cells including NB-1, the combination of ceritinib and CGM097 in the resistant NB-1R cells does not convincingly increase levels of p53-related proteins compared to CGM097 single agent alone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref>), overall suggesting that, at least in vitro, this combination is effective through other non-p53 mediated pathways. Immunoblotting analysis of tumors from in vivo experiments would be worth investigating.</p><p>9) Does cell death induction shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">4G</xref> translate to induction of apoptosis in treated tumors in vivo? Can apoptosis analysis be added to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2E</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">4H</xref>?</p><p>10) The authors conclude that an increase in MYCN expression causes resistance to ceritinib in the NB-1 cells and CGM097 restores sensitivity. The MYCN shRNA experiment in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref> shows restoration of ceritinib sensitivity in a single cell line. Can this be extended to support generality in additional lines, and does overexpression of MYCN in sensitive cells drive resistance?</p><p>11) Ceritinib appears to decrease the levels of p53, MDM2, and p21 levels in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>. Do the authors have insight into this observation?</p><p>12) In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref>, where NB-1R cells are treated with monotherapy and combination therapy, are levels of MYCN restored to NB-1 parental levels? The blot for p-Alk here is poor quality and difficult to evaluate.</p><p>13) The RNA-seq data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref> represent the tumors that progressed under treatment with 50 mg/kg ceritinib and NB-1 tumors treated with vehicle. How many mice does this represent, and is this RNA-seq data an average? Can these details be more clearly stated? Additionally, while the genes displayed are specifically ribosomal subunit genes and other translation-related genes, what was the fold change of MYCN detected by their RNA-seq experiment? Do these data support data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>.</p><p>14) The authors suggest that the p53 axis becomes disrupted in the NB-1R cells, and also show these cells strongly decrease expression of p21, and that this confers resistance since treatment with CGM097 restores sensitivity. Are NB-1R cells less sensitive to etoposide treatment?</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were requested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for resubmitting your work entitled &quot;Combined ALK and MDM2 inhibition increases antitumor activity and overcomes resistance in human ALK mutant neuroblastoma cell lines and xenograft models&quot; for further consideration at <italic>eLife</italic>. Your revised article has been favorably evaluated by Tony Hunter as the Senior Editor, Chi Dang as the Reviewing Editor and two reviewers.</p><p>The manuscript has been improved and responsive to the reviewers' comments, but there are some remaining issues that need to be addressed textually before acceptance. Please address the nuances of your findings in the Discussion or where applicable and submit the revision with altered text responding the key points of the following issues:</p><p>1) in vivo data shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref> in ALKi-naïve cell line xenografts harboring varying ALK status: While antitumor activity with dual targeting of ALK and MDM2 is compelling, it does not appear superior to several already published data (crizotinib plus chemotherapy; ceritinib plus ribociclib), nor are the data convincingly superior to published data for lorlatinib alone in some of the very same models (NB1643 and SY5Y). How does time to regrowth compare with other combinations tested, or with lorlatinib alone? The anti-tumor activity in NB1643 is not compelling. While there is no doubt that combination strategies are needed to delay or overcome acquired resistance, the challenge for ALK-driven neuroblastomas is overcoming de novo resistance. Authors need to put their work in context with the published literature for this disease- especially in their Discussion.</p><p>2) It is interesting that lorlatinib was used to generate resistance in in vitro models – why was 1 μM used to treat parental cells? This is a very high dose (and certainly would not be relevant clinically) for such a potent ALK inhibitor, and the resulting phenotype is unlikely to model what will happen in patients.</p><p>3) Would still prefer to see data with HDM201; at the very least, authors need to mention that HDM201 is in fact in phase 1 testing in neuroblastoma patients with p53 wild type status (NCT02780128), as is the combination of ceritinib and ribociclib for neuroblastoma patients with ALK-driven tumors. How do they envision moving this to the clinic? Are they suggesting that lorlatinib (a Pfizer drug) be combined with HDM201 (a Novartis drug)?</p><p>4) Need to change very first sentence in Introduction – &quot;Neuroblastoma is the most common extracranial childhood solid tumor&quot;- this exact phrase has been used hundreds of times.</p><p>5) Fourth paragraph in Introduction, as well as early on in the Discussion, the authors postulate why pediatric patients with NB did not respond to crizotinib or ceritinib – the authors need to be very careful here as the implications made about why patients with ALK-mutant neuroblastoma did not respond to direct ALK kinase inhibition with crizotinib or ceritinib is not accurate. These are heavily pretreated patients whose tumor genome evolves dramatically under the selective pressure of multimodal therapy for high-risk neuroblastoma and selects for therapy resistance irrespective of the presence of an oncogenic driver such as ALK, and testing targeted therapies in this context is unlikely to reflect the therapy-naïve patients at diagnosis who are most likely to benefit from incorporation of ALK inhibition. In addition, I am not aware that the phase 1 study of ceritinib has been published.</p><p>6) A lot of data were generated in the NB1 model – important to put into context that ALK amplification is very rare in these patients (2% overall).</p><p>7) Discussion (fourth paragraph) – studying this combination in PDX models is likely more relevant than transgenic models.</p><p>8) Mechanism of synergy still not clear. Given the role of p53 in modulating cell cycle arrest combined with the finding that ceritinib alone induces P-Rb dowregulation in models of neuroblastoma (Wood A. et al., 2016), it would be informative to assess levels of this major cell cycle modulator and potential G1 arrest in the combination-treated cells versus single agent. For the resistance model, the authors suggest that the MYCN and p21 axis cannot explain sensitivity to the combination. Nevertheless, the levels of key modulators that induce p53 signaling are not shown. Also, if the p53 signaling responsible for regulating p21 is impaired in NB-1R, molecules downstream of p21 such as P-Rb, cyclins etc. should be assessed. Last, given that MYCN is a pivotal regulator of the cell cycle, it would be interesting to perform a cell cycle analysis in these cells.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.17137.017</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>Essential revisions:</italic> </p><p><italic>1) The cell line and xenograft sample set is insufficient given the breadth of publications in this field, and should be expanded in order to provide robust rationale for dual targeting of ALK and MDM2 in ALK-driven neuroblastoma models.

We have established collaboration with the Genomics Institute of the Novartis Research Foundation to test the ceritinib and CGM097 combination in NB-1643 xenograft tumors. NB-1643 cells contain the ALK R1275Q mutation, <italic>MYCN</italic> amplification and wild-type TP53. We will also test this combination in vitroand in vivo in a neuroblastoma model which contains wild-type ALK. When work is completed, our revised manuscript will describe a diverse set of neuroblastoma models including those that contain <italic>ALK</italic> amplification, two different hot-spot ALK mutations (F1174L and R1275Q) and wild-type ALK.</p><p>We do not have access to neuroblastoma cell lines that contain the ALK F1245 mutations and neuroblastoma PDX models. We are aware that these models exist in a few labs in academic institutions. However, it usually takes at least six months to establish collaborations between external institutions and us, assuming that the proposal for the collaboration can be approved. Therefore, it is not feasible for us to include additional models, beyond the ones proposed, in a reasonable time frame.</p><p>We agree with the reviewers that PF06463922 is remarkably effective in xenograft models of neuroblastoma expressing the common <italic>ALK</italic> mutations. However, resistance to single-agent targeted therapies remains a major problem in treatment of cancer patients. Recently, we have established a cell line that shows significantly decreased sensitivity to PF06463922 as compared to the parental SH-SY5Y cell line. We have demonstrated marked increase of MYCN expression in PF06463922-resistant SH-SY5Y cells, and will test whether CGM097 can restore the sensitivity of these cells to PF06463922. In this study, we underscore the notion that concurrent inhibition of ALK and MDM2 provides an improved therapy compared to treatments with single-agent ALK inhibitors. We are hopeful that more potent ALK inhibitors, such as PF06463922, in combination with next-generation MDM2 antagonists can not only induce complete remission in <italic>ALK</italic>-mutated neuroblastoma but prevent tumor recurrence.</p><p><italic>2) Why was CGM097 used as opposed to HDM201, which is the compound in clinical trials?</italic> </p><p>CGM097 is indeed also being tested in clinical trials. A Phase I dose escalation study of CGM097 in adult patients with selected advanced solid tumors with wild-type p53 is ongoing (NCT01760525). CGM097 and HDM201 share the same mechanism of action. Tested in several hundred cell lines of various tumor types, both compounds selectively inhibit the growth of the cells expressing wild-type p53. In these tumor cell lines, both compounds activate downstream p53 effector pathways that decrease cell proliferation and increase apoptosis. HDM201 is in fact a more potent inhibitor. However, HDM201 has a very fast clearance in mice. Given that the mechanism of action is identical and pharmacokinetic properties in the mouse are more desirable with CGM097, we feel that for the purposes of this study and for the conclusions being made, the use of CGM097 is just as adequate as it would be with HDM201. Moreover, our drug exposure studies of CGM097 and ceritinib when used in combination show no drug-drug interaction, further justifying the use of CGM097 for these combination studies.</p><p><italic>3) The authors comment that &quot;ALK mutations are frequently observed in MYCN-amplified neuroblastomas&quot; and again reference the &quot;co-occurrence of ALK mutations and MYCN amplification&quot; in the Discussion.

In the revised manuscript, we will make our comments on the co-occurrence of ALK mutations and MYCN amplification more specific. We will replace these sentences with the following ones: 1) ALK F1174 mutations occur in a high proportion of MYCN-amplified cases; 2) ALK mutations that co-occur with MYCN amplification were biased toward F1174 substitutions; 3) Patients with both the ALK F1174 mutations and MYCN amplification have a significantly worse event-free survival than patients with neither. We will cite the Bresler paper when we make these comments in the manuscript.</italic> </p><p><italic>4) Despite compelling initial anti-tumor activity in the 2</italic> in vivo <italic>models tested, tumors recurred shortly after discontinuation of therapy.

However, it may not be straightforward to compare different treatments in different studies conducted at different labs.

We do not think that the synergy is resulted from the enhanced target inhibition caused by the other compound. The increased levels of cleaved PARP in the three p53 wild-type cell lines treated with the combination is clear in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>. Importantly, in the summary of the reviewers’ comment, the reviewers stated that “the mechanism for synergy by activation of non-overlapping pro-apoptotic and anti-proliferative proteins is well-supported”. However, we agree with the reviewer that we should assess the levels of target inhibition and apoptosis in vivo. We have already evaluated induction of apoptosis in treated NB-1 xenograft tumors and found that the combination induced greater apoptosis compared to the single-agent treatments, consistent with the observations made in vitro.

Also in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>, p53 levels are very similar in both cell lines and do not correlate with the differences seen in p21 levels. Is it possible that p21 levels in these cells are being modulated by MYCN instead, as has previously been suggested (Iraci et al., 2011)?</italic> </p><p>The reviewer is asking an excellent question. We will test whether p21 levels are modulated by MYCN in NB-1R cells transduced with lentiviral doxycycline-inducible vectors containing shRNA against <italic>MYCN</italic>. The p53 levels are very similar in NB-1 and NB-1R cell lines, but the p21 level is significantly lower in the NB-1R cell line than in the NB-1 cell line. Since p21 is one of the major p53 transcriptional target genes, we think that the p53 signaling responsible for regulating p21 expression might be impaired in the NB-1R cells.</p><p>We have demonstrated that increase in MYCN expression causes resistance to ceritinib in NB-1R cells because MYCN knockdown restores the sensitivity of NB-1R cells to ceritinib. MYC family proteins have two contradictory roles: promoting cell proliferation and sensitizing cells to apoptosis. The p14ARF-MDM2-p53 axis and its effectors keep the MYCN level in check. The defects in p53 signaling in NB-1R cells allow them to proliferate in the presence of significantly upregulated MYCN. Therefore, NB-1R cells are more sensitivity to CGM097 than the parental cells because they rely more on MYCN to proliferate and are more vulnerable to induced p53 signaling.</p><p><italic>8) Similarly to data shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref> in the sensitive cells including NB-1, the combination of ceritinib and CGM097 in the resistant NB-1R cells does not convincingly increase levels of p53-related proteins compared to CGM097 single agent alone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref>), overall suggesting that, at least in vitro, this combination is effective through other non-p53 mediated pathways. Immunoblotting analysis of tumors from in vivo experiments would be worth investigating.</italic> </p><p>We cannot exclude the possibilities that CGM097 and its combination with ceritinib can have effects mediated through non-p53 pathways. However, ceritinib and CGM097 combination has no effect on KELLY, the p53-mutant cell line, suggesting that major contribution of CGM097 in this combination is the induction of p53 signaling. We are not suggesting that the synergy is the result of the combination being able to increase the levels of p53 more than CGM097 single agent alone. We provide data to describe the mechanism for synergy to be the activation of non-overlapping pro-apoptotic and anti-proliferative proteins from the combined ALK and MDM2 inhibition.</p><p>We agree with the reviewer that we should assess the levels of target inhibition and apoptosis in vivo.

The MYCN shRNA experiment in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref> shows restoration of ceritinib sensitivity in a single cell line. Can this be extended to support generality in additional lines, and does overexpression of MYCN in sensitive cells drive resistance?</italic> </p><p>We do have additional lines to show that MYCN is upregulated in cells that are resistant to ALK inhibition. Recently, we have demonstrated markedly increased MYCN expression in PF06463922-resistant SH-SY5Y cells that harbor the ALK F1174L mutation, similar to the findings in ceritinib-resistant NB-1 cells. We chose PF06463922 in this cell line to achieve better ALK inhibition because SH-SY5Y contains the ALK F1174L mutation. We will test whether CGM097 can restore the sensitivity of these resistant cells to PF06463922. We are also treating KP-N-RT-BM-1 cells with PF06463922. If we can establish PF06463922-resistant KP-N-RT-BM-1 cells within the timeline we proposed for submitting the revised manuscript, we will conduct the same experiments in these cells, too. These results will be included in the revised manuscript.</p><p>We attempted to overexpress MYCN in NB-1 cells without success. We have preliminary results to show that upregulation of MYCN in the resistant cells is mainly caused by MYCN stabilization. This will be the focus of our future work.</p><p><italic>11) Ceritinib appears to decrease the levels of p53, MDM2, and p21 levels in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>. Do the authors have insight into this observation?</italic> </p><p>The reviewer is making an excellent comment. We made the same observation, but we do not have further insight into this observation. Downregulation of p53 by ALK inhibition may serve as a survival mechanism in <italic>ALK</italic>-mutated neuroblastoma cells treated with ALK inhibitors. Therefore, restoring or even increasing the level of p53 by MDM2 inhibitors can improve the efficacy of ALK inhibitors.</p><p><italic>12) In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref>, where NB-1R cells are treated with monotherapy and combination therapy, are levels of MYCN restored to NB-1 parental levels? The blot for p-Alk here is poor quality and difficult to evaluate.</italic> </p><p>We will reblot p-ALK and assess the levels of MYCN as the reviewer suggested.</p><p><italic>13) The RNA-seq data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref> represent the tumors that progressed under treatment with 50 mg/kg ceritinib and NB-1 tumors treated with vehicle. How many mice does this represent, and is this RNA-seq data an average? Can these details be more clearly stated? Additionally, while the genes displayed are specifically ribosomal subunit genes and other translation-related genes, what was the fold change of MYCN detected by their RNA-seq experiment? Do these data support data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>.</italic> </p><p>This represents two mice for each condition and the expression of each gene shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref> is an average. We will provide the details in the revised manuscript. All the gene expression values are in the <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3-data">Supplementary file 1</xref>. The FPKM values of MYCN of control and ceritinib-resistant tumors are 529 and 638, respectively. Therefore, the increased protein level of MYCN is not due to the increased transcription of MYCN. We have preliminary data to show that upregulation of MYCN protein is caused by MYCN stabilization. MYCN is not a very stable protein, with a half-life less than one hour. The protein encoded by <italic>MYCNOS (NCYM</italic>) plays a role in stabilizing MYCN and its expression is increased more than 10 fold in the resistant tumors<sup>1</sup>. How MYCN is upregulated in ALK inhibitor resistant cells will be the focus of our future studies.</p><p><sup>1</sup> NCYM, a Cis-antisense gene of MYCN, encodes a de novo evolved protein that inhibits GSK3β resulting in the stabilization of MYCN in human neuroblastomas. Suenaga Y, et al. PLoS Genet. 2014</p><p><italic>14) The authors suggest that the p53 axis becomes disrupted in the NB-1R cells, and also show these cells strongly decrease expression of p21, and that this confers resistance since treatment with CGM097 restores sensitivity. Are NB-1R cells less sensitive to etoposide treatment?</italic> </p><p>We do not think the decreased expression of p21 confers resistance. The increase in MYCN expression causes resistance to ceritinib in NB-1R cells because MYCN knockdown restores the sensitivity of NB-1R cells to ceritinib. MYC family proteins have two contradictory roles: promoting cell proliferation and sensitizing cells to apoptosis. The p14ARF-MDM2-p53 axis and its effectors keep the MYCN level in check. The defects in the p53 axis exemplified by the decreased expression of p21 in NB-1R cells allow them to proliferate in the presence of significantly upregulated MYCN.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were requested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p><italic>The manuscript has been improved and responsive to the reviewers' comments, but there are some remaining issues that need to be addressed textually before acceptance. Please address the nuances of your findings in the Discussion or where applicable and submit the revision with altered text responding the key points of the following issues:</italic> </p><p><italic>1) in vivo data shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref> in ALKi-naïve cell line xenografts harboring varying ALK status: While antitumor activity with dual targeting of ALK and MDM2 is compelling, it does not appear superior to several already published data (crizotinib plus chemotherapy; ceritinib plus ribociclib), nor are the data convincingly superior to published data for lorlatinib alone in some of the very same models (NB1643 and SY5Y). How does time to regrowth compare with other combinations tested, or with lorlatinib alone? The anti-tumor activity in NB1643 is not compelling. While there is no doubt that combination strategies are needed to delay or overcome acquired resistance, the challenge for ALK-driven neuroblastomas is overcoming de novo resistance. Authors need to put their work in context with the published literature for this disease- especially in their Discussion.</italic> </p><p>We do agree with the reviewer that it is important to put our manuscript in the context of the published literature. We have cited the relevant literature in the Introduction and Discussion sections, and have put our manuscript in that context. However, we cannot make direct comparative statements between ours and the papers cited. This manuscript was not designed to conduct rigorous head to head comparisons. For the same reasons, we believe that the reviewer cannot claim superiority of other studies over ours either. Nonetheless, we do show marked antitumor activity of ceritinib in combination with CGM097 in these models, providing rationale for testing this combination in patients. Furthermore, previous publications do not describe mechanisms responsible for resistance to ALK inhibition nor do they provide tested suggestions to overcome the resistance. We however demonstrate that concomitant inhibition of MDM2 and ALK can overcome ALK inhibitor-resistance conferred by MYCN upregulation.</p><p>The reviewer suggests that the anti-tumor activity in NB-1643 xenografts is not compelling. We observed that ceritinib monotherapy only delayed the tumor growth and the tumor volume increased more than 2-fold compared to day 0. In contrast, the combination treatment resulted in nearly complete tumor regression (7% of the tumor volume at day 0). After we submitted the revised manuscript, the treatments were stopped, but we continue to observe the animals. We found sustained tumor regression in the combination-treated group. We have updated the NB-1643 results in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref> to reflect this additional observation. We think that the anti-tumor activity of the ceritinib/CGM097 combination treatment in this model is even more striking.</p><p>We do agree with the reviewer that the challenge for <italic>ALK</italic>-driven neuroblastomas is overcoming de novo resistance. Our <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">3</xref> speak to that point. To make this point clearer, and as the reviewer suggested, we added the following text in the Discussion: all these findings suggest that the challenge for treating <italic>ALK</italic>-driven neuroblastomas is to overcome de novo resistance and combinatorial therapies are required to maximize the clinical benefit of ALK inhibition in neuroblastoma with <italic>ALK</italic> aberrations (Discussion, end of first paragraph).</p><p><italic>2) It is interesting that lorlatinib was used to generate resistance in</italic> in vitro <italic>models – why was 1 μM used to treat parental cells? This is a very high dose (and certainly would not be relevant clinically) for such a potent ALK inhibitor, and the resulting phenotype is unlikely to model what will happen in patients.</italic> </p><p>To develop lorlatinib-resistant SH-SY5Y and KP-N-RT-BM-1 cells, we wanted to choose a dose that achieves maximum inhibition of ALK while still retaining on-target selectivity (using suboptimal dosing could also result in phenotypes that are not modeling the relevant and complete inhibition of ALK). In our studies, the dose response curves showed no off-target killing in SH-SY5Y and KP-N-RT-BM-1 cells when lorlatinib was dosed at 1 µM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>), while at that same dose the strongest phospho-ALK inhibition was observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>).</p><p><italic>3) Would still prefer to see data with HDM201; at the very least, authors need to mention that HDM201 is in fact in phase 1 testing in neuroblastoma patients with p53 wild type status (NCT02780128), as is the combination of ceritinib and ribociclib for neuroblastoma patients with ALK-driven tumors. How do they envision moving this to the clinic? Are they suggesting that lorlatinib (a Pfizer drug) be combined with HDM201 (a Novartis drug)?</italic> </p><p>As the reviewer suggested, we have mentioned the clinical study of ceritinib and ribociclib combination in the Discussion section (second paragraph). However, the treatment of single agent HDM201 in <italic>TP53</italic> wild-type neuroblastoma is not addressing <italic>ALK</italic> mutants.</p><p>The following criticism from the reviewer: “Are they suggesting that lorlatinib (a Pfizer drug) be combined with HDM201 (a Novartis drug)?” we find to be off-base. The scientific merit of a paper does not hinge on the clinical candidacy. As such, numerous articles have been published in <italic>eLife</italic> and elsewhere with molecules that are not clinical candidates (for example consider publications with JQ1). Furthermore, it is beyond the scope of this scientific manuscript and this letter to provide justification of how two pharmaceutical companies could do business together and jointly bring drugs to the patients. However, we believe that our manuscript provides a strong rationale and a novel idea to test the efficacy of combined inhibition of ALK and MDM2 in <italic>ALK</italic>-mutant neuroblastoma.</p><p><italic>4) Need to change very first sentence in Introduction – &quot;Neuroblastoma is the most common extracranial childhood solid tumor&quot;- this exact phrase has been used hundreds of times.</italic> </p><p>The first sentence was changed to “Neuroblastoma is a common pediatric solid tumor that arises from neural crest cells”.</p><p><italic>5) Fourth paragraph in Introduction, as well as early on in the Discussion, the authors postulate why pediatric patients with NB did not respond to crizotinib or ceritinib – the authors need to be very careful here as the implications made about why patients with ALK-mutant neuroblastoma did not respond to direct ALK kinase inhibition with crizotinib or ceritinib is not accurate. These are heavily pretreated patients whose tumor genome evolves dramatically under the selective pressure of multimodal therapy for high-risk neuroblastoma and selects for therapy resistance irrespective of the presence of an oncogenic driver such as ALK, and testing targeted therapies in this context is unlikely to reflect the therapy-naïve patients at diagnosis who are most likely to benefit from incorporation of ALK inhibition. In addition, I am not aware that the phase 1 study of ceritinib has been published.</italic> </p><p>The reviewer raised an interesting hypothesis. In the Introduction section, we describe the lack of efficacy of ALK inhibitors in <italic>ALK</italic>-mutant neuroblastoma in the context of other ALK-driven cancers. Early phase clinical trials of crizotinib and ceritinib showed significant clinical activity in patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), anaplastic large cell lymphoma (ALCL) and inflammatory myofibroblastic tumor (IMT) that harbor <italic>ALK</italic> rearrangements. These patients were also heavily pretreated with multimodal therapies.</p><p>The clinical study of ceritinib in pediatric cancer has been published.

The NB-1 cell line and xenografts were used as the major model for studying the resistance mechanism because it is the only model that is truly sensitive to ALK inhibition. We also included two additional models that contain the F1174L mutation for studying mechanism responsible for resistance to ALK inhibition. As the reviewer requested, we have added the frequency of ALK amplification in the Introduction section (second paragraph).</p><p><italic>7) Discussion (fourth paragraph) – studying this combination in PDX models is likely more relevant than transgenic models.</italic> </p><p>Modified according to the reviewer’s suggestion.</p><p><italic>8) Mechanism of synergy still not clear. Given the role of p53 in modulating cell cycle arrest combined with the finding that ceritinib alone induces P-Rb dowregulation in models of neuroblastoma (Wood A. et al., 2016), it would be informative to assess levels of this major cell cycle modulator and potential G1 arrest in the combination-treated cells versus single agent. For the resistance model, the authors suggest that the MYCN and p21 axis cannot explain sensitivity to the combination. Nevertheless, the levels of key modulators that induce p53 signaling are not shown. Also, if the p53 signaling responsible for regulating p21 is impaired in NB-1R, molecules downstream of p21 such as P-Rb, cyclins etc. should be assessed. Last, given that MYCN is a pivotal regulator of the cell cycle, it would be interesting to perform a cell cycle analysis in these cells.</italic> </p><p>In our manuscript, we indeed showed that CGM097 caused induction of p21 and PUMA, while ceritinib caused induction of p27 and Bim. Therefore, ceritinib and CGM097 induce a complementary, yet non-overlapping set of anti-proliferative and apoptosis stimulating molecules, which resulted in synergistic antitumor effects. It is well established that induction of p21 and p27 leads to cell cycle arrest, and that PUMA and Bim function through BH3-dependent mechanisms to induce apoptosis. It would be interesting to further differentiate and monitor temporal contributions of cell cycle arrest and apoptosis to the effectiveness of this combination in future studies.</p></body></sub-article></article>
