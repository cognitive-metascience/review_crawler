concentration of ubiquitin in the cell. Here, we describe a novel mechanism for regulation of ubiquitin homeostasis that is mediated by phosphorylation of ubiquitin at the Ser57 position. We find that loss of Ppz phosphatase activity leads to defects in ubiquitin homeostasis that are at least partially attributable to elevated levels of Ser57 phosphorylated ubiquitin. Phosphomimetic mutation at the Ser57 position of ubiquitin conferred increased rates of endocytic trafficking and ubiquitin turnover. These phenotypes are associated with bypass of recognition by endosome-localized deubiquitylases - including Doa4 which is critical for regulation of ubiquitin recycling. Thus, ubiquitin homeostasis is significantly impacted by the rate of ubiquitin flux through the endocytic pathway and by signaling pathways that converge on ubiquitin itself to determine whether it is recycled or degraded in the vacuole.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>ubiquitin homeostasis</kwd><kwd>membrane trafficking</kwd><kwd>deubiquitylase regulation</kwd><kwd>phosphatase signaling</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>S. cerevisiae</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000057</institution-id><institution>National Institute of General Medical Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R00 GM101077</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>MacGurn</surname><given-names>Jason A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000057</institution-id><institution>National Institute of General Medical Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01 GM118491</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>MacGurn</surname><given-names>Jason A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000965</institution-id><institution>American Federation for Aging Research</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Research Grants for Junior Faculty</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>MacGurn</surname><given-names>Jason A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000057</institution-id><institution>National Institute of General Medical Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R35 GM118089</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Chazin</surname><given-names>Walter J</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000050</institution-id><institution>National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>T32 HL069765</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Lee</surname><given-names>Sora</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000054</institution-id><institution>National Cancer Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>T32 CA119925</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Tumolo</surname><given-names>Jessica M</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund7"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000054</institution-id><institution>National Cancer Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>T32 CA009582</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ehlinger</surname><given-names>Aaron C</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Ser57 phosphorylation regulates ubiquitin homeostasis by inhibiting deubiquitylase-mediated recycling and promoting vacuolar degradation.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>There is mounting evidence that many human diseases â particularly diseases related to protein misfolding and aggregation such as neurodegenerative disorders - are associated with diminished function of the ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS) and altered ubiquitin homeostasis. In general, protein aggregates found in neurodegenerative disorders (Lewy bodies in Parkinsonâs disease, neurofibrillary tangles in Alzheimerâs disease, etc.) tend to accumulate ubiquitin, which is conjugated to aggregated proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Dawson and Dawson, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Hallengren et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Upadhya and Hegde, 2007</xref>). Dysregulation of ubiquitin homeostasis has been observed in mouse models of Huntingtonâs disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bennett et al., 2007</xref>), spinal muscular atrophy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Wishart et al., 2014</xref>), amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Gilchrist et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Hallengren et al., 2013</xref>), and Alzheimerâs disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Lam et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Upadhya and Hegde, 2007</xref>). Given the emerging consensus that dysregulation of ubiquitin homeostasis and UPS activity is a key feature of neurodegeneration, some have proposed restoring ubiquitin levels and UPS activity as a potential therapeutic strategy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chen et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chou and Deshaies, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Deshaies, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Lee et al., 2010</xref>). However, very little is known about regulation of ubiquitin homeostasis in physiological conditions, during cellular aging, in response to cellular stress, or in states of disease. Thus, there is a critical need to dissect the basic mechanisms responsible for regulating ubiquitin metabolism and to identify new pathways which may be targeted to facilitate precise manipulation of ubiquitin homeostasis in the context of disease.</p><p>In yeast and mammalian cells, ubiquitin is synthesized from multiple (usually four) genes which encode ubiquitin precursor proteins consisting of either a single ubiquitin protein fused to a ribosomal protein subunit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Finley et al., 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Ozkaynak et al., 1987</xref>) or head-to-tail ubiquitin repeats (linear polymers) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Finley et al., 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Ryu et al., 2008a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Ryu et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Ryu et al., 2008b</xref>). Encoding ubiquitin as a fusion protein to ribosomal subunits allows cells to couple ubiquitin synthesis and ribosome biogenesis in nutrient-rich conditions that support protein translation and cellular growth. In coordination with synthesis, the management of existing ubiquitin pools (including monoubiquitin, conjugated ubiquitin, and free polymers) by recycling and degradation is critical. Deubiquitylating enzymes (DUBs) that associate with protein degradation machinery (the proteasome and ESCRT machinery for soluble and membrane proteins, respectively) tend to mediate recycling of ubiquitin, and mutation of these DUBs leads to ubiquitin deficiency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Anderson et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Hallengren et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Leggett et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Swaminathan et al., 1999</xref>). In particular, Doa4 â a yeastÂ endosomal DUB that associates with the ESCRT machinery and recycles ubiquitin prior to membrane protein degradation â has a critical role in both vacuolar trafficking and management of cellular ubiquitin levels. More specifically, <italic>doa4</italic> mutant cells exhibit ubiquitin deficiency and vacuolar trafficking defects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Amerik et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Kimura et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Swaminathan et al., 1999</xref>), underscoring how trafficking along the endocytic route and the management of cellular ubiquitin levels are coupled. Furthermore, these findings illustrate how ubiquitin recycling is a potential point of regulation for controlling cellular ubiquitin levels yet specific mechanisms for the regulation of ubiquitin recycling and degradation remain poorly understood.</p><p>The ubiquitin code is highly complex, and modification by conjugation to ubiquitin can alter the fate of substrate proteins by promoting degradation, altering subcellular localization, or altering interactions with binding partners. The complexity of the ubiquitin code is underscored by the fact that ubiquitin can polymerize at any of seven internal lysines (or the N-terminus) leading to chains of different linkage types, each with a unique structure that can be interpreted differently, and that mixed-linkage or branched chains are also possible. More recent work has also led to a consensus that post-translational modifications of ubiquitin (other than polymerization) can alter its function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Herhaus and Dikic, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Zheng and Hunter, 2014</xref>) - making the ubiquitin code as we know it even more complex than previously appreciated. For example, several groups have reported that the E3 ubiquitin ligase Parkin â mutations in which cause an autosomal recessive form of early onset Parkinsonâs disease â is activated by Ser65 phosphorylated ubiquitin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kane et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Kazlauskaite et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Koyano et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Ordureau et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Wauer et al., 2015b</xref>). Despite the fact that the Pink1-Parkin system is not conserved in <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic>, Ser65 phosphorylation of ubiquitin has been detected in yeast and recent work suggests it may play a role in the oxidative stress response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Swaney et al., 2015</xref>). These findings suggest that Ser65 phospho-regulation of ubiquitin is highly conserved across evolution and likely has functional significance beyond Pink1-Parkin-mediated mitophagy. Importantly, several other studies have reported evidence of phosphorylation at other sites on ubiquitin in yeast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Peng et al., 2003</xref>) and mammalian (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">VillÃ©n et al., 2007</xref>) cells. While biochemical analysis has revealed that different phosphorylation events on ubiquitin impact the <italic>in vitro</italic> activities of specific E2-conjugating enzymes, E3 ubiquitin ligases, and deubiquitylases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Huguenin-Dezot et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Wauer et al., 2015b</xref>) the actual functional significance of these modifications remain to be elucidated.</p><p>Here, we report that a pair of highly similar yeast phosphatases â Ppz1 and Ppz2 â are required for proper management of ubiquitin homeostasis in yeast. We show that <italic>ppz</italic> mutants exhibit elevated levels of Ser57 phosphorylated ubiquitin â suggesting that Ser57 phosphorylation of ubiquitin may be linked to the regulation of ubiquitin homeostasis. We show that phosphomimetic mutations at the Ser57 position confer increased rate of ubiquitin degradation and gain-of-function endocytic trafficking phenotypes. Furthermore, we present evidence that these phenotypes are associated with resistance to removal by deubiquitylases on yeast endosomes, and that this pathway plays a significant role in the regulation of ubiquitin metabolism. Based on these findings, we propose Ser57 phosphorylation of ubiquitin as a potential mechanism for deciding whether ubiquitin is recycled or degraded during multi-vesicular body (MVB) sorting on endosomes, thus contributing to the global regulation of ubiquitin levels in the cell.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Ppz phosphatases regulate ubiquitin phosphorylation and homeostasis</title><p>As part of an ongoing effort to elucidate signaling pathways that regulate endocytic trafficking in yeast, we recently became interested in a pair of highly similar (57% identical) protein phosphatases in <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> called Ppz1 and Ppz2 given their reported role in the regulation of ion transporter function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Ruiz et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Ruiz et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Yenush et al., 2005</xref>).

One possible explanation for these findings is that Ser57 phosphorylation of ubiquitin occurs transiently, at low stoichiometry or in a highly localized manner. In an attempt to quantify the stoichiometry of Ser57 phosphorylation, we performed multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) mass spectrometry analysis on ubiquitin affinity purified from <italic>ppz</italic> mutant cell lysates and spiked with isotopically labeled (heavy) standard peptides corresponding to unmodified and phosphorylated Ser57. Ser57 phosphorylation was detected in these samples but was present at a level below that required for reliable quantification â although it is clear based on internal heavy standard measurements that Ser57 phosphorylation occurs on less than 0.05% of total ubiquitin in <italic>ppz</italic> mutant cell lysates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3âfigure supplement 2</xref>). These data suggest that under normal growth conditions Ser57 phosphorylation occurs at very low stoichiometry and may function to regulate the turnover of a limited and/or highly localized portion of the ubiquitin pool in physiological conditions. Although the rate of ubiquitin turnover is increased in <italic>ppz</italic> mutants and for Ser57Asp phosphomimetic ubiquitin, the low stoichiometry of Ser57 phosphorylation (even in <italic>ppz</italic> mutants) limits our ability to determine the relative contribution of this modification to the overall regulation of ubiquitin homeostasis.</p><p>Given our observation that Ser57 phosphomimetic ubiquitin increased the rate of turnover, we also considered the possibility that this mutation causes loss of ubiquitin structure. To test this, we used NMR to assay the tertiary structure of Ser57Asp ubiquitin relative to wildtype. <sup>15</sup>N-<sup>1</sup>H heteronuclear single quantum coherence (HSQC) experiments are highly sensitive to changes in the electronic environment of backbone amides, and can readily detect even subtle changes in structure. Overlay of the spectra of wildtype and mutant proteins reveals differences in the position or intensity of signals. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref> shows that the Ser57Asp mutation causes only a small number of perturbations. Cross-referencing to the chemical shift assignments (BMRB entry 17769) and structure (PDB entry 1UBQ) of ubiquitin allowed us to localize these effects to a surface immediately adjacent to the mutation site (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref>). The small number of perturbations observed here is fully consistent with previous studies of mutations at surface exposed sites resulting in only minor changes in the local environment. Because the Ser57Asp mutant ubiquitin retains a highly similar structure to wild-type ubiquitin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref>), we can conclude that the decreased half-life observed for Ser57Asp ubiquitin <italic>in vivo</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3AâD</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3âfigure supplement 1</xref>) is not due to disruption of ubiquitin structure.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Ser57 phosphomimetic ubiquitin accelerates endocytic trafficking</title><p>We decided to explore further how ubiquitin phosphorylation at Ser57 could alter its metabolism in the cell. We hypothesized that increased ubiquitin metabolism could result from increased degradation of ubiquitin by either the proteasome or the vacuole. The later possibility could occur via increased flux of ubiquitin through the endocytic pathway â which we decided to test by examining growth in the presence of canavanine. Canvanine is a toxic arginine analog that only enters yeast cells via the arginine transporter Can1, and mutations that disrupt or hyperactivate Can1 endocytic trafficking confer canavanine hypersensitivity or resistance, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Lin et al., 2008</xref>). Surprisingly, we found that yeast cells expressing Ser57Asp phosphomimetic ubiquitin conferred resistance to canavanine (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A and B</xref>) â indicative of a gain-of-function endocytic trafficking phenotype (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Lin et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">MacGurn et al., 2011</xref>).

Similarly, we tested if K63- or K48-linked polyubiquitin is required for the endocytic gain-of-function associated with expression of Ser57Asp phosphomimetic ubiquitin and found that both linkage types are required for full canavanine resistance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4âfigure supplement 2</xref>).

Finally, we considered the possibility that Ser57 phosphorylation of ubiquitin alters recognition by deubiquitylases along the endocytic trafficking route. To test this, we took advantage of the previously published observation that fusing deubiquitylase domains to ESCRT-0 prevents cargo sorting on endosomes and thus prevents delivery of cargo to the lumen of the vacuole (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Stringer and Piper, 2011</xref>). Normally, endocytic cargos like Mup1 are trafficked along the endocytic route, from the plasma membrane to the lumen of the vacuole, in response to the addition of methionine to the media (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Lin et al., 2008</xref>). However, fusing the UL36 deubiquitylase domain to Hse1 (part of ESCRT-0) prevents delivery of Mup1 to the vacuole lumen, instead causing it to accumulate on the limiting membrane of the vacuole in response to methionine stimulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>, top panel). Surprisingly, we found that expression of Ser57Asp ubiquitin facilitated bypass of this artificial DUB checkpoint, allowing Mup1 to traffic to the lumen of the vacuole (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>, bottom panel). We also observed that fusion of Hse1 to catalytically active (but not catalytically dead) UL36 conferred hypersensitivity to canavanine â consistent with a trafficking block in these strains â which could be suppressed by the expression of Ser57Asp (but not wildtype) ubiquitin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>). Importantly, suppression of the canavanine hypersensitive phenotype by Ser57Asp ubiquitin required components of ESCRT-I (Vps23) and ESCRT-III (Snf7), but not components of the autophagy pathway (Atg5, Atg8) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s3">Figure 5âfigure supplement 3</xref>), indicating that Ser57Asp ubiquitin restores cargo delivery to the vacuole lumen through the ESCRT pathway and not a parallel pathway. To further test the ability of Ser57Asp ubiquitin to bypass DUB recognition, we fused the arginine transporter Can1 to UL36 and found that this also confers canavanine hypersensitivity that can be partially suppressed by expression of Ser57Asp ubiquitin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s4">Figure 5âfigure supplement 4</xref>). All these results indicate that in a cellular context, and more specifically on endosomal membranes, Ser57Asp ubiquitin bypasses DUB recognition in order to promote cargo trafficking to the vacuole lumen. Thus, given the low observed stoichiometry of Ser57 phosphorylation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3âfigure supplement 2</xref>), it is possible that phosphorylation and dephosphorylation of limited pools of ubiquitin localized to the endosome may impact rates of ubiquitin recycling and turnover.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig5" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.29176.019</object-id><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><title>Ser57Asp phosphomimetic ubiquitin bypasses an artificial DUB checkpoint.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Analysis of Mup1-GFP (green) localization in wildtype yeast cells (strain SEY6210) grown in minimal media lacking methionine (left) or stimulated with methionine for 45 min (right).

In contrast to Ser65, Ser57 is located on a surface loop and in the absence of structural data it is unclear how phosphorylation at this position would impact the overall structure of ubiquitin. Our NMR analysis of the Ser57Asp phosphomimetic suggests that structural perturbations are localized to the site of mutation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E and F</xref>), although we cannot exclude the possibility that more substantial structural perturbations occur when Ser57 is phosphorylated. Furthermore, although Ser65 phosphomimetics were reported to activate parkin in cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kane et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Koyano et al., 2014</xref>) they are unable to stimulate parkin activity <italic>in vitro</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Ordureau et al., 2015</xref>) â underscoring the possibility at the Ser57Asp phosphomimetic ubiquitin doesÂ not necessarily phenocopy the effects of increased Ser57 phosphorylated ubiquitin. Thus, additional structural and biochemical characterization of Ser57-phosphorylated ubiquitin will be required in order to better understand how phosphorylation at the Ser57 position impacts the structure and function of ubiquitin.</p><p>Our <italic>in vitro</italic> analysis of Ser57Asp binding to ESCRT-I and ESCRT-II indicates UBD capture in those complexes is unaffected by phosphomimetic mutation at that position. This is not surprising, since most known ubiquitin interactions with UBDs occur via a hydrophobic patch (Leu8, Ile44, Val70) located on the opposite surface of ubiquitin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Dikic et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Komander and Rape, 2012</xref>). Indeed, the Ser57 position does not appear to correspond to any surface features of ubiquitin that are known to participate in interactions with UBDs or DUBs, and thus it is unclear how depositing a phosphate group at this site would affect recognition by deubiquitylases.

Although the precise function of each UBD in this pathway is unclear, it is proposed that these UBDs function primarily in cargo capture and sorting for delivery to nascent ILVs as they form (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Henne et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Ren and Hurley, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Wollert and Hurley, 2010</xref>). However, it is possible that different UBDs along the ESCRT pathway may have different functions â and it is tempting to speculate that one or more UBDs may be involved in positioning ubiquitin for recognition by Doa4 in order to be recycled prior to ILV scission. Because structural information on Doa4 is lacking and precise determinants of ubiquitin recognition by Doa4 in the context of ESCRT sorting are still unclear, further investigation will be required to determine how Ser57 phosphorylation of ubiquitin inhibits deconjugation by Doa4.</p><p>Although our study establishes a relationship between Ppz phosphatases and ubiquitin phosphorylation at the Ser57 position, additional biochemical studies will be required to determine if Ser57 phosphorylated ubiquitin is a direct substrate of Ppz phosphatases. This may be challenging since Ppz phosphatases are poorly characterized and appear to function in multi-subunit complexes but direct substrates have not been previously reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Posas et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Ruiz et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Sakumoto et al., 2002</xref>). It is possible that ubiquitin is not a direct substrate of Ppz phosphatases, and the elevated levels of pSer57 ubiquitin in <italic>ppz</italic> mutants may be a cellular response to altered ubiquitin homeostasis. Indeed, other potential Ppz substrates identified in this study (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig1sdata1">Figure 1âsource data 1</xref>) include Ypl191c, an uncharacterized member of the MINDY family of deubiquitylases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abdul Rehman et al., 2016</xref>), and ECM30, which associates with the Ubp15 deubiquitylase. The potential regulation of these DUBs by Ppz phosphatases may explain why Ser57 phosphorylation of ubiquitin only partially accounts for the ubiquitin deficiency in <italic>ppz</italic> mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A and B</xref>). Further experimentation will be required to understand additional layers of regulation that may contribute to the ubiquitin homeostasis phenotypes observed in <italic>ppz</italic> mutant cells. Additionally, it will be important to identify yeast kinases that phosphorylate ubiquitin at the Ser57 position. Based on the data reported here, we hypothesize that Ser57 ubiquitin kinases in yeast might be involved in the management of ubiquitin homeostasis.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Ubiquitin modification as a novel mechanism for regulation of membrane traffic</title><p>The current study demonstrates that Ser57Asp ubiquitin is associated with increased rates of endocytic trafficking (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>) which can be explained, at least in part, by a DUB bypass mechanism (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). It is well-established that endosomal DUBs can remove ubiquitin from endocytic substrates to promote their recycling back to the plasma membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Alwan and van Leeuwen, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Clague et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Clague and UrbÃ©, 2006</xref>). Additionally, cargo that have been sorted into the MVB pathway can encounter DUBs recruited by ESCRT-III which promote recycling of ubiquitin just prior to cargo delivery into intraluminal vesicles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Amerik et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">DuprÃ© and Haguenauer-Tsapis, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Henne et al., 2011</xref>). In yeast, Doa4 appears to be the primary DUB responsible for recycling ubiquitin during MVB biogenesis, consistent with the fact that <italic>Îdoa4</italic> mutant cells exhibit ubiquitin deficiency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Swaminathan et al., 1999</xref>) and accelerated turnover (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6âï»¿figure supplement 1</xref>). Doa4 recruitment to endosomes is mediated by an interaction with Bro1, a highlyÂ conserved yeast homolog of the human ALIX protein which is essential for MVB sorting and also plays a role in Doa4 activation on endosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Luhtala and Odorizzi, 2004a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Richter et al., 2007</xref>). Rfu1, a protein that has been proposed to function as an inhibitor of Doa4 activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Kimura et al., 2009</xref>), is also recruited to endosomes by interactions with Bro1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Kimura et al., 2014</xref>). Our data indicate that the Ser57 position of ubiquitin plays an important role in recognition by Doa4. Based on these results, we propose that Doa4 activity is an important point-of-regulation to control both rates of endocytic flux and ubiquitin turnover, especially in conditions of stress. In addition to the established regulatory roles for Bro1 (an activator) and Rfu1 (an inhibitor), we propose that Doa4 activity can also be regulated by ubiquitin phosphorylation at the Ser57 position. Additional studies will be required to determine if Ser57 phosphorylation of ubiquitin prevents Doa4 recognition directly or indirectly via regulation of Rfu1 or Bro1.</p><p>We also considered the possibility that Ser57 phosphorylation of ubiquitin could accelerate endocytic trafficking by increasing the rate of Rsp5-mediated ubiquitin conjugation or by altering affinity for UBDs in the ESCRT pathway; however, we found no evidence that Ser57Asp ubiquitin exhibited either of these properties (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5âfigure supplement 1</xref> andÂ <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5âfigure supplementÂ 2</xref>). Despite these findings, we cannot exclude the possibility that Ser57 phospho-ubiquitin might exhibit increased rate of Rsp5-mediated conjugation or increased altered affinity for UBDs in the ESCRT pathway, which could contribute to the accelerated endocytic trafficking phenotype. The possibility that post-translational modifications of ubiquitin regulate the efficiency of endocytosis, cargo sorting on endosomes, or other membrane protein sorting and trafficking events in the cell represents a novel mode of regulation that will require further exploration in future studies.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Harvesting the reaper: vacuolar trafficking and ubiquitin metabolism</title><p>Ubiquitin homeostasis is poorly understood but clearly involves complex sensing and regulation for the control of both ubiquitin expression and degradation. Most mutations known to alter ubiquitin homeostasis occur in either deubiquitylating enzymes or genes encoding the ubiquitin conjugation machinery. To our knowledge, the current study provides the first example of a phosphatase â or any signaling protein â that is required for proper ubiquitin homeostasis. We predict that signaling components upstream of Ppz phosphatases may sense ubiquitin levels and, by regulating the activity of Ppz phosphatases and possibly other factors involved in ubiquitin recycling, control ubiquitin metabolism. It is noteworthy that we observe the greatest amount of ubiquitin Ser57 phosphorylation in <italic>ppz</italic> mutant cells grown in minimal media (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Interestingly, we normally do not detect high levels of Ppz phosphatase expression in yeast cells grown to mid-log phase, whereas higher levels of expression can be detected in stationary phase yeast cultures (data not shown). These observations indicate that Ppz phosphatases may function as part of a signaling mechanism that operates to manage ubiquitin levels in response to changes in nutrient availability.</p><fig id="fig8" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.29176.031</object-id><label>Figure 8.</label><caption><title>Model for ubiquitin flux through the endocytic pathway, illustrating how phosphorylation of ubiquitin at Ser57 can alter ubiquitin metabolism by limiting recycling of ubiquitin and promoting its delivery to the vacuole for degradation.</title><p>(I) Plasma membrane proteins can be conjugated to ubiquitin, resulting in sorting and internalization by endocytosis (<bold>II</bold>).

We were surprised to find that proteasome activity appeared to be largely dispensable for ubiquitin degradation while defects in vacuolar degradation or MVB sorting led to significantly reduced rates of ubiquitin turnover (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). These findings suggest that ESCRT-mediated vacuolar trafficking is the major mechanism of ubiquitin degradation in yeast, at least under the conditions tested in this study. Indeed, the observation that ubiquitin accumulates significantly in E-compartments of <italic>escrt</italic> mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7E</xref>) is an indication that ubiquitin flux through the endocytic pathway is significant, making endosomes an ideal location for regulating whether ubiquitin is recycled or degraded (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>). Ultimately, understanding how cells sense and manage ubiquitin homeostasis may lead to therapeutic targets and strategies for restoration of ubiquitin pools during aging or in disease contexts such as neurodegeneration where ubiquitin is depleted.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th>Reagent type (species) <break/>or resource</th><th>Designation</th><th>Source or <break/>reference</th><th>Identifiers</th><th>Additional information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Strain background (<italic>S. cerevisiae</italic>)</td><td>SEY6210.1</td><td>S.

Contaminants were precipitated by titrating acetic acid until the pH dropped to 4.8, then the precipitated protein was pelleted by centrifugation (20,000 rpm for 20 min at 4Â°C). The cleared lysate was run over a C4 proto column (Higgins Analytical, Inc.,Â Mountain View, CA) using a Waters Delta 600 HPLC system. Ubiquitin containing fractions were buffer exchanged into NMR buffer (20 mM sodium phosphate pH 6.5, 50 mM NaCl) and concentrated by centrifugation to 100 Î¼M. <sup>15</sup>N-<sup>1</sup>H HSQC experiments were performed at 25Â°C using a Bruker 600 MHz Avance AV-III spectrometer. Data were processed in NMRPipe and visualized using CARA.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Fluorescence microscopy and trafficking assays</title><p>Yeast cells expressing fluorescent fusion proteins were grown to mid-log phase in synthetic media. Microscopy images were acquired using a DeltaVision Elite system (GE Healthcare) and processed using SoftWoRx software (GE Healthcare,Â Chicago,Â IL). FM4-64 was used as a marker to label the limiting membrane of the vacuole as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Vida and Emr, 1995</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Recombinant protein expression and purification</title><p>For bacterial expression, plasmids containing N-terminally tagged Ubc1, Bro1, and Art1 genes were transformed into Rosetta cells. 5 ml of LB/Ampicillin/chloramphenicol media were grown overnight at 37Â°C with a single colony from the transformation. The 5 ml starter cultures were added to 1Â L of LB media with antibiotics and grown to OD<sub>600</sub> of approximately 0.6. At this point the cultures were induced with 0.5 mM IPTG and left to shake overnight at 18Â°C. Cells were harvested by centrifugation at 6000 x g for 20 min. The pellets were washed with 50 ml of lysis buffer (50 mM NaPO<sub>4</sub>, 300 mM NaCl, pH 8.0) per 1 L of culture then centrifuged at 2000 rpm for 30 min. Pellets were resuspended in 20 ml of lysis buffer with protease tablets and 1 mM PMSF. Cells were lysed by sonication (5 Ã 1 min, 50% duty) then spun down at 12,000 rpm for 20 min. For purification, lysates were applied to either Ni-NTA or Cobalt resin (Thermo Scientific,Â Rockford,Â IL) that had been equilibrated with lysis buffer containing 20 mM imidazole. The protein was eluted with lysis buffer containing 300 mM imidazole. Protein was concentrated and buffer exchanged to remove the imidazole. Cells containing an overexpression plasmid for Rsp5 with a Strep-tag were grown and lysed as described above except the lysis buffer used was 100 mM Tris pH 8, 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA. To purify, 10 ml of lysate was applied to a 0.2 ml Strep-Tactin column (IBA Lifesciences,Â GÃ¶ttingen,Â Germany). The protein was eluted with 0.8 mM biotin.</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title><italic>In vitro</italic> ubiquitin conjugation and deubiquitylation assays</title><p>For the conjugation reactions, 56 nM GST-Ube1 (Boston Biochem,Â Cambridge,Â MA, E-300), 0.77 mM His<sub>6</sub>-Ubc1, 2.3 mM Ub or Ub S57D, 50 nM Art1-flag, and 60 nM Strep-RSP5 were incubated in conjugation buffer (40 mM Tris pH 7.5, 10 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub> and 0.6 mM DTT) with 1 mM ATP, at 30Â°C. Reactions were initiated by the addition of Strep-RSP5. Samples were removed at indicated time-points, boiled in 2x Laemmli sample buffer for 10 min, and analyzed by blotting for Art1-flag with flag antibody (Sigma,Â St. Louis, MO) using goat anti-mouse secondary (IRDye 680RD, LI-COR Biosciences,Â Lincoln,Â NE). Quantification was performed using ImageStudioLite software (LI-COR).</p><p>For deconjugation reactions, polyubiquitinated substrate (Art1-flag) was generated using the conjugation assay described above within one exception in that 0.1 mM ATP was used. The conjugation reaction was stopped by incubation with 0.75 units Apyrase in a 90 Âµl reaction at 30Â°C for 1 hr. For the deconjugation reaction, 40 nM His<sub>6</sub>-Doa4 and 3.2 mM His<sub>6</sub>-Bro1<sup>388-844</sup> was added to conjugated Art1-flag as well as 10X DUB buffer (0.5 M Hepes pH 7.4, 200 mM DTT, 3 mg/ml BSA) to 1X. Reactions were initiated by the addition of His<sub>6</sub>-Doa4 and His<sub>6</sub>-Bro1<sup>388-844</sup> protein. The reaction was incubated at room temperature. Samples were removed at indicated time-points and boiled in 2x Laemmli sample buffer. Art1-flag levels were determined as described in the conjugation assay.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We are very grateful to D Finley, M Boselli, R Piper, W Tansey, C Howard, S Wente, T Dawson, T Graham, and P Xu for yeast strains and reagents.

Your article has been favorably evaluated by Vivek Malhotra (Senior Editor) and three reviewers, one of whom, Wade Harper, is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal his identity: Richard Gardner (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>This work examines ubiquitin (UB) phosphorylation in budding yeast and in particular, the potential roles of pS57-UB. The authors find that the abundance of pS57 UB is increased when redundant phosphatase regulatory subunits ppz1/2 are deleted. Using strains expressing either phosphomimetics or non-phosphorylatable mutants in UB (S57A), the authors report that turnover of UB is accelerated when it is in the phospho-mimic form while the S57A mutant does not have a phenotype. In addition, the authors find that expression of the S57D phosphomimic alters the rate of endocytosis in a manner that depends on the deubiquitylating enzyme Doa4.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>All of the reviewers find the paper to be potentially interesting and important. The role of UB phosphorylation in specific functions of UB biology is in its infancy. However, the reviewers expressed some concerns with particular aspects of the paper that need to be satisfactorily addressed. Although there was some differences in opinion about the relative importance of particular issues, all reviewers agree that the following issues should be addressed.</p><p>1) A major conclusion of the paper is that pS57-UB promotes UB turnover as well as endocytosis. This is based on the use of a phosphomimetic or the S57A mutant that is either the only UB form expressed or the one that is followed. The S57D mutant has a phenotype while the S57A doesn't. The absence of a phenotype with the S57A mutant is problematic since this would seem to suggest that phosphorylation at this site isn't absolutely required for the functions that are examined. This would suggest that the role of S57 phosphorylation in the phenotypes studied is minor.</p><p>The reviewers suggest three approaches to try to address this: a) The stoichiometry of S57 phosphorylation needs to be measured with and without ppz. This can be done using various approaches, but perhaps quantitative proteomics is the best approach. If the stoichiometry is low, you would need to accurately describe the implications of this on your conclusions. It may be the case that normally, a very small fraction of UB is phosphorylated on this site and that pool is more rapidly degraded during the execution of endocytosis.</p><p>b) Further analysis of the ppz1/2 deletion strain which has elevated S57 phosphorylated ubiquitin would strengthen the paper, as this seems a more natural and relevant condition than overexpression of the S57D mutant ubiquitin. For example, what does Mup1 trafficking look like in the ppz1/2 deletion strain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>), or does the ppz1/2 strain display the same bypass of Hse1-UL36 for Mup1-GFP trafficking (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>) as the S57D mutant ubiquitin strain?</p><p>c) Depending on the results of points 1 and 2, you would need to be able to provide a more nuanced description of the results, as there is concern that some of the conclusions are too strong. In particular, the fact that much of the UB is degraded in the context of the S57D mutant is likely not to be physiological, since the stoichiometry is likely low compared to the apparent case of the phosphomimetic. So a much more nuanced set of conclusions should be made, depending on the outcome.</p><p>d) There is also an issue with the possibility that the phosphomimetic doesn't actually phenocopy the phosphoform. In the case of pS65 UB, it is clear from the literature that the phosphomimetic is not really a phosphomimetic biochemically, as pS65 UB can dramatically activate parkin in vitro but S65D UB has essentially no activity in such assays. Some discussion of this issue or qualifications in the text is likely needed.</p><p>2) Overall, the treatment of the mass spectrometry experiments is insufficiently described. It is unclear for example how error bars are being generated from a SILAC experiment apparently performed only once unless the error bars are coming from different peptides, but this can't really be done for single peptides by SILAC. A detailed description of how the statistics was done is needed.</p><p>3) There was some concern and discussion concerning the fact that the strains have overexpressed UB in some cases, although the reviewers understand the difficulties in making mutations in the endogenous loci. It might be useful to have blots with all the UB chains collapsed down to mono UB with USP2 in order to know what the actual UB levels are.</p><p>4) Quite a number of different yeast strains with different ways of expressing UB are used. Perhaps this should be explained.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.29176.035</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>All of the reviewers find the paper to be potentially interesting and important.

These results indicate some functional contribution of Ser57 phosphorylation to the <italic>ppz</italic> mutant phenotypes â however, the results also indicate that the ubiquitin deficiency phenotype is not entirely attributable to Ser57 phosphorylation, suggesting that Ppz phosphatases may regulate ubiquitin metabolism at multiple levels. We also agree with the reviewers that the data suggest Ser57 phosphorylation may be sufficient but not strictly required for many of the phenotypes observed. There are several potential explanations for why this may be the case, which we have attempted to address throughout the manuscript. Specifically, we have provided additional experimentation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3âfigure supplement 2</xref>, see more details below) and made extensive revisions throughout the text, including: (i) subsection âUbiquitin Turnover is Regulated by the Ser57 Position of Ubiquitinâ, second paragraph; (ii) subsection âSer57 phosphomimetic ubiquitin accelerates endocytic traffickingâ, last paragraph; (iii) subsection âSer57 phosphomimetic ubiquitin bypasses an artificial DUB checkpointâ, end of first paragraph; (iv) Discussion, first paragraph. Overall, we believe these new experiments and modifications to the text of the manuscript provide the âmore nuanced set of conclusionsâ requested by reviewers.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The reviewers suggest three approaches to try to address this: a) The stoichiometry of S57 phosphorylation needs to be measured with and without ppz.

By spiking isotopically labelled heavy standard peptides into affinity purified ubiquitin, we were able to measure absolute quantities of ubiquitin. However, the abundance of Ser57 phosphorylated ubiquitin was below the limit of reliable quantification (even when we load sample to instrument capacity) â as illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3âfigure supplement 2</xref>. Although we cannot derive an accurate stoichiometry for Ser57 phosphorylation in biological samples, we can conclude that the abundance is below 0.05% of total ubiquitin in the samples measured. As suggested by reviewers, this extremely low stoichiometry may be consistent with localized regulation of specific pools of ubiquitin. However, it also limits our ability to draw physiological conclusions from expression of the phosphomimic, as it is unlikely that Ser57 phosphoubiquitin is ever present systemically. As requested by reviewers, we have tried to accurately describe the implications of these results throughout the text, including: (i) subsection âUbiquitin Turnover is Regulated by the Ser57 Position of Ubiquitinâ, second paragraph; (ii) subsection âSer57 phosphomimetic ubiquitin accelerates endocytic traffickingâ, last paragraph; (iii) subsection âSer57 phosphomimetic ubiquitin bypasses an artificial DUB checkpointâ, end of first paragraph; (iv) Discussion, first paragraph.

For example, what does Mup1 trafficking look like in the ppz1/2 deletion strain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>), or does the ppz1/2 strain display the same bypass of Hse1-UL36 for Mup1-GFP trafficking (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>) as the S57D mutant ubiquitin strain?</p></disp-quote><p>This is an excellent point â and one that we have been working on. However, the results of this line of investigation have led to a parallel manuscript which we are currently preparing for submission.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>c) Depending on the results of points 1 and 2, you would need to be able to provide a more nuanced description of the results, as there is concern that some of the conclusions are too strong. In particular, the fact that much of the UB is degraded in the context of the S57D mutant is likely not to be physiological, since the stoichiometry is likely low compared to the apparent case of the phosphomimetic. So a much more nuanced set of conclusions should be made, depending on the outcome.</p></disp-quote><p>As described above, we have confirmed the low stoichiometry of Ser57 phosphorylation of ubiquitin. Additionally, we have incorporated multiple revisions throughout the text (described above) to effectively incorporate more nuanced and limited conclusions with respect to results obtained using the S57D mutant. Thus, we feel the revised manuscript effectively conveys the above points raised by reviewers.</p><p>d) There is also an issue with the possibility that the phosphomimetic doesn't actually phenocopy the phosphoform. In the case of pS65 UB, it is clear from the literature that the phosphomimetic is not really a phosphomimetic biochemically, as pS65 UB can dramatically activate parkin in vitro but S65D UB has essentially no activity in such assays. Some discussion of this issue or qualifications in the text is likely needed.</p><p>We agree with the reviewers on this point. We have clarified this in the text and emphasized how this limits our ability to draw conclusions from the analysis of the Ser57Asp phosphomimetic (subsection âPhosphorylation as an Emerging Mechanism of Ubiquitin Regulationâ, first paragraph).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Overall, the treatment of the mass spectrometry experiments is insufficiently described. It is unclear for example how error bars are being generated from a SILAC experiment apparently performed only once unless the error bars are coming from different peptides, but this can't really be done for single peptides by SILAC. A detailed description of how the statistics was done is needed.</p></disp-quote><p>We have provided additional details on the mass spectrometry analysis in the Materials and methods section of this paper. Additionally, we have removed the previous <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1âfigure supplement 4E</xref> â which contained error bars that reflected averaging the H:L ratio across multiple peptides for the same protein. However, since those data did not contribute substantially to the overall scope or conclusions of this paper (and in fact those data appear more pertinent to our parallel trafficking story) this figure supplement has been removed.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) There was some concern and discussion concerning the fact that the strains have overexpressed UB in some cases, although the reviewers understand the difficulties in making mutations in the endogenous loci. It might be useful to have blots with all the UB chains collapsed down to mono UB with USP2 in order to know what the actual UB levels are.</p></disp-quote><p>This is an excellent point and we have addressed this by performing slot blot analysis of total cell lysates. Briefly, we used yeast strains expressing FLAG-tagged ubiquitin from endogenous loci (<italic>RPL40B</italic> and <italic>RPS31</italic>, both with native promoters and terminators) so we are confident all signal on the slot blot is derived from ubiquitin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1âfigure supplement 3</xref>). (In contrast, blotting with ubiquitin antibodies is likely to yield background signal which would be impossible to measure/control.) This experimental analysis allows us to quantify ubiquitin abundance in cell lysates without having to overexpress ubiquitin.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) Quite a number of different yeast strains with different ways of expressing UB are used. Perhaps this should be explained.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that the use of different strains can be confusing â and we appreciate the reviewersâ understanding. To address this, we have added a general strain usage statement at the beginning of the âYeast Strains and Growth Conditionsâ section of the Experimental Procedures. Additionally, we have re-organized some figures to help make strain usage more consistent. For example, in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> all ubiquitin levels experiments shown in the main figure correspond to the SEY6210 background, while corresponding analysis in SUB280 has been placed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1âfigure supplement 4</xref>.</p></body></sub-article></article>
