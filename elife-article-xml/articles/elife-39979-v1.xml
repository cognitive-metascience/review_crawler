critical players in a range of DNA replication, repair and damage signalling processes. They are composed of multiple BRCT domains, some of which bind phosphorylated motifs in other proteins. They thus act as multi-point adaptors bringing proteins together into functional combinations, dependent on post-translational modifications downstream of cell cycle and DNA damage signals. We have now structurally and/or biochemically characterised a sufficient number of high-affinity complexes for the conserved N-terminal region of TOPBP1 and Rad4 with diverse phospho-ligands, including human RAD9 and Treslin, and <italic>Schizosaccharomyces pombe</italic> Crb2 and Sld3, to define the determinants of BRCT domain specificity. We use this to identify and characterise previously unknown phosphorylation-dependent TOPBP1/Rad4-binding motifs in human RHNO1 and the fission yeast homologue of MDC1, Mdb1. These results provide important insights into how multiple BRCT domains within TOPBP1/Rad4 achieve selective and combinatorial binding of their multiple partner proteins.</p><p><bold>Editorial note:</bold> This article has been through an editorial process in which the authors decide how to respond to the issues raised during peer review.

In TOPBP1, this is located between BRCT domains 6 and 7, while in the yeast proteins it occurs at the C-terminus, downstream of BRCT4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Wardlaw et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>Bioinformatic analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Rappas et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Wardlaw et al., 2014</xref>) suggests that only three of the BRCT domains in the yeast TOPBP1 homologues, and four in the vertebrate TOPBP1 homologues, possess the required cluster of residues needed to bind phosphorylated peptide motifs. Despite the structural similarity of these phosphopeptide-binding BRCT domains, genetic and biochemical studies show that they are nonetheless selective and specific for the phosphopeptide sequences with which they interact (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Leung et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Leung et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Qu et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Rappas et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Sun et al., 2017</xref>). However, the structural basis for this specificity has not been defined.</p><p>To gain some insight into this, we have determined crystal structures of segments of yeast and vertebrate TOPBP1 that contain the two most N-terminal phosphopeptide binding sites (BRCT1 and BRCT2), in complex with phosphopeptides derived from a number of different known ligand proteins, including RAD9, and used this to develop consensus patterns that encapsulate the individual specificity requirements of these two independent binding sites. We have used these patterns to predict interacting phospho-peptides from putative ligand proteins in vertebrates and yeast, and have characterised their specific interactions structurally and biochemically. These data provide insights into how TOPBP1 homologues can differentiate between closely related phosphopeptide motifs, allowing them to act as multi-point scaffolds that bring ligand proteins together into specific functional assemblies for DNA replication and repair.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Structural basis for RAD9 binding to TOPBP1</title><p>Phosphorylation of RAD9 on Ser387 (or its equivalent) in its C-terminal ‘tail’ has been shown to be essential for interaction with TOPBP1, and required for an effective checkpoint response in a <italic>Xenopus</italic> system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Lee et al., 2007</xref>).

In addition to these core polar interactions with the phosphate, the side chain of RAD9-Asp386 hydrogen bonds to the side chain of cTOPBP1-Lys118. No ordered electron density was observed for the downstream Glu-Gly-Glu-Gly sequence that forms the C-terminal tetrapeptide of RAD9. Upstream of pSer387 and Asp386 (−1, relative to phosphorylated residue), the peptide backbone of the RAD9 peptide main chain forms a distorted anti-parallel β-sheet with the main chain of a loop connecting cTOPBP1 residues 137 – 141, with an additional interaction between the side chain of cTOPBP1-Asp138 and the peptide nitrogen of RAD9-Asp386 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). The effect of these main chain interactions is to twist the peptide into a tight turn, which projects the sequential side chains of RAD9 residues Leu383 (−4) and Ala384 (−3) into a hydrophobic pocket lined by the side chains of cTOPBP1 residues Lys154, Lys155, Val158, Leu162, Leu139 and Met141. All the cTOPBP1 residues involved in binding the RAD9 peptide are identical in the human protein, except Met141 which is a valine in human TOPBP1. The tight turn conformation of the RAD9 peptide is reinforced by the hydrophobic side chain of Val382 which packs in against the face of the peptide bond connecting residues Leu383 and Ala384.</p><p>To determine which RAD9 residues, in addition to the phosphorylated Ser 387, are important for binding to TOPBP1, we established a semi-quantitative peptide pull-down assay in which we systematically varied the identity of the residues at position −5, –4, −3, and −1 relative to pSer387 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). Position −3 (Ala in RAD9) retained tight binding only when substituted by valine, while −4 (Leu in RAD9) tolerated phenylalanine or isoleucine, but with reduced binding in all cases. Position −5 (Val in RAD9), showed the greatest tolerance, retaining substantial binding with a range of substitutions, including proline and polar residues such as serine or glutamine. The side chain at this position is conformationally unrestricted beyond the Cγ position and involved primarily in interactions within the RAD9 peptide itself that reinforce the tight turn conformation delivering the side-chains of residues −3 and −4 into direct interaction with TOPBP1. The unfavourability of aspartic acid at this position is likely to result from a repulsive electrostatic interaction with TOPBP1-Asp138. The aspartic acid in the −1 position, which makes a polar interaction with a lysine residue in TOPBP1, could be replaced by serine without substantial loss of binding, but replacement with leucine or lysine, which would generate a steric and/or electrostatic clash, abolished binding.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Conserved conformations of TOPBP1/Rad4 binding peptides</title><p>Although no crystal structures have been reported for phospho-peptides binding to BRCT2 of metazoan TOPBP1, we previously described the interaction of phospho-peptides from Crb2 (the fission yeast homologue of 53BP1) to both BRCT1 and BRCT2 of Rad4 (the fission yeast homologue of TOPBP1) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Qu et al., 2013</xref>).

A common feature of all TOPBP1/Rad4 BRCT1 or BRCT2 ligands so far identified, is the presence of a hydrophobic residue at −3 relative to the phosphorylated serine or threonine. In both BRCT1 and BRCT2, this residue packs into a hydrophobic recess formed by side chains projecting from the α-helix connecting the 3rd and 4th β-strand of the BRCT fold. In BRCT1 this recess is extended and is sufficiently large to accommodate two consecutive hydrophobic side chains of a peptide ligand so long as the backbone of the peptide adopts a tight turn conformation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A,B</xref>). In BRCT2, however, the size of the recess is restricted by the side chain of a highly conserved tryptophan residue (Trp158 in Rad4; Trp257 in human TOPBP1) at the C-terminal end of the α-helix, and can only accommodate a single hydrophobic side chain, requiring that the peptide chain continues in an extended β-sheet conformation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C,D</xref>).</p><fig id="fig3" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.39979.004</object-id><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>Structural basis of BRCT domain conformational preferences</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Detail of the RAD9-pSer387 peptide bound to TOPBP1-BRCT1, showing the tight turn conformation adopted by the consecutive hydrophobic residues at positions −5, –4 and −3 relative to the phosphorylated residue, that positions the side chains of the −4 and −3 residues in a pocket on the BRCT domain.

Sequences with hydrophobic residues at −3 and −4 (and often −5) as in the RAD9-pS387, Crb2-pT187, Sld3-pT636 and Treslin-pS1001 (993-DIGVVEEpSP) peptides conform to this requirement, whereas sequences with large polar side chains such as Crb2-pT235 where −4 is arginine, or Sld3-pT650 where −4 is glutamate, do not, and are restricted to binding to BRCT2. A subtler effect is seen with the Treslin-pT969 site (962-LTKSVAEpTP), which has a small polar amino acid - serine - at −4, and binds preferentially to BRCT2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>) when presented in the context of a short peptide. However, the unfavourability of the small polar serine, which unlike arginine or glutamate could at least be sterically accommodated by BRCT1, is diminished in the context of a longer peptide (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Boos et al., 2011</xref>). Binding to BRCT2 appears to be less selective beyond the requirement for a hydrophobic residue at −3. Thus, the Crb2-pT187 sequence is able to bind to Rad4-BRCT2 as well as Rad4-BRCT1 with comparable affinity, as can the Treslin-pS1001 sequence to TOPBP1-BRCT1 and TOPBP1-BRCT2. However, the ability to bind to BRCT1 does not guarantee binding to BRCT2, which may depend on the identity of the hydrophobic −3 residue. The RAD9-pS387 sequence for example, binds with low micromolar affinity to TOPBP1-BRCT1 where its −3 alanine and −4 leucine can effectively occupy the extended hydrophobic recess, but binds much less tightly to BRCT2 where only the minimal hydrophobic side chain of the −3 alanine is available to bind.</p><p>Many (but by no means all) of the sites shown to bind to TOPBP1-BRCT0,1,2 or Rad4-BRCT1,2 have a proline residue (at +1) following the phosphorylated serine or threonine, and are known (or presumed to be) targets for phosphorylation by CDKs or other proline-directed protein kinases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Boos et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Qu et al., 2013</xref>).

Our data reveal clear and distinctive specificities for ligand binding between the two phosphopeptide-binding sites in the N-terminal BRCT module, and this is also likely to be true for the conserved central BRCT module, and for the C-terminal BRCT module, which is only present in metazoa. Apart from the contentious (see above) interaction claimed for BRCT5 with the SDT repeats of MDC1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Leung et al., 2013</xref>), only two specific high-affinity interacting peptides have been identified for the central module – 406-DAFEGPpTQ-413 from the C-terminal tail of <italic>S. pombe</italic> Rad9, which binds to Rad4-BRCT4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Qu et al., 2013</xref>), and 297-TDFVPPpSP-305 from BLM which binds to TOPBP1-BRCT5 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Blackford et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Sun et al., 2017</xref>). These peptides both have a proline at −1 and a phenylalanine at −4, but further work will be required to determine the significance of these. Only a single high-affinity interaction has been validated for the canonical tandem BRCT7,8 module, with a peptide from FANCJ (aka BRIP/BACH1) containing pThr 1133 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Leung et al., 2011</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>).</p><p>Based on these patterns of specificity, it is feasible that a single TOPBP1 molecule could, for example, simultaneously bind 9-1-1 (via BRCT1) and BLM (via BRCT5), or a single Rad4 molecule bind Crb2 (via BRCT1 and 2) and 9-1-1 (via BRCT4). Of course, steric constraints imposed by the rest of the ligand protein outside the phosphopeptide motif, might prevent simultaneous interaction, but multiple combinations are possible at least in principle.</p><p>Conversely, the mapped BRCT specificities of some ligands potentially rules out their co-existence within a TOPBP1/Rad4 scaffolded complex. Thus, both RHNO1 and the RAD9 component of the 9-1-1 clamp selectively bind BRCT1 of TOPBP1 and are therefore unlikely to be simultaneously bound to the same TOPBP1 molecule, in contradiction of current models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Lindsey-Boltz et al., 2015</xref>). Similarly, Treslin and 9-1-1 in metazoa, or Sld3 and Crb2 in fission yeast, would be in competition for binding to TOPBP1/Rad4. These competitions may be resolved by differences in affinity between binding motifs - for example RHNO1-pT202 appears to bind ~10 fold tighter than RAD9-pS387 – and by regulation of the phosphorylation state of individual ligand sites by cell cycle and/or DNA damage response systems. For example, while the RAD9-pS387 site is generated by CK2, which is constitutively active throughout the cell cycle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Pinna, 2002</xref>), the potentially competing RHNO1-pT202 site has the appearance of a CDK target, and its modification and interaction with TOPBP1 might be restricted to a specific cell cycle phase. Although these models for regulation of TOPBP1/Rad4 complex formation are appealing, the situation may be further complicated by the observation that under some circumstances TOPBP1 may be able to oligomerise via interaction of an AKT-dependent phosphorylation site on one TOPBP1 molecule, with the C-terminal BRCT7,8 module of another (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Liu et al., 2006</xref>). Further work will be required to define the composition of the many different TOPBP1-scaffolded complexes that potentially occur within living cells.</p><p>Given the many roles of TOPBP1 in maintaining cell viability in the presence of the genomic instability that typically accompanies cancer progression, pharmacological disruption of TOPBP1-BRCT interactions with ligand proteins offers an attractive therapeutic approach.

However, the authors failed to describe in sufficient detail how these sites were found.

I think the authors should add a section in the Materials and methods part to describe which consensus motif sequences were used for the search and how many matching sequences were found in RHNO1 and Mdb1. For the BRCT2 ligand, besides the phosphorylatable residue, only -3 position has a requirement of being hydrophobic. Such a sequence pattern should occur many times in a protein. For example, in Mdb1, even adding the requirement of +1 position being Pro, there are two other sites besides T113 that can match the consensus: S426 (421-FVILGSP-427) and T85 (80-VRINDTP-86). I suspect that other criteria need to be applied to further filtering the candidate sites. In the case of RHNO1, the authors showed that sequence conservation can be used as a further support.

I think a title like &quot;Structural basis of phosphopeptide ligand binding specificity of BRCT domains of TOPBP1/Rad4&quot; may better reflect the main findings of this paper.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic> </p><p>Day et al. presented crystal structures of TOPBP1/Rad4 BRCT0,1,2 domain bound to phospho-peptides from RAD9 and Sld3 and compared the binding modes with existing structures of Rad4 BRCT1,2 domain bound to phospho-peptides to define the determinants of BRCT1 and BRCT2 domain specificity. They found that most peptides contain a preferred phospho-TP/SP motif for proline-directed kinase. Peptides that bind to BRCT1 undergo a tight turn conformation at -3 to -4 position and harbour hydrophobic residues at -3 to -5 position. Surprisingly BRCT2 contains a conserved tryptophan that precludes the tight turn conformation and seems to be less selective at -4 and -5 position as long as -3 is a hydrophobic residue with the exception of an alanine. Using this information, the authors identified novel TOPBP1-BRCT1 binding site in RHNO1 and Rad4-BRCT2 binding site in Mdb1 and validated the binding mode by fluorescence polarisation assays and a crystal structure of Rad4 BRCT1,2 in complex with Mdb-pT113 peptide.</p><p>Strength: The data are solid and the manuscript is well written. The findings are interesting as it defined the rules for TOPBP1/Rad4 BRCT1 and BRCT2 domain phospho-peptide specificity. This should facilitate future studies directed at identification of other phospho-ligands and understanding of how TOPBP1/Rad4 engage multiple binding partners.</p><p>Weakness: Lack of validation of the novel-binding site in cells. It would strengthen the hypothesis by confirming the interaction between TOPBP1 and RHNO1 in cells with pull down experiments using RHNO1 mutants such as T202A or VLV mutant.</p><p>Minor comments:</p><p>1) It would be useful to mention how K155E and K250E disrupt the BRCT1 and BRCT2 phospho-peptide binding site, respectively, when discussing Treslin in the second paragraph of the subsection “Structural basis for peptide selectivity by BRCT1 and BRCT2” rather than later in the last paragraph of the subsection “Identification of the TOPBP1-BRCT1,2 binding site in RHNO1”, for clarity.</p><p>2) Please show the Mdb1 pS216, pT218 peptide sequence in Figure 5. Perhaps the sequence is obvious that it doesn't bind BRCT1,2 based on the prediction.</p><p>3) The symbol legends for all fluorescence polarisation curves are not displayed correctly. Please specify what ND stands for.</p><p>4) In Figure 5C, please explain &quot;inaccurate&quot; and how 20-fold reduction (subsection “Identification of a novel Rad4-BRCT1,2 binding site in Mdb1”, fourth paragraph) was derived when comparing the Kd of BRCT1,2 WT and K151E mutant for Mdb1 pT113 peptide.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.39979.026</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p>Reviewer #1:</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Day et al. describe a detailed interaction study of the BRCT domains in mammalian TOPBP1 and in the fission yeast homologue RAD4 with phosphopeptides.

I think a title like &quot;Structural basis of phosphopeptide ligand binding specificity of BRCT domains of TOPBP1/Rad4&quot; may better reflect the main findings of this paper.</p></disp-quote><p>We would prefer to keep the title as it is.</p><p>Reviewer #3:</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Day et al. presented crystal structures of TOPBP1/Rad4 BRCT0,1,2 domain bound to phospho-peptides from RAD9 and Sld3 and compared the binding modes with existing structures of Rad4 BRCT1,2 domain bound to phospho-peptides to define the determinants of BRCT1 and BRCT2 domain specificity. They found that most peptides contain a preferred phospho-TP/SP motif for proline-directed kinase. Peptides that bind to BRCT1 undergo a tight turn conformation at -3 to -4 position and harbour hydrophobic residues at -3 to -5 position. Surprisingly BRCT2 contains a conserved tryptophan that precludes the tight turn conformation and seems to be less selective at -4 and -5 position as long as -3 is a hydrophobic residue with the exception of an alanine. Using this information, the authors identified novel TOPBP1-BRCT1 binding site in RHNO1 and Rad4-BRCT2 binding site in Mdb1 and validated the binding mode by fluorescence polarisation assays and a crystal structure of Rad4 BRCT1,2 in complex with Mdb-pT113 peptide.</p><p>Strength: The data are solid and the manuscript is well written. The findings are interesting as it defined the rules for TOPBP1/Rad4 BRCT1 and BRCT2 domain phospho-peptide specificity. This should facilitate future studies directed at identification of other phospho-ligands and understanding of how TOPBP1/Rad4 engage multiple binding partners.</p><p>Weakness: Lack of validation of the novel-binding site in cells. It would strengthen the hypothesis by confirming the interaction between TOPBP1 and RHNO1 in cells with pull down experiments using RHNO1 mutants such as T202A or VLV mutant.</p></disp-quote><p>This point has not escaped our notice. However, this is not a straightforward binary interaction system in which the kind of simple pull-down experiment the reviewer suggests, will be informative. The current understanding of RHNO1, is that it interacts with TOPBP1 – most likely through the phosphorylation site we identify here – but it also interacts with the 9-1-1 checkpoint clamp, which itself interacts directly with TOPBP1 independently of RHNO1. Thus, TOPBP1, 9-1-1 and RHNO1 are apices of an interaction triangle in which pull-down of any apex will co-precipitate both other apices. Thus, even if a RHNO1 T202A mutation prevented RHNO1 phosphorylation in vivo and thereby disrupted the RHNO1-TOPBP1 ‘edge’ of the interaction triangle, as our in vitro data would predict, the interaction of RHNO1 with 9-1-1 would still allow co-precipitation of TOPBP1 through the high-affinity RAD9 – TOPBP1 interaction. As part of our ongoing studies of this system, we have now mapped the regions of RHNO1 that mediate its interaction with different components of 9-1-1 at least in vitro, and are developing an RHNO1 CRISPR/Cas9 knockout cell line into which RHNO1 constructs with defined mutations can be engineered and their interactions and functionality assessed. Along with a phosphospecific antibody to RHNO1-pThr202, which we are also developing, this will allow us to properly test the contribution of the pThr202 site to RHNO1 – TOPBP1 interaction, and fully characterise the role of RHNO1 in the 9-1-1 – TOPBP1 checkpoint system. Clearly this is a substantial piece of work in its own right that goes far beyond the scope of this current manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Minor comments:</p><p>1) It would be useful to mention how K155E and K250E disrupt the BRCT1 and BRCT2 phospho-peptide binding site, respectively, when discussing Treslin in the second paragraph of the subsection “Structural basis for peptide selectivity by BRCT1 and BRCT2” rather than later in the last paragraph of the subsection “Identification of the TOPBP1-BRCT1,2 binding site in RHNO1”, for clarity.</p></disp-quote><p>We don’t really see a suitable place to include this as the reviewer suggests, but to clarify the purpose of these charge-reversal mutations, we have expanded the preamble to the experimental description in the last paragraph of the subsection “Identification of the TOPBP1-BRCT1,2 binding site in RHNO1”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Please show the Mdb1 pS216, pT218 peptide sequence in Figure 5.

This is rather confusing, and so we have removed the fitted curve and now show the data points only as Not Determined (ND). The 20-fold is a reference to the lower end of the range of Kds that can be extracted from this inaccurate data. As we can’t assign a reliable value to this weak dose response, we have amended the text in the fourth paragraph of the subsection “Identification of a novel Rad4-BRCT1,2 binding site in Mdb1”, to be qualitative rather than quantitative.</p></body></sub-article></article>
