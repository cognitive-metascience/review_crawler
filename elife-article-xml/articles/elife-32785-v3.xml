types. How these combinations of TFs identify and activate their target sequences remains poorly understood. Here, we identify the <italic>cis</italic>-regulatory transcriptional code that controls the differentiation of serotonergic HSN neurons in <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic>. Activation of the HSN transcriptome is directly orchestrated by a collective of six TFs. Binding site clusters for this TF collective form a regulatory signature that is sufficient for de novo identification of HSN neuron functional enhancers. Among <italic>C. elegans</italic> neurons, the HSN transcriptome most closely resembles that of mouse serotonergic neurons. Mouse orthologs of the HSN TF collective also regulate serotonergic differentiation and can functionally substitute for their worm counterparts which suggests deep homology. Our results identify rules governing the regulatory landscape of a critically important neuronal type in two species separated by over 700 million years.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.32785.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>All cells in the body essentially share the same DNA, despite looking very different and playing a range of roles. The reason that cell types are so different from one another is because of the way they interpret the DNA. Each different type of cell uses a specific subset of the genes within the genome. The part of the DNA that controls which cell will use which genes and when is called the regulatory genome; this DNA is not translated into proteins.</p><p>The regulatory genome is much less well understood than the protein-coding genome. At present, when a new species is discovered, it is often possible to sequence its DNA and deduce where the protein-coding genes are and what roles they might play. However, it is not yet possible to do the same for the regulatory genome. Finding a way to do this is an important step towards understanding when and where each of the organism’s genes is active.</p><p>Lloret-Fernández, Maicas, Mora-Martínez et al. focused on the regulatory genome of nerve cells that use a chemical messenger called serotonin in the nematode worm <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic>. First, they studied mutations in six genes that code for transcription factors that are active in this cell type. Transcription factors are proteins that identify and bind to specific regions of the genome to control the activity of nearby genes. These six mutants failed to correctly activate the regulatory genome of this nerve cell, which was measured using a genetic approach that caused the nerves to glow green under a microscope when the regulatory genome was active.</p><p>Further experiments then confirmed that all six transcription factors must act together to identify and activate the regulatory genome in this particular nerve cell. The fact that the DNA sites that these transcription factors bind are clustered close to each other means they can be used as a marker to help decode the active regulatory genome of this class of nerve cell.</p><p>This is a small step towards understanding how the regulatory genome works. Comparisons with similar nerve cells from mammals found that the equivalent transcription factors have the same role, suggesting that they may be broadly conserved across species. Understanding the regulatory genome better could eventually lead to new treatments for certain genetic conditions, as many mutations associated with diseases appear outside the protein-coding genome.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>neuronal differentiation</kwd><kwd>cis-regulatory logic</kwd><kwd>transcription factors</kwd><kwd>serotonergic neurons</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>C. elegans</italic></kwd><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100003329</institution-id><institution>Ministerio de Economía y Competitividad</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>SAF2014-56877-R</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Lloret-Fernández</surname><given-names>Carla</given-names></name><name><surname>Maicas</surname><given-names>Miren</given-names></name><name><surname>Mora-Martínez</surname><given-names>Carlos</given-names></name><name><surname>Jimeno-Martín</surname><given-names>Ángela</given-names></name><name><surname>Chirivella</surname><given-names>Laura</given-names></name><name><surname>Flames</surname><given-names>Nuria</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000781</institution-id><institution>European Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>ERC Stg 2011-281920</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Lloret-Fernández</surname><given-names>Carla</given-names></name><name><surname>Maicas</surname><given-names>Miren</given-names></name><name><surname>Mora-Martínez</surname><given-names>Carlos</given-names></name><name><surname>Jimeno-Martín</surname><given-names>Ángela</given-names></name><name><surname>Chirivella</surname><given-names>Laura</given-names></name><name><surname>Flames</surname><given-names>Nuria</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100003359</institution-id><institution>Generalitat Valenciana</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>ACIF/2013/087</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Lloret-Fernández</surname><given-names>Carla</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100003176</institution-id><institution>Ministerio de Educación, Cultura y Deporte</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>FPU14/02651</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Mora-Martínez</surname><given-names>Carlos</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100003359</institution-id><institution>Generalitat Valenciana</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>ACIF/2015/398</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Jimeno-Martín</surname><given-names>Ángela</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The collective action of six transcription factors selects and activates the regulatory regions of the HSN serotonergic neuron effector genes constituting a signature that can be used for the novo identification of HSN expressed genes.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Cell identities are characterized by the expression of specific transcriptomes that are activated through cell-type-specific regulatory landscapes. Large efforts have been made to identify functional enhancers in different tissues and developmental stages. The approaches include the occupancy of combinations of transcription factors (TFs), identifying DNA regions displaying open chromatin states, analyzing specific histone marks and assessing enhancer function by transgenesis in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Junion et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Mo et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Nord et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Pattabiraman et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">Visel et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib110">Zinzen et al., 2009</xref>). These studies have revealed a highly dynamic organization of active enhancers that change depending on the cell type and developmental stage. However, to date, it is unclear what features of the DNA sequences distinguish enhancer regions from the rest of the genome. The identification of such features is critical both for understanding fundamental biological processes such as cell fate specification, as well as for biomedicine, given that most disease-associated mutations are thought to be located within regulatory sequences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Mathelier et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Nishizaki and Boyle, 2017</xref>).</p><p>TFs are the main regulators of enhancer function. Each enhancer is bound by specific combinations of TFs that will either activate or repress transcription (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Reiter et al., 2017</xref>). The distribution of TF-binding sites (TFBS) has been studied in detail in only a few enhancers. For example, a study of <italic>sparkling</italic>, a specific enhancer of the <italic>Drosophila</italic> Pax2 gene, revealed it to be densely packed with TFBS that required specific arrangements for its functionality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Swanson et al., 2010</xref>). However, these one-by-one approaches are not able to reveal any general molecular logic underlying cell-type-specific regulatory landscapes. Chromatin immunoprecipitation combined with deep sequencing (ChIP-seq) has been used to generate genome-scale binding profiles of specific TFs. It is now clear that TF-binding profiles are dynamic during cell differentiation and vary in related species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Garber et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Heinz et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Khoueiry et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Nord et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Stefflova et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib103">Wilczyński and Furlong, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib110">Zinzen et al., 2009</xref>). However, it is unclear what distinguishes TFBS actually bound by the TF from those that are unoccupied. Moreover, despite the fact that only a small fraction of bound TFBS are located in enhancers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Kwasnieski et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Pattabiraman et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib102">Whitfield et al., 2012</xref>), the molecular organization that distinguishes functional enhancers from the rest of non-coding regions is still unknown. Collective binding of several TFs is emerging as an important feature that distinguishes TFBS at functional enhancers from other genomic regions bound by individual TFs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Junion et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Khoueiry et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Mazzoni et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib110">Zinzen et al., 2009</xref>). However, it is still unclear how these combinations of TFs are collectively recruited to and activate cell-type-specific regulatory landscapes.</p><p>The study of the transcriptional regulatory mechanisms underlying neuronal subtype specification in vivo in complex model organisms, such as rodents, is a challenging task. Here, we take advantage of the simple model organism <italic>C. elegans</italic> to study neuron type specification in vivo. <italic>C. elegans</italic> is especially suitable for transcriptional regulatory studies because its cell lineage is fully described, it is easy to genetically manipulate and its genome is very compact (despite containing a similar number of genes to the human genome) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Gerstein et al., 2010</xref>). In this work, we focus on the study of the transcriptional regulatory logic of serotonergic neurons. Serotonergic neurons are present in all eumetazoan groups and are universally defined by their ability to synthesize and release serotonin (5HT) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Flames and Hobert, 2011</xref>). They regulate multiple processes and their dysfunction has been linked to bipolar disorder, depression, anxiety, anorexia and schizophrenia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Deneris and Wyler, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Mathelier et al., 2015</xref>). Several TFs are known to be involved in mammalian serotonergic differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Deneris and Wyler, 2012</xref>). However, little is known about their function in the regulation of specific serotonergic neuron enhancers. Here, we focus on this clinically relevant and highly conserved neuronal subtype, and exploit the amenability of <italic>C. elegans</italic> to unravel the rules governing the activation of the serotonergic transcriptome. This work reveals the phylogenetically conserved action of a collection of TFs on the selection of a specific regulatory landscape from the genome and allows for the identification of neuron subtype specific functional enhancers merely based on the presence of the TF collective regulatory signature.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Transcription factors from six different families are required for HSN neuron terminal differentiation</title><p>Serotonergic neurons are characterized by the coordinated expression of a battery of phylogenetically conserved enzymes and transporters known as the 5HT pathway genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). <italic>C. elegans</italic> adult hermaphrodites contain three functionally distinct serotonergic neuron subclasses: the NSM neurosecretory neuron, the ADF chemosensory neuron and the HSN motor neuron (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>), which arise from different progenitors and, with the exception of the 5HT pathway genes, express different effector genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>).

We did not observe precocious expression of any of the analyzed terminal features in any of the single mutant backgrounds, suggesting that the HSN TF combination acts mainly as activator of transcription.

Some HSN TFs are expressed embryonically (such as UNC-86, HLH-3 or EGL18). SEM-4 is widely expressed in the embryo in the area were HSN is located, although it is likely to be expressed at this early stage in HSN, we could not unequivocally identify it. In contrast, AST-1 and EGL-46 initiate their expression at different postnatal stages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). Interestingly, HLH-3 shows two waves of expression: it is present in the mother cell of HSN (around 280 min of embryonic development, see lineage in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>) and its expression becomes fainter in postmitotic HSN and PHB neurons (data not shown). At first larval stage (L1), HLH-3 expression is undetectable in HSN and expression reappears at third larval stage (L3), preceding AST-1 onset of expression and HSN maturation and is quickly downregulated at the end of L4 [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref> and (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Doonan et al., 2008</xref>)].</p><p>Thus, to further study the temporal requirements of HLH-3 activity in HSN differentiation, we induced HLH-3 expression at early L4 state in <italic>hlh-3</italic> mutants.

Heterochronic genes have been described to regulate the onset of HSN axon extension (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Olsson-Carter and Slack, 2010</xref>), although the molecular mechanisms underlying this process are unknown. AST-1 and HLH-3 expression correlates with HSN maturation suggesting they might have a role in determining the onset of this process. We used an early active HSN promoter to induce <italic>ast-1</italic> and <italic>hlh-3</italic> expression precociously from first larval stage (L1). Our results show that AST-1 significantly advances <italic>tph-1</italic> expression to L2-L3 larval stages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). On the contrary, early <italic>hlh-3</italic> induced expression either alone or in combination with <italic>ast-1</italic> leads to both a delay in onset and expression defects of <italic>tph-1</italic> reporter gene (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). Despite <italic>tph-1</italic> expression defects, HSN was still present as we could identify it by differential interference contrast (DIC) (data not shown). These results suggest that AST-1 activity is an important determinant of HSN maturation onset. We also found that <italic>lin-41</italic> heterochronic mutants show <italic>ast-1</italic> expression defects in the HSN (data not shown) further supporting the role of AST-1 as a downstream effector controlling HSN maturation timing.</p><p>Additionally, these experiments underscored the importance of the dynamic regulation of <italic>hlh-3</italic> expression. HLH-3 is a proneural TF of the asc family, ortholog of mouse Ascl1 and <italic>Drosophila</italic> Scute (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). Proneural factors regulate both neural progenitor specification and neuronal differentiation and their functions are conserved through evolution from cnidarians to mammals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Guillemot and Hassan, 2017</xref>). Ascl1 is required for correct mouse serotonergic specification (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Pattyn et al., 2004</xref>) and its activity is required to induce serotonergic fate from human fibroblasts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Vadodaria et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib106">Xu et al., 2016</xref>). HLH-3 shows several features common to ASCL1: (1) HLH-3 is transiently expressed in all neuronal progenitors and differentiating neuroblasts and it is required for correct differentiation of several neuronal types, including HSN (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Doonan et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Gruner et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Krause et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Luo and Horvitz, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Murgan et al., 2015</xref>). (2) Both HLH-3 and ASCL1 are required to induce correct neurotransmitter identity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Pattyn et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Sommer et al., 1995</xref>). (3) As will be explained in a later section, Ascl1 can rescue HSN differentiation defects of <italic>hlh-3</italic> mutants, supporting its functional conservation. (4) As would be expected for a proneural gene, HLH-3 is also required for correct expression of panneuronal features in the HSN (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>, <italic>rab-3</italic> expression defects). (5) We find that HLH-3 expression needs to be tightly temporally regulated to correctly induce HSN fate. Temporal regulation of ASCL1 and SCUTE activities is also required for correct neuronal specification (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Andersen et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Imayoshi et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Quan et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Urbán et al., 2016</xref>).

Taken together, our data suggests that HLH-3 acts as a proneural factor in HSN specification.

However, UNC-86 is a notable exception as it is required for the expression of most factors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). Noteworthy, SEM-4, that is downstream UNC-86, is also required for AST-1 and partially for HLH-3 expression. Thus, UNC-86 effects could be, at least in part due to SEM-4 regulation. Finally, additional more modest effects are also observed between other TF pairs, such as the regulation of AST-1 and EGL-46 by HLH-3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref> and summarized in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>).</p><p>Since TFs required for neuronal terminal differentiation are often also required to maintain the correct differentiated state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Deneris and Hobert, 2014</xref>), we explored whether this was also the case for the HSN TFs.

We performed site-directed mutagenesis on predicted TFBS in these CRMs and analyzed in vivo the effect of the mutations.</p><p>Our analysis, explained in detail below, revealed that all members of the HSN TF combination act directly upon 5HT pathway gene CRMs. Each CRM has a different disposition of TFBS arrangements supporting the flexible function of the HSN TFs. Additionally, we found examples of redundancy between TFBS that provide robustness of expression to the system and whose functionality can only be revealed in the context of smaller CRMs or mutant backgrounds. Notably, redundancy is specific to the CRM architecture as two TFs can act redundantly in one CRM but not in others. Finally, we also found that short HSN CRMs that lack TFBS for some HSN TF members can drive partially penetrant HSN expression, while longer CRMs with functional binding sites for additional members of HSN TFs drive more robust expression. This direct but flexible action of a combination of TFs to directly regulate cell type specification has been previously termed ‘TF collective’ mode of regulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Junion et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Spitz and Furlong, 2012</xref>), accordingly, we termed this set of TFs the ‘HSN TF collective’.</p><p>The HSN minimal CRM for <italic>tph-1</italic> (TPH) (<italic>tph-1prom2,</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>) contained predicted binding sites for all six HSN TF members (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>).

Indeed, full-length reporter (<italic>cat-1prom1)</italic> expression was affected in <italic>egl-46</italic> mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>).

Thus, EGL-18 directly regulates <italic>cat-1</italic> expression but its loss can be compensated in the context of a large regulatory region by other unknown factors. We confirmed EGL-18 direct binding to the <italic>cat-1</italic> promoter in vitro using electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSA) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2</xref>).</p><p>The HSN minimal CRM for <italic>bas-1</italic> (AADC) (<italic>bas-1prom18,</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>) contained predicted binding sites for four TFs from the HSN TF collective: ETS, POU, GATA and SPALT TFs, but lacked any predicted INSM- or HLH-binding sites. Reporter analyses of the minimal CRM revealed that ETS-, POU- and SPALT- but not GATA-binding sites were required for expression in HSN (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>). Similar to <italic>cat-1</italic>, a <italic>bas-1</italic> functional binding site for several TFs was detectable only in the context of the minimal small CRMs while there was no defect in expression of the full-length reporter in the corresponding TF mutant backgrounds. For example, we found functional ETS- (<italic>ast-1</italic>) binding sites in <italic>bas-1prom18</italic> while expression of the full-length <italic>bas-1</italic> reporter was unaffected in <italic>ast-1 (ot417)</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5G</xref>). As <italic>ast-1 (ot417)</italic> is a hypomorphic allele, we confirmed that <italic>ast-1</italic> is not required for <italic>bas-1</italic> full-length reporter expression by mosaic analyses with a rescuing array in a null <italic>ast-1</italic> allele (<italic>hd92</italic>) (87 out of 87 <italic>ast-1</italic> null HSN neurons expressed <italic>bas-1</italic>).

We also confirmed AST-1 binding to the <italic>bas-1</italic> promoter in vitro using EMSA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2</xref>). Altogether, these results suggest that AST-1 can bind and activate transcription from the <italic>bas-1</italic> minimal CRM as can EGL-18 from <italic>cat-1</italic> minimal CRM. In both cases, however, other factors can compensate for their loss by activating transcription from regulatory sequences outside the minimal CRMs. This genetic redundancy for some members of the HSN TF collective at specific 5HT pathway genes possibly acts as a mechanism to ensure that differentiation is robust.</p><p>Although HLH-3 (bHLH) and EGL-46 (INSM) were required for full-length <italic>bas-1</italic> expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>), no functional HLH- or INSM-binding sites were found in the minimal <italic>bas-1</italic> CRM (<italic>bas-1prom18)</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>). Similar to the minimal <italic>cat-1</italic> CRM (<italic>cat-1prom14)</italic>, GFP expression of <italic>bas-1prom18</italic> was partially penetrant (ranging from 38% to 83% depending on the transgenic line, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>), while a longer construct (<italic>bas-1prom13)</italic> was more robustly expressed (90% expression in all lines, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>). <italic>bas-1prom13</italic> contains bHLH- and INSM-binding sites and INMS-binding site mutation, but not bHLH mutation, leads to expression defects which suggest a direct role for EGL-46 in robust <italic>bas-1</italic> expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F</xref>).</p><p>We did not find functional GATA-binding sites in <italic>bas-1</italic> CRMs, and <italic>egl-18</italic> (GATA) mutants did not show <italic>bas-1</italic> expression defects either. This would suggest that GATA factors are dispensable for the regulation of this gene. However, as we had already observed genetic redundancy in other CRMs, we considered that this could also be the case for <italic>bas-1</italic> regulation. First, we analyzed <italic>bas-1</italic> minimal CRM expression (<italic>bas-1prom18</italic>) in <italic>egl-18(ok290)</italic> mutants and found that EGL-18 was required for its normal expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5G</xref>). Next, to determine whether the role for GATA factors in <italic>bas-1</italic> expression was direct, we analyzed the expression of a <italic>bas-1</italic> minimal CRM carrying GATA-binding site mutations (<italic>bas-1prom78</italic>) in the <italic>ast-1(ot417)</italic> genetic background. Interestingly, while GATA-binding site mutations had no significant effects in wild type worms, we found a complete loss of expression of this construct in <italic>ast-1(ot417)</italic> mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5H</xref>).

Interestingly, the same pair of TFs acting synergistically in the regulation of one reporter can show a different genetic relationship in the regulation of a different gene (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E–H</xref>). For example, while <italic>unc-86</italic> acts synergistically with <italic>sem-4</italic> and <italic>hlh-3</italic> in the regulation of <italic>cat-1</italic> expression, it shows additive effects with both TFs in the regulation of <italic>tph-1</italic> reporter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E,F</xref>).

We analyzed upstream and intronic sequences of HSN expressed genes in search of DNA windows (up to 700 bp length) containing at least one position weight matrix match for all six members of the HSN TF collective (termed the ‘HSN regulatory signature’) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>). We found that known HSN expressed genes contained large upstream and intronic sequences, thus, for comparison purposes, we built ten thousand sets of 96 random genes with similar upstream and intronic length distribution. A significantly higher percentage of HSN expressed genes contain the HSN regulatory signature compared to the random sets of genes (p&lt;0.05) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig7sdata1">Figure 7—source data 1</xref>).</p><p>Studies in <italic>Drosophila</italic> and vertebrates have shown that functional enhancers that are bound by combinations of TFs show higher interspecific conservation compared to enhancers bound by single TFs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Ballester et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Khoueiry et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Stefflova et al., 2013</xref>). Thus, we performed a similar motif search in <italic>C. brenneri, C. remanei</italic>, <italic>C. briggsae</italic> and <italic>C. japonica</italic> genomes and calculated, for each <italic>C. elegans</italic> gene, the proportion of its orthologs that had, in its upstream or intronic sequence, at least one 700 bp window with binding sites for all the six TFs. We considered the HSN regulatory signature as phylogenetically conserved when orthologous genes in all species displayed the signature within their upstream or intronic regions. We found that the inclusion of the conservation criteria in this analysis slightly increased the difference between HSN and the random sets of genes (p&lt;0.01) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>).</p><p>The higher prevalence of conserved signature in HSN expressed genes supports the idea that the HSN TF collective broadly selects the HSN transcriptome. We tested HSN regulatory signature windows from four of the known HSN expressed genes by in vivo reporter assays and confirmed that they correspond to active HSN enhancers (three out of four tested contructs show HSN expression, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig7sdata2">Figure 7—source data 2</xref>). Of note, <italic>C. elegans</italic> functional HSN regulatory signature windows do not show a high level of sequence conservation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1</xref>), which is in agreement with rapid evolution of regulatory sequences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Villar et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>Next, we examined the distribution of the HSN regulatory signature windows across the entire <italic>C. elegans</italic> genome. Remarkably, we found that it was preferentially found in the putative regulatory sequences of genes known to be expressed in neurons or that have a neuronal function compared to the rest of the genome, as would be expected for genes controlled by the HSN TF collective (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref>). Filtering of conserved regulatory signatures further increased the difference between ‘neuronal’ and ‘non-neuronal’ genomes, which adds support to its functionality (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref>). Gene ontology analysis of all genes in the <italic>C. elegans</italic> genome with HSN regulatory signature revealed enrichment of processes controlling transcription, axon guidance, synaptic transmission and oviposition, all characteristic of HSN differentiation and function (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D</xref>).</p><p>Our experimental data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>), in agreement to the TF collective model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Spitz and Furlong, 2012</xref>), shows that the presence of TFBS for all TF collective members is not required in specific enhancer contexts. Thus, we aimed to analyze if HSN regulatory windows lacking TF-binding sites for one or two TF classes show also an enriched distribution in HSN expressed genes and in the neuronal genome. We find that, in contrast to the six-motif HSN regulatory signature, windows containing only five or four types of HSN TF motifs are not preferentially found in HSN expressed genes compared to the 10.000 random sets of genes with or without filtering for conservation (p&gt;0.05 in all conditions) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s2">Figure 7—figure supplement 2</xref>). Additionally, genomic distribution of the HSN regulatory signature is less enriched in neuronal genes compared to non-neuronal genes when including windows lacking one or two HSN TF collective motifs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s2">Figure 7—figure supplement 2</xref>). Moreover, while only 25% of the genes (4,968) contain at least one assigned six-motif regulatory window, regulatory windows with five or more motifs are found in 52% of the genes (10,415) and 72% of the genes (14,325) contain windows with four or more motifs. Finally, GO comparative analysis shows that genes with assigned 6-motif HSN regulatory windows show the highest enrichment in terms related to HSN function and that the additional GO terms obtained when including windows lacking either one or two HSN TF motifs are not related to neuronal functions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s2">Figure 7—figure supplement 2</xref>). Altogether, our data shows that the most prevalent mark of HSN expressed genes is the regulatory signature with all six TFBS. Even if some HSN enhancers can still be functional with a partial complement of HSN TF collective binding sites, at the genomic level, including enhancers with missing TFBS abolishes cell type specificity.</p><p>Next, we aimed to identify new genes expressed in HSN based solely on the presence of the HSN regulatory signature. To this end, we randomly selected 35 neuronal genes with a conserved HSN regulatory signature and generated transgenic reporter lines. We found that 13 out of the 35 constructs (37%) showed GFP expression in HSN (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7E</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig7sdata2">Figure 7—source data 2</xref>), while none of 10 randomly picked similar-sized intergenic regions of neuronal genes lacking the HSN regulatory signature led to reporter expression in HSN (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig7sdata2">Figure 7—source data 2</xref>). Importantly, all reporter constructs, including the negative controls, did drive GFP expression in a variable set of additional neurons, which might be due to the compact nature of the <italic>C. elegans</italic> genome.</p><p>Finally, to analyze if the activity of the identified HSN regulatory windows was under the control of the HSN TF collective we crossed them into the <italic>unc-86(n846)</italic> mutant. The expression of 12 out of 15 reporter constructs (80%) was significantly reduced in <italic>unc-86</italic> mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s3">Figure 7—figure supplement 3</xref>). Of note, onset of expression of the HSN regulatory window reporters can be used to predict the effect of <italic>unc-86</italic> mutation: while all reporters with L4 onset of expression are strongly dependent on <italic>unc-86</italic>, HSN regulatory windows that initiate expression at earlier stages show more modest dependency on <italic>unc-86</italic> function (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s3">Figure 7—figure supplement 3</xref>).</p><p>Our results reveal that the presence of a conserved HSN regulatory signature can be successfully used to de novo identify HSN expressed genes. However, our high level of false positives (63%) indicates that the signature itself is not sufficient to induce HSN expression. Additional TFs might be part of the HSN TF collective and thus active HSN regulatory signature windows would contain additional TFBS. Repressive elements or chromatin accessibility could also block HSN expression of non-functional HSN regulatory signature windows, indeed members of the SWI/SNF chromatin remodeling complex are required for correct HSN terminal differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib100">Weinberg et al., 2013</xref>). It is also possible that specific syntactic rules (TFBS order, distance and disposition) discriminate functional from non-functional HSN regulatory signature windows. Future studies will help identify additional players and rules for HSN terminal differentiation.</p></sec><sec id="s2-8"><title>Deep homology between HSN and mouse raphe serotonergic neurons</title><p>Mouse orthologs for four out of the six TFs of the HSN TF collective are involved in mammalian serotonergic specification: ASCL1 (bHLH TF ortholog of HLH-3) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Pattyn et al., 2004</xref>), GATA2/3 (GATA TF ortholog of EGL-18) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Haugas et al., 2016</xref>), INSM1 (Zn Finger Insm TF ortholog of EGL-46) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Jacob et al., 2009</xref>) and PET1 (ETS TF ortholog of AST-1) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Hendricks et al., 2003</xref>).

We found that numerous TFs (here we identify six but likely additional TFs are required) act in conjunction to directly activate the HSN regulatory landscape. HSN TF collective acts through the HSN regulatory signature, which is found preferentially associated to genes of the neuronal genome that are related to HSN function.</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>Regulation of <italic>C. elegans</italic> neuron specification is unexpectedly complex</title><p>Neuronal terminal differentiation programs have been best characterized in <italic>C. elegans.</italic> So far, relatively simple TF combinations, composed of two or three members, were shown to be required, and in some contexts sufficient, to select specific neuronal types. These TFs have been termed Terminal Selectors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Doitsidou et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Serrano-Saiz et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Van Buskirk and Sternberg, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib108">Zhang et al., 2002</xref>). In some cases, additional TFs act together with Terminal Selectors to partially modulate the transcriptomes of specific neuronal subclasses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Kerk et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Kratsios et al., 2017</xref>). Accordingly, it has been suggested that, in <italic>C. elegans,</italic> a rather simple organization of CRMs control the expression of neuronal terminal features (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Holmberg and Perlmann, 2012</xref>). Our results, however, demonstrate a more complex scenario in the regulation of the HSN transcriptome. We have identified six TFs required for HSN terminal differentiation acting directly upon the regulatory regions of HSN expressed genes. Nonetheless, additional unidentified factors are likely to compose the HSN TF collective. We found that the HSN TF collective includes a proneural TF (<italic>hlh-3</italic>) that is required to initiate HSN differentiation but whose expression, like all proneural factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Guillemot and Hassan, 2017</xref>), is not maintained in the mature neuron. Future experiments should determine if, as has been proven for its mouse ortholog Ascl1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib98">Wapinski et al., 2013</xref>), <italic>hlh-3</italic> acts as a pioneer factor for HSN terminal differentiation. In light of our findings, nematode neuronal terminal differentiation programs are not necessarily simpler than those found in vertebrates, as previously proposed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Holmberg and Perlmann, 2012</xref>).</p><p>Considering the technical advantages of <italic>C. elegans</italic> as a simple model system, our work is an example on how its study may help to identify rules of terminal differentiation in eumetazoa. The combination of our extensive <italic>cis</italic>-regulatory analysis and the double mutant characterization allowed us to describe the flexible action of the HSN TF collective that can activate enhancers with very different dispositions of TFBS. This flexibility is also made evident by the specific synergistic relationships in the regulation of some enhancers and not others. We propose that these redundant actions, globally considered, confer robustness of expression to the system.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>The HSN regulatory signature identifies HSN expressed genes</title><p>Co-binding of specific combinations of TFs to the same genomic region, assessed by ChIP-seq, has been successfully used to identify, de novo, cell-type-specific enhancers in <italic>Drosophila</italic> embryos (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Busser et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Junion et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib110">Zinzen et al., 2009</xref>). However, this approach fails to address why specific genomic regions work as enhancers. Recently, massively parallel reporter assays (MPRA) have been used to identify generic rules of enhancer function. The analysis of synthetic enhancers revealed that highest levels of expression are achieved with clusters of binding sites for different TFs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Smith et al., 2013</xref>). Another MPRA study has analyzed enhancer activity of regions bound by the adipocyte terminal selector PPARγ and has determined that the best predictor for enhancer functionality is the presence of nearby TFBS for more than 30 different TFs expressed in adipocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Grossman et al., 2017</xref>). In accordance to this complex scenario of combinatorial action of multiple TFs in the global selection of cell type regulatory landscapes, we found that clusters of bioinformatically predicted TFBS for the HSN TF collective can be used for the de novo identification of HSN enhancers. Of note, our analysis still shows a high rate of false positives, which suggests that additional features are present in HSN functional enhancers. Future analyses based on more complex paradigms should facilitate the identification of such features that could include additional TFBS (or the absence of repressor sites) or specific syntactic rules.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Deep homology, molecular homology and functional homology between <italic>C. elegans</italic> HSN and mouse serotonergic neurons</title><p>The diversity of <italic>C. elegans</italic> serotonergic neuronal classes (NSM, ADF and HSN) contrasts with that of tetrapod vertebrates, in which serotonergic neurons are limited to the raphe system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Flames and Hobert, 2011</xref>). Other chordates contain additional serotonergic populations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Flames and Hobert, 2011</xref>) and serotonergic subclass diversity is also prevalent in other phyla such as arthropoda and mollusca (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Flames and Hobert, 2011</xref>), which suggests a loss of serotonergic diversity in the tetrapod branch. As in nematodes, serotonergic subclass specification in other organisms is likely to be independently regulated. For instance, in <italic>Drosophila</italic>, the TFs <italic>islet, hunchback</italic> and <italic>engrailed</italic> are required for serotonergic specification of the ventral ganglion, while are dispensable for fly brain serotonergic specification (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Lundell et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Thor and Thomas, 1997</xref>). Similarly, in zebrafish, Pet1 regulates raphe serotonergic specification but is dispensable for the specification of other serotonergic subclasses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Lillesaar et al., 2007</xref>).</p><p>Considering the homologous regulatory network between HSN and mouse raphe and their molecular proximity, our results suggest that the <italic>C. elegans</italic> HSN serotonergic neuron, but not the NSM or ADF, could share deep homology with mouse raphe neurons. It would be interesting to explore if NSM or ADF regulatory programs show homology to any of the programs controlling the non-raphe serotonergic populations present in other organisms. Noteworthy, despite the homology in TFs regulating HSN and raphe specification, both systems also show discrepancies. For example, while the LIM TF Lmx1b is known to be a key player in mouse serotonergic differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Ding et al., 2003</xref>), we failed to identify a similar role for any <italic>C. elegans</italic> LIM TF (A.JM and N.F unpublished). Similarly, while <italic>C. elegans</italic> GATA factor <italic>egl-18</italic> has very redundant effects on HSN differentiation, GATA2/3 factors are fundamental in mouse serotonergic differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Haugas et al., 2016</xref>). Considering the evolutionary distance between mammals and nematodes, the complexity of the regulatory network (composed in <italic>C. elegans</italic> at least by six and most likely more factors) and the fast evolutionary rate of regulatory regions, it is conceivable that the ancestral common serotonergic regulatory network has significantly diverged between these two animal groups. We propose that this deep homology might be the result of a common ancestor cell type, although, as we do not have enough information about the serotonergic regulatory programs in other animal groups, an alternative scenario is that they might have arisen independently in nematodes and vertebrates and thus although some components would have been convergently employed others could be species specific.</p><p>If HSN and mouse raphe serotonergic neurons were homologous cell types, we would predict that they are also functionally homologous. Serotonergic systems in all animal groups function as facilitators of motor output, with 5HT promoting a switch between states (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Gillette, 2006</xref>). Interestingly, <italic>C. elegans</italic> 5HT signaling in HSN neurons also facilitates motor output. Egg-laying behavior transitions from inactive to active states of egg laying, and 5HT signaling in HSN mediates the onset of the active phase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib97">Waggoner et al., 1998</xref>). Thus, HSN and mouse serotonergic neurons would share deep homology, as well as molecular and functional homology.</p><p>Deep homology of specific nervous system structures has been previously proposed. Conserved TF expression patterns in annelid antero-posterior nervous system axis, including the serotonergic progenitor region, was used to propose the existence of a common Bilaterian ancestor with centralized nervous system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Denes et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Tomer et al., 2010</xref>). Additionally, homologous TF expression patterns have also been used to propose the presence of a visceral nervous system in the common Bilaterian ancestor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Nomaksteinsky et al., 2013</xref>). Altogether, these results suggest that, despite considerable divergence in neuronal architecture and connectivity, deep homology could underlie the specification of diverse neuron subtypes. The identification of homologous regulatory programs could help identify homologous neuronal types in distant species.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th valign="top">Reagent type (species) or resource</th><th valign="top">Designation</th><th valign="top">Source or reference</th><th valign="top">Identifiers</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td valign="top">Strain, strain background (<italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic>)</td><td valign="top">C. elegans: Strain N2</td><td valign="top">Caenorhabditis Genetics Center</td><td valign="top">WormBase: N2</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Strain, strain background (<italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic>)</td><td valign="top">Strain names and genotypes</td><td valign="top"><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp3">Supplementary file 3</xref></td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Strain, strain background (<italic>Mus musculus</italic>)</td><td valign="top">Mouse: C57Bl/6JRccHsd strain</td><td valign="top">ENVIGO, Harlan. (Huntingdon, Cambridgeshire, UK)</td><td valign="top">C57Bl/6JRccHsd</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Strain, strain background (<italic>Escherichia coli</italic>)</td><td valign="top">Strain OP50</td><td valign="top">Caenorhabditis Genetics Center</td><td valign="top">OP50</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Strain, strain background (<italic>Escherichia coli</italic>)</td><td valign="top">Rosetta 2(DE3) Singles Competent Cells: BL21 derivatives</td><td valign="top">Novagen, Merck Group.

Lack of GFP signaling was considered OFF phenotype. As we observed no appreciable bias in reporter expression between left and right HSN neurons, percentages were calculated regardless of side. <italic>cis</italic>-regulatory reporter and mutant scoring was performed using young adult worms maintained at 25°C, unless indicated. For <italic>cis</italic>-regulatory analysis a minimum of 30 animals (60 HSN cells) per line were scored. For mutant analysis at least 100 HSN cells, roughly corresponding to 50 animals, were scored for each genotype. For double mutant analysis, we scored young adult worms and we included an extra phenotype category termed ‘dim’ whenever fluorescence was obviously reduced but still detectable. For HSN regulatory signature analysis, the three lines showing strongest GFP under the dissecting scope were selected for scoring under the microscope. To prepare figures for publication, images were cropped and rotated, brightness and contrast were adjusted, and maximum intensity projections (where applicable) were performed using FIJI. No other image manipulations were performed.</p><p>For wild type TF expression analysis at HSN birth, an <italic>unc-86</italic> fosmid reporter was crossed with the desired TF reporter in order to construct double reporter strains, when possible. UNC-86 is expressed in the HSN after cell cycle exit, approximately 400 min after fertilization and coinciding with embryonic comma stage, which was chosen as analytical time point (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Desai et al., 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Finney and Ruvkun, 1990</xref>). In the particular case of <italic>hlh-3</italic>, 1 to 2 cell-stage embryos with the endogenous gene tagged were selected and mounted [0 hr post-fertilization (hpf) to 0.8 hpf, respectively], incubated at 25°C and analyzed at different time points. We determined that HLH-3 is initially expressed in the HSN/PHB precursor cell (approximately five hpf) and maintained in the postmitotic HSN. HSN cells were identified relative to nearby landmark cell deaths (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Sulston et al., 1983</xref>). The rest of developmental stages of the worm were identified by standard anatomical features. For <italic>hlh-3</italic> mutant time-specific rescue experiments using the <italic>hsp16-2</italic> promoter, synchronized worms were grown until early L4 larva stage, when they received three heat shock pulses (30 min at 37°C) with 2 hr resting intervals. Animals were analyzed the next morning at young adult stage.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Statistical analysis for HSN scorings</title><p>Data was categorically classified as ‘on’ or ‘off’ and the significance of the association was examined using the two tailed Fisher’s exact test. For double mutant analysis, ‘phenotype’ vs. ‘no phenotype’ was compared and thus, ‘dim’ and ‘off’ were considered under the category ‘phenotype’. The null hypothesis was that the level of expression in the double mutant would be equal to the product of the levels of expression in single mutants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Mani et al., 2008</xref>). Whatever statistically deviated from the expected, was considered genetic interaction; Pearson’s chi-squared test was used.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Immunohistochemistry</title><p><italic>C. elegans</italic> serotonin antibody staining was performed using the tube fixation protocol (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">McIntire et al., 1992</xref>).

For F1 RNAi scoring, we bleached gravid adults in OP50 plates, eggs were allowed to hatch and worms grew in RNAi treated food. We scored their progeny, which had developed under the embryonic effects of RNAi knock down (F1 scoring). The experiment was performed in two independent replicates with similar results.

Next, we downloaded upstream and intronic gene regions from WormBase version 262 and classified genes in three groups: genes known to be expressed in HSN, genes expressed in neurons and non-neuronal genes, according to WormBase annotations on gene expression and/or belonging to the published neuronal genome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Hobert, 2013</xref>). PWMs were aligned to genomic sequences and we retrieved matches with a minimum score of 70%. To increase specificity, we removed all matches that did not bear an exact consensus sequence for the corresponding TF family (ETS: YWTCCG, GATA: DGATAD, HLH: SCAGAA, INMS: CCSCWNNM, SPALT: TTGTST, POU: WTKCAT). Then, we performed a sliding window search to find regions that included at least one match for four or more of the 6 TF types. Windows were separated according to the number of different motifs that they bore (4, 5 or 6), and then overlapping regions were merged. Embryonic stem cell enhancers median size has been reported to be around 800 bp (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Parker et al., 2013</xref>); therefore, the initial search was performed with a maximum length restriction of either 600, 700 or 800 bp. Differences between HSN-expressed genes and other gene groups was greater when the maximum length was set to 700 bp, thus we kept this maximum window length for the rest of the analyses. To assess enrichment in signature in HSN-expressed genes we sampled 10,000 groups of 96 genes that (1) had not previously been reported to be expressed in the HSN, (2) at least one ortholog had been described in other <italic>Caenorhabditis</italic> species (<italic>C. briggsae</italic>, <italic>C. japonica, C. remanei</italic> or <italic>C. brenneri</italic>), and (3) such that their upstream and intronic regions were similar in length, on average, to those of the HSN-expressed genes (Mann-Whitney U test, p-value&gt;0.05). We compared the distribution of the proportion of genes with signature (4, 5 or 6 different motifs) in these groups to the HSN-expressed gene group. We consider the enrichment in signature to be significant when the percentile of the HSN-expressed group is above 95. In order to assess signature conservation, we performed a similar motif search using other nematode genomes also available from WormBase (<italic>C. briggsae</italic>, <italic>C. japonica, C. remanei, C. brenneri</italic>) and we considered the signature to be conserved if HSN regulatory windows were found in all orthologous genes, at least 4, 5 or 6 motifs for 4, 5 and 6-motif <italic>C. elegans</italic> windows.</p><p>Gene ontology analysis was performed using GOrilla software, using <italic>C. elegans</italic> coding genome (19.276 genes) as control list (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Eden et al., 2009</xref>).</p><p>For hierarchical clustering, we used curated data from WormBase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Hobert et al., 2016</xref>) to generate a matrix with gene expression profiles for the 118 <italic>C. elegans</italic> hermaphrodite anatomical neuronal classes. Pan-neuronal genes and neurons in which less than 30 genes had been reported to be expressed were excluded. We built a similar matrix with mouse gene expression data from RNA-seq experiments, either from adult raphe nuclei divided into different rhombomeres (R1Dorsal, R1 Medial, R2, R3, R5, R6) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Guillemot and Hassan, 2017</xref>) or from cortical neurons that served as negative control (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Molyneaux et al., 2015</xref>)). To transform the quantitative RNA-seq data into a presence-absence binary matrix. We considered values above 19 CPM as present and values below that threshold as absent because this cut-off produces a list of approximately 7000 expressed genes in each Raphe sample (roughly a third of the genome that is what is being estimated as expressed in a given cell type). Nevertheless, results were consistent in all conditions when considering cutoffs ranging from 9 to 140 CPM, after which HSN-raphe cluster robustness started to decline (low AU and BP values, not shown).</p><p>To assign mouse ortholgs to <italic>C. elegans</italic> genes, we combined orthology relationships between mouse and worm genes annotated in the ENSEMBL database and worm-human orthology relationships reported in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Shaye and Greenwald (2011</xref>). In the last case, we used ENSEMBL database again to assign mouse orthologs to human genes. In (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Molyneaux et al., 2015</xref>)), ENSEMBL, OrthoMCL, InParanoid and Homologene methods are combined to identify orthologs. Thus, we combined both sources to have a wider coverage of orthology relationships than using ENSEMBL or (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Molyneaux et al., 2015</xref>) data alone. Worm genes without any mouse ortholog and genes that were not expressed in any worm neuron were removed. Whenever a worm gene had more than one mouse ortholog, it was duplicated in the worm data set. For hierarchical clustering, this binary matrix containing mouse and worm expression data was fed to the pvclust function in the pvclust R package (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Shimodaira, 2002</xref>), which uses a bootstrapping technique to calculate p-values for each cluster, the AU and BP values (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Shimodaira, 2002</xref>). Parameters were set as follows: method.hclust = ‘average’, method.dist= ‘binary’, nboot = 10,000, r = seq(0.5, 1.4, by = 0.1). The standard error of the PV and AU values was approximately 0.1% for most clusters, including the HSN-raphe cluster. Also, as a control, 100 random sets of 96 expressed genes (the same number of genes that are expressed in the HSN) were generated from the worm gene pool. Each random set contained the four 5HT pathway genes (<italic>tph-1, cat-1, cat-4</italic> and <italic>bas-1</italic>) plus 92 randomly picked genes from the genes expressed in <italic>C. elegans</italic> neurons. This data set was merged with mouse raphe nuclei expression profile and pvclust was run as before.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We thank CGC (P40 OD010440) for providing strains.

Your article has been favorably evaluated by a Senior Editor and three reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>Our decision has been reached after consultation between the reviewers. Based on these discussions and the individual reviews below, we regret to inform you that your work will not be considered further for publication in <italic>eLife</italic> in its current format.</p><p>We have opted to include the full reviews below. As you will see, all reviewers are potentially interested in the work, but all ask for extensive revisions and additional experiments to support the conclusions. Although we are unable to move forward with the current version of the manuscript given the extent of the requested revisions, if you agree with the reviewers and are willing and able to do the extensive work outlines below we do encourage you to consider <italic>eLife</italic> again for submission of a revised manuscript once the issues raised below have been addressed. The manuscript will be considered a new submission. If, on the other hand, you do not agree with the reviewers, please do not do experiments you don't consider worthwhile or merited, but instead submit your manuscript elsewhere.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic> </p><p>Positives:</p><p>- The fact that the authors characterize a different TF regulatory mechanism for HSN than what has been described by the Hobert lab for the majority of other neurons</p><p>- The work is extensive and detailed (but see below) and the conservation with mouse serotonergic neuron regulatory mechanisms is encouraging.</p><p>Negatives:</p><p>- I am bothered by the strong conclusions the authors draw from looking at single alleles of genes.

The two most interesting points are relevant to:</p><p>1) Transcriptional regulation, enhancer function: The identification of another good example of a TF collection mode of regulation; that is a group of TFs essential for the regulation of a shared set of enhancers and genes, whereby the input of each TF on different enhancers within the set can vary from direct to indirect recruitment- such that the binding sites of all TFs don't have to be present on all enhancers in the set;</p><p>2) Developmental and evolutionary standpoint: This study identifies the major TFs essential for serotonergic neurons in <italic>C. elegans</italic>, a set of 6 factors with very different DNA binding domains, which have a deeply conserved role in serotonergic neuron development.</p><p>In reading the paper, I found it very strange to talk about regulatory codes (subsection “Transcription factors from six different families are required for HSN 3 neuron terminal differentiation”) when describing Figure 1 and 2. At least to me, codes refer to something in the DNA sequence, while the first two figures describes the proteins involved, their loss-of-function phenotypes, and their expression. For example, – &quot;…this set of six TFs that we refer as the HSN TF code&quot;. As you have already referred to the TF collective in the Introduction, why not already call it a TF collective here rather than code or simply 'the HSN TFs' and then define it as a HSN TF collective later as you currently do.</p><p>The analysis of enhancer activity in the double mutants showing synergy etc. is very nice – but some of these embryos are quite messed up. To avoid pleiotropic functions that could lead to secondary effects have you tried making double mutants in the TFBSs of the analyzed enhancers? This would be a very nice complement to Figure 5.</p><p>The motif prediction section is very interesting. Given your genetic dissection showing that for a given TF, its TFBS are essential for some enhancers and indispensable for others in keeping with the TF collective mode of regulation, I was surprised that the authors required the presence of all 6 TFBSs. I realize that you wanted to make the screen as stringent as possible – and even with all 6 conserved only ~35% of the predictions are expressed in the correction tissue (as you discuss very openly). Given the apparent plasticity in the system, it would be very interesting to do the same computational analysis searching for elements that contain any 5 and any 4 of the 6 TFBS. Does this decrease your enrichments or not make any difference (as the collective model would propose)?</p><p>- &quot;Of note, 5HT pathway gene CRMs are not completely independent as in some cases they partially overlap (Figure 3).&quot; Just because the elements have overlapping expression doesn't mean that they are not acting independently. By independent do you mean each enhancer functions as an independent autonomous unit? Or that they are regulated by independent (unique) sets of TFs?</p><p>The deep homology of the system is really interesting, and the rescue of the worm mutants with the human factors is very impressive. Actually, I suggest to consider moving this down (Figure 7D) to the end of the figure. Start with the expression of the mouse genes, then the expression comparison to the mouse 5HT raphe suggesting deep homology specifically to the HSN neurons. To test this deep homology you then determined if the mouse TFs could rescue the <italic>C. elegans</italic> mutants, suggesting that the underlying regulatory network is also conserved.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic> </p><p>In this manuscript, the authors use <italic>C. elegans</italic> to study transcription factor combinations that are responsible for the differentiation of HSN, a specific class of serotonergic neurons. They identify six transcription factors based on their egg laying phenotype, as well as the absence of serotonin production in mutant cells. They argue that these transcription factors act in parallel and synergistically to regulate the serotonergic regulatory landscape. They study the enhancers of genes involved in the serotonin biosynthetic pathway where they identify the binding sites for these six transcription factors. They use this information to try to find more genes that are regulated by these transcription factors. Although they manage to do so, they have a very high number of false positives. Then, they use the mouse orthologs of these transcription factors to see if they can drive HSN differentiation in worms. Finally, using transcriptomic data they conclude that the HSN neurons are homologous to the mouse raphe serotonergic neurons.</p><p>The manuscript has a number of interesting results, but there is a lot of missing information. The interpretation of the results is often exaggerated and many conclusions are extrapolated from patchy data.</p><p>- The title is misleading. The authors advertise the TF combination as regulating serotonergic neurons, while they are only studying one serotonergic type. In fact, the other serotonergic neurons are minimally affected in these TF mutants.</p><p>- The authors are obviously missing a number of important transcription factors that participate to the differentiation of these neurons. Therefore, this makes most of their downstream results (that is synergy and epistasis) hard to interpret. The way the authors came up with their candidates is very biased towards genes that do not have embryonic lethal phenotypes; in fact, most transcription factors are re-used in different contexts, including embryogenesis.</p><p>- Very importantly, the authors observe many non serotonin-related genes being affected in the TF mutants. This means that they are obviously also interfering with the differentiation of the HSNs! Some genes like <italic>kcc-2</italic> and <italic>lgc-55</italic> are affected equally to the serotonergic pathway genes, while serotonergic pathway genes, such as <italic>cat-4</italic>, are affected less than some terminal features. However, the authors conclude: &quot;This indicates that HSN partially differentiates, but fails to activate expression of the complete HSN transcriptome&quot;. An equally possible conclusion is that they are affecting the differentiation of HSNs, but since they are missing many TFs from their collection, they only affect it partially.</p><p>- How is HLH3 important for the serotonergic identity when it is not expressed in the adults? The neurons do continue to synthesize serotonin in adult worms. It could be acting as a pioneer factor, or it could be relaying its activity to a downstream transcription factor, but the authors never address this.</p><p>- In Figure 2E, can the authors really decide on the fate maintenance based on one marker? Moreover, most of the TFs have a very minimally (although significantly) penetrant effect. Do they believe that the egg-laying defect is because of this effect? Could it be that this mutant is affecting other cell types that are causing the egg-laying defects?</p><p>- As stated earlier, Figure 5 is quite confusing. It shows complex regulatory interactions that cannot be put in a model, as the data are incomplete. Moreover, the authors are testing only TFs with low penetrance and are extrapolating for the whole series.</p><p>[Editors’ note: what now follows is the decision letter after the authors submitted for further consideration.]</p><p>Congratulations, we are pleased to inform you that your article, &quot;A combinatorial transcription factor signature defines the HSN serotonergic neuron regulatory landscape&quot;, has been accepted for publication in <italic>eLife</italic>.</p><p>This is a detailed analysis of the TF network that specifies the differentiated characteristics of a single serotonergic neuron type in <italic>C. elegans</italic>.

As stated by the reviewer, dysregulation of temporal expression is also a phenotype important to consider.</p><p>The onset of expression of all analyzed reporter strains is around L4 larval stage, when HSN neuron matures (See Figure 1: <italic>tph-1, bas-1, cat-1, cat-4, kcc-2, lgc-55, ida-1</italic>, etc.). The only exception being <italic>kal-1</italic>, which is expressed already at larval stage 1 (L1). None of the single mutants show precocious expression of any of the terminal features when we analyzed expression at first larval stage. This observation suggests that the members of the HSN TF collective act mainly as activators of expression in the onset of differentiation but do not act as repressors of ectopic expression before HSN maturation. We have now included this observation as a comment in the revised version of the manuscript:</p><p>'HSN neuron is born embryonically and remains in a quiescent undifferentiated state until late fourth larval stage (L4), when it activates the expression of most effector genes, including the 5HT pathway genes.

In the revised version of the manuscript we have tried to clarify this issue with additional experiments and re-writing of the section: detailed analysis of <italic>hlh-3</italic> expression by GFP fusion to HLH-3 in the endogenous locus (Figure 2—figure supplement 1A) shows that, post-embryonically, HLH-3 starts being expressed in the HSN at third larval stage and its expression is highest at late third larval stage and early forth larval stage, this expression shortly precedes and overlaps onset of expression of most HSN effector genes (Figure 2—figure supplement 1C). We also demonstrate that <italic>hlh-3</italic> postembryonic expression in <italic>hlh-3</italic> mutants is sufficient to rescue <italic>tph-1</italic> expression defects (Figure 2C). Taking into account that we found functional bHLH binding sites in <italic>tph-1</italic> and <italic>cat-1</italic> CRMs (Figure 5), altogether our data supports the hypothesis that <italic>hlh-3</italic> function is directly required to initiate expression of some HSN effector genes. A role for TFs exclusively in initiation but not maintenance has been previously reported. For example, embryonic <italic>ttx-3</italic> expression in AIY neuron is dependent on the TF REF-2 but its maintenance of expression does not require REF-2 but TTX-3/CEH-10 activity (Bertrand and Hobert, 2009). There are also examples in mouse of TFs required for establishment but not maintenance of cell fate (Bettess et al., 2005, Hoogenkamp et al., 2009, Martins et al., 2005) or required for maintenance but not initiation of expression (Galceran et al., 2001, Harms et al., 2014).</p><p>HLH-3 belongs to the Asc proneural factor family and is ortholog to mouse Ascl1 (Figure 2—figure supplement 1D). Ascl1 is expressed in serotonergic progenitors and early postmitotic serotonergic neuroblasts. Besides its role in neuronal progenitors specification it has well-demonstrated roles inducing neuronal differentiation in serotonergic and other neuronal types (Pattyn et al., 2004, Sommer et al., 1995). Ascl1 is also part of the TF combinations used to induce serotonergic fate from human fibroblasts (Vadodaria et al., 2015, Xu et al., 2015). Similar to <italic>hlh-3</italic>, Ascl1 expression is downregulated from mature neurons. Temporal dysregulation of Ascl1 activity by sustained expression or inhibition of degradation leads to neuronal differentiation defects (Imayoshi et al., 2013, Urbán et al., 2016). Similarly, we observed that precocious and sustained expression of <italic>hlh-3</italic> leads to HSN differentiation defects (Figure 2D). <italic>hlh-3</italic> function shows additional shared features to Ascl1 like regulation of expression of panneuronal features (see <italic>rab-3</italic> expression defects Figure 1E) or being an upstream regulator of <italic>egl-46</italic> (Figure 3A) (Ascl1 directly regulates Insm1, ortholog of <italic>egl-46</italic>) (Castro et al., 2011). Finally, Ascl1 can substitute <italic>hlh-3</italic> function in HSN differentiation (Figure 8F). Altogether our new data suggest that in the HSN TF collective <italic>hlh-3</italic> acts as a proneural gene in the induction of HSN terminal fate. Ascl1 has been shown to act as a pioneer factor to facilitate binding of additional TFs (Wapinski et al., 2013). It would be very interesting to address if HLH-3 can also bind closed chromatin. We have not addressed this issue in the manuscript because we think it is out of the scope of the paper, the main message of the paper is the identification and characterization of HSN TF collective as a whole, our ability to predict HSN enhancers and the phylogenetic conservation. We believe that a more detailed analysis on HLH-3 function as proneural factor is a project on its own for future manuscripts.</p><p>This data is now explained in the subsection “AST-1 acts as temporal switch for HSN maturation” and Figure 2 and (Figure 2—figure supplement 1).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>- It seems important to look at expression upon mutating multiple TF binding sites and not just at double mutants for the TFs.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank reviewer #1 for this suggestion, also proposed by reviewer #2.

We think this is not due to an intrinsic difference in the HSN, but to the exhaustive analysis we have performed. Describing this complexity is important because the data available so far created the false impression that <italic>C. elegans</italic> cell fate regulation was different and much simpler than in other organisms and thus could follow different rules see for example review (Holmberg and Perlmann, 2012). (This concept is explained in the first section of the Discussion).</p><p>2) Three models have been proposed to explain enhancer function: the enhanceosome model, billboard model and TF collective model. It is still a matter of debate which model better represents TF way of action. There are several beautiful examples that fit the TF collective model mainly, but not only, in <italic>Drosophila</italic> embryo. To our knowledge our work is the first characterization in great detail of the action of a TF collective model in the neuronal subtype terminal differentiation. Moreover our detailed examination on the HSN TF collective function has allowed us to describe a high degree of flexibility as well as extensive synergistic relationships further supporting the TF collective model. (This concept is also explained in the first section of the Discussion).</p><p>3) Despite great efforts, we still do not understand why specific regions in the DNA constitute functional enhancers. This lack of understanding precludes us from identifying <italic>cis</italic>-regulatory modules only based on DNA sequence. Although we are still far from reaching this goal, our work shows that the complexity of the HSN TF collective, composed by at least six members (and most likely by additional TFs) impose a regulatory signature that is specific enough to identify enhancers only from DNA sequence. Our understanding is still incomplete, what produces a high number of false positives in our search, nevertheless, we think it provides an important proof of concept that could help in the understanding of enhancer selection. (Explained in the second section of the Discussion).</p><p>4) Finally, our work shows an unexpected degree of homology between the HSN and the mouse raphe. Both terminal features as well as TF regulatory network seem shared between these two populations. From an evolutionary point of view we think this finding is very relevant and suggests that eumetazoans might share deep homology in additional neuron types.

Our results are summarized in the subsection “The HSN regulatory signature allows de novo identification of HSN expressed genes” and in Figure 7—figure supplement 2. In summary, we find that in contrast to our analysis with 6 motifs, only five or only four motif windows are not enriched in genes known to be expressed in HSN compared to random (Figure 7—figure supplement 2A, B). Additionally, inclusion of only five motif regulatory windows (≥5 motif) or both only five and only four motif regulatory windows (≥4 motif) decreases the enrichment in the neuronal genome compared to non neuronal genome and the GO term enrichment on HSN related terms (Figure 7—figure supplement 2C-E). Altogether, our data shows that the most prevalent mark of HSN expressed genes is the regulatory signature with all six TFBS. Even if some HSN active enhancers lack predicted binding sites for any of the members of the HSN TF collective, at the genomic level, including enhancers with missing TFBS abolishes cell type specificity.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>- &quot;Of note, 5HT pathway gene CRMs are not completely independent as in some cases they partially overlap (Figure 3).&quot; Just because the elements have overlapping expression doesn't mean that they are not acting independently.

However, we respectfully disagree with the reviewer's claim that, because not all components of the HSN TF collective have been identified, the conclusions from our data are hard to interpret. Biological research is often based on the dissection and analysis of specific parts of complex systems to understand their function. This strategy has been historically very successful to advance our understanding of complex processes. In this context, synergy refers to the relationship between two factors, independently of how many additional factors are involved. Many examples of synergistic relationships have been reported in different organisms in which only a few components of the whole network were considered (see as examples for <italic>C. elegans</italic> (Chen et al., 2013, Doitsidou et al., 2013, Hsin and Kenyon 1999, Kratsios et al., 2017, Ogg et al., 1997, S Lichtsteiner 1995, Sawa et al., 2000, Sommermann et al., 2010, Wang et al., 2014, Zhang et al., 2013) and for other systems: (Costa et al., 2013, Goldstein et al., 2017, Kottakis et al., 2016, Mazzoni et al., 2013, Rubtsova et al., 2013, Stuart et al., 2014)).

All members of the HSN TF collective are broadly expressed during embryogenesis and have other reported functions either in specification of other neuronal types or even in non-neuronal tissues. However, we would like to clarify that we have not limited our analysis to TFs that are not required for early steps in development. This is precisely the case of <italic>ast-1</italic>: null <italic>ast-1</italic> alleles are L1 larval lethal. However, forward genetic screens and the isolation of hypomorphic mutations allows for the identification of viable alleles in genes that code for TFs that are required for viability, and <italic>ast-1</italic> is one of the many examples. Just to mention another case, in the past we isolated a <italic>ceh-43</italic> mutant allele that contains a regulatory mutation that specifically affects <italic>ceh-43</italic> expression in CEPs neurons, this mutant allele is viable while null alleles of <italic>ceh-43</italic> are embryonic lethal. The isolation of this mutation was key in identifying a specific role of <italic>ceh-43</italic> in dopaminergic specification (Doitsidou et al., 2013).</p><p>In summary, 1) we are aware, as we state in the manuscript several times, that other components of the HSN TF collective are yet to be identified. These additional TFs may or may not be required for embryonic development. Nevertheless, this fact does not affect the conclusions driven from our data, 2) a member of the HSN TF collective is required for worm viability (<italic>ast-1</italic>), demonstrating that we do not exclude from our analysis genes required for embryonic development.</p><p>We have now included a sentence in the Discussion section acknowledging the possibility that the additional components of the HSN TF collective could have a role in embryogenesis (subsection “Regulation of C. elegans neuron specification is unexpectedly complex”, last paragraph).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>- Very importantly, the authors observe many non serotonin-related genes being affected in the TF mutants. This means that they are obviously also interfering with the differentiation of the HSNs! Some genes like kcc-2 and lgc-55 are affected equally to the serotonergic pathway genes, while serotonergic pathway genes, such as cat-4, are affected less than some terminal features. However, the authors conclude: &quot;This indicates that HSN partially differentiates, but fails to activate expression of the complete HSN transcriptome&quot;. An equally possible conclusion is that they are affecting the differentiation of HSNs, but since they are missing many TFs from their collection, they only affect it partially.</p></disp-quote><p>We apologize if our statement was misleading in the initial version of the manuscript. As well pointed by the reviewer, our data shows that these TFs are required for proper expression of a broad range of HSN terminal features and not only the 5HT pathway genes. This finding is very important for the rest of the manuscript as we find these TFs work according to the 'TF collective model' originally proposed by Furlong lab. Accordingly, HSN TF collective defines the HSN neuron regulatory landscape (and not just the 5HT biosynthesis pathway gene expression).</p><p>We totally agree with reviewer that other TFs, not analyzed in this manuscript, can produce lineage defects that lead to missing HSN (for example <italic>hlh-14</italic> mutants (Frank et al. 2003). However, this is not the case for the so far identified members of the HSN TF collective. In our single mutant analysis we want to make clear that the lack of expression detected for some markers is not due to the lack of the cell itself but a lack of transcription of that gene. We agree with the reviewer our single mutant analysis shows that HSN differentiation is only partially affected. We thank the reviewer for the remark and we have now modified the text to try to be more precise as follows:</p><p>&quot;This indicates that, in each of the analyzed single mutants, HSN is present but shows broad but partial differentiation defects.&quot;</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>- How is HLH3 important for the serotonergic identity when it is not expressed in the adults? The neurons do continue to synthesize serotonin in adult worms. It could be acting as a pioneer factor, or it could be relaying its activity to a downstream transcription factor, but the authors never address this.</p></disp-quote><p>We apologize for not being clear enough on the role of HLH-3, as also pointed by reviewer #1. In the revised version of the manuscript we have tried to clarify this issue with additional experiments and re-writing of the section: detailed analysis of <italic>hlh-3</italic> expression by GFP fusion to HLH-3 in the endogenous locus (Figure 2—figure supplement 1A) shows that, post-embryonically, HLH-3 starts being expressed in the HSN at third larval stage and its expression is highest at late third larval stage and early forth larval stage, this expression shortly precedes and overlaps onset of expression of most HSN effector genes (Figure 2—figure supplement 1C). We also demonstrate that <italic>hlh-3</italic> postembryonic expression in <italic>hlh-3</italic> mutants is sufficient to rescue <italic>tph-1</italic> expression defects (Figure 2C). Taking into account that we found functional bHLH binding sites in <italic>tph-1</italic> and <italic>cat-1</italic> CRMs (Figure 5), altogether our data supports the hypothesis that <italic>hlh-3</italic> function is directly required to initiate expression of some HSN effector genes. A role for TFs exclusively in initiation but not maintenance has been previously reported. For example, embryonic <italic>ttx-3</italic> expression in AIY neuron is dependent on the TF REF-2 but its maintenance of expression does not require REF-2 but TTX-3/CEH-10 activity (Bertrand and Hobert 2009). There are also examples in mouse of TFs required for establishment but not maintenance of cell fate (Bettess et al., 2005, Hoogenkamp et al., 2009, Martins et al., 2005) or required for maintenance but not initiation of expression (Galceran et al., 2001, Harms et al., 2014).</p><p>HLH-3 belongs to the asc proneural factor family and is ortholog to mouse Ascl1 Figure 2—figure supplement 1D). Ascl1 is expressed in serotonergic progenitors and early postmitotic serotonergic neuroblasts. Besides its role in neuronal progenitors specification it has well-demonstrated roles inducing neuronal differentiation in serotonergic and other neuronal types (Pattyn et al., 2004, Sommer et al., 1995). Ascl1 is also part of the TF combinations used to induce serotonergic fate from human fibroblasts (Vadodaria et al., 2015, Xu et al., 2015). Similar to <italic>hlh-3</italic>, Ascl1 expression is downregulated from mature neurons. Temporal dysregulation of Ascl1 activity by sustained expression or inhibition of degradation leads to neuronal differentiation defects (Imayoshi et al., 2013, Urbán et al., 2016). Similarly, we observed that precocious and sustained expression of <italic>hlh-3</italic> leads to HSN differentiation defects (Figure 2D). <italic>hlh-3</italic> function shows additional shared features to Ascl1 like regulation of expression of panneuronal features (see <italic>rab-3</italic> expression defects Figure 1E) or being an upstream regulator of <italic>egl-46</italic> (Figure 3A) (Ascl1 directly regulates Insm1, ortholog of <italic>egl-46</italic>) (Castro et al., 2011). Finally, Ascl1 can substitute <italic>hlh-3</italic> function in HSN differentiation (Figure 8F). Altogether our new data suggest that in the HSN TF collective <italic>hlh-3</italic> acts as a proneural gene in the induction of HSN terminal fate.</p><p>As suggested by reviewer #3 <italic>hlh-3</italic> could be relaying its activity to a downstream TF. Indeed, proneural factors are known to regulate expression of other bHLH TFs that are later required for neuronal differentiation such as NeuroD1 (Guillemot and Hassan 2017). We performed RNAi experiments to knock down the activity of all <italic>C. elegans</italic> bHLH TFs but we fail to detect either <italic>cat-1</italic> or <italic>tph-1</italic> expression defects (See attached graphs at the end of the document). As negative results with RNAi are not conclusive we have decided not to include them in the current version of the manuscript.</p><p>Ascl1 has been shown to act as a pioneer factor to facilitate binding of additional TFs (Wapinski et al., 2013). It would be very interesting to address if HLH-3 can also bind closed chromatin. We have not address this issue in the manuscript because we think it is out of the scope of the paper, the main message of the paper is the identification and characterization of HSN TF collective as a whole, our ability to predict HSN enhancers and the phylogenetic conservation. We believe that a more detailed analysis on HLH-3 function as proneural factor is a project on its own for future manuscripts.</p><p>This data is now explained in the subsection “AST-1 acts as temporal switch for HSN maturation” and Figure 2 and Figure 2—figure supplement 1.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>- In Figure 2E, can the authors really decide on the fate maintenance based on one marker? Moreover, most of the TFs have a very minimally (although significantly) penetrant effect.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this excellent suggestion and agree that additional markers should be added. We have now included <italic>cat-1</italic> expression defects by RNAi (Figure 3C) as well as temperature shift experiments performed with temperature sensitive alleles for <italic>ast-1, sem-4</italic> and <italic>unc-86</italic> (Figure 3—figure supplement 1).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Do they believe that the egg-laying defect is because of this effect? Could it be that this mutant is affecting other cell types that are causing the egg-laying defects?</p></disp-quote><p>Mutant alleles for all members of the HSN TF collective show obvious egg-laying defects. As suggested by the reviewer, it is well established that some of the members of the HSN TF collective have pleiotropic actions in other tissues that also contribute to the egg laying phenotype: <italic>sem-4</italic> and <italic>egl-18</italic> are required for VPC specification and vulva formation (Eisenmann and Kim 2000, Koh et al., 2002), <italic>sem-4</italic> is also required for correct specification of vulval and uterine muscles (Basson and Horvitz 1996). HLH-3 is expressed in the VCs and it is required for correct <italic>unc-40</italic> expression (Doonan et al., 2008). Moreover, we have also determined that the expression of other genes in VC4/5 neurons is affected in <italic>hlh-3</italic> mutants. Finally, we have observed that <italic>egl-46</italic> is also expressed in VC neurons. Thus, for most of the HSN TF collective the egg-laying phenotype is not exclusively due to HSN differentiation. In support to this idea we find that our HSN-specific rescue experiments restore HSN gene expression but do not suppress the egg laying phenotype. We thank the reviewer for this remark, and we have now included a comment on this regard in the text:</p><p>'Of note, our rescue experiments restore <italic>tph-1</italic> expression but do not rescue egg-laying defects. HSN TF collective have pleiotropic actions in other tissues that also contribute to the egg laying phenotype (Basson and Horvitz 1996, Doonan et al., 2008, Eisenmann and Kim 2000, Koh et al., 2002)what explain the egg laying defects in the HSN specific rescue experiments.'</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>- As stated earlier, Figure 5 is quite confusing. It shows complex regulatory interactions that cannot be put in a model, as the data are incomplete. Moreover, the authors are testing only TFs with low penetrance and are extrapolating for the whole series.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this remark, we have modified the text to try to clarify our results (subsection “HSN TF collective shows enhancer-context dependent synergistic relationships”). Additionally, we have now expanded our double mutant analysis including more double combinations as well as cis-cis and cis-trans double combinations (Figure 6 and Figure 6—figure supplement 1 and Figure 6—source data 2). We now show synergistic relationships in 9 out of the 15 possible HSN TF collective pair combinations. Synergistic effects include examples for all members of the HSN TF collective and it is the most frequent genetic interaction found in our double mutant analysis (Figure 6—source data 2). Thus, although not all combinations of TFs might be able to synergize we find that all HSN TFs show synergistic relationships and that synergy is a very common feature as would be expected for the TF collective model.</p><p>Nevertheless, as stated by reviewer # 3 our data show a complex scenario that cannot be put in a model or used to make predictions or extrapolations, in fact, this is an important message of this part of the manuscript: we find different types of genetic interactions for every reporter gene and for different combinations of TFs pairs indicating there is not a general rule. We apologize if this was misleading, now we have change the text to try to clarify this point. We think this data is very informative. Despite the fact that these TFs act as a collective, they work in such a flexible way that interactions among them are determined specifically by the enhancer context they bind to.</p><p>As for the second part of the remark by the reviewer, the use of mutant alleles showing low penetrance is a requirement to be able to unravel genetic interactions. Strong phenotypes would not allow us to detect synergy or additivity.</p></body></sub-article></article>
