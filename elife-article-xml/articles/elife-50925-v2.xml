transcriptional and post-translational feedback loops. An important step in generating rhythmicity is the translocation of clock components into the nucleus, which is regulated in many cases by kinases. In mammals, the kinase promoting the nuclear import of the key clock component Period 2 (PER2) is unknown. Here, we show that the cyclin-dependent kinase 5 (CDK5) regulates the mammalian circadian clock involving phosphorylation of PER2. Knock-down of <italic>Cdk5</italic> in the suprachiasmatic nuclei (SCN), the main coordinator site of the mammalian circadian system, shortened the free-running period in mice. CDK5 phosphorylated PER2 at serine residue 394 (S394) in a diurnal fashion. This phosphorylation facilitated interaction with Cryptochrome 1 (CRY1) and nuclear entry of the PER2-CRY1 complex. Taken together, we found that CDK5 drives nuclear entry of PER2, which is critical for establishing an adequate circadian period of the molecular circadian cycle. Of note is that CDK5 may not exclusively phosphorylate PER2, but in addition may regulate other proteins that are involved in the clock mechanism. Taken together, it appears that CDK5 is critically involved in the regulation of the circadian clock and may represent a link to various diseases affected by a derailed circadian clock.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><title>eLife digest</title><p>Anyone who has crossed multiple time zones on a long flight will be familiar with jet lag, and that feeling of wanting to sleep at lunchtime and eat in the middle of the night. Many bodily processes, including appetite and wakefulness, roughly follow a 24-hour cycle. These cycles are known as circadian rhythms, from the Latin ‘circa diem’ meaning about a day. An area of the brain called the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) coordinates circadian rhythms. It acts as a master clock by generating a 24-hour signal for the rest of the body to follow. Jet lag occurs when this internal circadian rhythm becomes out of sync with the local day-night cycle.</p><p>Although jet lag can be uncomfortable, it tends to disappear over the course of a few days. This is because exposure to daylight in our new location resets the SCN master clock, enabling us to adapt to a new time zone. But evidence suggests that long-term disruption of circadian rhythms, for example as a result of shift work, may have lasting harmful effects. These include an increased risk of degenerative brain disorders such as Parkinson's disease and Alzheimer's disease.</p><p>Brenna et al. now identify a molecular mechanism that could explain this link. A key component of the SCN master clock is a protein called Period2 (PER2). Levels of PER2 rise and fall over each 24-hour period, helping the brain keep track of time. Brenna et al. show that PER2 interacts with CDK5, a protein that helps regulate brain development and that has been implicated in Parkinson's disease and Alzheimer's disease. Reducing CDK5 levels in mice shortened their circadian rhythms by several hours. It also altered the animals’ behavioral patterns over a 24-hour period. Deleting the gene for PER2 had a similar effect, suggesting that CDK5 helps regulate PER2.</p><p>Future studies should investigate the molecular links between CDK5, circadian rhythms and processes such as neurodegeneration. The results would provide clues to whether manipulating the circadian clock could help prevent or treat neurological disorders.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>Period 2</kwd><kwd>Cryptochrome 1</kwd><kwd>phosphorylation</kwd><kwd>nuclear import</kwd><kwd>proteasome</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>S. cerevisiae</italic></kwd><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Fondazione Cenci Bolognetti, Instituto Pasteur</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Brenna</surname><given-names>Andrea</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001711</institution-id><institution>Schweizerischer Nationalfonds zur Förderung der Wissenschaftlichen Forschung</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>31003A_166682</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Albrecht</surname><given-names>Urs</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001711</institution-id><institution>Schweizerischer Nationalfonds zur Förderung der Wissenschaftlichen Forschung</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>310030_166474/1</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>De Virgilio</surname><given-names>Claudio</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001711</institution-id><institution>Schweizerischer Nationalfonds zur Förderung der Wissenschaftlichen Forschung</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>316030_177088</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Dengjel</surname><given-names>Jörn</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Cyclin-dependent kinase 5 regulates the circadian clock involving phosphorylation of the PER2 protein.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The circadian clock, prevalent in most organisms, is an evolutionary adaptation to the daily light-dark cycle generated by the sun and the earth’s rotation around its own axis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Rosbash, 2009</xref>). This clock allows organisms to organize physiology and behavior over the 24 hr time scale in order to adapt and thus optimize, body function to predictably recurring daily events. Malfunctioning or disruption of the circadian clock in humans results in various pathologies including obesity, cancer, and neurological disorders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Roenneberg and Merrow, 2016</xref>). In order to maintain phase synchronicity with the environmental light-dark cycle, the suprachiasmatic nuclei (SCN), a bipartite brain structure located in the ventral part of the hypothalamus above the optic chiasm, receive light information from the retina. The SCN convert this information into humoral and neuronal signals to set the phase of all circadian oscillators in the body (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Dibner et al., 2010</xref>).</p><p>In order to measure the length of one day, organisms have developed cell-based molecular mechanisms relying on feedback loops involving a set of clock genes. The existence of such loops was suggested by the analysis of <italic>Drosophila</italic> having various mutations in their <italic>period</italic> (<italic>per</italic>) gene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Hardin et al., 1990</xref>). Further studies completed the picture of intertwined transcriptional feedback loops at the heart of the <italic>Drosophila</italic> circadian oscillator (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Darlington et al., 1998</xref>). Every day, per accumulates to a certain concentration upon which it enters into the nucleus together with timeless (tim). This protein complex inhibits transcriptional activation mediated by dClock and cycle acting on the expression of <italic>per</italic> and <italic>tim</italic>. After the degradation of the inhibitor complex, the repression is relieved and a new circadian cycle starts.</p><p>To fine-tune the period of the circadian oscillator, kinases regulate the accumulation and nuclear entry of per and tim. The kinase double-time (dbt) phosphorylates per to destabilize it and to prevent its transport into the nucleus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Kloss et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Price et al., 1998</xref>). On the other hand, the kinase shaggy (shg) phosphorylates tim to stabilize the heterodimer and to promote its nuclear translocation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Martinek et al., 2001</xref>). Many other kinases and phosphatases are necessary to complete the <italic>Drosophila</italic> circadian cycle and to adjust its phase to the external light-dark rhythm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Garbe et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>The circadian oscillator of mammals is arranged very similarly to the one of <italic>Drosophila</italic>, with some modifications (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Dibner et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Takahashi, 2017</xref>). For instance, the function of <italic>Drosophila</italic> tim to escort per into the nucleus was replaced by the Cryptochromes (Cry) in the mammalian system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">van der Horst et al., 1999</xref>). Furthermore, the first mutation to affect the mammalian circadian oscillator, <italic>Tau</italic>, was later mapped to Casein kinase Iε (CK1ε), which is the <italic>Drosophila</italic> dbt orthologue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Lowrey et al., 2000</xref>). One of the sites phosphorylated by CK1ε within human PER2 is mutated in the Familial Advanced Sleep Phase Syndrome (FASPS) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Toh et al., 2001</xref>). This mutation and also the <italic>Tau</italic> mutation were subsequently introduced into the mouse genome to prove their functional relevance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Meng et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Xu et al., 2007</xref>). However, a kinase similar to the function of shg in <italic>Drosophila</italic>, which stabilizes and promotes the import of PER proteins into the nucleus of mammals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Hirano et al., 2017</xref>), has not been identified. Interestingly, PER2 contains over 20 potential phosphorylation sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Vanselow et al., 2006</xref>), indicating that mammalian PER and specifically PER2 are highly regulated at the post-translational level. This degree of phosphorylation is probably contributing to the precise rhythmicity of PER2, which stands out as a crucial feature of the core clock (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chong et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>Among the plethora of kinases identified that phosphorylate mammalian clock proteins, cyclin-dependent kinase 5 (CDK5) was found to target CLOCK (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Kwak et al., 2013</xref>). CDK5 is a proline-directed serine-threonine kinase belonging to the Cdc2/Cdk1 family that is controlled by the neural specific activators p35, p39 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Tang et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Tsai et al., 1994</xref>), and cyclin I (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Brinkkoetter et al., 2009</xref>). CDK5 regulates various neuronal processes such as neurogenesis, neuronal migration, and axon guidance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Kawauchi, 2014</xref>). Outside of the nervous system CDK5 regulates vesicular transport, apoptosis, cell adhesion, and migration in many cell types (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Contreras-Vallejos et al., 2012</xref>). It has been proposed that CDK5 modulates the brain reward system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Benavides et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bibb et al., 2001</xref>) and that it is consequently linked to psychiatric diseases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Engmann et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Zhu et al., 2012</xref>). Interestingly, the clock components PER2 and CLOCK have been associated with the same processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abarca et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Hampp et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Roybal et al., 2007</xref>). However, it is unknown whether CDK5 plays an important role in the central oscillator of the circadian clock.</p><p>In this study, we wanted to identify proteins promoting the nuclear transport of PER2 with focus on kinase(s) acting similarly to shg. Using a genetic synthetic lethal dosage screen in yeast, we observed a genetic interaction between <italic>Per2</italic> and <italic>PHO85</italic>, which encodes a cyclin-dependent protein kinase that is orthologous to CDK5 in mammals. Subsequent experiments in mice demonstrated that silencing of <italic>Cdk5</italic> in the SCN shortened the clock period. Our study identified CDK5 as a critical protein kinase in the regulation of the circadian clock and in particular as an important regulator of the crucial clock component PER2.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Genetic interaction between Per2 and CDK5 in yeast and diurnal activity of CDK5</title><p>In order to gain insight into the regulation of PER2 function in mice, we initially tried to identify genes that genetically interact with <italic>Per2</italic> in budding yeast by using a variation of the Synthetic Genetic Array (SGA) method (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Tong, 2001</xref>). To this end, we carried out a synthetic dosage lethality (SDL) screen, which is based on the concept that a high dosage of a given protein (i.e. PER2 in this case) may have negligible effect on growth in wild-type cells (as we found to be the case for PER2; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>), but may compromise growth in mutants that have defects in pathway components or in functionally related processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Measday et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Sopko et al., 2006</xref>). Of note, SDL screens have been instrumental in the past to specifically predict the relationship between protein kinases and their targets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Sharifpoor et al., 2012</xref>). Our search in a yeast knockout collection (encompassing 4857 individual deletion strains) for mutants that exhibited significantly reduced growth when combined with increased dosage of PER2 (see Materials and methods for further details) allowed us to isolate three mutants, namely <italic>eap1∆</italic>, <italic>gnd1∆</italic>, and <italic>pho85∆</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Among these, the strain lacking the cyclin-dependent protein kinase Pho85 was most dramatically compromised for growth in the presence of high doses of PER2. Hence, Pho85 antagonizes the growth-inhibitory effect of PER2 in yeast, which indicates that the Pho85-orthologous CDK5 may potentially act upstream of PER2 in mammalian cells.</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>CDK5 intersects with PER2 and has diurnal activity in the SCN.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Loss of Eap1, Gnd1, or Pho85 compromises growth of PER2-overproducing yeast cells.

However, the functional relevance of CDK5 for the clock mechanism has never been tested. Therefore, we investigated whether CDK5 affected the functioning of the circadian clock. First, we assessed whether CDK5 displayed time of day-dependent expression and activity in the SCN, the master clock of the circadian system. We collected SCN samples every 4 hr starting from ZT0 until ZT20 (ZT0 = light on, ZT12 = light off), and performed western blots on total extracts using specific antibodies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). The immunoblot against CRY1 showed a diurnal profile of this protein with a peak during the late-night phase, confirming that the mice were entrained properly to the light-dark cycle. In contrast, the CDK5 accumulation profile seemed to be unaffected by the time of day (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). Next, we investigated whether CDK5 kinase activity displayed a diurnal profile. While CDK5 levels did not change significantly over one day (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>), we observed that histone-H1, a known CDK5 target (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Peterson et al., 2010</xref>), was phosphorylated by this kinase in a time of day-dependent manner, with the highest levels of CDK5 activity observed at ZT12 to ZT20, that is during the dark phase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). Phosphorylation of histone-H1 was specifically blocked by roscovitine, a CDK5 inhibitor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Hsu et al., 2013</xref>), whereas LiCl, a Gsk3β inhibitor, did not affect this phosphorylation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>), suggesting a CDK5-specific phosphorylation. Altogether, these data demonstrated that CDK5 kinase activity (but not protein accumulation) was diurnal in the SCN.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>CDK5 regulates the circadian clock</title><p>Since CDK5 activity displayed a diurnal profile in the SCN, we tested whether knock-down of CDK5 in the master clock of the SCN changed circadian behavior in mice. To this end, we tested various shRNAs against <italic>Cdk5</italic> in NIH 3T3 fibroblast cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>) and subsequently injected into the SCN region adeno-associated viral particles containing expression vectors for either a scrambled set of shRNA or a <italic>Cdk5</italic>-specific shRNA (variant D, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). After recovery from the procedure the animals were transferred into cages containing a running-wheel in order to assess their activity profiles. The control animals expressing the scrambled set of shRNA displayed normal activity in the light-dark (LD) cycle with precise onset of activity at the beginning of the dark phase (ZT12). This onset of activity was less precise in mice with a <italic>Cdk5</italic> knock-down (shCdk5) but comparable to animals with a deletion mutation in the clock gene <italic>Per2</italic>, designated as <italic>Per2<sup>Brdm1</sup></italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>).

This suggested that CDK5/p35 phosphorylates S394 and that this phosphorylation is of functional relevance.

Next, we investigated whether PER2 degradation involved the proteasome. Cells were treated with epoxomycin, a proteasome inhibitor, or with the solvent DMSO. In line with our previous experiments, shCdk5 treatment efficiently knocked down CDK5 and reduced PER2 levels compared with scrambled shRNA treatment. Addition of epoxomycin, but not DMSO, significantly increased PER2 levels despite absence of CDK5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E</xref>), indicating that PER2 degradation involved the proteasome. Residual amounts of CDK5 in the cells still may phosphorylate PER2 and direct it into the nucleus. Therefore, we wanted to see whether PER2 could be detected in nuclear extracts of shCdk5 knocked down cells. In line with our previous observations we did not detect PER2 in nuclear extract (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6F</xref>), supporting the idea that PER2 needed to be phosphorylated by CDK5 in order to enter the nucleus. Data from immunofluorescence experiments on SCN sections were in line with this hypothesis. PER2 was only detected in nuclei when CDK5 was available (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6G</xref>, arrowheads, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s4">Figure 6—figure supplement 4</xref>), but not when shCdk5 was expressed in SCN cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6G</xref>, white arrow, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s4">Figure 6—figure supplement 4</xref>).</p><p>It has been described that nuclear entry of PER2 involves CRY1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Kume et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Ollinger et al., 2014</xref>).

Therefore, we tested the interaction potential of wild-type PER2 and the S394G PER2 mutation with CRY1 by overexpressing the two PER variants in NIH 3T3 cells. Immunoprecipitation of wild-type PER2 pulled down CRY1; however, the S394G PER2 mutation was significantly less efficient in doing so (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6H</xref>). The small amounts of CRY1 detected may be bound to endogenous PER2 that is present in the cells. In summary, these experiments suggested that CDK5 affects PER2 stability, interaction with CRY1, and nuclear localization.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Not only do kinases play a crucial role in signal transduction in response to extracellular stimuli, but they also regulate cycling processes such as the cell cycle and circadian rhythms. Most cyclin dependent kinases (CDKs) regulate the cell cycle, with few exceptions such as the cyclin dependent kinase 5 (CDK5). This kinase is ubiquitously expressed and its function is vital in post-mitotic neurons, where other CDKs are not active. Although CDK5 is not implicated in cell cycle progression, it can aberrantly activate components of the cell cycle when it is dysregulated in post-mitotic neurons, leading to cell death (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chang et al., 2012</xref>). Interestingly, cell death is affected by the clock component PER2 as well (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Magnone et al., 2014</xref>), suggesting that both, CDK5 and PER2 act in the same pathway, or that their pathways cross at a critical point during the regulation of cell death. The synthetic dosage lethal screen that we performed in yeast supports this notion, as expression of PER2 in yeast lacking <italic>Cdk5</italic> strongly and significantly compromised growth (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>).</p><p>The kinase CDK5 displays many effects that ensure proper brain function and development. Mice deficient for <italic>Cdk5</italic> are perinatal lethal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Gilmore et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Ohshima et al., 1996</xref>). CDK5 influences cortical neuron migration, cerebellar development, synapse formation and plasticity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Kawauchi, 2014</xref>). Here, we identified a new role for this kinase, that is the regulation of the circadian clock in vivo. Previously, CDK5 had been identified to phosphorylate CLOCK and thereby regulate CLOCK stability and cellular distribution in cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Kwak et al., 2013</xref>). In the SCN, however, NPAS2 may replace the function of CLOCK (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Debruyne et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">DeBruyne et al., 2007</xref>) and therefore phosphorylation of CLOCK by CDK5 may play a minor role in the SCN. Hence, to unravel the novel function of CDK5 in the circadian oscillator, we had to restrict ourselves to the use of SCN tissue and whole animals.</p><p>CDK5 activity, but not its protein accumulation, displays a diurnal profile in the SCN with high activity during the night and low activity during the day (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). The activity displayed a typical on/off profile similar to other CDKs. This finding raises the question how this diurnal activity of CDK5 may be achieved. On one hand, ATP accumulation, which is required for phosphorylation, peaks during the night in the SCN (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Yamazaki et al., 1994</xref>). On the other hand, CDK5 activity is regulated by cofactors. Depending on its cofactor, CDK5 in the brain phosphorylates targets involved in neurodegenerative diseases (e.g. Tau, MAP1B), neuronal migration (e.g. DCX), and synaptic signaling (e.g. Ca<sub>v</sub>2.2, Dynamin1, NR2A, DARPP-32) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Kawauchi, 2014</xref>). The most obvious candidates to regulate its time-dependent activity would be cyclins D1 and E, which inhibit CDK5, or cyclin I, which activates it. Alternatively, other known CDK5 regulators such as p35 may be involved (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Shah and Lahiri, 2014</xref>). Most likely, positive and negative feedback loops of other kinases and phosphatases are necessary to generate the on/off profile, although the components involved in this mechanism are probably different from the ones known for CDKs that regulate the cell cycle. Interestingly, CK1 phosphorylates and activates CDK5 in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Sharma et al., 1999</xref>) and CDK5 is thought to phosphorylate and inhibit CK1δ in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Ianes et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Eng et al., 2017</xref>) potentially establishing a feedback loop between the two kinases. However, additional research is needed to determine the precise mechanism of diurnal on/off activation of CDK5.</p><p>As evidenced in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>, Cdk5 knock-down affects circadian clock period at the behavioral level. The shortening of period in mice with knocked-down Cdk5 is comparable to mice containing a mutation of the <italic>Per2</italic> gene (<italic>Per2<sup>Brdm1</sup></italic> mutant mice, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Zheng et al., 1999</xref>). Interestingly, however, knock-down of Cdk5 in <italic>Per2<sup>Brdm1</sup></italic> mutant mice leads to further shortening of circadian period. This suggests that Cdk5 may affect period either independently of <italic>Per2</italic> or, while PER2 may still be important, CDK5 regulates other proteins important for clock function. Since the difference between the period in control versus Cdk5 knock-down (0.8 hr, black and gray bars, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>) is not the same as in <italic>Per2<sup>Brdm1</sup></italic> mutant versus its Cdk5 knock-down (0.6 hr, red and rose bars, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>) the second possibility is more likely. Moreover, wt KD versus <italic>Per2<sup>Brdm1</sup></italic> KD show a difference in period (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>, gray and rose bars), suggesting that the difference in genotype plays an important role. From a dynamic perspective, it is possible that lack of PER2 protein will unmask Cdk5 targets that otherwise would be phosphorylated less efficiently or not at all. For example, the PER2 site that is phosphorylated by CDK5 (PFD<bold>Y</bold><underline>S</underline>PIR) is very similar in PER1 (PFD<bold>H</bold><underline>S</underline>PIR). If PER1 would be phosphorylated by CDK5 at this site at the same rate as PER2, then PER1 as well as PER2 should be absent in the nucleus of SCN cells. This would correspond to a PER1/PER2 double knock-out, which become immediately arrhythmic when subjected to constant darkness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Zheng et al., 2001</xref>). This is not the phenotype we observe in the Cdk5 knock-down mice and hence it is unlikely that CDK5 affects PER1 in the same manner as it affects PER2. However, in the absence of PER2 the dynamics may change and PER1 may become a better target for CDK5 and influence period. This view is consistent with the observation that knock-down of Cdk5 in <italic>Per2<sup>Brdm1</sup></italic> mutant mice can shorten period (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D,E</xref>).</p><p>CDK5 binds to the C-terminal half of PER2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4G</xref>) and phosphorylates it at S394 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>), which is located in the PAC domain of the N-terminal half of the protein. Hence, the binding and phosphorylation sites are far apart, suggesting a structure of PER2 allowing proximity of the CDK5 binding and phosphorylation domains. We cannot exclude weak binding of CDK5 to the N-terminal half of PER2, because phosphorylation at S394 occurs in vitro even in the absence of the C-terminal half of the PER2 protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>). This may be due to the fact that the N-terminal half is overexpressed in vitro, which strongly increases the probability of phosphorylation by CDK5 even in the absence of the C-terminal binding domain. It is also known that p35 (which is used in the in vitro kinase assay to activate CDK5) can increase the interaction between CDK5 and its targets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Hsu et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>In SCN tissue PER2 phosphorylation at S394 appears to be time of day-dependent, with highest levels at ZT12 and ZT16 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>) when CDK5 activity is high (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). Compared with total PER2 protein the S394 phosphorylated form appears to be slightly advanced in its phase. The difference in phase is probably even larger than it appears here, because the polyclonal antibody that detects total PER2 also detects the phosphorylated S394 PER2 variant. This is especially important in the rise of the signal detected, which appears to be identical in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>. Probably the steep increase between ZT8 and ZT12 represents the S394 phosphorylated forms in both curves. In contrast, the decrease in PER2 levels differs between total PER2 and P-S394-PER2 form. Consistent with previous studies total PER2 peaks in the nucleus at ZT16 in the SCN (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Nam et al., 2014</xref>) when P-S394-PER2 is not detected anymore. This highlights that additional post-translational modifications of PER2 exist (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Toh et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Vanselow et al., 2006</xref>) and that P-S394-PER2 disappears faster compared with other modified forms. Probably, P-S394-PER2 plays a role in PER2 dynamics in terms of shuttling from the cytoplasm to the nucleus, because P-S394-PER2 can only be observed in the cytoplasmic and not the nuclear fraction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F</xref>). The phosphorylation of PER2 by CDK5 may therefore be critical for the assembly of a macromolecular complex in the cytoplasm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Aryal et al., 2017</xref>), which then enters the nucleus.</p><p>The difference in the decline between PER2 and its S394 phosphorylated form in the SCN may suggest a role of the S394 phosphorylation not only for nuclear transport but also for PER2 protein stability. The earlier decline of the P-S394-PER2 signal compared with total PER2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F</xref>) might suggest that the S394 phosphorylated form is less stable. Apparently, the opposite is the case, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>. Pharmacological inhibition of CDK5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>), CRISPR/Cas9-mediated knock-out of <italic>Cdk5</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>), and shRNA-mediated knock-down of <italic>Cdk5</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>) all led to reduced levels of PER2 in cells. The half-life of PER2 is clearly increased in the presence of CDK5, rising from about 4 hr to 11 hr, indicating that phosphorylation at S394 has a stabilizing function. This is in accordance with previous results that described almost absent levels of PER2 in the <italic>Per2<sup>Brdm1</sup></italic> mutant mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Zheng et al., 1999</xref>). This mouse strain expresses a PER2 lacking 87 amino acids in the PAS and PAC domains, where the S394 and the CDK5 consensus sequence are localized. CDK5 cannot phosphorylate this mutant PER2 and therefore the protein is less stable. As a consequence, the formation of the macromolecular complex responsible for nuclear transport of PER2 is disturbed. This results in a temporal change of BMAL1/CLOCK/NPAS2 activity, shortening the clock period. Accordingly, <italic>Per2<sup>Brdm1</sup></italic> mutant mice display a short period or no circadian period in constant darkness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Zheng et al., 1999</xref>), similar to the phenotype observed for the CDK5 knock-down mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>).</p><p>PER2 stability is affected by CK1δ/ε, which phosphorylate PER2 at several sites and regulate degradation of PER2 via the proteasome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Eide et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Xu et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Narasimamurthy et al., 2018</xref>). This effect is similar to the action of dbt on <italic>Drosophila</italic> per. Interestingly, CDK5 can phosphorylate CK1δ to reduce its activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Ianes et al., 2016</xref>). This phosphorylation could cross-regulate the activities of both kinds of kinases to fine-tune the amount of PER2. This is evidenced by the observation, that knock-down of <italic>Cdk5</italic> in <italic>Per2<sup>Brdm1</sup></italic> mutant mice further shortens period in these animals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D,E</xref>). The mammalian orthologue of shg, Gsk3β, does not phosphorylate the mammalian Tim but the nuclear receptor NR1D1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Mukherji et al., 2015</xref>). This change in substrate may be related to the shift in function of the CRYs to replace Tim in the mammalian circadian oscillator. Similar to shg, CDK5 phosphorylation of PER2 increases its half-life (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>). Lack of CDK5, and therefore lack of phosphorylation at S394 of PER2, leads to proteasomal degradation of PER2 as evidenced by epoxomycin treatment, which inhibits the proteasome and reduces the decline of PER2 levels in the cell (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E</xref>). This is consistent with a recent report that describes the ubiquitin ligase MDM2 as controlling PER2 degradation via the proteasome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Liu et al., 2018</xref>). However, it is not clear whether it is the phosphorylation at S394 per se or the capacity to participate in a macromolecular complex to enter the nucleus that stabilizes PER2. In any case, this phosphorylation appears to be essential for nuclear entry of PER2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6F,G</xref>).</p><p>A recent report showed that mammalian PER represses and de-represses transcription by displacing BMAL1-CLOCK from promoters in a CRY-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chiou et al., 2016</xref>). Our data support these findings. PER2 containing a S394G mutation, which abolishes CDK5-mediated phosphorylation, displayed reduced interaction potential with CRY1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6H</xref>). Because CRY1 is involved in nuclear transport of PER2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Kume et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Ollinger et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Yagita et al., 2000</xref>), lack of interaction with the S394G mutant form of PER2 leaves this protein in the cytoplasm, unable to enter the nucleus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6G</xref>). The present data are also in agreement with previous experiments in which we investigated the role of protein phosphatase 1 (PP1) and its effects on the circadian clock (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Schmutz et al., 2011</xref>). Expression of a specific PP1 inhibitor in the brain lengthened circadian period and increased PER2 levels and its nuclear accumulation in neurons. These effects are all opposite to what we observe when PER2 is not phosphorylated at S394. Therefore, it could be speculated that PP1 is involved in the dephosphorylation of P-S394, thereby counterbalancing phosphorylation of this site by CDK5.</p><p>Taken together, our results indicate that CDK5 potentially affects several proteins that regulate circadian clock period. In particular, we find that CDK5 phosphorylates PER2 at S394. This phosphorylation appears to be important for PER2 to bind efficiently to CRY1 in order to allow entry of PER2 into the nucleus. Inhibition of CDK5 in cells leads to degradation of PER2 in the proteasome (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). Inhibition of CDK5 in vivo inhibits nuclear entry of PER2 and shortens period to a similar extent as observed in <italic>Per2<sup>Brdm1</sup></italic> mutant mice, which express a barely detectable level of protein lacking 87 amino acids including S394. Taken together, CDK5 regulates the circadian clock and influences PER2 nuclear transport via phosphorylation. Because PER2 is involved in several physiologically relevant pathways in addition to clock regulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Albrecht et al., 2007</xref>), PER2 may mediate several biological functions that were previously linked to CDK5, such as the regulation of the brain reward system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Benavides et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bibb et al., 2001</xref>) and psychiatric diseases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Engmann et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Zhu et al., 2012</xref>).</p><fig id="fig7" position="float"><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><title>Model illustrating the regulation of PER2 by CDK5.</title><p>The upper row illustrates phosphorylation of PER2 at S394 by CDK5 that subsequently favors interaction with CRY1 and leads to transport into the nucleus, where the PER2/CRY1 complex inhibits BMAL1/NPAS2 (or in the periphery CLOCK)-driven transcriptional activation. Of note is that CDK5 potentially phosphorylates other clock relevant components, such as CLOCK, PER1 and CKI. The lower part illustrates that inhibition of CDK5 leads to a lack of S394 PER2 phosphorylation, which renders the PER2 protein more prone to degradation by the proteasome. CRY1 does not form a complex with PER2 and hence PER2 is not transported into the nucleus. CRY1 enters the nucleus independently and can inhibit the BMAL1:NPAS2 (or in the periphery CLOCK) transcriptional complex. This model is consistent with the dual modulation of transcriptional inhibition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Ye et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Xu et al., 2015</xref>). Transcriptional inhibition is modulated in an intricate unknown manner by various additional factors (gray) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Aryal et al., 2017</xref>) that may be cell type specific.</p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-50925-fig7-v2.tif"/></fig></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th valign="top">Reagent type <break/>(species) or <break/>resource</th><th valign="top">Designation</th><th valign="top">Source or <break/>reference</th><th valign="top">Identifiers</th><th valign="top">Additional <break/>information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td valign="top">Genetic reagent (<italic>M. musculus</italic>)</td><td valign="top"><italic>Per2<sup>Brdm1</sup></italic></td><td valign="top">Jackson Laboratory</td><td valign="top">Stock #: 003819</td><td valign="top">PMID: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10408444">10408444</ext-link></td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Genetic reagent (<italic>M. musculus</italic>)</td><td valign="top">B6;129P2-Per2tm1Ual/Biat</td><td valign="top">European mouse mutant archive</td><td valign="top">Strain ID EM:10599</td><td valign="top">PMID: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26838474">26838474</ext-link></td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Cell line <break/>(<italic>M. musculus</italic>)</td><td valign="top">NIH3T3</td><td valign="top">ATCC</td><td valign="top">Cat. #: ATCCRCRL-1658<sup>Tm</sup></td><td valign="top">Immortalized <break/>Mouse fibroblast cells</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Cell line <break/>(<italic>M. musculus</italic>)</td><td valign="top">NIH3T3 <break/>CRISPR/Cas9 <break/><italic>Cdk5</italic> KO</td><td valign="top">Origene</td><td valign="top">Cat. #: <break/>KN303042</td><td valign="top">Immortalized <break/>Mouse fibroblast cells.7 ug/ml of puromycin are required for cells propagation</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Cell line <break/>(<italic>Human</italic>)</td><td valign="top">HEK</td><td valign="top">ATCC</td><td valign="top"/><td valign="top">Immortalized <break/>Kidney fibroblast cells</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Transfected construct (<italic>M. musculus</italic>)</td><td valign="top">Sh RNA CDK5 plasmids</td><td valign="top">Origene</td><td valign="top">Cat. #: <break/>TL515615 A/B/C/D</td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Transfected construct (<italic>M. musculus</italic>)</td><td valign="top">Sh RNA scramble</td><td valign="top">Origene</td><td valign="top">Cat. #: <break/>TR30021</td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Antibody</td><td valign="top">anti-PER2-1 <break/>(Rabbit polyclonal)</td><td valign="top">Alpha Diagnostic <break/>Lot #

regulating circadian timing. There are a growing number of modifying enzymes and different type of PTM that form a complex network of regulation. The addition of CDK5 to this network is an important one.</p><p><bold>Decision letter after peer review:</bold></p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Cyclin dependent kinase 5 (CDK5) regulates the circadian clock&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by two peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Catherine Dulac as the Senior Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>Brenna and colleagues provide in this article interesting evidences of the role of CDK5 in the regulation of the circadian clock. Using genetic screen in yeast, viruses-injected animals and knockout and knockdown cells, they clearly show CDK5 shows a rhythmic activity in the SCN, interact with PER2 in a rhythmic fashion, phosphorylates PER2 at serine 394 and regulates its stability and nuclear transport. Finally, they show that Cdk5 knockdown in the SCN of injected animals reduces their circadian period. While authors convincingly show that CDK5 regulates PER2 stability and transport through phosphorylation, the impact of this regulation on the reduced period observed in Cdk5 knockdown animals is less clear. This is confirmed by the fact that this knockdown has the same effect on the period of Per2 mutant animals, suggesting alternative targets that need more attention.</p><p>However, the contribution of the described pathway to the observed changes of circadian period length upon knockdown of CDK5 in the SCN is not entirely convincing and is based on circumstantial evidence. Specifically, CDK5 could act on CK1δ, as described by the Virshup lab. CK1α which is not phosphorylated at T347 is more active, resulting in a short period phenotype, just as the one observed by the authors.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>- Figure 1. The short period phenotype in CDK5 knockdown animals appears to be Per2-independent since knockdown of CDK5 in <italic>Per2<sup>Brdm1</sup></italic> animals still shows comparable period reduction as knockdown of CDK5 in wild type mice. <italic>Per2<sup>Brdm1</sup></italic> still express a truncated form of Per2, hence the authors should also consider a similar experiment in Per2 KO animals to prove Per2-dependent mechanism. Alternatively, the CDK5 phenotype in <italic>Per2<sup>Brdm1</sup></italic>animals could be due to CDK5 phosphorylating Per1, which is not discussed by the authors.</p><p>- Figure 1.

The short period phenotype in CDK5 knockdown animals appears to be Per2-independent since knockdown of CDK5 in Per2<sup>Brdm1</sup> animals still shows comparable period reduction as knockdown of CDK5 in wild type mice.</p></disp-quote><p>We think the reviewer is referring to Figure 2 and not Figure 1. Figure 2 shows that knock-down of CDK5 causes short period length that is comparable to the period of <italic>Per2<sup>Brdm1</sup></italic>mutant mice. As the reviewer states correctly, knockdown of Cdk5 in <italic>Per2<sup>Brdm1</sup></italic> mutant mice leads to even further shortening of period. The reviewer concludes from this that period shortening by knockdown of Cdk5 is therefore Per2 independent.</p><p>A genetic complementation assay, in our case the knockdown of Cdk5 in <italic>Per2<sup>Brdm1</sup></italic>, allows the identification of genes that are in the same complementation group. If Per2 was the sole target of CDK5 and the phosphorylation important for the period length, then one would expect that the combination of knockdown and knockout would have the same effect as the single conditions. This is not what was observed. However, the effect is not simply additive to indicate two different pathways as suggested by the reviewer. In this scenario, the one-hour reduction of <italic>Per2<sup>Brdm1</sup></italic> and the one-hour reduction of the knockdown would add up to an at least two-hour shortening and not to the about 1.5 hour shortening as observed. Hence, part of the Cdk5 knockdown effect is mediated by Per2, and this is all what we can/want to say.</p><p>Additionally, our immunofluorescence experiments show, that knockdown of Cdk5 in the SCN prevents PER2 to be localized in the nucleus (Figure 6). If the reviewers view would be correct, this would mean that PER2 protein localization whether in the nucleus or not would be irrelevant for the generation of period length. This, however, is not what genetic experiments revealed, namely that PER2 is a negative feedback loop component of the circadian oscillatory mechanism important to generate circadian period (for review see Chong et al., 2012) for which its nuclear shuttling is essential.</p><p>However, the reviewer has a point, because this experiment shows that knockdown of Cdk5 can affect period not exclusively via PER2 and that there are other Cdk5 targets that may become important in absence of PER2 (what we actually state in the manuscript, see also the new Figure 7).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Per2<sup>Brdm1</sup> still express a truncated form of Per2, hence the authors should also consider a similar experiment in Per2 KO animals to prove Per2-dependent mechanism.</p></disp-quote><p>Theoretically, it is correct that <italic>Per2<sup>Brdm1</sup></italic> mice express a truncated form of PER2. This truncated form of PER2, however, is not in the nucleus, very unstable and degraded fast. We could not detect any PER2 protein in the SCN of <italic>Per2<sup>Brdm1</sup></italic> mice (Figure 3) similar to our findings in Per2 total KO SCN (Chavan et al., 2016). This is the reason why the total Per2 ko and the <italic>Per2<sup>Brdm1</sup></italic> mutant show the same free-running period (see Figure 2 and Chavan et al., 2016, Figure 2—figure supplement 5). Hence, a knockdown of Cdk5 in Per2 KO mice will show the same effect on period as the knockdown in <italic>Per2<sup>Brdm1</sup></italic> animals.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Alternatively, the CDK5 phenotype in Per2<sup>Brdm1</sup> animals could be due to CDK5 phosphorylating Per1, which is not discussed by the authors.</p></disp-quote><p>Since the PER1 and PER2 proteins only differ in a conservative amino acid change one amino acid before the PER2 Ser 394, i. e. PFD<bold>Y</bold><underline>S</underline>PIR in Per2 and PFD<bold>H</bold><underline>S</underline>PIR in PER1, it is likely that CDK5 may also phosphorylate PER1.</p><p>However, if PER1 would be phosphorylated at the mentioned site above at the same rate as PER2, then also PER1 in addition to PER2 would be absent in the nucleus. This would correspond to a PER1/PER2 double ko. PER1/PER2 ko mice become immediately arrhythmic when they are in constant darkness. This is not the phenotype we observe in the CDK5 knock-down mice and hence it is unlikely that Cdk5 has the same effect on PER1 as it has on PER2. The affinity and efficiency of CDK5 to phosphorylate Per2 may be much higher than that for Per1. However, if PER2 protein is absent (as in the Per2 Brdm mutant) PER1 may become phosphorylated by CDK5 to a greater extent (no competition with PER2) and affect period. Therefore, it will be of great interest to study the relationship between Cdk5, Per1 and Per2. We have discussed this aspect now in the manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>- Figure 1. Eng, Edison and Virshup, 2017, demonstrated that CKIδ activity towards Per2 is regulated via phosphorylation of T347 by proline-directed kinases (presumably also CDK5). This possibility should be addressed by the authors.</p></disp-quote><p>We apologize that this study has escaped our attention. Although we mention that CDK5 may phosphorylate CKI (Ianes et al., 2016) this study also indicates this. However, both studies do not provide any evidence for CDK5 phosphorylating CKI at T347 in vivo. We cite now both articles in the revised version and depict this possibility in Figure 7.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>- Figure 6. To prove the relevance of this mechanism to other peripheral oscillators, the authors should include an experiment in NIH-3T3 Bmal1-luc cells transfected with shRNA against CDK5.</p></disp-quote><p>This is a very good suggestion and we performed the proposed experiment in NIH-3T3 Bmal1-luc cells (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig1">Author response image 1</xref>) previously in order to determine the efficiencies of CDK5 shRNAs. We observed a longer period, which would suggest that CDK5 activity in peripheral clocks in vitro has not the same effects compared to central clocks in vivo. CDK5 is a kinase that has many targets which are involved in many different signaling cascades. This may influence circadian period in central and peripheral clocks differently, although the molecular effect on PER2 as target is the same. For example, CDK5 phosphorylates CLOCK, which may be more important in peripheral tissues compared to the central pacemaker in the SCN, where Clock can be replaced by NPAS2. Since the results we present in the paper are showing the role of CDK5 in the central clock, we rather prefer not to put the result on peripheral clocks in vitro in this paper. This will avoid confusion between central and peripheral effects of CDK5 in the clock.</p><fig id="respfig1"><label>Author response image 1.</label><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-50925-resp-fig1-v2.tif"/></fig><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>- Mutation of PER2 Ser 394 impacts circadian oscillation.</p></disp-quote><p>This is a very good suggestion, which we also wanted to do. However, overexpressing a PER Ser 394 mutant protein in cell cultures will simply interfere with the circadian clock mechanism in cells, because there is no system at hand that would allow us to express even the normal PER2 protein in a dynamic (circadian) manner. In other words, there is no cell culture system available that would rescue Per2 ko cell lines by overexpression of PER2, since the dynamic presence over time of PER2 is essential for establishing a circadian rhythm. Hence having no rescue system for wild type PER2, it makes no sense to overexpress Ser 394 mutant PER2. Its overexpression simply will interfere with the dynamic time dependent protein-protein interactions of the clock machinery and block it in a similar manner as wild type PER2 would (see Wallach et al., 2013, PLoS Genetics, 9, e1003398).</p><p>In vivo a knock-in experiment would be interesting to replace normal PER2 with a Ser 394 PER2 mutant protein. However, we would expect as similar phenotype as in the <italic>Per2<sup>Brdm1</sup></italic> mutant since the Ser 394 is missing there as well and the PER protein in the <italic>Per2<sup>Brdm1</sup></italic> mice is very unstable and degraded quickly. Furthermore, a PER2 Ser 394 knock in experiment in mice is for us not feasible to do within 2 months.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>- CDK5 potentially also phosphorylates and regulates PER1 stability and transport.</p></disp-quote><p>This is a highly interesting question (see also above). Since the PER1 and PER2 proteins only differ in a conservative amino acid change one amino acid before the PER2 Ser 394, i.e. PFD<bold>Y</bold><underline>S</underline>PIR in Per2 and PFD<bold>H</bold><underline>S</underline>PIR in PER1, it is likely that CDK5 may also phosphorylate PER1.</p><p>However, if PER1 would be phosphorylated at the mentioned site above and its function would be the same as in PER2, then also PER1 in addition to PER2 would lack in the nucleus. This would correspond to a PER1/PER2 double ko. PER1/PER2 ko mice become immediately arrhythmic when they are in constant darkness. This is not the phenotype we observe in the CDK5 knock-down mice and hence it is unlikely that Cdk5, has the same functional effect on PER1 as it has on PER2. We agree that it remains to be seen what the function of a potential phosphorylation of PER1 by CDK5 might be. This is, however, out of the scope of this manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>- CDK5 regulation of CLOCK (and potentially NPAS2) contributes to the observed phenotype: CLOCK stability and transport are impacted by Cdk5 knockout?</p></disp-quote><p>As the reviewer suggests, a study has indicated that CDK5 may phosphorylate CLOCK in vitro (which is cited in the text). If CDK5 regulation of CLOCK in the SCN would play a major role, we would expect the period in wheel running activity to become longer, similar to CLOCK mutant mice (Vitaterna et al., 1994, Science, 264: 719-25). What we observe, however, is a shorter circadian activity period upon knockdown of Cdk5. Therefore, it is unlikely that Clock plays a major role in the behavioral phenotype we observe. Whether NPAS2 can be phosphorylated by CDK5 is unknown and we cannot exclude such a possibility. Interestingly, NPAS2 does not show any consensus sequence that would be recognized by CDK5. Therefore, it is unlikely that CDK5 phosphorylates NPAS2. However, further investigation of the role of CDK5 in the phosphorylation of CLOCK may reveal additional and novel aspects in circadian clock regulation, but is out of the scope of this study.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Is the circadian effect of Cdk5 knockdown also observed in Clock knockout?</p></disp-quote><p>This is related to the question above and very interesting. We have not done an experiment in Clock knock-out mice with a knockdown of Cdk5. I would expect that the longer period phenotype of Clock KO mice would be shortened and appear normal like in wild-type. This is of course a speculation and it remains to be seen what happens in Clock KO mice. Knockdown of Cdk5 would also be interesting to perform in Npas2 KO, Cry KO, Per1 KO, Rev-erba KO and Bmal1 KO mouse strains. However, this is out of the scope of this study.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>While the effect of CDK5 on circadian period is clearly showed, the involvement of PER2 in the mechanism is not clear, meaning the model on Figure 7 is mainly speculative at this stage.</p></disp-quote><p>From the questions and answers above it is clear that the regulation of the circadian clock mechanism by CDK5 is more complicated than depicted in the model. We acknowledge this in the revised Figure 7 highlighting the potential additional players that may be influenced by CDK5. However, some aspects in the model concerning PER2 are supported by our findings as well as by previous studies that are cited. A model is always based on what we know. Because we do not know everything of a process the model has to be continuously adapted according to new findings.</p></body></sub-article></article>
