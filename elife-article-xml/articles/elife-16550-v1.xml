axis. During interphase, we found that a unique membrane structure invaginates from the posterior to the centre of the cell, in a microtubule-dependent manner. The invagination projects toward centrioles on the apical side of the nucleus and associates with one of them. Further, a cilium forms on the posterior side of the cell and its basal body remains associated with the invagination. A laser ablation experiment suggests that the invagination is under tensile force and promotes the posterior positioning of the centrosome. Finally, we showed that the orientation of the invaginations is coupled with the polarized dynamics of centrosome movements and the orientation of cell division. Based on these findings, we propose a model whereby this novel membrane structure orchestrates centrosome positioning and thus the orientation of cell division axis.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.16550.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.16550.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.16550.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>An animal develops from a single fertilized egg cell. Several rounds of cell division then occur to create new cells and form an embryo. Often, the direction of cell division is oriented, rather than random. In other words, the positioning of the two new daughter cells is highly organized during cell division. This orientation of the direction of cell division is also important for shaping the body’s tissues.</p><p>Animal cells contain a structure called the centrosome that helps to regulate cell division (amongst other roles). Just before a cell divides, the centrosome duplicates itself and the copies move toward opposite ends of the cell. A structure called the mitotic spindle then forms out of the centrosomes and ensures that the newly forming cells contain the correct amount of genetic material. The orientation of the spindle specifies where the cell splits into two, and this orientation is ultimately governed by the position of the centrosomes inside the cell. However, it is not fully understood how cells position their centrosomes.</p><p>Sea squirts are simple marine animals that are well suited for studying cell division, in part because their embryos consist of a small number of cells. Negishi et al. have now studied the final cell division cycle of the outer cells of sea squirt embryos, during which nearly all the cells divide in the same direction – along an axis that stretches from the embryo’s head to its tail. This revealed that before a spindle forms in these cells, the cell membrane at the rear end of each cell is pulled into the cell, forming an “invagination” that elongates along the head-to-tail axis.</p><p>The finger-like membrane invagination captures the centrosome and pulls it towards the rear end of the cell. Following this, the centrosome duplicates and the new centrosomes move until they are aligned with the membrane invagination. Once both centrosomes are aligned correctly, the spindle forms.</p><p>Thus, membrane invaginations serve to position centrosomes. The next steps are to identify the molecules that allow membrane invaginations and centrosomes to interact with each other and to determine the forces that place centrosomes in their correct location.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.16550.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.16550.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>spindle orientation</kwd><kwd>Ciliary positioning</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd><italic>C. intestinalis</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001691</institution-id><institution>Japan Society for the Promotion of Science</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>13J03013</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Negishi</surname><given-names>Takefumi</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001665</institution-id><institution>Agence Nationale de la Recherche</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>ANR-09-BLAN-0013-01</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Yasuo</surname><given-names>Hitoyoshi</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004097</institution-id><institution>Fondation ARC pour la Recherche sur le Cancer</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>1144</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Yasuo</surname><given-names>Hitoyoshi</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001691</institution-id><institution>Japan Society for the Promotion of Science</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>22127007</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ueno</surname><given-names>Naoto</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>A newly discovered membrane structure associates with one of the centrioles and affects two important centrosomal events in epidermal cells – ciliary positioning and spindle orientation – through a physical interaction.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The orientation of the mitotic division axis has been proposed to control tissue morphogenesis as well as cell fate determination, thus playing an important role in shaping embryonic forms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Lu and Johnston, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Moorhouse and Burgess, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Siller and Doe, 2009</xref>). The mechanism determining the orientation of the mitotic spindle has been extensively studied in both cultured and embryonic cells and precise molecular processes are well understood (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bell et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cao et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Delaval et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Kiyomitsu and Cheeseman, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Woolner and Papalopulu, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Zheng et al., 2010</xref>). One strategy to achieve this is the control of centrosome dynamics. Centrosome works as a microtubule-organizing center (MTOC) in animal cells and consists of a pair of mother and daughter centrioles, which are distinct in both structure and age (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Azimzadeh and Bornens, 2007</xref>). Following duplication and migration, the two centrosomes become aligned to serve as spindle poles during mitosis. Thus, the axis of centrosome alignment is frequently consistent with mitotic spindle orientation unless additional constraints such as cell shape exist to alter the spindle orientation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Gibson et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Minc et al., 2011</xref>). Specific mother-daughter centrosome inheritance coupled with asymmetric cell division is a highly conserved phenomenon (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Yamashita, 2009</xref>). It has been first reported in budding yeast that the 'old' spindle pole body corresponding to the mother centrosome, segregates into the bud (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Pereira et al., 2001</xref>). <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> male germline stem cells and neuroblasts have contributed to our understandings of the molecular mechanisms underlying the asymmetric migration of the duplicated centrosomes during interphase. In male germline cells, membrane localized Adenomatous polyposis coli 2 (Apc2) and the <italic>Drosophila</italic> Par-3 homolog, Bazooka, associated with E-cadherin, tethers one centrosome adjacent to the niche, called the hub, and consequently ensures spindle orientation and asymmetric stem cell division (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Inaba et al., 2015a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Yamashita et al., 2003</xref>). In male germline cells, it is the mother centrosome with stable astral microtubules which is anchored near the hub (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Yamashita et al., 2007</xref>). In neuroblasts, the centrosome with the higher MTOC activity remains in the neuroblast following asymmetric cell division (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Rebollo et al., 2007</xref>). In contrast to the male germ line, it is the daughter centrosome that is retained in the stem cell (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Conduit and Raff, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Januschke et al., 2011</xref>). Centrobin, associated with the daughter centrosome, was found to be responsible for this oriented cell division (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Januschke et al., 2013</xref>). In both cell systems, the centrosome with a higher MTOC activity is less motile and is inherited by the stem cell (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Pelletier and Yamashita, 2012</xref>).</p><p>In addition to a role in spindle orientation, the centrosome also has an important role in cilia formation. During ciliogenesis, the mother centriole converts into the basal body in a quiescent (G0 phase) or interphase (G1 phase) cell to nucleate a primary cilium. Following re-entry or progression of the cell cycle, the primary cilium is disassembled and the basal body/mother centriole is reused for mitotic spindle formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Kobayashi and Dynlacht, 2011</xref>). It is unclear how the centrosome transition is coordinated between cilia and spindle.</p><p>In this study, we use embryos of ascidian, belonging to the phylum Tunicata, a sister group of the vertebrates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Satoh et al., 2014</xref>). Ascidian embryos are ideally suited to study mechanisms of cell division because of their invariant cleavage pattern and the small number of cells that form their bodies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Conklin, 1905</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Nishida, 1986</xref>). The pattern of cell division is highly conserved among different ascidian species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Conklin, 1905</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Lemaire et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Zalokar and Sardet, 1984</xref>). This implies robust mechanistic constraints on the cell division patterns of ascidian development. Several studies, including our own, have reported unique mechanisms of spindle orientation in ascidian embryos (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Kumano et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Nakamura et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Negishi and Yasuo, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Negishi et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Nishikata et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Prodon et al., 2010</xref>). In this study, we focused on embryonic epidermal cells in the cosmopolitan ascidian, <italic>Ciona intestinalis</italic>. It was previously reported that almost all epidermal cells cleave along the anterior-posterior (A–P) axis at the last (11th) division when the <italic>Ciona</italic> embryo starts shaping into a tadpole larval form (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Ogura et al., 2011</xref>). We describe here a novel membrane structure that may control centrosome dynamics including ciliary positioning and spindle orientation during this last cell division of the epidermal cells.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>A unique membrane structure during interphase of ascidian epidermal cells undergoing oriented cell division</title><p>The epidermal cell lineage of ascidians is known to divide alternately along the A-P and medial-lateral (M– L) axes during early cleavage stages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Nishida, 1994</xref>). The perpendicular shift of the cell division axis during successive rounds of cell division is thought to result from a 90° translocation of the duplicated centrosomes around the nucleus to the opposite directions (Sach’s rule) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Mardin and Schiebel, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Strome, 1993</xref>). This alternating 90° shift of the division axis tends to follow the long-axis rule based on cell shape (Hertwig’s rule) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hertwig, 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Minc et al., 2011</xref>). With live imaging analysis of epidermal cell division, we confirmed that almost all epidermal cells divide along the A–P axis at the last (11th) division as reported previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Ogura et al., 2011</xref>).

Additionally, we found, during the 11th (but not the 10th) cell cycle, that the nucleus of the epidermal cells gradually shifts toward the posterior side (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D,E</xref> and <xref ref-type="other" rid="media1">Video 1</xref>).<fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.16550.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title><italic>Ciona intestinalis</italic> epidermal cell mitosis and the posterior nuclear positioning prior to the final cell division.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Representative epidermal cell divisions (white arrows) from the 10th to the 11th cell cycle in an embryo expressing PH-GFP/H2B-mCherry; frames are from <xref ref-type="other" rid="media1">Video 1</xref>.

We found a unique structure (membrane invagination) that formed in almost all of the epidermal cells specifically during the interphase of the last (11th) division cycle (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A,B</xref>, magenta and blue arrows). Time-lapse observations of cells that had committed to cell division revealed that the invaginating membrane did not adopt a stable, solid form, but rather appeared to be a highly dynamic filamentous structure (<xref ref-type="other" rid="media2">Video 2</xref>). To confirm the structure of the invaginating membranes, we used another membrane binding probe using a domain of c-Ha-Ras, memGFP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Morita et al., 2012</xref>) or membrane-staining fluorescent dye, FM4-64 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>), which demonstrated that the invaginations were not an artefact of a specific protein or GFP staining itself. The filamentous structures are located near the apical surface approximately 1.5 μm beneath the apical membrane (base: 1.33 ± 0.56 µm, tip: 0.98 ± 0.37 µm n = 71, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). The length of the invaginations changed over time, ranging from roughly one-third to half of the cell diameter (2.0–5.0 μm) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>). Interestingly, some cells that formed a vertex with posterior cells had two or more invaginations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>, magenta arrows). Quantitative analysis showed that most of the invaginations projected from the posterior or lateral side toward the anterior (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>), at a nearly perpendicular angle to the cell membrane (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G</xref>), although transient, randomly projected filamentous membranes were also observed (See <xref ref-type="other" rid="media6">Videos 6</xref> and <xref ref-type="other" rid="media8">8</xref>). These results suggest that the membrane structure forms near the apical cortex and elongates along the A-P axis. All of the invaginations disappeared just before spindle formation became visible, suggesting that the formation of the invagination is temporally regulated. In fact, the invaginations were observed without exception during the interphase of the 11th cell cycle in epidermal cells. These results prompted us to investigate whether this novel membrane structure is involved in the spindle orientation.<fig id="fig2" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.16550.006</object-id><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Characterisation of the invaginating membrane structure.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Low-magnification image of epidermal cells in a normal <italic>Ciona intestinalis</italic> embryo expressing PH-GFP, during the 11th cell division cycle.

For this analysis, ascidian embryos were fixed at the 11th cell-division cycle. In a series of several hundred sections, we observed fragmented membrane structures directed toward the centrioles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>, blue arrows, <xref ref-type="other" rid="media3">Video 3</xref>). Notably, 3D reconstructions from serial sections (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>, <xref ref-type="other" rid="media4">Videos 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="other" rid="media5">5</xref>) showed the tip of the invagination approaching the centrioles as if to capture the organelle. These observations raised the interesting possibility that the invagination might physically capture the centrosome and pull it toward the posterior of the cell. SEM images showed that the invaginations were formed of a double-bilayer plasma membrane and that adjacent posterior cell membrane also contributed to this structure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>, <xref ref-type="other" rid="media3">Videos 3</xref>–<xref ref-type="other" rid="media5">5</xref>).

At the border between two differently labelled cells, the invaginating membranes were labelled with both green and red fluorescence, indicating that the layers of the invaginating membrane were derived from the both of the neighbouring cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>, white arrowheads).<media content-type="glencoe play-in-place height-250 width-310" id="media3" mime-subtype="mp4" mimetype="video" xlink:href="elife-16550-media3.mp4"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.16550.007</object-id><label>Video 3.</label><caption><title>A video made of serial sections of SBM-SEM images.</title><p>Blue arrow: invagination.

MTOCs in epidermal cells were fluorescently labelled with the microtubule-binding protein ensconsin (E-MAP-115) tagged with tdTomato (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bulinski et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Dong et al., 2011</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref> and <xref ref-type="other" rid="media6">Video 6</xref>). We found that the interphase microtubule array was aligned with the A-P axis with its nucleation site localised at the posterior side, indicating that a stable MTOC was positioned to the posterior of the cells. To record the dynamics of centrosome behaviour in epidermal cells, we decided to use end-binding 3 (EB3), which marks the plus end of the microtubule as it grows away from the organising centre (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Akhmanova and Hoogenraad, 2005</xref>) and highlights the MTOC activity at the centrosome. Before the formation of the invagination at the early interphase of the 11th cell cycle, EB3-labelled centrosomes were located beneath the apical surface of the epidermal cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>, white arrowheads and <xref ref-type="other" rid="media7">Video 7</xref>). We then co-visualised the centrosomes and membrane invaginations by time-lapse imaging of EB3-mCherry/PH-GFP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref> and <xref ref-type="other" rid="media8">Video 8</xref>). These analyses showed that the invaginations appeared to extend toward highly concentrated EB3-mCherry signals over time (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>, 33'–79'). Importantly, the invagination and the centrosome remain associated during posterior displacement. Although during the 10th division cycle, centrosomes were distributed equally along the A-P axis of epidermal cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>), in the 11th division cycle following the emergence of the membrane invagination, the distribution of centrosome positioning was strongly biased to the posterior of the cell (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C,D</xref>). By the time the invagination disappeared, the centrosome had duplicated; the two centrosomes then migrated asymmetrically until they were aligned with the axis of invagination (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>, white brackets in 79'). Indeed, our quantitative analysis indicated that the posterior-most centrosome migrated a shorter distance than the anterior one in the 11th division cycle, while this is not the case in the previous cell cycle (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>). After the centrosome migration, we measured the angle between the axis of aligned centrosomes and the direction of invagination(s). When there were multiple invaginations, we calculated the composition of these structures as a vector. The analysis revealed that the migrated centrosomes were well-aligned along the axis of membrane invagination (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref>). Mitotic spindles then form with the two spindle poles aligned along the axis of the invagination (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>, 104'; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>, 79' and 96'). Taken together, these observations suggest that the formation of the invagination may be correlated with the apical and posterior positioning of the centrosomes and the subsequent asymmetric migratory behaviour of the duplicated centrosomes.<fig id="fig4" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.16550.012</object-id><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><title>Quantitative description of centrosome behaviour in relation to the membrane invaginations.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Epidermal cells in the 11th cell cycle showing the interphase microtubule array along the A-P axis and membrane invaginations toward the microtubule nucleation site in an embryo expressing PH-GFP/Ensconsin-tdTomato.

Microtubule depolymerisation with nocodazole blocked the formation of invaginations completely (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>), indicating that MTOC activity induces the invaginations and that, in turn, the invaginations relocate the MTOC to the posterior of cells.

Further, we explored the topological relationship between the membrane invagination and microtubules by serial transmission electron microscopy (serial-TEM) observation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7E</xref>, <xref ref-type="other" rid="media11">Video 11</xref>). In serial-TEM, the membrane invaginations were visualized as double bilayer fragments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7Ea–f</xref>) extending toward the basal body (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7Eh–k</xref>). Abundant microtubules were also observed between the tip of invagination and the basal body (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7Ef–h</xref>), but no microtubules were observed within the invagination itself. These results indicate that the membrane invagination in ascidian epidermal cell is distinct from microtubule-filled nanotubes although both tubular structures are sensitive to microtubule depolymerization. Our results also indicate that the membrane invagination may associate with the centrosome via microtubules.<media content-type="glencoe play-in-place height-250 width-310" id="media11" mime-subtype="mp4" mimetype="video" xlink:href="elife-16550-media11.mp4"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.16550.019</object-id><label>Video 11.</label><caption><title>A video made of sections of serial-TEM images shows the invagination toward the basal body.</title><p>This video is related to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7E</xref>.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.16550.019">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.16550.019</ext-link></p></caption></media><media content-type="glencoe play-in-place height-250 width-310" id="media12" mime-subtype="mp4" mimetype="video" xlink:href="elife-16550-media12.mp4"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.16550.020</object-id><label>Video 12.</label><caption><title>(10 fps) A time-lapse movie of an embryo expressing PH-GFP (green) and EB3-mCherry (magenta), made with a time series of a single confocal plane.</title><p>Laser irradiation occurs at the third frame.

To examine whether a pulling force was generated between the membrane invaginations and the posteriorly located centrioles, we employed laser ablation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Rauzi et al., 2008</xref>). The junction of the fluorescently labelled invagination and the EB3-mCherry-labelled centrosome was cut by UV laser irradiation, and the cells were observed by time-lapse imaging (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8A</xref>, white cross). Interestingly, the end of the cut edge of the invaginations regressed immediately to the basal position, suggesting that the invaginations are normally under tension (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8A</xref>, <xref ref-type="other" rid="media12">Video 12</xref>). Therefore, the displacement of the nucleus during the 11th cell-division cycle could be explained by a posteriorly directed force (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D,E</xref>). In the series of laser ablation experiments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8B</xref>), we noted that the longer invaginations had a tendency to regress more rapidly (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8C</xref>). The results show a positive correlation between the initial length and both average and max speed of regression (recoiling). When we cut one of two invaginations that cooperatively support a single centrosome, a significant recoil occurred toward the intact (uncut) invagination (<xref ref-type="other" rid="media13">Video 13</xref>). This finding strongly suggests that the centrosome was balanced by two invaginations that generate pulling forces. Interestingly, soon (15 min) after the cutting, we found that the plasma membrane re-invaginated toward the centrosome (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8D</xref>).<media content-type="glencoe play-in-place height-250 width-310" id="media13" mime-subtype="mp4" mimetype="video" xlink:href="elife-16550-media13.mp4"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.16550.022</object-id><label>Video 13.</label><caption><title>(10 fps) A time-lapse movie of an embryo expressing PH-GFP (green) and EB3-mCherry (magenta), made with a time series of a single confocal plane.</title><p>Laser irradiation on the lower invaginations occurs at the 10th frame.

These results suggest that the posterior distribution of the invaginations is tightly associated with the direction of mitotic divisions. We also found that the nuclei were distributed around the center of the cells with the omni-directional invaginations, as opposed to the posterior localisation observed in the cells with directional invaginations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10B</xref>). Moreover, the centrosomes were also positioned in the center of the cells with the radial formation of invaginations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10A</xref>; Omni-directional 86', <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10C</xref> and <xref ref-type="other" rid="media14">Video 14</xref>).

This includes positioning of centrosomes and cilia and determination of the cell division axis (graphical summary and model in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11">Figure 11A,B</xref>). We propose a model whereby these events are coupled by physical interaction between a centriole and plasma membrane, which results in the generation of a tensile force in the latter. Although we could not directly demonstrate that the membrane invagination is required for mitotic spindle orientation, our data is consistent with our model whereby the centrosome is captured by a unique membrane structure and is subsequently tethered to the posterior side of cells. In the <italic>Drosophila</italic> stem cell systems, duplicated centrosomes generated from an eccentrically positioned centrosome show differential motilities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Yamashita and Fuller, 2008</xref>). In the ascidian epidermal cells in the 11th cell cycle, the duplicated centrosomes also exhibit differential motilities with the less motile centrosome remaining associated with the membrane invagination. Although some microtubule (MT)-filled nanotubes resist nocodazole treatment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Önfelt et al., 2006</xref>), the formation of the ascidian membrane invagination, like the MT-nanotubes in <italic>Drosophila</italic> male germ cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Inaba et al., 2015b</xref>), depends on microtubule function. However, the distribution of the microtubule is distinct in the latter two tubular membrane structures and it is not known whether MT-nanotubes protrude toward the centrosome. Interestingly, a similar membrane invagination to the one we observed in ascidian embryos was previously reported in the <italic>C. elegans</italic> zygote, and it was suggested that the actomyosin cortex counteracts pulling forces mediated by microtubules, resulting in the posterior displacement of the spindle and the unequal cell division (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Redemann et al., 2010</xref>). Our pharmacological tests with either microtubule or actin inhibitors resulted in similar observations to those described for the <italic>C. elegans</italic> membrane invagination. Importantly, we report here for the first time that membrane invaginations take place in normal (untreated) cells in a multicellular tissue (ascidian embryonic epidermis). Our observations collectively indicate that these invaginations (generally one or two per cell) arising from two adjacent plasma membranes may control centrosome dynamics and the orientation of the cell division axis. It should be also noted that a similar membrane invagination is observed during the formation of immunological synapses between T cells and antigen-presenting cells. During this process, T cells rapidly reposition their centrosome to the center of the immunological synapse. Importantly, the centrosome repositioning is coupled with the formation of a membrane invagination originating from the synaptic interphase and reaching towards the T-cell centrosome in a mirotubule-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Yi et al., 2013</xref>). Therefore, the microtubule-dependent mechanism in which a membrane invagination captures and repositions the centrosome may be a general mechanism that transcends species and cell types for polarised centrosome repositioning. In ascidian epidermal cells, this process appears to be also involved in the posterior positioning of the cilia. In this study, we revealed that the tip of the membrane invagination is found in close vicinity of the basal body, indicating that the membrane invagination might associate preferentially with the mother centriole. Since the mother and daughter centrioles inherit distinct components (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Pelletier and Yamashita, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Pereira et al., 2001</xref>), specific molecules of the mother centriole might be involved in establishing the proposed association with the membrane invagination. Posteriorly localized cilia are found in several systems and it will be interesting to determine if their position depends on similar mechanism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Antic et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Borovina et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Hashimoto et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Momose et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Thompson et al., 2012</xref>).<fig id="fig11" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.16550.027</object-id><label>Figure 11.</label><caption><title>A proposed model for mitotic spindle orientation driven by membrane invaginations.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Graphical summary of the spatial relationship of each component.

In the lower panel, the assumed forces involved in the invagination are shown. MTOC activity on the centrosome causes the 'approaching' invagination from the plasma membrane, likely to be depending on microtubule function.

This observation implies that the membrane invagination has an elastic restoring force rather than an active force generator like cell-cell junctions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Ishihara and Sugimura, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Rauzi et al., 2008</xref>).</p><p>Some questions remain to be addressed—for example, which molecule(s) acts as the force generator to invaginate the plasma membrane and establish a link with the centrosome. The microtubule-dependent invagination process targeting the centrosome implies the involvement of plus-end-directed motor. Indeed, the generation of membrane invaginations in <italic>C. elegans</italic> one-cell embryos involves cortical dynein motors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Redemann et al., 2010</xref>). Therefore, this plus-end motor protein would be one of the promising candidates for the formation of invagination in ascidian epidermal cells. The rigidity of the plasma membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Ramanathan et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Stewart et al., 2011</xref>) should be measured during the cell cycle to clarify the mechanism of the phase transition of the membrane invagination, from 'approaching' to 'pulling' the centrosome. Furthermore, by disrupting a core PCP component in ascidian epidermal cells, we have shown a tight correlation between the direction of membrane invagination and centrosome dynamics including mitotic spindle orientation. However, in this experiment, we cannot rule out the possibility that the PCP pathway affects centrosome behavior independently of this membrane structure. Hence, it should be further addressed how the PCP pathway participates in the regulation of centrosome dynamics and the polarization of the membrane invagination. It will also be intriguing to investigate whether the PCP pathway regulates the asymmetric distribution of the actomyosin network and/or plus-end motors in ascidian epidermal cells. Nevertheless, our present work uncovers a previously unknown mechanism associating the centrosome and the plasma membrane, and may open new avenues of investigation into the hidden mechanisms of oriented cell division that underlie embryogenesis and organogenesis.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Embryo handling</title><p><italic>Ciona intestinalis</italic> adults were supplied by the National Bio Resource Project (NBRP, Japan) or purchased from the Station Biologique de Roscoff (France).

The pRN3 was digested by BglII and NotI. To construct PH-tdTomato, we made pRN3-RfA-tdTomato from pCX3-RfA-tdTomato, a gift from Dr. T. Momose. The pCX3-RfA-tdTomato was digested by Acc65I and blunt-ended. RfA-tdTomato was cut out by the restriction enzyme BglII and subcloned into the pRN3 vector. The ORF of the PH domain was PCR-amplified from PH-GFP (forward primer AAAGGATCCACCATGGACTCGGGCCGGGACTTCCT; reverse primer TTTGAATTCCCCGGGGATGTTGAGCTCCTTCAGGA) and subcloned into the pENTR vector, which was mixed with pRN3-RfA-tdTomato in a Gateway LR reaction (Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA).

The angle, length, and centroid of the cell and the nucleus were manually measured with ImageJ. The length and direction of the invagination were measured in the maximum-intensity projection of time-lapse movies of embryos expressing PH-GFP at the time point when an invagination reached its maximum length (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E–G</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref>).

The long axis of the cell was determined and measured just before the nuclear membrane breakdown, and we calculated the angle of the cell division axis relative to the long axis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). In embryos expressing PH-GFP/H2B-mCherry, we measured the position of individual nuclei just before the nuclear membrane breakdown. We measured the centroid of the nucleus and the cell, and calculated the distance of both centroids along the A-P axis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10B</xref>). We also measured the centrosome position just before the separation of the duplicated centrosomes during the 10th and 11th cell division cycles in embryos expressing PH-GFP/EB3-mCherry, and normalized the centrosome position to the centroid of the cell (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10C</xref>). To measure the migration distance of duplicated centrosomes, we calculated for each centrosome the distance between the position just before migration started and that when migration ceased in embryos expressing PH-GFP/EB3-mCherry; both positions were normalized to the centroid of the cell (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10D</xref>). We also used embryos expressing PH-GFP/EB3-mCherry to measure the angle of the centrosome axis relative to the invagination axis; the line between the two duplicated centrosomes just after their separation during the 11th division cycle was used as the centrosome axis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref>). When there were multiple invaginations, we calculated the composition of these structures as a vector (see also <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref>). To quantify the cilium’s position in DAPI/acetylated tubulin-immunostained embryos, we traced the cell contours, calculated the centre of the cell, and then measured the distance between the cilium and the centre of the cell along the A–P axis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>). We also quantified cilia positions at 30 min before the 11th cytokinesis started with Arl13b-GFP labelled cilia in MO-injected embryos. In the laser ablation experiments, we measured the length of invagination in each frame from a single confocal plane for more than 10 min (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>). To calculate the average speed of regression after UV laser ablation, we divided the length of invagination by the total time and in the case of maximum speed, we measured the change of length between each time frame (one second).

Your article has been favorably evaluated by K VijayRaghavan as the Senior editor and three reviewers, one of whom, Yukiko M Yamashita (Reviewer #1), is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>In this report, Negishi et al. describe a novel cell invagination during the early development of ascidian embryo that captures the centrosomes to orient the spindle. They describe this novel structure that is formed during oriented divisions of ascidian embryos (11th cell cycle). Long range centrosome migrations are known to be a feature of many large invertebrate embryonic cells, most notably ascidian embryos, but the origins of the directed force that drive this migration have been a mystery for over 100 years. Wilson for example talks about this type of behavior in his famous book from the last century. The apparent &quot;action at a distance&quot; of some cortical cue on the centrosome has always struck me as a very interesting problem. Here the authors suggest a novel solution whereby the membrane forms deep invaginations that reach out and attach to the centrosome, after which they exert elastic forces to pull the centrosome to the appropriate direction.</p><p>The morphological observations in this paper are truly striking and have been carried out with great thoroughness. The authors use a wide range of techniques from simple membrane dyes, to GFP tagged membrane proteins, to serial block face SEM, all of which reveal a highly novel structure composed of nested membranes from two adjacent cells diving deep into the interior of a cell to contact its centrosome. This invagination is associated with microtubules, which are apparently required for its formation or at least maintenance. This is thus a very interesting structure that many cell biologists, especially those interested in cytoskeleton-membrane interactions, will find very interesting. The images are of extremely high quality and all of the observations are rigorously quantified.</p><p>The reviewers agreed that this is a very interesting story describing a novel cellular structure that likely plays a critical role in spindle orientation during early development of ascidian embryos. The major concern was the lack of direct proof of a causal role of this invagination in spindle orientation. However, there is tremendous circumstantial evidence that this structure may play a direct mechanical role in centrosome migration. Given the novelty of the discovery, we believe that this paper will spark further research into the possible role of elastic membrane tethers in moving centrosomes, not only in ascidians but other systems as well. Given the complete mystery surrounding the long-range action at a distance underlying centrosome migration in invertebrate embryos, the demonstration of at least a potential mechanism is extremely welcome to the field. We therefore support the publication of this paper in <italic>eLife</italic>. But the critical lack of direct evidence must be appropriately acknowledged in the text.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>Please go through the text to make it clear that the causal relationship (i.e. invagination orients spindle) is not proven. (Particularly because the laser ablation of invagination did not work in a way to provide insights).</p><p>The authors utilize disruption of planar cell polarity to test the idea of invagination being required for spindle orientation. Indeed, they observed that disruption of PCP causes invagination with randomized orientation, which nicely correlated with perturbed spindle orientation. But this does not necessarily prove that the invaginations play a causal role in moving the centrosomes, because it leaves open the possibility that there is some other down-stream process regulated by the planar cell polarity pathway that regulates centrosome movement independently of the invaginations. Thus, please make it clear that this is still correlational.</p><p>In addition, there have been a few suggestions that can potentially add mechanistic insights to the paper. However, after discussion, we felt that these are likely beyond the scope of the present manuscript. Therefore, the following suggestions are not required for acceptance of the manuscript. If the authors have such data already, they can be added. Or such possibilities may be discussed.</p><p>1) The actomyosin cortex appears to restrict the formation of those plasma membrane structures. It would be interesting to determine whether the cortex is weaker at the place where this structure forms, and how such potential anisotropy of the actomyosin cortex is established in the first place.</p><p>2) Microtubules appear to be required for the formation of those plasma membrane structures, but it remains unclear how microtubules generate the observed tensile forces. Presumably microtubule motors are involved, and it would thus be very interesting to identify any of such motors and their possible function in this process.</p><p>3) The orientation of the observed plasma membrane structure seems to determine the position of the primary cilium and the mitotic spindle, thus overriding other potential mechanisms, such as cell shape. It would be quite interesting to see whether e.g. cell division orientation is truly randomized in cases where the plasma membrane structure is cut, or whether other factors take over and bias division orientation.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.16550.029</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>Essential revisions:</italic></p><p><italic>Please go through the text to make it clear that the causal relationship (i.e. invagination orients spindle) is not proven.

In particular,at the beginning of the Discussion section, we clearly state “[…] we could not directly demonstrate that the membrane invagination is required for mitotic spindle orientation […]”. Please note that we did not change the title of the manuscript, “Physical association between a novel plasma-membrane structure and centrosome orients cell division”. However, we are open to change it if necessary.</p><p><italic>The authors utilize disruption of planar cell polarity to test the idea of invagination being required for spindle orientation.

Indeed, our Dsh-knockdown experiments cannot exclude the possibility that the PCP pathway regulates the centrosome dynamics and the directionality of invagination independently. In the last paragraph of the Discussion section, we now state “However, in this experiment, we cannot rule out the possibility that the PCP pathway affects centrosome behavior independently of this membrane structure”.</p><p><italic>In addition, there have been a few suggestions that can potentially add mechanistic insights to the paper.

Or such possibilities may be discussed.</italic> </p><p><italic>1) The actomyosin cortex appears to restrict the formation of those plasma membrane structures. It would be interesting to determine whether the cortex is weaker at the place where this structure forms, and how such potential anisotropy of the actomyosin cortex is established in the first place.</italic> </p><p>Yes, this is exactly what we are thinking. We observed that the number of invaginations was increased in Dsh-knockdown cells as well as in cytochalasin-treated cells, and it implies a possibility that the PCP pathway regulates anisotropy of the cortical actin. We now discuss this possibility in the last paragraph of the Discussion section:</p><p>“It will also be intriguing to investigate whether the PCP pathway regulates the asymmetric distribution of the actomyosin network and/or plus-end motors in ascidian epidermal cells.”</p><p>In the future, we plan to measure local differences and temporal changes of membrane stiffness using atomic force microscopy (AFM).</p><p><italic>2) Microtubules appear to be required for the formation of those plasma membrane structures, but it remains unclear how microtubules generate the observed tensile forces. Presumably microtubule motors are involved, and it would thus be very interesting to identify any of such motors and their possible function in this process.</italic> </p><p>We agree with this comment; the physical association between membrane structure and microtubule is likely to be mediated by a motor protein. Indeed, the formation of the similar membrane invaginations in <italic>C. elegans</italic> zygotes depends on dynein (Redemann et al. 2010), it is possible that this plus-end motor protein is also involved in the process in ascidian epidermal cells. We now discuss this possibility in the last paragraph of the Discussion section: “The microtubule-dependent invagination process targeting the centrosome implies the involvement of plus-end-directed motor. Indeed, the generation of membrane invaginations in <italic>C. elegans</italic> one-cell embryos involves cortical dynein motors (Redemann et al., 2010)”. We are currently investigating the potential involvement of dynein in the ascidian membrane invagination but we do not yet have any solid data on this subject.</p><p><italic>3) The orientation of the observed plasma membrane structure seems to determine the position of the primary cilium and the mitotic spindle, thus overriding other potential mechanisms, such as cell shape. It would be quite interesting to see whether e.g. cell division orientation is truly randomized in cases where the plasma membrane structure is cut, or whether other factors take over and bias division orientation.</italic> </p><p>As pointed out, during the 11th cell division, the ascidian epidermal cells divide along anterior-posterior axis overriding cell shape constraints and regardless of the direction of the 10th cell division axis. Our data support that this is likely to due to the polarized membrane invaginations controlling centrosome dynamics. Unfortunately, as described in the text, the immediate regeneration of membrane invagination after laser ablation did not allow us to test this possibility. Conversely, it would be very interesting if “experimentally-induced” membrane invaginations could affect the direction of cell division on other systems such as 10th cell cycle epidermal cells.</p></body></sub-article></article>
