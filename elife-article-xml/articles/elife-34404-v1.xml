Glycoproteins of the Dickkopf (Dkk) family are important modulators of Wnt signaling acting primarily as Wnt antagonists. Here we report that Dkk2 is required for neural crest specification functioning as a positive regulator of Wnt/β-catenin signaling. Dkk2 depletion in <italic>Xenopus</italic> embryos causes a loss of neural crest progenitors, a phenotype that is rescued by expression of Lrp6 or β-catenin. Dkk2 overexpression expands the neural crest territory in a pattern reminiscent of Wnt8, Lrp6 and β-catenin gain-of-function phenotypes. Mechanistically, we show that Dkk2 mediates its neural crest-inducing activity through Lrp6 and β-catenin, however unlike Wnt8, in a GSK3β independent manner. These findings suggest that Wnt8 and Dkk2 converge on β-catenin using distinct transduction pathways both independently required to activate Wnt/β-catenin signaling and induce neural crest cells.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>neural crest</kwd><kwd>Wnt</kwd><kwd>Dkk</kwd><kwd>Xenopus</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>Xenopus</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>DE025468</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Saint-Jeannet</surname><given-names>Jean-Pierre</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>DE014212</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Saint-Jeannet</surname><given-names>Jean-Pierre</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Dkk2, a member of the Dikkopf family of Wnt antagonists, acts as a positive regulator of Wnt signaling during neural crest formation.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The neural crest is a population of cells unique to the vertebrate embryo. They are induced at the neural plate border during gastrulation, and around the time of neural tube closure, leave the neuroepithelium to produce a diverse array of cell types, contributing to multiple tissues, including the heart, the peripheral nervous system, and the craniofacial skeleton.</p><p>Neural crest cells are generated through a sequence of events orchestrated by the modulation of several signaling pathways and the activation of a complex network of transcription factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Meulemans and Bronner-Fraser, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Simões-Costa and Bronner, 2015</xref>). A large body of evidence in several organisms indicates that attenuation of bone morphogenetic (BMP) signaling in conjunction with activation of Wnt/β-catenin signaling is critical to specify the neural crest (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Stuhlmiller and García-Castro, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bae and Saint-Jeannet, 2014</xref>). Canonical Wnt ligands bind to Frizzled (Fzd) receptors and low-density-lipoprotein-related protein (Lrp5/6) co-receptors, which signals through the cytosolic adaptor protein Disheveled leading to inhibition of glycogen synthase kinase 3 (GSK3) and subsequent stabilization of β-catenin. β-catenin then translocates to the nucleus and in association with Tcf/Lef transcription factors activates Wnt target genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Clevers and Nusse, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">MacDonald et al., 2009</xref>). Interfering with any components of Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway blocks neural crest formation in the embryo.</p><p>The Dickkopf (Dkk) family of secreted glycoproteins acts primarily as negative modulators of Wnt signaling, this is especially true for Dkk1 and Dkk4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Niehrs, 2006</xref>). Dkks interact with the Wnt co-receptors Lrp5/6, disrupting the binding of Lrp5/6 to the Wnt/Fzd ligand-receptor complex, thereby locally inhibiting Wnt regulated processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Niehrs, 2006</xref>). Dkk1 was first identified for its ability to inhibit Wnt signaling in <italic>Xenopus</italic> embryos and promote head formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Glinka et al., 1998</xref>). Dkk1 injected embryos formed enlarged heads, and injection of Dkk1 blocking antibodies resulted in microcephalic <italic>Xenopus</italic> embryos (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Carmona-Fontaine et al., 2007</xref>). Similarly, Dkk1 deficient mouse embryos lacked most head structures anterior of the otic vesicle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Mukhopadhyay et al., 2001</xref>). During neural crest formation, Dkk1 is expressed in the prechordal mesoderm and has been proposed as the inhibitory signal that prevents neural crest formation anteriorly by blocking Wnt/β-catenin signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Carmona-Fontaine et al., 2007</xref>). The role of Dkk2 is not as well defined. It has been proposed that Dkk2 can either activate or inhibit the pathway, depending on cellular context (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Wu et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Li et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Brott and Sokol, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Li et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Mukhopadhyay et al., 2006</xref>), however its role during neural crest development has not been studied.</p><p>Here we show that Dkk2 knockdown prevents neural crest formation in vivo and in neuralized animal cap explants injected with Wnt8. Furthermore, Dkk2 gain-of-function increases the neural crest progenitor pool, reminiscent of Wnt8, Lrp6 and β-catenin gain-of-function phenotypes. We demonstrate that Dkk2 mediates its neural crest-inducing activity by activation Wnt/β-catenin signaling in a GSK3β independent manner. We propose that during neural crest formation, Lrp6 mediates two independent signaling events triggered by Wnt8 and Dkk2 converging on β-catenin to specify the neural crest.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Dkk2 is required for neural crest formation</title><p>To evaluate Dkk2 function in the context of neural crest development we performed knockdown of Dkk2 using morpholino antisense oligonucleotides (MOs).

The specificity of the MO was confirmed by Western blot of embryos injected with <italic>Dkk2-Flag</italic> mRNA and increasing doses of MO (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1b</xref>). Unilateral injection of Dkk2MO in the animal region of 2 cell stage embryos resulted in a severe reduction of expression of two neural crest-specific genes <italic>snai2</italic> and <italic>sox10</italic> in a majority of injected embryos (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1c,d</xref>). Concomitant with the loss of these genes the neural plate expression of <italic>sox2</italic> appeared broader on the injected side (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1c,d</xref>). To confirm the specificity of Dkk2 knockdown phenotype, we used a second MO (Dkk2SMO) that specifically interferes with <italic>dkk2</italic> pre-mRNA splicing by targeting the intron 1-exon 2 junction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1e</xref>), resulting in the production of a longer transcript, due to intron 1 retention (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1f</xref>; see also <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>).

Similarly Dkk2 has been shown to regulate several developmental processes including eye, heart and palate development through its inhibitory function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Mukhopadhyay et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Gage et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Phillips et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Li et al., 2017</xref>). However, the situation for Dkk2 is somewhat more complex as its activity appears to be context dependent. For example, unlike Dkk1, Dkk2 does not promote the formation of enlarged heads when overexpressed in <italic>Xenopus</italic> embryo, it has in fact the opposite effect generating microcephalic and cyclopic embryos, similar to Wnt8 gain-of-function phenotype (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Wu et al., 2000</xref>). Dkk2 is also a poor inhibitor of Wnt-8-induced axis duplication as compared to Dkk1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Krupnik et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Wu et al., 2000</xref>). Furthermore when overexpressed with Fzd8 or Lrp5/6, Dkk2 can activate Wnt/β-catenin signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Wu et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Brott and Sokol, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Li et al., 2002</xref>), and in <italic>Xenopus</italic> this activity can be blocked by Dkk1 expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Mao and Niehrs, 2003</xref>). The molecular mechanism underlying these functional differences is not well understood. The Dkks are characterized by the presence of two conserved cysteine-rich domains, an N-terminal cysteine-rich domain, known as Dkk_N, and a C-terminal cysteine-rich domain, resembling a colipase fold (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Niehrs, 2006</xref>). Structure function analyses using chimeric constructs and the axis duplication assay as readout have revealed that the different activities of Dkk1 and Dkk2 rest on the unique properties of their respective Dkk_N domains, while the C-terminal cysteine-rich domain primarily promotes Lrp6 signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Brott and Sokol, 2002</xref>). Similarly in cultured cells, the C-terminal region of Dkk2 inhibited Wnt3a signaling, but activated a Wnt-responsive promoter upon LRP6 co-expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Li et al., 2002</xref>). Another study, has proposed a different mechanism by which the inhibitory activity of Dkk2 was primarily dependent on the presence of the Dkk receptor, kremen2, possibly by promoting internalization of the receptor complex, thereby preventing Lrp6 signaling. When kremen2 is absent, Dkk2 acts as an activator of the pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Mao and Niehrs, 2003</xref>).</p><p>Gain-of-function experiments indicate that Dkk2 is a potent inducer of neural crest genes in the embryos. Dkk2 requires Lrp6 and β-catenin to promote neural crest formation, suggesting that Dkk2 mediates its neural crest-inducing activity through activation of Wnt/β-catenin signaling. This activity is not a unique feature of <italic>Xenopus</italic> Dkk2, as Human and zebrafish Dkk2 were also capable of inducing neural crest genes in the embryo. Interestingly, Dkk2 was unable to induce neural crest formation in neuralized animal cap explants, indicating that Dkk2 in this context cannot substitute for Wnt8. This result suggests that signaling by Wnt8 and Dkk2 are likely to be concurrently required to activate the Wnt/β-catenin pathway during neural crest specification.</p><p>Dkk2-/- mutant mice are characterized by low bone density and osteopenia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Li et al., 2005</xref>). These animals have also a complete conversion of the corneal epithelium into stratified epithelium with epidermal characteristics. Analysis of a Wnt reporter (TOP-GAL) indicates that these mutants have increased Wnt/β-catenin signaling in the cornea (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Mukhopadhyay et al., 2006</xref>). Our loss-of-function experiments point to a role of Dkk2 as a positive regulator of Wnt/β-catenin signaling. Using two distinct MOs interfering with Dkk2 mRNA translation and splicing we found that Dkk2 was required for neural crest induction in vivo and in animal cap explants. In these explants activation of the Wnt responsive TOP-FLASH reporter was also dependent on Dkk2 activity. The ability of Lrp6 and β-catenin to rescue Dkk2 knockdown phenotype, together with the fact that the GSK3 inhibitor (BIO) failed to restore neural crest gene expression in these embryos, strongly suggest that Dkk2 mediates its activity through Lrp6 and β-catenin, and point to a GSK3β independent function of Dkk2 during neural crest formation. These results are consistent with another study suggesting a DVL and GSK3β independent pathway in the activation of Wnt signaling by Dkk2 and Lrp6 in transfected cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Li et al., 2002</xref>).</p><p>It is likely that this activity of Dkk2 as a positive regulator of Wnt/β-catenin signaling will apply to other biological contexts. For example Dkk1 and Dkk2 have been shown to have opposite functions in regulating angiogenesis, however it is still unclear whether Dkk2 mediates its activity through the Wnt pathway in this context. Interestingly, we were able to extend our observations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>) to another Wnt regulated process, axis duplication by Wnt8; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Sokol et al., 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Smith and Harland, 1991</xref>), demonstrating that Wnt8’s ability to induce secondary axis was directly dependent on Dkk2 function (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9s1">Figure 9—figure supplement 1</xref>). Further studies are needed to identify the downstream effectors of the alternate pathway activated by the Lrp6/Dkk2 complex to understand the precise mechanism of Dkk2-mediated activation of Wnt signaling, and define the underlying mechanisms that contribute to its context dependent activity.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Plasmids and morpholinos</title><p>Expression constructs for <italic>Xenopus</italic>, zebrafish and human Dkk2 were generous gifts of Dr. Christof Niehrs (University of Mainz, Mainz, Germany), Dr. Tatiana Piotrowski (Stowers Institute, MO, USA) and Dr. Sergei Sokol (Mount Sinai, NY, USA), respectively.

Pools of 10 embryos were homogenized in lysis buffer (0.5% Triton X-100, 10 mM Tris–HCI at pH 7.5, 50 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA), containing Halt<sup>TM</sup> Protease Inhibitor Cocktail (ThermoFisher Scientific; Waltham, MA). After two consecutive centrifugations to eliminate lipids, the lysate was concentrated on an Amicon Ultra Centrifugal Filter (Merck Millipore; Billerica, MA), 5 μl of the concentrated lysate was resolved on a 10% NuPAGE Bis-Tris gel and transferred onto a PVDF membrane using the iBlot system (Invitrogen). Blots were subsequently incubated overnight with one of the following primary antibodies: monoclonal anti-Flag M2 antibody (Sigma Aldrich, F3165; 1:1000 dilution) and anti α-tubulin antibody (Sigma Aldrich, T9026; 1:500 dilution). The blots were then washed and incubated with anti-mouse IgG coupled to horseradish peroxidase (Santa Cruz Biotechnology; 1:10,000 dilution). Peroxidase activity was detected with the Western Blotting Luminol Reagent (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and imaged on a ChemiDoc MP Biorad gel documentation system (Hercules, CA).

Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by Marianne Bronner as the Senior and Reviewing Editor.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>This is an interesting paper that addresses the role of Dkk2 in neural crest formation, showing that it is required for the expression of both Snai2 and Sox10. Loss of Dkk2 can be rescued by β-catenin and Lrp6, as well as Wnt8. Over-expression of Dkk2 leads to an expansion of Snai2. While a GSK3β inhibitor expands Snai2 expression anteriorly, the prospective neural crest territory remains sensitive to Dkk2 MO, suggesting it functions in a GSK3β independent manner.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) It is critical to provide better expression profile of Dkk2 and it is suggested to move the images to main figures. The published expression pattern for Dkk2 does not show expression in the neural fold or neural crest. Furthermore the RNA seq data available on Xenbase shows a very low expression of Dkk2 during neural crest induction. It is even more striking when the expression data is compared to the Wnt partner namely Wnt8 and Lrp6. It is only in the Discussion that the authors refer to expression data presented in the supplemental material.</p><p>2) The expression data suggest that Dkk2 is an extremely potent activator of the pathway that despite its minute expression it is essential for proper Wnt signaling. This is not entirely consistent with the fact that loss of Dkk2 can be rescued by overexpression of Wnt8, Lrp6 or β-catenin since all of these mRNA are expressed at 10 to 100 folds excess when compared to Dkk2. Does the Dkk2 protein possess some particular property such as extreme stability or extreme binding affinity to the co-receptors? Following a tagged Dkk2 protein in the embryo (by blot and IF) could provide some clues. Dose response in the embryo or animal cap could be used to determine the effectiveness of Dkk2 compare to Dkk1. What is the minimal dose at which Dkk2 expression can expend the neural crest?</p><p>3) While the results strongly suggest that Dkk2 potentiates WNT signaling towards neural crest formation, the mechanism of action is unresolved. The authors should assess whether Dkk2 triggers expression of known direct targets of WNT/β-cat pathway, or non-canonical WNT pathways. They should also test mesoderm markers to rule out possible secondary effects.</p><p>4) The authors should test a broader repertoire of neural crest markers (in addition to Sox10 and Snai2). In addition, analysis of early stages (st. 13) is required to test effects on early NC specification markers.</p><p>5) In the absence of lineage tracing, the loss of <italic>snai2</italic> and <italic>sox10</italic> expression is not conclusive evidence for loss of neural crest cells. The authors should examine non-neural ectoderm markers. They should also let embryos grow to later stages, as loss of neural crest should result in complete unilateral absence of craniofacial cartilage and cranial peripheral nervous system. If so, is this rescued by β-catenin and Lrp6 injections in Dkk2-depleted embryos?</p><p>6) While the loss of function phenotype is compelling, the in vitro translation does not allow one to test the effective amount to inject in an embryo. Blocking the translation of a tagged Dkk2 mRNA would help define that dose. In addition, rescuing Dkk2 MO with an insensitive mRNA would confirm the specificity of the phenotype. The splice morpholino need to be more carefully quantified. Using realtime qPCR what is the percentage of properly spliced mRNA with various doses of the MO?</p><p>Other suggested revisions:</p><p>1) The authors should references previous studies that provide molecular insights into how Dkk2 activates Wnt/β-cat. For example, Li et al. (2002) suggested that it is the C2 domain of Dkk2 that is critical in its WNT activating functions, and further provide evidence suggesting that Dkk2 WNT inductive role operates through DVL and GSK3 independent mechanisms. Mao and Niehrs (2003) suggested that Krm2 is responsible for the WNT-antagonistic effect of Dkk2, and that in its absence, Dkk2 operates as a WNT activator.</p><p>2) It would be nice to examine biochemical interactions between Dkk2 function with Lrp5/6, Ror, Krm, during neural crest development.</p><p>3) The authors present a model where Dkk2 and Wnt8 appear to function in parallel pathways that converge on β-catenin. What's not clear is why eliminating Dkk2 prevents Wnt8 from its normal activation of β-catenin and neural crest cell formation and also why vice versa, Dkk2 can't activate β-catenin and specify neural crest cells in the absence of Wnt8. Do Dkk2 and Wnt8 somehow impact each other's function?</p><p>4) Better quantification would be appropriate.</p><p>5) On BIO experiments, it is puzzling that the Dkk1+BIO does not display expected anterior expansion of Snai2 on the control side, unlike the Dkk2+Bio…?</p><p>6) This statement in the Discussion is debatable:</p><p>&quot;While overexpression studies have previously shown that Dkk2 can function as an activator of Wnt/β-catenin signaling when co-expressed with Fzd8 or Lrp6 (Wu et al., 2000; Brott and Sokol, 2002; Li et al., 2002), this is the first study that provides evidence for its positive role in a Wnt/β-catenin regulated developmental process.&quot;</p><p>7) It should be noted that the expanded domain of Sox2 does not correlate with neural crest cell generation.

Dkk2 is broadly expressed during embryogenesis and is not distinctly enriched in the neural crest territory. It is likely that the regionalized expression of other components of the pathway, such as Fzd receptors and Wnt ligands, which are expressed at higher levels, provides the spatiotemporal cues to achieve a localized response.

As suggested we have performed Western blot analyses to evaluate the accumulation overtime of a Flag-tagged version of HuDkk2 (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig1">Author response image 1</xref>, red arrow). Protein detection was only possible after injection of 5 ng of plasmid DNA at the 4-cell stage consistent with a previous study (Brott and Sokol, 2002). We observed that Dkk2 starts to accumulate at the gastrula stage (stages 10/12) to reach a maximum at neural stage (stages 14/18), and then progressively decreases (stage 20). A similar pattern was observed for a Flag-tagged version of HuDkk1 (not shown). Upon overexpression in the embryo, Dkk2 protein does not appear to have an unusual stability and/or degradation profile. For comparison the minimal dose at which Dkk2 can expand the neural crest in the embryo is 25 pg of plasmid DNA.</p><fig id="respfig1"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.34404.022</object-id><label>Author response image 1.</label><caption/><graphic mime-subtype="jpeg" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-34404-resp-fig1-v1"/></fig><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) While the results strongly suggest that Dkk2 potentiates WNT signaling towards neural crest formation, the mechanism of action is unresolved.

This result suggests that <italic>dkk2</italic> alone is a poor activator of Wnt/β-catenin signaling, consistent with the view that it is acting in concert with a Wnt ligand to activate the pathway.

In addition, analysis of early stages (st. 13) is required to test effects on early NC specification markers.</p></disp-quote><p>We have performed additional experiments to increase the repertoire of neural crest genes analyzed, which now include <italic>pax3, sox8, snai1, twist1</italic> and <italic>sox9</italic> (see Figure 2 and Results subsection “Dkk2 is required for neural crest formation”, second paragraph). We found that early neural crest markers (neural border specifiers) such as <italic>pax3, sox8</italic> and <italic>snai1</italic> were only mildly affected – their expression levels were unchanged but their expression domain appeared to be shifted laterally – while other markers (neural crest specifiers) such as <italic>twist1</italic>, and <italic>sox9</italic> to a lesser extent, were downregulated, consistent with the phenotype observed for <italic>sox10</italic> and <italic>snai2</italic>.

Both gave a similar phenotype resulting in the inhibition of <italic>snai2</italic> and <italic>sox10</italic> expression, associated with an expansion of <italic>sox2</italic> expression domain. This phenotype was observed in both whole embryos and animal cap explants. We also used a control MO, which did not affect the expression of these genes. Importantly, this phenotype was efficiently rescued by expression of Lrp6 and β-catenin, two components of Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway. We believe that this combination of approaches makes a compelling case for a specific requirement of <italic>dkk2</italic> in neural crest formation. It is difficult to estimate the efficacy of a translation blocking MO without a good antibody, and we have not been able to identify one that could detect endogenous <italic>dkk2</italic> in <italic>Xenopus</italic>. As suggested, we have performed qRT-PCR to evaluate the proportion of spliced versus unspliced transcripts generated upon injection of increasing doses of MO.
