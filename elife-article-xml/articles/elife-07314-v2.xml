Multiple signaling pathways in the integrated stress response phosphorylate eIF2 serine-51, inhibiting nucleotide exchange by eIF2B. ISRIB, a potent drug-like small molecule, renders cells insensitive to eIF2α phosphorylation and enhances cognitive function in rodents by blocking long-term depression. ISRIB was identified in a phenotypic cell-based screen, and its mechanism of action remained unknown. We now report that ISRIB is an activator of eIF2B. Our reporter-based shRNA screen revealed an eIF2B requirement for ISRIB activity. Our results define ISRIB as a symmetric molecule, show ISRIB-mediated stabilization of activated eIF2B dimers, and suggest that eIF2B4 (δ-subunit) contributes to the ISRIB binding site. We also developed new ISRIB analogs, improving its EC<sub>50</sub> to 600 pM in cell culture. By modulating eIF2B function, ISRIB promises to be an invaluable tool in proof-of-principle studies aiming to ameliorate cognitive defects resulting from neurodegenerative diseases.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.07314.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.07314.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.07314.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Proteins are often described as life's ‘workhorse’ molecules, and cells must be able to build new proteins to stay alive. This ability is also vital for storing new memories. A protein called eIF2 carries out a critical step in the process that cells use to make proteins; and a decrease in the activity of eIF2 has been linked with memory loss in diseases such as Parkinson's and Alzheimer's disease.</p><p>When a cell experiences stressful conditions—such as virus infection or starvation—it triggers the ‘integrated stress response’. This response helps the cell conserve its resources and take corrective steps to restore its normal working conditions. As part of the integrated stress response, an enzyme adds a phosphate group onto eIF2. The ‘phosphorylated’ eIF2 blocks protein production, which causes the cell to make fewer proteins. In 2013, researchers revealed that a small drug-like molecule, called ISRIB, could prevent this decline in protein production following eIF2 phosphorylation; and when ISRIB was administered to mice and rats, it enhanced their long-term memories. However, this early work did not identify the molecule that is targeted by ISRIB.</p><p>Now Sidrauski, Tsai et al.—including many of researchers involved in the 2013 work—have used a combination of techniques including genetics, chemistry and biochemistry to reveal the target of ISRIB. The experiments show that ISRIB's molecular target is a protein complex called eIF2B. Artificially reducing the production of eIF2B made cells resistant to the effects of ISRIB. The eIF2B protein normally works to activate eIF2; Sidrauski, Tsai et al. observed that ISRIB boosts the activity of eIF2B and renders it insensitive to blockage by phosphorylated eIF2. This in turn increases protein production in the cell.</p><p>But how does ISRIB activate eIF2B? It was known that two copies of eIF2B can bind to each other; and Sidrauski, Tsai et al. found that ISRIB acts by stabilizing these larger protein complexes that are more active and less sensitive to inhibition by phosphorylated eIF2. Finally, in further experiments, new versions of ISRIB were synthesized that are ten-times as active as the original molecule inside cells.</p><p>Importantly, the discovery that eIF2B is the molecular target for ISRIB has recently been independently validated by other researchers, and it looks promising that this discovery will guide future efforts to develop clinically useful drugs to treat memory disorders.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.07314.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.07314.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author keywords</title><kwd>eIF2B</kwd><kwd>eIF2</kwd><kwd>integrated stress response</kwd><kwd>ISRIB</kwd><kwd>unfolded protein response</kwd><kwd>protein synthesis</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000011</institution-id><institution>Howard Hughes Medical Institute (HHMI)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Sidrauski</surname><given-names>Carmela</given-names></name><name><surname>Tsai</surname><given-names>Jordan C</given-names></name><name><surname>Kampmann</surname><given-names>Martin</given-names></name><name><surname>Mendez</surname><given-names>Aaron S</given-names></name><name><surname>Weissman</surname><given-names>Jonathan S</given-names></name><name><surname>Walter</surname><given-names>Peter</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funder had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.3</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>A drug-like molecule called ISRIB, which activates the translation initiation factor eIF2B, antagonizes stress responses as diverse as protein misfolding and nutrient deprivation, and restores protein synthesis, enhancing memory.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>In the integrated stress response (ISR), phosphorylation of the α-subunit of the eukaryotic translation initiation factor eIF2 (eIF2α-P) at serine-51 acts as a major regulatory step that controls the rate of translation initiation. Four distinct eIF2α kinases can catalyze phosphorylation at this single residue, each acting in response to different cellular stress conditions: PERK senses accumulation of unfolded polypeptides in the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), GCN2 responds to amino acid starvation and UV-light, PKR responds to viral infection, and HRI responds to heme deficiency. Their convergence on the same molecular event leads to a reduction in overall protein synthesis. Concomitant with a decrease in new protein synthesis, preferential translation of a small subset of mRNAs that contain small upstream open reading frames (uORFs) in their 5′ untranslated region is induced (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Harding et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Wek et al., 2006</xref>). ISR-translational targets include the well-known mammalian ATF4 (Activating Transcription Factor 4) and CHOP (a pro-apoptotic transcription factor) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Harding et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Vattem and Wek, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Palam et al., 2011</xref>). ATF4 regulates genes involved in metabolism and nutrient uptake and was shown to have a cytoprotective role upon stress in many cellular contexts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Ye et al., 2010</xref>). ATF4 is also a negative regulator of ‘memory genes’ and its preferential translation in neurites can transmit a neurodegenerative signal in neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Chen et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Baleriola et al., 2014</xref>). ISR activation leads to preferential translation of key regulatory molecules and thus its level and duration of induction must be tightly regulated. Cells ensure that the effects of eIF2α-P are transient by also activating a negative feedback loop. This is accomplished by GADD34 induction, which encodes the regulatory subunit of the eIF2α phosphatase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Lee et al., 2009</xref>). GADD34 induction leads to a reduction of eIF2α-P, allowing cells to restore translation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Novoa et al., 2001</xref>).</p><p>eIF2 is a trimeric complex (comprised of α, β and γ subunits) that binds to both GTP and the initiator methionyl tRNA (Met-tRNA<sub>i</sub>) to form a ternary complex (eIF2•GTP•Met-tRNA<sub>i</sub>). After engaging the 40S ribosomal subunit at an AUG start codon recognized by Met-tRNA<sub>i</sub>, GTP is hydrolyzed by the GTPase activating protein (GAP) eIF5, and the 60S ribosomal subunit joins to form a complete 80S ribosome ready for polypeptide elongation. eIF2•GDP is released, and eIF2 must then be reloaded with GTP to enter another round of ternary complex formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Hinnebusch and Lorsch, 2012</xref>). In addition to being a GAP for eIF2, eIF5 is also a GDP dissociation inhibitor that prevents GDP release from eIF2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Jennings and Pavitt, 2015</xref>). The exchange of GDP with GTP in eIF2 is catalyzed by its dedicated guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) eIF2B, which has the dual function of catalyzing the release of both eIF5 and GDP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Jennings et al., 2013</xref>). eIF2B is a complex molecular machine, composed of five different subunits, eIF2B1 through eIF2B5, also called the α, β, γ, δ, and ε subunits. eIF2B5 catalyzes the GDP/GTP exchange reaction and, together with a partially homologous subunit eIF2B3, constitutes the ‘catalytic core’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Williams et al., 2001</xref>). The three remaining subunits (eIF2B1, eIF2B2, and eIF2B4) are also highly homologous to one another and form a ‘regulatory sub-complex’ that provides binding sites for eIF2B's substrate eIF2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Dev et al., 2010</xref>). When phosphorylated on Ser-51, eIF2α-P dissociates more slowly from the eIF2B regulatory sub-complex and locks eIF2B into an inactive state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Krishnamoorthy et al., 2001</xref>). Phosphorylation thus renders eIF2 an inhibitor of its own GEF. Because eIF2 is more abundant than eIF2B, a small amount of eIF2α-P is sufficient to sequester a large proportion of available eIF2B, leading to a substantial reduction in overall protein synthesis.</p><p>Using a cell-based high-throughput screen, we recently identified a small molecule, ISRIB (for <underline>i</underline>ntegrated <underline>s</underline>tress <underline>r</underline>esponse <underline>i</underline>nhi<underline>b</underline>itor) that renders cells resistant to the inhibitory effects of eIF2α-P. ISRIB, the only <italic>bona fide</italic> ISR inhibitor identified to date, is a highly potent compound (EC<sub>50</sub> = 5 nM in cells) and has good pharmacokinetic properties (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Sidrauski et al., 2013</xref>). In agreement with the phenotype of genetically modified mice having reduced eIF2α-P, we showed that treatment with ISRIB enhances memory consolidation in rodents. Moreover, ISRIB comprehensively and selectively blocked the effects of eIF2α phosphorylation on mRNA translation and triggered rapid stress granule disassembly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Sidrauski et al., 2015</xref>). To date, the molecular target of ISRIB is not known. The fast kinetics of action of ISRIB and the remarkable specificity of its effects in response to eIF2α phosphorylation strongly suggested that its target is a factor that closely interacts with the eIF2 translation initiation complex. The existence of eIF2B mutations in yeast that, like ISRIB, render cells resistant to eIF2α-P led us to propose that eIF2B was a likely target of this small molecule (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Sidrauski et al., 2013</xref>). Here, we draw on clues from two independent approaches, an unbiased genetic screen and structure/activity analyses of ISRIB, to converge on the hypothesis that the mammalian eIF2B complex indeed is the molecular target of ISRIB. We demonstrate that a symmetric ISRIB molecule induces or stabilizes eIF2B dimerization, increasing its GEF activity and desensitizing it to inhibition by eIF2-P. Thus ISRIB directly modulates the central regulator in the ISR.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Knockdown of eIF2B renders cells resistant to ISRIB</title><p>To identify the molecular target of ISRIB, we conducted a genetic screen for genes whose knockdown modulated the sensitivity of cells to the drug. Using this strategy, we were previously able to pinpoint the molecular targets of cytotoxic compounds and to delineate their mechanism of action (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Matheny et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Julien et al., 2014</xref>). Here, we conducted a reporter-based screen using a sub-library of our next-generation shRNA library targeting 2933 genes involved in aspects of proteostasis. This focused library targets each protein-coding gene with ∼25 independent shRNAs and contains a large set (&gt;1000) of negative-control shRNAs. We have previously shown that the use of such libraries and analysis using a rigorous statistical framework generates robust results from forward genetic screens (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bassik et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Kampmann et al., 2013</xref>). We screened the shRNA library in a K562 cell line expressing an uORF-ATF4-venus reporter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>), similar to the translational reporters that we and others previously used to measure activation of the ISR. In cells bearing this reporter, the venus fluorescent protein is translationally induced upon eIF2α phosphorylation. We chose the K562 cell line for the screen because these cells are non-adherent and allow for efficient fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS). Treatment with thapsigargin (Tg), an ER stress inducer that inhibits the ER-localized Ca<sup>2+</sup>-ATPase, resulted in a sixfold increase in mean fluorescence intensity and, as expected, ISRIB substantially reduced induction of the reporter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). As a first step in the screen, we transduced the reporter cell line with the library and selected shRNA-expressing cells. We next divided the population and induced ER stress with Tg in the presence or absence of ISRIB. To optimize the dynamic range of the screen and to focus on early translational effects elicited by eIF2α phosphorylation, we incubated cells for 7 hr, at which time full induction of the reporter was reached. To identify genes whose knockdown resulted in either enhanced or reduced sensitivity to ISRIB, we used a concentration of drug corresponding to the EC<sub>50</sub> (15 nM) in this cell type. Cells from each subpopulation (Tg-treated and Tg + ISRIB-treated) were then FACS-sorted to isolate the third of the population with the lowest reporter expression and the third of the population with the highest reporter expression (see schematic in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). To quantify frequencies of cells expressing each shRNA, we isolated genomic DNA from the sorted populations and then PCR-amplified, purified and analyzed by deep-sequencing the shRNA-encoding cassettes. To determine the enrichment or depletion of each shRNA, we compared its frequency in the Low and High reporter populations. For each gene, we calculated a p value by comparing the distribution of log<sub>2</sub> enrichment for the 25 shRNAs targeting the gene to the negative control shRNAs. We then plotted p values for each gene determined in ER stress-induced cells in the absence (x-axis) vs the presence (y-axis) of ISRIB (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>).<fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.07314.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Knockdown of eIF2B subunits renders cells more resistant to ISRIB.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Schematic representation of the ATF4-venus reporter used for the screen.

The population was then divided into two and either treated with Tg (ER stress) or Tg + ISRIB (ER stress + ISRIB) for 7 hr. Cells were sorted based on their fluorescence (venus) intensity into three bins and the third of the population with the Low and High-reporter levels were collected. Note that the ER stress + ISRIB population had a lower overall fluorescence intensity (median) as ISRIB partially blocks induction of the reporter when added at a concentration corresponding to its EC<sub>50</sub> in these cells (15 nM). DNA was extracted from the sorted subpopulations for each treatment and shRNA-encoding cassettes were PCR-amplified and subjected to deep sequencing to determine their frequency.

By contrast, knockdown of genes that changed the expression of the reporter to the same degree in both treatments localized to the diagonal. We focused our analysis on genes that when knocked-down in the presence of ISRIB, affected the expression of the reporter selectively. In this plot these genes are displaced along the y-axis and encode proteins whose reduced expression modulates the cells' sensitivity to ISRIB. Knockdown of genes that confer resistance to ISRIB lie above the diagonal, while knockdown of genes that confer hypersensitivity to ISRIB lie below it.</p><p>Of particular interest was the pronounced effect of the knockdown of (i) two subunits of eIF2B, eIF2B4 and eIF2B5, that significantly reduced the sensitivity (p &lt; 1.4·10<sup>−6</sup> and p &lt; 2.4·10<sup>−11</sup>, respectively) and (ii) eIF4G1 that significantly enhanced the sensitivity (p &lt; 3.4·10<sup>−10</sup>) of cells to ISRIB, each without affecting induction of the reporter (i.e., no displacement along the x-axis). Individual shRNAs targeting either eIF2B4 or eIF2B5 were enriched in the High reporter population of the ISRIB-treated sample and stood out from the negative control shRNA population (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). Knockdown of other translation initiation factors (highlighted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>) revealed no effects on ISRIB sensitivity (locating close to the diagonal of the plot). Based on these data and the fact that eIF2α-P is a direct inhibitor of eIF2B, we postulated that eIF2B is a promising candidate target of ISRIB. Moreover, the data suggest that ISRIB acts as an activator of eIF2B: when eIF2B levels are reduced, cells become resistant to the effects of ISRIB when there is a lower supply of molecules that can be activated.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Structure-activity relationship of ISRIB suggests a twofold symmetric target</title><p>Structure-activity studies of synthetic ISRIB analogs provided further clues as to the nature of its molecular target in cells. Of particular note is that the progenitor member of this class (ISRIB, also denoted herein as ISRIB-A1, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>) exhibits twofold rotational symmetry and is bisected longitudinally by a mirror plane. The molecule is thus achiral but can exist as either <italic>cis</italic> or <italic>trans</italic> diastereomers, depending on the relative orientation of the side chains at positions 1 and 4 of the cyclohexane ring (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>, ISRIB-A1 and ISRIB-A2). We previously showed in cell-based assays that the <italic>trans</italic>-isomer (ISRIB-A1, EC<sub>50</sub> = 5 nM) is &gt; 100-fold more potent than the <italic>cis</italic>-isomer (ISRIB-A2, EC<sub>50</sub> &gt; 600 nM). This indicated a preference for an extended binding conformation, with both side chains adopting an equatorial position, as would be expected in the preferred chair conformation of the <italic>trans</italic> diastereomer (ISRIB-A1) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Sidrauski et al., 2013</xref>). By contrast, the <italic>cis</italic> diastereomer ISRIB-A2 would need to adopt a higher-energy boat-like conformation to project both side chains in pseudo-equatorial orientations. Further structure-activity studies revealed that a 1,4-phenyl spacer could reasonably substitute for 1,4-cyclohexyl, although a 10-fold loss in potency was observed (ISRIB-A7, EC<sub>50</sub> = 53 nM). Replacement of the 1,4-cyclohexyl ring with <italic>cis</italic> or <italic>trans</italic>-1,3-cyclobutyl spacers resulted in a more dramatic loss of potency (ISRIB-A4, EC<sub>50</sub> = 142 nM; ISRIB-A5, EC<sub>50</sub> = 1000 nM), indicating that the distance between the distal aromatic rings in ISRIB analogs is as important as their positioning in space. This distance dependence was also observed in analogs with acyclic spacers (e.g., ISRIB-A3 and ISRIB-A6). Thus, the <italic>n</italic>-butyl linker in ISRIB-A3 (maintaining the spacing of ISRIB-A1) was better tolerated than the shorter <italic>n</italic>-propyl linker in ISRIB-A6, an analog without measurable activity. The 60-fold reduction in the potency of ISRIB-A3 as compared to ISRIB-A1 can be explained by the increased flexibility of the <italic>n</italic>-butyl chain, resulting in a higher entropic cost associated with adopting the conformation required for binding.<fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.07314.006</object-id><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>SAR analyses suggest ISRIB interacts with a twofold symmetric target.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) ISRIB analogs bearing various likers (L) between the pendant side chains and their corresponding EC<sub>50</sub> values.

Overall, we found that the SAR was consistent with the idea that ISRIB analogs bind across a symmetrical interface. Thus, sequential modification of one and then both side chains in ISRIB analogs was additive, both for favorable modifications and for unfavorable modifications. For example, a <italic>para</italic>-chloro substituent was found to be optimal in ISRIB analogs. Replacing one or both <italic>para</italic>-chloro substituents with fluoro, methyl, or cyano groups led to predictable deterioration of potencies, with the doubly modified analogs least potent in every case (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>, compare ISRIB-A8 with A9, ISRIB-A10 with A11 and ISRIB-A12 with A13). Conversely, the addition of a <italic>meta</italic>-chloro or <italic>meta</italic>-fluoro substituent enhanced the potency of ISRIB analogs, and introducing such modifications on both side chains produced the most potent analogs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>, compare ISRIB-A14 with A15, ISRIB-A16 with A17). Among these more potent analogs is ISRIB-A17, which is nearly 10-fold more potent than ISRIB-A1, lowering the EC<sub>50</sub> into the picomolar range. A full account of our SAR studies will be provided elsewhere but the data presented here demonstrate that the electronics of the phenoxy substituents are important drivers of potency and support the notion that the two halves of ISRIB analogs are engaged in similar recognition events with the target. The most plausible explanation of these findings is that the functional twofold symmetry of ISRIB reflect a target that is likewise twofold symmetric. Taken together, the results obtained by the shRNA screen described above and the recent discovery of eIF2B dimers suggest that ISRIB may act by directly binding to eIF2B at a twofold symmetric interface that stabilizes it as a dimer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Gordiyenko et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Wortham et al., 2014</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>ISRIB promotes dimerization of eIF2B in cells</title><p>To test directly whether ISRIB induces or stabilizes the dimeric form of eIF2B, we treated cells with or without ISRIB. We prepared extracts in a high-salt buffer to dissociate eIF2B from its substrate eIF2 and analyzed the lysates by velocity sedimentation on sucrose gradients. In the absence of ISRIB, eIF2B (as detected by immunoblotting with antibodies against eIF2B4 and eIF2B5) migrated predominantly in fractions 3–6 in the gradient, consistent a combined molecular mass of four of its subunits (225 kDa). In the high-salt buffer used, the eIF2B complex lacked the eIF2B1 subunit, which was found predominantly in fractions 1–3 of the gradient. By contrast, when cells were treated with ISRIB, we observed a substantial shift in sedimentation towards a higher molecular mass (predominantly found in fractions 5–8), demonstrating a substantial increase in complex size. By comparing the relative mobility of eIF2B4 and eIF2B5 to that of a background band (marked with a red asterisk in the upper panel of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>), the shift in size of eIF2B is easily appreciated. The magnitude of the shift is consistent with a doubling in the molecular mass of the complex. Interestingly, in extracts from ISRIB-treated cells, eIF2B1 also shifted to the heavier fractions, suggesting that its association with the rest of the complex was stabilized. In contrast to the eIF2B subunits, we did not observe a shift in eIF3a or eIF2α. These data strongly support the notion that ISRIB induces the formation of a stable eIF2B dimer.<fig-group><fig id="fig3" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.07314.008</object-id><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>ISRIB induces dimerization of eIF2B in cells.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) HEK293T cells were treated with or without 200 nM ISRIB and clarified lysates were loaded on a 5–20% sucrose gradient and subjected to centrifugation. 13 equal-size fractions were collected, protein was precipitated and run on a SDS-PAGE gel and immunoblotted with the indicated antibodies.

To this end, we treated cells with ISRIB or with an inactive analog (‘ISRIB<sup>inact</sup>’ [ISRIB-A18], <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>) and subjected extracts to fractionation on sucrose gradients. We used ISRIB<sup>inact</sup> to control for non-specific hydrophobic interactions of ISRIB with proteins in the extract. We determined the complete protein composition in the fractions in which eIF2B peaked in the presence of ISRIB (fractions 6–9, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>) by mass spectrometry. This analysis revealed a significant ISRIB-dependent enrichment of all five eIF2B subunits (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). Notably, eIF2B subunits in ISRIB samples exhibited a characteristic profile in which all subunits collectively peaked in fraction 7. By contrast eIF2B subunits in ISRIB<sup>inact</sup> samples were most abundant in fraction 6 and trailed further into the gradient. As expected, two other large protein complexes, the proteasome (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>; data shown for subunit PSMD1) and eIF3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>; data shown for subunit eIF3A), showed no displacement upon ISRIB treatment.</p><p>Because the mass spectrometric analysis of the gradient was performed with a non-targeted method, it allowed us to ask whether additional proteins would associate with eIF2B potentially contributing to the shift in size. To address this question, we correlated the intensity profiles of all other proteins identified through the analyzed fractions to the sedimentation profile exhibited by a representative subunit, eIF2B4. We plotted the correlation coefficient (R-value) for each comparison. We were excited to find that all eIF2B subunits (eIF2B1, eIF2B2, eIF2B3, eIF2B5) stood out as most strongly correlated to eIF2B4, all exhibiting correlation coefficients (R-values) &gt; 0.98 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>), strongly indicating that the increase in molecular mass of eIF2B upon ISRIB addition indeed resulted from eIF2B dimerization. Moreover, these analyses strongly support the notion that eIF2B forms a complete complex upon ISRIB treatment.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>ISRIB enhances the thermo-stability of eIF2B4</title><p>To identify the subunit of eIF2B targeted by ISRIB, we monitored drug-target engagement, utilizing a cellular extract thermal shift assay (CETSA) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Martinez Molina et al., 2013</xref>). This method relies on the principle that ligand binding can stabilize protein folding and hence increase the protein's resistance to heat denaturation. To this end, we incubated a cell lysate with and without ISRIB and then heated aliquots to different temperatures, followed by centrifugation to separate soluble from precipitated denatured proteins. We then analyzed the soluble fractions by Western blotting with antibodies against eIF2B1, eIF2B4 and eIF2B5. When the lysate was pre-incubated with ISRIB, we observed an increase in thermal stability of eIF2B4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>, lanes 4 and 5, arrows). Although slight, the increase was highly reproducible and, as was the case for the analysis of the eIF2B shift in the sucrose gradients shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>, a background band that cross-reacts with the anti-eIF2B4 antibody (red asterisk) provided a convenient internal control for the exclusive stabilization of eIF2B4.

This analysis suggests that eIF2B subunits act autonomously in this assay, as eIF2B4 was stabilized while other subunits denatured and precipitated.

To this end, we generated eIF2-P by incubating eIF2 with recombinantly expressed PERK kinase and ATP. We next loaded eIF2-P with [<sup>3</sup>H]-GDP and measured GDP release. As expected from the known inhibitory role of eIF2α phosphorylation on eIF2B, GDP release from eIF2-P remained virtually unchanged in the presence of eIF2B (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>, black solid line). We next asked whether ISRIB allows eIF2-P to be a substrate for eIF2B. Our data show that ISRIB did not stimulate GDP release from eIF2-P (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>, red solid line), indicating that this is not the case. We next explored whether ISRIB can overcome the inhibitory effects of eIF2-P on eIF2B. To this end, we tested if ISRIB can promote GDP release from unphosphorylated eIF2 in the presence eIF2-P by mixing [<sup>3</sup>H]-GDP-loaded eIF2 with eIF2-P in a 3:1 or 1:1 ratio. Although the exchange reaction was slower, ISRIB stimulated GDP release at the eIF2:eIF2-P ratio of 3:1 (-ISRIB: t<sub>1/2</sub> = 6.7 min, vs + ISRIB: t<sub>1/2</sub> = 2.7 min) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>), whereas we observed hardly any stimulation at the 1:1 ratio (-ISRIB: t<sub>1/2</sub> = 6.4 min, vs + ISRIB: t<sub>1/2</sub> = 5.3 min) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>). Thus, the relative ratio of substrate (eIF2) to inhibitor (eIF2-P) emerges as an important parameter affecting ISRIB's ability to modulate eIF2B activity. Taken together, these functional data underscore the notion that ISRIB acts as an activator of eIF2B and that ISRIB alleviates inhibition by eIF2-P, as long as eIF2-P is present below threshold levels.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>The ISR is controlled by phosphorylation of the general eukaryotic translation initiation factor eIF2. Multiple cell signaling pathways converge at a single phosphorylation site on its α-subunit where phosphorylation of Ser-51 modulates eIF2α's interaction with its dedicated, multi-subunit guanine nucleotide-exchange factor (GEF) eIF2B. We previously identified and characterized a potent small molecule ISR inhibitor (ISRIB) with good pharmacological properties and showed that it renders cells insensitive to eIF2α phosphorylation upon ISR induction and enhances cognitive function in rodents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Sidrauski et al., 2013</xref>). Within a few minutes after administration, ISRIB reverses the effects triggered by eIF2α phosphorylation dissolving RNA stress granules and restoring translation of inhibited mRNAs while reversing de-repression of uORF-containing mRNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Sidrauski et al., 2015</xref>). Because ISRIB was identified in a phenotypic cell-based screen, its mechanism of action remained obscure. Here, we report the identification of eIF2B as the molecular target of ISRIB. To this end, we used reporter-based shRNA screening, structure–function analyses of ISRIB analogs, biochemical characterization of eIF2B oligomerization and thermal stability, and enzymatic analyses of eIF2B's GEF activity. The results of our multipronged approach provide a rationale for why ISRIB analogs exhibit twofold symmetry, showed ISRIB-mediated stabilization and activation of eIF2B dimers, and suggested eIF2B4, also known as its δ-subunit, as a candidate to contain the ISRIB binding site. In the course of this work, we also developed more active ISRIB analogs, improving potency by almost 10-fold and lowering EC<sub>50</sub> values into the high picomolar range in cell culture.</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>How does ISRIB modulate eIF2B?</title><p>In this work, ISRIB emerged as an eIF2B activator. First, ISRIB promoted the formation of or stabilized eIF2B dimers (‘[eIF2B]<sub>2</sub>’) and enhanced GEF activity in biochemical assays. Second, knockdown of both eIF2B4 and eIF2B5 subunits rendered cells resistant to the action of ISRIB, presumably because under these conditions the total amount of eIF2B that can be activated in cells is reduced. Note that the three other subunits of eIF2B were not represented in our focused shRNA library and therefore could not have been identified in the screen. Functioning as an activator, ISRIB joins the still sparsely populated group of unnatural small molecule enzyme activators, while the vast majority of synthetic small molecules that modulate enzyme activity are inhibitors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Wiseman et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Zorn and Wells, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Wang et al., 2014</xref>). Conversely, knockdown of eIF4G1 sensitized cells to ISRIB. This can be explained because, under conditions of reduced eIF4G1, overall cap-dependent translation initiation is reduced. A lower concentration of ISRIB could then suffice to generate sufficient amounts of GTP-loaded eIF2 to maintain normal rates of translation, even in the presence of eIF2α-P. Intriguingly, knockdown of other components of the cap-binding complex, such as eIF4A1, or components of the eIF3 complex, such as eIF3f and eIF3b, not only reduced sensitivity to ISRIB but also affected induction of the reporter upon ER stress alone. In agreement with studies in yeast and plants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Szamecz et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Roy et al., 2010</xref>), knockdown of the eIF3 subunits in the library (eIF3a, eIF3b, and eIF3f) reduced translational induction of the reporter, presumably due to eIF3's stimulatory effects on re-initiation after translation of short uORFs. Our data therefore provide the first evidence that the mechanism of re-initiation may be similar in mammalian cells.</p><p>The differences observed between assorted initiation factors on reporter expression is likely to reflect the extent to which translation initiation was reduced under the different knockdown conditions. Importantly however, only knockdown of the eIF2B subunits targeted by shRNAs in the library conferred resistance to ISRIB.</p><p>We previously proposed two models that could explain how ISRIB renders cells resistant to the inhibitory effects of eIF2α-P (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Sidrauski et al., 2013</xref>). First, ISRIB could weaken the effect of eIF2α-P on eIF2B by interfering with its tight and non-productive binding. In this way, more eIF2B would be available to reload eIF2 with GTP. Second, ISRIB could enhance the basal activity of eIF2B so that the fraction not engaged with eIF2α-P would produce sufficient levels of ternary complex to sustain translation in cells. Currently, our in vitro enzymatic data do not allow us to distinguish between these models. While we showed that the rate of GDP release from purified eIF2 by eIF2B was significantly enhanced upon addition of ISRIB (and therefore can explain the effect of ISRIB in living cells), we do not know what fraction of our eIF2 preparation was isolated in a eIF2α(Ser-51)-phosphorylated state. ISRIB could thus either increase the GEF activity of eIF2B on eIF2 or diminish the inhibitory effect of a small amount eIF2-P present in the assay, akin to the regime that we directly tested by adding increasing amounts of in vitro phosphorylated eIF2 to the assay. Our analyses confirmed however that eIF2α-P is not a substrate for eIF2B (in agreement with previous reports [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Kimball et al., 1998</xref>]), and determined that ISRIB does not enable eIF2B to use eIF2-P as a substrate.</p><p>While catalyzing guanine nucleotide exchange on other GTPases can be effected by relatively simple enzymes, eIF2B is a complex molecular machine composed of five different subunits. Much remains uncertain about the structural arrangement of the subunits and how eIF2B's activity is regulated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Jennings and Pavitt, 2014</xref>). Similarly, how ISRIB exerts its effects on eIF2B remains unknown. eIF2B subunits are organized into two modules, called the catalytic (eIF2B3 and eIF2B5) and regulatory (eIF2B1, eIF2B2 and eIF2B4) sub-complexes, containing two and three homologous proteins, respectively. The subunits of the regulatory subcomplex are characterized by highly homologous Rossman folds that bind nucleotides and are adorned by N-terminal extensions of lesser homology between the subunits. Intriguingly, recombinantly expressed eIF2B1 purified and crystallized as a stable homodimer, with an extensive buried interface contributed by the nucleotide-binding domains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bogorad et al., 2014</xref>). The residues contributing to the interface are highly conserved among its homologs in the complex. Combined with the SAR analyses indicating ISRIB's obligate twofold symmetry, the discovery that (eIF2B)<sub>2</sub> exist in both yeast and mammalian cells was instrumental in suggesting to us that eIF2B is the target of ISRIB (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Gordiyenko et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Wortham et al., 2014</xref>). According to this model, ISRIB binds to two regulatory eIF2B subunits that form part of the interface linking two pentamers.</p><p>Native mass spectrometry of mammalian eIF2B revealed the existence of stable subcomplexes that lack the eIF2B1 subunit, indicating that this subunit is more loosely associated, as we confirmed here by sedimentation of the non-ISRIB treated control extracts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Wortham et al., 2014</xref>). We have shown by biochemical analysis that ISRIB binding stabilizes (eIF2B)<sub>2</sub>, rendering it resistant to dissociation of eIF2B1 in the high-salt buffers used in the sucrose gradient analysis. Importantly, we showed by mass spectrometric proteomic analysis that no other protein co-profiled with (eIF2B)<sub>2</sub> in the gradients, demonstrating that the observed ISRIB-dependent effects were confined exclusively to eIF2B subunits.</p><p>Given the relative stability of the eIF2B1 homodimer (K<sub>d</sub> &lt; 1 nM; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bogorad et al., 2014</xref>]) and our observation that ISRIB stabilized complete (eIF2B)<sub>2</sub>, it is likely that two opposing eIF2B1 subunits form an essential part of the interface that links two eIF2B pentamers. ISRIB could favor this interaction by adding to the affinity provided by a (eIF2B1)<sub>2</sub> tether via the stabilization of an additional interface formed between homologous regions of two eIF2B4 subunits. This view would be in agreement with our data that showed protection by ISRIB of eIF2B4 to thermal denaturation. For symmetry reasons, as elegantly discussed in (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bogorad et al., 2014</xref>), this arrangement would leave the interfaces of the two identical eIF2B2 subunits in the complex unpaired. Alternatively, ISRIB may stabilize interfaces between eIF2B4 in one eIF2B pentamer and eIF2B2 in an opposing pentamer. If this were the case, ISRIB would bind at a pseudo-symmetric interface formed by two different, yet strongly homologous components. We note in this scenario, two ISRIB molecules binding to two identical interfaces of opposite polarity (eIF2B2 → eIF2B4 and eIF2B4 → eIF2B2) may bind and stabilize one (eIF2B)<sub>2</sub>, which may contribute to its potency. This would open the possibility that design and synthesis of non-symmetric analogs could further improve ISRIB's efficacy. A definite assignment of ISRIB's binding site will have to await the structural determination of ISRIB-bound (eIF2B)<sub>2</sub> or genetic analyses in which loss-of-function mutations are suppressed by compensating changes in ISRIB analogs.</p><p>Consistent with the notion that the regulatory sub-complex provides binding sites for eIF2, mutations in eIF2B in yeast that render cells resistant to phosphorylation of eIF2α map to eIF2B1 and eIF2B4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Pavitt et al., 1997</xref>). Moreover, two different variants in mammalian eIF2B4 (generated by alternative splicing) contain different N-terminal extension domains and exclusive expression of the longer variant desensitizes cells to eIF2α phosphorylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Martin et al., 2010</xref>), phenocopying the effects elicited by ISRIB in mammalian cells. In the structure of (eIF2B1)<sub>2</sub> the N-terminal domains reach across the interface and interact with the nucleotide binding domain of the partnering eIF2B1 molecule. We speculate that the extended N-terminal domain of eIF2B4 may stabilize (eIF2B)<sub>2</sub>, mimicking the effects of ISRIB.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Importance of eIF2-mediated translational control in disease</title><p>Phosphorylation of eIF2 is important in long-term depression (LTD), and we have recently shown that this modulation of synaptic plasticity can explain cognitive enhancement elicited by ISRIB treatment of wild type rodents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Di Prisco et al., 2014</xref>). Engagement of metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluR) in post-synaptic hippocampal cells leads to eIF2 phosphorylation and preferential translation of neuronally expressed oligophrenin-1 (encoded by OPHN1), a protein that mediates the initial steps of downregulation of postsynaptic AMPA receptors by endocytosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Nadif Kasri et al., 2011</xref>). Like ATF4, the 5′-UTR of OPHN1 mRNA contains two uORFs that repress expression of the downstream coding sequence unless eIF2 is phosphorylated. Importantly, both genetic ablation of eIF2 phosphorylation and treatment with ISRIB but not the inactive analog ISRIB-A18 abolished the reduction in surface AMPARs and blocked mGluR-LTD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Di Prisco et al., 2014</xref>). These findings hold promise that targeting the effects of phosphorylation of eIF2 by pharmacologically modulating eIF2B with drugs such as ISRIB could result in therapies for cognitive disorders. Activation of the ISR with its characteristic increase in eIF2 phosphorylation has been reported in numerous neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, Frontotemporal Dementia, Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis, and prion neurodegenerative diseases, but its role in disease progression has just recently begun to be interrogated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Kim et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Leitman et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Ma et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Moreno et al., 2013</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">2012</xref>).</p><p>The importance of eIF2 and eIF2B in brain function is underscored by the existence of mutations in these factors that cause human disease.

When an analogous mutation was introduced into yeast cells, it impaired eIF2-mediated translation initiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Borck et al., 2012</xref>). Mutations in the different subunits of eIF2B cause childhood ataxia with central nervous system (CNS) hypomyelination (CACH) or vanishing white matter disease (VWMD). All affected individuals have two altered copies of a single eIF2B gene (autosomal recessive inheritance) and the majority are missense mutations that cause a single amino acid change while the remainder is a mixture of premature nonsense mutations, some causing a frame-shift and others altered splicing. All subunits of eIF2B are essential and the biochemical analysis of 40 different VWMD mutations revealed that the majority are hypomorphs, that is, cause partial loss-of function of eIF2B GEF activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Leegwater et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Li et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Fogli and Boespflug-Tanguy, 2006</xref>). Whether ISRIB can reverse the deleterious effects of mutations in eIF2B in VWMD patients is not known, but we speculate that it may protect from a further reduction in GEF activity by stress-induced eIF2α-P. Intriguingly, the onset of VWMD is varied but generally exacerbated by head trauma and febrile illnesses. Interestingly, two VWMD mutations have been characterized that affect the integrity and dimerization of the eIF2B complex. A mutation in eIF2B1(V183F) maps to the dimerization interface and the mutant recombinant protein is predominantly in the monomeric form and a mutation in eIF2B4(A391D) affects complex integrity in the absence of eIF2B1 and dimerization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Wortham et al., 2014</xref>). ISRIB induces dimerization and complex stability and thus may rescue the effects of such mutations.</p><p>Given the wide spectrum of potential applications for ISRIB in neurological diseases, the identification of its molecular target is an important step.

Your article has been favorably evaluated by Randy Schekman (Senior editor) and three reviewers, one of whom, Jeffery W Kelly, is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors.</p><p>The Reviewing editor and the other reviewers discussed their comments before we reached this decision, and the Reviewing editor has assembled the following comments to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>This study depicts an impressive addition to the small, but growing list, of well-defined small molecule Proteostasis regulators. Specifically, the manuscript addresses and answers an interesting question in the field-that is the mode of action of ISRIB, the only currently available small molecule to block eIF2∼P regulation of translational initiation. The text and experiments are generally clearly presented and support the conclusions drawn. The study has broad biomedical implications.</p><p>The first reviewer request is to better integrate the three parts in the manuscript.

Thus we are unable to comprehensively assess the impact of modulation of different pathways on translational control of the ISR. There are no other gene classes that stand out prominently enough to warrant an informed discussion that would enhance the manuscript. We noted that a few components of the oligosaccharyl transferase are included in the gene set that renders cells more resistant to ISRIB, but interpret this observation as resulting from an enhancement of generic ER stress that would elevate eIF2α-phosphorylation further, most likely beyond the threshold that ISRIB can reverse. Similarly, knockdown of HYOU1, encoding the ER chaperone Grp170, increased reporter activation. The data are included in the source files of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>. Given the successful biochemical validation ISRIB effects on eIF2B, we did not follow up on these and other genes that changed the cells’ sensitivity to ISRIB.</p><p><italic>Could any of the more potent compounds be assessed for their ability to inhibit translation initiation in cell culture?</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1"><italic>Figure 1B</italic></xref> <italic>and some later figures include error bars and statistical considerations</italic>.</p><p>We included error bars in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>.

We have not tested the effects of all newly synthesized analogs on bulk translation. ISRIB and other analogs (not described in this paper) that we did analyze, consistently demonstrated that translation upregulation of the uORFs-ATF4 reporter inversely correlates with downregulation of bulk mRNA translation. Both of these outputs depend directly on the ternary complex concentration in the cell; lower levels of ternary complex result in increased uORFs-ATF4-GFP expression and reduced bulk protein synthesis. As all analogs are based on the same scaffold, it is highly unlikely that changes in the molecule would uncouple the effects observed with the ISR-translation reporter from the inversely correlated effects on bulk protein synthesis.</p><p><italic>The x-axis scale of</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5"><italic>Figure 5A</italic></xref> <italic>differs from the other panels and to the casual reader can be confusing when comparing with</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5"><italic>Figure 5C</italic></xref>.</p><p>We modified the x-axis of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref> to match the other panels in the Figure.</p><p><italic>One would like to see the authors document the extent of eIF2B subunit knock-down and, importantly, the consequences of knockdown on translation of the ATF4 reporter and bulk translation initiation in the absence of ER stress and attendant elevated eIF2α phosphorylation, in the presence and absence of ISRIB</italic>.</p><p>We have not measured the degree of shRNA knockdown. Since the screen deployed a pool of 25 different shRNAs representing every gene, the degree of knockdown is different from one shRNA to another. This creates an allelic series of different knockdown efficiencies that are integrated in the analysis to compute statistical significance plotted as the P-value. This spread of knockdown efficiencies provides the basis of the screen design as it buffers from lethal effect of complete disruption of gene expression. As such, measurement of individual knockdown efficiencies would provide no further value in interpreting the screen results.</p><p><italic>It would be expected that reducing eIF2B levels would induce ATF4 translation in the absence of ER stress, by reducing levels of eIF2-GTP-tRNAi ternary complexes, and it seems likely that the drug would still reduce ATF4 translation by stimulating the GEF activity of the residual eIF2B</italic>—<italic>the authors' thoughts?</italic></p><p>We agree. This is consistent with our model. In the reviewer’s scenario there is no phosphorylated eIF2α.

The ratio of eIF2α-P:eIF2B was previously shown to be a critical parameter for ISR induction, explaining how a limited amount of eIF2α-P blocks translation disproportionately. Under reduced eIF2B levels, ISRIB cannot compensate for the inhibitory effects of this phosphorylation event (as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>).</p><p><italic>The authors’ screen is based on ATF4 reporter expression, not bulk translation, and low levels of eIF2-GTP-tRNAi ternary complexes induce ATF4 by shifting the probability of reinitiation from inhibitory uORF2 to the ATF4 start codon. Do the authors mean to suggest that with decreased overall translation on eIF4G1 knockdown the demand on ternary complexes is diminished, and that the resulting higher level of ternary complexes would oppose reinitiation at the ATF4 start codon; and that ISRIB would exacerbate this effect by increasing eIF2B activity and elevating ternary complex levels further? This passage needs to be clarified</italic>.</p><p>Yes, this is what we think. ISRIB exacerbates diminished initiation at the ATF4 start codon by increasing eIF2B activity and elevating ternary complex levels further. As reported in our 2013 <italic>eLife</italic> paper (Figure 3–figure supplement 4), ISRIB increased 43S loading on mRNAs as shown by the persistence of halfmers in the monosome and disome peaks in the polyribosome analysis of cells treated with ER-stressors and ISRIB. These data provide strong support to the notion that ISRIB restores ternary complex levels in ER stressed cells.</p></body></sub-article></article>
