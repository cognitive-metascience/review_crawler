In <italic>Drosophila</italic>, exposure to parasitoid wasps leads to a sharp decline in oviposition. We show that exposure to predator elicits both an acute and learned oviposition depression, mediated through the visual system. However, long-term persistence of oviposition depression after predator removal requires neuronal signaling functions, a functional mushroom body, and neurally driven apoptosis of oocytes through effector caspases. Strikingly, wasp-exposed flies (teachers) can transmit egg-retention behavior and trigger ovarian apoptosis in naive, unexposed flies (students). Acquisition and behavioral execution of this socially learned behavior by naive flies requires all of the factors needed for primary learning. The ability to teach does not require ovarian apoptosis. This work provides new insight into genetic and physiological mechanisms that underlie an ecologically relevant form of learning and mechanisms for its social transmission.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.07423.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.07423.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.07423.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Every animal must be able to adapt to threats and changes to their environment that could affect their survival. Some ‘social’ animals, such as honeybees and ants, go further than this, and also transmit information about a threat—and how to survive it—to other members of their species. This helpful behavior is now known to occur to some extent even in animals that have not been considered to be social, like the <italic>Drosophila</italic> species of fruit fly.</p><p>Parasitoid wasps lay their eggs in the larvae and pupae of certain insect species. When the wasp eggs hatch, they feed on the host insect, eventually killing it. <italic>Drosophila</italic> fruit flies have evolved various behaviors to protect their offspring from these wasps. For example, female fruit flies reduce the number of eggs they lay when they are in the presence of a wasp.</p><p>Kacsoh, Bozler et al. exposed female flies to wasps for a day. These flies produced fewer eggs than flies that were not exposed to wasps and continued to lay fewer eggs for 24 hours after the wasps were removed. Introducing these flies to ‘naive’ flies that had not encountered a wasp caused the naive flies to produce fewer eggs as well.</p><p>After ruling out several possible ways that the wasp-exposed flies might ‘teach’ the naive flies to produce and lay fewer eggs, Kacsoh, Bozler et al. found that naive flies cannot learn this behavior when they are blind. In addition, exposed flies cannot instruct other flies of the threat if their wings are absent or deformed. These and other findings, therefore, suggest that information about the wasp threat is transmitted through visual cues that involve the wings.</p><p>Kacsoh, Bozler et al. found that the flies must have certain brain circuits associated with memory and learning to be able to teach others and to reduce the numbers of eggs they lay after the wasp has been removed. This suggests that signals from this brain region must be continually sent out to alter the physiology of the developing eggs in order to maintain the lower rate of egg laying; understanding how flies use visual cues for communication and how the brain signals to the ovary remain key challenges for future work.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.07423.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.07423.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author keywords</title><kwd>social learning</kwd><kwd>learning</kwd><kwd>memory</kwd><kwd>apoptosis</kwd><kwd>parasitoid wasp</kwd><kwd>communication</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>D. melanogaster</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000057</institution-id><institution>National Institute of General Medical Sciences (NIGMS)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Bosco</surname><given-names>Giovanni</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001602</institution-id><institution>Science Foundation Ireland</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ramaswami</surname><given-names>Mani</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100008299</institution-id><institution>Dartmouth College</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Geisel School of Medicine at Dartmouth</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Bosco</surname><given-names>Giovanni</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.3</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Reproductive behavior is conferred from experienced to naïve <italic>Drosophila</italic> as a behavioral social strategy allowing naïve groups to anticipate a threat from a predator.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>All organisms must acquire and respond to information about their environment. Some changes in the environment are predictable or periodic, like light/dark or seasonal cycles that result in organismal adaptation manifesting as physiological changes in order to optimize survival and fitness in the context of a changing environment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Baldwin and Meldau, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cermakian et al., 2013</xref>). This ability to adapt to environmental change is essential for survival, but can such an adaptive response occur in the absence of the direct experience?</p><p>Well-defined examples of this phenomenon have been observed in what are considered ‘social’ organisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Franks et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Townsend et al., 2011</xref>). Yet, emerging studies are providing mounting evidence to suggest that the use of social cues extend far beyond the traditional notions of social animals: organisms once viewed as asocial in nature are now known to have advanced forms of social communication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Gariepy et al., 2014</xref>). This social transmission of information can result in distinct behavioral changes, based on another individual's set of experiences. The ability to learn from others influences the choices and behaviors of individuals and allows a group of individuals to share information about a changing environment. It is speculated that social information transmission involves either the ability to feel vicarious reward and punishment or other complex communication strategies to transmit an individual's experience to the community of conspecifics. The potential benefits of adaptive behavior, based on information acquired from others within the community, can give social learners a significant advantage over those that must directly explore and gather environmental information for themselves. Understanding how this information transfer occurs and what the underlying neurological and molecular mechanisms are is critical for a comprehensive view of adaptive behavior across a wide range of taxa.</p><p>Many species considered as ‘social’ and ‘non-social’ communicate about the environment. Plants have been observed to alter their physiology in response to signaling from another plant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Baldwin and Schultz, 1983</xref>). An example of such communication involves salt stress, which has been shown to trigger the release of volatile organic compounds that induce salt resistance in neighboring plants that have yet to experience any salt stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Lee and Seo, 2014</xref>). In animals, the process is speculated to be more complex: honeybees are able to fine tune signals directed at individuals within the hive that elicit highly specific behavioral changes in response to specific environmental cues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Wenner, 1962</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Schneider and Lewis, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Richard et al., 2012</xref>). Even <italic>Drosophila</italic> are prone to social cues, altering their decision making based on the behavior of conspecifics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Mery et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Sarin and Dukas, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Battesti et al., 2012</xref>). It is clear that the once thought ‘fine line’ between social and non-social organisms is beginning to blur, and that social communication is actually much more fundamental to life than originally considered.</p><p>In animals, this ability to transmit and process information about the environment has been termed ‘social learning’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Gariepy et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Gruter and Leadbeater, 2014</xref>). Learning can occur in a social context through olfactory cues, observation and instruction, or by imitation, and thus, is a mechanism for sharing information about a changing environment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Baldwin and Meldau, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cermakian et al., 2013</xref>). The potential benefits of adaptive behavior, based on information acquired from others within the community, can give social learners a significant advantage over those that must directly explore and gather environmental information for themselves. However, in general, the underlying molecular mechanisms of social learning are almost entirely mysterious and remain a <italic>terra incognita</italic> in terms of the strategies for communication, perception, neural plasticity, and the underlying physiological changes that cause changes in behavior. In this study, we use endoparasitoid wasps to explore social learning in the <italic>Drosophila</italic> model system with the aim of addressing some of these open questions.</p><p>Endoparasitoid wasps are ubiquitous keystone species in many ecosystems around the world. These wasps prey on immature stages of other insects, using larva and pupa of certain species as hosts for their own offspring. Such wasps pose a serious threat to juvenile <italic>Drosophila</italic>, with infection rates as high as 90% in natural populations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Janssen et al., 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Driessen et al., 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Fleury et al., 2004</xref>). Adult <italic>Drosophila</italic> have evolved complex behavioral changes to protect their offspring from these predatory wasps, including altered food preference and reduced oviposition rates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Lefevre et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kacsoh et al., 2013</xref>). Adult <italic>Drosophila</italic> themselves are not infected by these wasps, thus, making the change in reproductive behavior beneficial only to an anticipated threat to their offspring and not a response to predation itself. A remarkable feature of this altered reproductive behavior is that female <italic>Drosophila</italic> never having seen this predator can nevertheless robustly and reproducibly respond to it, suggesting an innate recognition of this predator-threat. Here, we use this natural predator system to explore predator threat communication within <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> and describe the specific learning, memory, and anatomical components necessary for this response. Our findings report the first example of social learning in <italic>Drosophila</italic> that can be delineated from simple mimicry, through the use of a natural predator. Exposure to the predatory wasp results in a distinct germ line-cell physiological apoptotic response in both flies having seen the wasp (direct experience) or flies having been paired with experienced individuals (social learning), which is clearly independent of mimicry. Furthermore, we address the genetic factors, neural circuits, and behavioral changes necessary for the transmission of this socially learned alteration in germ line physiology.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Flies respond to wasps by decreasing oviposition and are able to confer this information to naive flies</title><p><italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> alters its egg-laying behavior after it encounters parasitoid wasps, which infect fly larvae. This behavioral change entails at least two different and quantifiable behavioral responses. First, if high-ethanol containing food is made available to adult <italic>Drosophila</italic>, then wasp-exposed females will actively prefer to lay eggs on ethanol-laden food (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kacsoh et al., 2013</xref>). Second, if ethanol-containing food is not an option, <italic>Drosophila</italic> females will depress their egg-laying frequency, presumably to allow for time to search and discover an egg-laying environment that is not wasp infested (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Lefevre et al., 2012</xref>). Adult <italic>Drosophila</italic> are not infected by these wasps, thus, making the change in reproductive behavior beneficial only to an anticipated threat to their offspring. To address the question of whether changes in reproductive behavior could be transferred from exposed teacher flies to naive student conspecifics, we examined the underlying physiological, physical, and genetic components of the exposed teacher and naive student flies and asked if these mechanisms rely on learned reproductive behavior.</p><p><italic>Drosophila</italic> were exposed for 24 hr to wasps in cylindrical 7.5-cm long by 1.5-cm diameter tubes arrayed into fly condos of 24-tubes where each tube contained five female flies and one male fly, either with three female wasps (exposed) or with no wasps at all (unexposed) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, see methods and supporting information for details). After 24 hr, food plates were removed and embryos counted. Consistent with previous observations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Lefevre et al., 2012</xref>), exposed females reduced their oviposition rate significantly (average unexposed lay ∼65 ± 3.2 eggs; average exposed lay ∼13 ± 1.98 eggs) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). We observed this robust response in at least four different genetic backgrounds including <italic>Canton-S</italic> (CS), <italic>Oregon-R</italic> (OreR) (unexposed ∼57 ± 2.84 eggs compared to exposed 13 ± 1.88 eggs on average)<italic>, w</italic><sup><italic>1118</italic></sup> (unexposed ∼25 ± 1.54 eggs compared to exposed ∼1 ± 0.53 egg on average), and transgenic flies carrying Histone H2AvD-GFP (His-GFP) (unexposed ∼108 ± 7.69 eggs compared to exposed 18 ± 1.97 eggs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Clarkson and Saint, 1999</xref>). To test whether this decrease in egg laying can be transmitted from exposed flies to naive females, we exposed <italic>Canton-S</italic> flies to wasps for 24 hr, then removed the wasps and placed these pre-exposed flies in a new condo with three naive female flies expressing Histone-GFP (His-GFP) for an additional 24 hr (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). The His-GFP line was ideal for discriminating mixed populations of non-green fluorescent protein (GFP) and GFP embryos since this histone is clearly visible by 70 min after oviposition (embryonic cell cycle 9) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Foe et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Clarkson and Saint, 1999</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A,B</xref>). Oviposition in exposed teacher females was significantly reduced during the 24-hr exposure to wasps (acute depression: 0–24 hr) (53 ± 3.35 compared to 14 ± 1.59 eggs) and this depression persisted for an additional 24-hr post wasp exposure (learned depression: 24–48 hr) (35 ± 2.44 compared to 19 ± 1.33 eggs), relative to age-matched, unexposed sibling controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C</xref>). Quantification of total GFP and non-GFP embryos deposited during the 24–48 hr after initial teacher exposure to wasps demonstrated that naive His-GFP student flies had also decreased oviposition, relative to His-GFP siblings mixed with unexposed <italic>Canton</italic>-<italic>S</italic> flies (33 ± 2.34 compared to 6 ± 0.86 eggs) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C</xref>). In the reciprocal experiment, naive <italic>Canton-S</italic> student flies mixed with pre-exposed His-GFP teacher flies also exhibited a decrease in oviposition (46 ± 2.48 compared to 14 ± 1.34 eggs, see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD6-data SD7-data">Supplementary files 6,7</xref> for all raw egg numbers) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1D,E</xref>). Thus, naive female flies, never experiencing wasp exposure directly, reduced oviposition when encountering exposed flies. The decrease in oviposition of student flies is not due to an effect of the ratio of teacher to student flies. We tested a 1:1 ratio of 3 exposed female teachers to 3 naive female student flies. This elicited a similar reduction in oviposition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1F,G</xref>). Interestingly, when we tested a 1:1 ratio of 3 exposed males to 3 naive female student flies, we found no significant decrease in oviposition for students instructed by exposed males (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1H,I</xref>). This suggests that, under these conditions, only females can transmit predator-response information. Males are neither necessary nor sufficient for the information transfer. Therefore, for all further experiments, we used a teaching cohort of 5 females and 1 male to 3 female students, unless otherwise noted.<fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.07423.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Flies respond to wasps by decreasing oviposition and are able to confer this information to naive flies.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Standard exposure setup.

Naive student flies mixed with exposed teachers showed apoptosis at the stage 7/8 checkpoint, as did their teachers (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Supplementary file 1C,D,F,G</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A–B</xref>).

Thus, in naive student flies, transmitted information from exposed teacher flies results in triggering a specific-apoptotic mid-oogenesis checkpoint in students that have learned from teachers' experience. These data indicate that teacher flies transmit instructive cues to student flies that student flies receive these cues and then process them in a manner that leads to apoptosis of egg precursor cells and reduced oviposition.</p></sec><sec id="s2-6"><title>Oviposition depression in teacher and student requires the caspase encoding genes Dcp-1 and drice, which are dispensable for teacher behavior</title><p>One explanation for social learning could be that student flies instinctively mimic the behavior of more experienced teacher flies. Repeated episodes of imitative behavior could lead to a strengthening of neural circuits that underlie this behavior. We explored this idea by testing if wasp-exposed flies that are genetically unable to suppress oviposition efficiency are still able to successfully act as teacher flies. The <italic>Drosophila</italic> mid-oogenesis checkpoint is known to activate effector caspases Dcp-1 and drice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">McCall, 2004</xref>). Additionally, the caspase-3 staining we performed on wasp-exposed teacher ovaries recognizes effector caspases Dcp-1 and drice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1G–J</xref>), leading us to hypothesize that these caspases are important in oviposition depression in teacher and student flies as a response to parasitoid wasps. By using a maternal <italic>α-Tubulin &gt; Gal4</italic> driver to express an RNA-hairpin targeting mRNA from each of these genes, we were able to reverse both the decrease in oviposition as well as the increase of stage 7/8 egg chamber apoptosis of wasp-exposed females, while RNAi depletion of these caspases had no effect on oviposition of unexposed females (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2A,B</xref>). This provides further evidence that the stage 7/8 egg chamber apoptosis and corresponding oviposition decrease is a specific physiological checkpoint, similar to that previously described for poor nutritional intake (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A,B</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Supplementary file 1H</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Drummond-Barbosa and Spradling, 2001</xref>). We considered the possibility that ovarian apoptosis could produce secondary signals important for conveying information to naive flies, which in turn triggers apoptosis in student ovaries. To test this, we used teacher flies that were incapable of triggering apoptosis because of RNAi depletion of Dcp-1 or drice, specifically in developing egg chambers. Strikingly, following wasp exposure, flies, depleted of germ line Dcp-1 or drice function, were still excellent teachers capable of cueing naive student flies to decrease their oviposition and induce apoptosis at the stage 7/8 mid-oogenesis checkpoint in the students' ovaries (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A,B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1 A-B and G</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Supplementary file 1I,J</xref>). The finding that Dcp-1 and drice deficient females incapable of depressing oviposition can nevertheless convey critical cues to naive students demonstrates that the depressed oviposition response can be decoupled from the process required for teacher–student information transfer. Thus, information transfer in this context is not due to secondary effects of ovarian cell death. Interestingly, Dcp-1- and drice-deficient student females could not depress oviposition in response to exposed, wild-type teachers, suggesting that the same effector caspases activated in exposed teachers are also needed for oviposition depression in students (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C–D</xref>). Control, parental lines were found to behave as wild type as both teachers and students (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1A–F</xref>).

Consistent with previous studies indicating the necessity of light in visual learning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Ofstad et al., 2011</xref>), these data suggest that wild-type fly vision can only detect cues from wasps and teachers if there is light present, again demonstrating the role for visual cues for the behavior.<fig-group><fig id="fig8" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.07423.016</object-id><label>Figure 8.</label><caption><title>Acute and teaching response requires light.</title><p>(<bold>B</bold>, <bold>D</bold>, and <bold>F</bold>) Percent of eggs laid normalized to unexposed.

Previous experiments had both teachers and students co-habitating, leading us to speculate whether other stimuli were involved in either the acute- or social-learning response. To test this, we built the Fly Duplex, which we constructed by using three standard 25 mm × 75-mm glass microscope slides that were adhered between two 75 mm × 50 mm × 1-mm glass microscope slides using clear aquarium silicone sealant, making two compartments separated by one 1-mm thick glass slide. This setup allows flies to see other flies or wasps in the neighboring chamber, but do not allow direct contact (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9A</xref>). We find that both the acute and learned response are intact when performing the exposure in separate, but adjacent, chambers using the Fly Duplex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9B–C</xref>). We also find that teachers are able to transmit information to naive flies when in separate chambers, yielding depressed oviposition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9B–C</xref>). Both the requirement for light and the use of the Fly Duplex strongly suggest that olfactory, auditory, and tactile information is not likely to be important for this type of social communication. Instead, this demonstrates that visual cues alone are sufficient for acute-, learned-, and social-learning responses.<fig id="fig9" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.07423.018</object-id><label>Figure 9.</label><caption><title>Visual cues are necessary and sufficient for learning.</title><p>(<bold>B</bold> and <bold>C</bold>) Percent of eggs laid normalized to unexposed.

As these learning mutants show normal acute oviposition depression in response to direct wasp exposure, this suggests that wasp-induced and teacher-induced reductions in oviposition behavior occur through fundamentally different mechanisms. This is consistent with the fact that wasps and teachers must provide different visual signals to initiate learning and must, therefore, be expected to alter behavior through different neural circuit mechanisms. Taken together with the observations of blind <italic>ninaB</italic><sup><italic>P315</italic></sup> mutants, experiments performed in the dark, and the Fly Duplex, these results demonstrate that during social learning student flies must be able to visually perceive information from teacher flies and then undergo an active-learning process in order to stably respond by depressing oviposition.</p><p>We further asked how apoptosis in egg chambers was affected in wasp-exposed <italic>orb2</italic><sup><italic>ΔQ</italic></sup> mutant flies. The apoptotic response to acute wasp exposure (0–24 hr) in <italic>orb2</italic><sup><italic>ΔQ</italic></sup> was similar to the wild type, as expected, given that these flies had a normal depressed oviposition in presence of wasps (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig12">Figure 12M</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Supplementary file 1K</xref>).

We conclude that <italic>Drosophila</italic> females depress their egg laying during exposure to predatory wasps through an acute pathway that requires visual perception of wasp presence and leads to active elimination of developing eggs. The persistence of depressed oviposition and apoptosis in the 24-hr period after wasp removal requires an intact <italic>orb2</italic> gene, suggesting that maintenance of the initial behavior may require neural consolidation of the memory of wasp presence learned during the exposure period. Both acute and persistent mechanisms indicate that a systemic pathway initiated in photoreceptors and visual systems of female flies, processed centrally through neural circuits that can encode memories, leads to neuroendocrine signaling that impinges on developing egg chambers where it activates caspase-signaling cascades.</p></sec><sec id="s2-10"><title>Continued input from the mushroom body is required for the learned response and teaching behavior</title><p>To test if the reduced oviposition requires continued neuronal input to maintain reduced oviposition and teaching behavior, we mechanically removed neural input of exposed wild-type flies.

The tetanus toxin light chain works by catalytically inhibiting synaptic transmission once present in the cytosol by cleaving either synaptobrevin, syntaxin, or SNAP-25 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Poulain et al., 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bittner et al., 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Mochida et al., 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Kurazono et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">McMahon et al., 1993</xref>). We found that flies expressing <italic>UAS-TeTx</italic> in the MB exhibited a wild-type acute response, suggesting that the acute response occurs independent of the MB. However, in the learned period, these flies no longer showed reduced oviposition and were unable to teach naive students (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig13">Figure 13D</xref>). Using a second MB driver (MB247), this result was recapitulated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig13s1">Figure 13—figure supplement 1I</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Mao et al., 2004</xref>).

Flies expressing UAS-TeTx in the MB failed to function as students (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig13s1">Figure 13—figure supplement 1J–K</xref>). These data suggest that wasp presence is sensed through the visual system, and this information is relayed to the MB to induce a persistent reduction of oviposition, apoptosis, and teaching behavior, all of which are maintained over a time span of days.<fig-group><fig id="fig13" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.07423.024</object-id><label>Figure 13.</label><caption><title>Learning and teaching require a continuous neural input from the brain.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold> and <bold>D</bold>) Percent of eggs laid normalized to unexposed.

However, these experiments could not exclude the possibility that <italic>orb2</italic> gene product was required in non-neural tissues. Similarly, <italic>orb2</italic> may have been necessary for early neuronal development, and mutant phenotypes observed simply reflected developmental defects that precluded proper adult MB functions (pleiotropic effects). Given that inhibiting synaptic transmission in the MB with <italic>UAS-TeTx</italic> eliminated a long-term behavioral response to wasp exposure, teaching ability, and social learning (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig13">Figure 13D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig13s1">Figure 13—figure supplement 1I–K</xref>), we tested the hypothesis that the gene products of known learning and memory genes (such as <italic>orb2</italic>) may also be required to function in this anatomical region of the brain. To test this, we used the GAL4/UAS system as before: in this case, the MB driver (<italic>OK-107-GAL4</italic>) drove expression of an RNA-hairpin targeting <italic>orb2</italic> mRNA.

Flies deficient in <italic>orb2</italic> in the MB are also unable to learn from wild-type teachers.

The <italic>OK-107-GAL4</italic> driver begins expression of GAL4 in the larvae. Thus, it remains possible that RNAi depletion of Orb2 in the larvae could cause developmental defects that then indirectly cause behavioral phenotypes in adults. A second possibility is that persistence of depressed oviposition and in turn teaching ability requires <italic>orb2</italic> function in the adult MB, regardless of its possible function during MB development. In order to address this question, we turned to the GAL4-based Gene-Switch System where the GAL4 transcription factor is fused to the human progesterone ligand-binding domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Burcin et al., 1999</xref>). We used flies expressing the Gene-Switch transgene specifically in the MB, where only an administration of the pharmacological Gene-Switch ligand RU486 could activate the GAL4 transcription factor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Mao et al., 2004</xref>). In order to confirm our feeding protocol could work in The Fly Condo, we used the MB Gene-Switch line to express a nuclear-localized GFP. Flies were placed into condos containing instant <italic>Drosophila</italic> media hydrated by a mixture of RU486 dissolved in methanol and water. We found that flies placed in the Fly Condo where the food contains RU486 are able to function as wild-type teachers and students (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig15">Figure 15A–B</xref>). This observation demonstrates that RU486 does not perturb <italic>Drosophila</italic>'s ability to perceive and respond to wasp presence by changing their oviposition behavior, as both flies expressing a Gene-Switch construct and His-GFP flies behaved as wild type. Our data also demonstrate that induction of a protein in MB, in this case GFP, does not perturb learning and memory formation nor teaching ability. When the assay is run with just methanol, therefore lacking RU846, we find flies are able to function as wild type, similar to when they were fed RU486 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig15">Figure 15C–D</xref>). Control MB-Gene switch parental lines behave as wild-type flies as both homozygotes and when outcrossed to <italic>Canton-S</italic>. In cases when RU486 laden food was fed to flies containing the MB Gene Switch and GFP nuclear localization signal (nls) construct, we find that 24 hr is sufficient to induce GFP signal specifically localized to the MB, whereas food lacking RU486 (methanol only) does not induce GFP after 24 hr (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig15">Figure 15E–G</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig15s1">Figure 15—figure supplement 1E–G</xref>).<fig-group><fig id="fig15" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.07423.028</object-id><label>Figure 15.</label><caption><title>Induction of GFP in the MB using the Gene-Switch System does not perturb learning and memory.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold> to <bold>D</bold>) Percent of eggs laid normalized to unexposed.

The response persists over multiple days when learning and memory functions are intact. We also find that this behavior can be socially transmitted from experienced teacher females to naive student females: the transfer of information from teachers does not occur as a by-product of apoptosis in the teacher, but rather through an independent pathway, since depressed oviposition is not a necessary condition for social transmission of reduced egg-laying behavior or apoptosis in the student females (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig17">Figure 17</xref>). These conclusions are further supported by the unexpected observation that student flies, that had learned to reduce oviposition, could not serve as teachers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). We emphasize that teacher-instructed students continued to exhibit depressed oviposition and stage 7/8 egg chamber apoptosis in the 24-hr period after removal of teachers. This again indicates that depressed oviposition itself is not sufficient for information transfer. However, at a higher level, these observations also indicate that such adaptive information transfer cannot spread throughout a population, since only primary teachers are able to transmit the predator-threat information.<fig id="fig17" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.07423.032</object-id><label>Figure 17.</label><caption><title>Pathway model for fly-wasp mediated social learning.</title><p>Initial oviposition depression during the 0- to 24-hr acute response period and information transmission during social learning 24- to 48-hr periods are not coupled.

The discovery of neurally driven control of non-neural germ line cell physiology is conceptually similar to a recent study in <italic>Drosophila</italic>, which demonstrated that olfactory stimulation was necessary for maintenance of blood progenitor cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Shim et al., 2013</xref>), thus, also establishing a link between perception of environmental information and physiological response to specific information. Although learning mutants and flies expressing an RNA-hairpin to orb2 could perceive and respond to predator presence, the observation that egg production completely recovered by 24 hr following removal of the wasp threat (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig12">Figure 12</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig12s1">Figure 12—figure supplement 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Supplementary file 1K,L</xref>) is consistent with previous observations where females switched from a poor to rich food source repress the mid-oogenesis checkpoint via insulin signaling and recover normal egg production within 24 hr (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Drummond-Barbosa and Spradling, 2001</xref>). This rapid recovery of oviposition in learning and memory mutants, coupled with removing fly heads and inhibiting synaptic transmission in the MB, suggests that maintenance of the depressed oviposition state requires continued neural signaling mediated by a memory component of the brain.</p><p>Our observations document and describe a particularly robust form of social learning in <italic>Drosophila</italic> and establish several fundamental features. First, direct learning and social learning require visual system function but occur through different mechanisms: in particular, the acute response of flies to direct wasp exposure can occur even in classic-learning mutants, while persistence of the predator response and subsequent social learning requires functions of learning genes and continued neural input. Loss of memory gene functions, such as <italic>Adf1</italic>, <italic>amn</italic>, <italic>dnc</italic>, <italic>dFmr1, rut</italic>, and <italic>Orb2</italic>, or inhibition of MB synaptic transmission had no effect on the ability to change oviposition behavior in the presence of wasp, however, in each of these cases, persistence of this behavior after wasp removal, and subsequent teaching ability, was abolished. Additionally, inhibition of orb2 using the GAL4/UAS and Gene-Switch systems suggests that maintenance of the change in oviposition state requires neural signaling mediated by a memory component of the adult brain. Second, social learning occurs through a mechanism distinct from mimicry. Information of wasp presence can be transmitted by animals that have encountered wasps but are physiologically unable to display egg retention, which is the normal behavioral output of such learning (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig17">Figure 17</xref>). Third, social learning in this context appears to be limited in its spread: being transmitted only from teachers with direct predator experience to students that they encounter. Therefore, students that have learned through social learning cannot become teachers themselves (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). This is noteworthy because the inability of primary students to further transfer information to secondary students will limit the time frame and number of individuals in which this knowledge transfer takes place. The spreading of socially learned behavior has been previously postulated to possibly drive local adaptation by maintaining behavioral diversity of groups through self-propagating social learning once initiated in an individual (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Battesti et al., 2012</xref>). With regards to social learning of oviposition depression in response to a predator threat, it seems reasonable that such information would be most useful if limited to nearest neighbors, whose progeny may be similarly vulnerable in time and space by parasitoid wasps. However, the fitness costs of prolonged oviposition depression and/or spreading to conspecifics beyond primary learners could be devastating if it were self propagating, and thus, the degree to which it can spread within a group must be limited by restricting teaching behavior only to individuals having had direct visual experience of the threat, while ensuring memory of the threat in both primary (teachers) and secondary (students) learners is maintained and then decays over time.</p><p>In sum, we have shown that visual inputs modify synaptic signaling in the MB of the fly brain to implement a behavioral and physiological change, both of which are transferable through extrinsic inputs to naive student flies, and that experiments based around wasp exposure can serve as a simple and robust learning, social learning, and memory paradigm in future <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> studies. The learning and memory genes we tested and found to be involved are conserved across many animal species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bolduc and Tully, 2009</xref>), and thus, serves as an excellent approach to model cellular and neuronal network functions that may be relevant to vertebrate brain function. Even though the vertebrate brain is vastly more complex than that of the fly, additional genes, gene families, and pharmacological effects can be elucidated in <italic>Drosophila</italic> and may identify core mechanisms that are used in all species. These conserved components provide starting points in vertebrate animals for further vertical integration in the fields of learning and social communication. In this way, mechanisms that are unique to vertebrates can also be inferred, and we suggest that the learning and memory paradigm presented here will prove to be a useful discovery tool. We believe this study establishes a new and robust ecologically relevant model of social learning in <italic>Drosophila</italic> with possible far reaching implications for neurobiology, Darwinian selection and evolution.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Insect species/strains</title><p>The <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> strains <italic>Canton-S</italic> (CS), <italic>Oregon-R</italic> (OR), <italic>w</italic><sup><italic>1118</italic></sup><italic>,</italic> and transgenic flies carrying Histone H2AvD-GFP (His-GFP) were used as wild-type strains for assaying egg retention in the presence of wasps.

For all outcrosses, <italic>Canton-S</italic> virgin females were mated to males of the appropriate genotype.</p><p>Flies aged 3–5 days post-eclosion on fresh, molasses-based, <italic>Drosophila</italic> media were used in all experiments. Stocks were maintained at 25°C in 70% humidity with a 12:12 light:dark cycle. For stocks maintained in vials, 25 females were kept for stocks with 10 males at maximum to prevent over-crowding. Stocks kept in bottles had a maximum of 100 females and 40 males to prevent over-crowding. When flies were close to eclosion, parents were removed from the bottles. Newly eclosed flies were moved to fresh <italic>Drosophila</italic> media (in bottles or vials at the same population density) and aged until they were between 3 and 5 days of age maintained at 25°C in 70% humidity with a 12:12 light:dark cycle, at which point they were used in experiments. We stress the importance of aging the flies on fresh media, as it appears that flies aged on old media (i.e., the same media in which they eclosed) are nutrient deprived and naturally lay very few eggs.</p><p>The Figitid larval endoparasitoid <italic>Leptopilina heterotoma</italic> (strain Lh14) was used in all experiments. <italic>L. heterotoma</italic> strain Lh14 originated from single females collected in Winters, California in 2002, and was kindly provided by Todd Schlenke (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Schlenke et al., 2007</xref>). In order to culture wasps, adult flies were allowed to lay eggs in standard <italic>Drosophila</italic> vials containing standard <italic>Drosophila</italic> medium for 4 days before being replaced by adult wasps (10 female, 6 male), which then attack the developing fly larvae. Wasp vials were supplemented with approximately 500 µl of a 50% honey/water solution applied to the inside of the cotton vial plugs. Wasps aged 3–7 days post-eclosion were used for all experiments. Fresh wasps were used for all experiments, such that wasps were never reused between experiments.</p></sec><sec id="s4-2"><title>Fly oviposition</title><p>Fly oviposition rates were conducted using The Fly Condo (Genesee Scientific (San Diego, CA) Cat # 59-110) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>), which contained 24 independent chambers. Each chamber is 7.5 cm long by 1.5-cm diameter. Each condo/chamber had a bottom 24-well food plate with approximately 2 ml of standard, molasses cornmeal media per chamber. Briefly, bottles containing <italic>Drosophila</italic> were microwaved for 30 s at maximum heat. This liquid food was allowed to cool before dispensing 2 ml into the Fly Condo plates, where food was allowed to cool for another 30 min before the start of the experiment. All experiments used this food protocol unless otherwise noted (specifically experiments using instant <italic>Drosophila</italic> media with RU486 experiments). Mesh wire was along the top of the condo, allowing air transfer. In order to assay egg retention of flies in the presence of wasps (acute exposure), 5 female flies and 1 male fly (prepared and aged as described above) were placed into one chamber of The Fly Condo in the control, while 3 female Lh14 wasps were placed with the flies in the experimental setting. The oviposition plate from control and experimental condos was made 24 hr later.</p><p>In order to assay fly communication and the social learning period, 5 female flies and 1 male fly were placed into one chamber of The Fly Condo in the control, while 3 female Lh14 wasps were placed with the flies in the experimental setting for 24 hr. After the 24-hr exposure, wasps were removed by anesthetizing flies and wasps in the condos. Control flies underwent the same anesthetization. Wasps were removed and replaced with 3 female ‘student’ flies. All flies were placed into new clean condos for the second 24-hr period. The oviposition plate from each fly condo was replaced 24 hr after the start of the experiment, and the second plate was removed 48 hr after the start of the experiment. Fly egg counts from each plate were made at the 0–24-and 24–48-hr time points. To control for both seasonal influence and population effects of both flies and wasps used, acute- and social-learning period experiments were repeated in 24-experimental replicate increments in both August 2013 and April 2014. We found the same effect in both time points tested, suggesting that seasonal changes and population effects were not affecting our results (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C–E</xref>).</p><p>In order to demonstrate that students cannot become teachers, the same protocol as above was performed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). At the 48-hr time point, exposed teacher flies were removed by anesthetizing teacher and 1° student flies in the condos. Control flies underwent the same anesthetization. The exposed teacher flies were replaced with 3 new naive student flies, termed 2° students. These 2° students were placed with 1° student flies into new condos for the third 24-hr period. Fly egg counts from each oviposition plate were made at the 0–24, 24–48, and 48–72 hr time points.</p><p>In order to demonstrate that teachers could teach more than one cohort of students, the same protocol as above was performed with the exception of teacher removal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). At the 48-hr time point, 1° student flies were removed by anesthetizing students and teachers and teacher flies were placed into new condos. The 1° student flies were replaced with 3 new naive student flies, termed 2° students. These 2° students were placed with teacher flies into new condos for the third 24-hr period. Fly egg counts from each oviposition plate were made at the 0–24, 24–48, and 48–72 hr time points.</p><p>To assay if the ratio of teachers to students impacted the ability for information transfer, 3 female flies were placed into one chamber of The Fly Condo in the control, while 3 female Lh14 wasps were placed with the flies in the experimental setting for 24 hr. Wasps were then removed and replaced with 3 female, naive student flies of the opposite genotype (either His-GFP or <italic>Canton-S</italic> depending on teacher identity). Flies were then placed into new, clean condos. This provided a 1:1 ratio of teachers to students. The same protocol was performed to see if males participated in transmission of information by having 3 male flies exposed to 3 female Lh14 wasps. Wasps were then removed and replaced with 3 female, naive student flies of the opposite genotype (either His-GFP or <italic>Canton-S</italic> depending on teacher identity).</p><p>In order to assay the role of light during initial exposure and the role of light during the learned response, multiple assays were performed where light availability was varied (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>). For experiments where the acute response occurred in the dark, flies were anesthetized and placed into The Fly Condo with or without wasps as described above. However, they were then immediately placed into a box, taped closed with Duct Tape (to prevent light leaks), and allowed to awaken in the dark. Flies were kept in the dark for either 24 hr, after which wasps were removed and students were added and moved into the light, or kept in the dark for the duration of the experiment (48 hr) including the social-learning period with students. If flies were to be kept in the dark, the only light they were exposed to was just before they were anesthetized and given students.</p><p>All treatments were run at 25°C at 70% humidity with a 12:12 light:dark cycle in twenty-four replicates unless otherwise noted with both teacher and student flies aged 3–5 days post-eclosion. Food used for Fly Condo plates was the same molasses based <italic>Drosophila</italic> media used in maintaining fly stocks, unless otherwise noted. Fly condos and oviposition plates were bleached thoroughly with 10% bleach and rinsed with distilled water mixed with Sparkleen after every use (1 gallon of water: 1 gram of Sparkleen). All egg plates were coded and scoring was blind as the individual counting eggs were not aware of treatments or genotypes.</p><p>To assay whether flies continued to eat high-nutrient food during wasp exposure, flies were placed into a large embryo collection chamber (Genesee Scientific (San Diego, CA) Cat No. 59-101), which fits a 100-mm Petri dish. Dishes were filled with 5 grams of blue instant drosophila media (Fisher Scientific (Pittsburgh, PA) Cat No. S22315C), supplemented with a total of 20 ml of distilled water to hydrate the food. Yeast paste was made with 15 ml distilled water, 5 mL McCormick's red food dye, and 13 mL live yeast. Approximately, 15 mL of the yeast paste solution was added to the center of the petri dish containing the instant <italic>Drosophila</italic> media. In the egg lay chambers, 100 female <italic>Canto- S</italic> and 20 male <italic>Canton-S</italic> flies were added for control conditions. For exposed conditions, 100 female <italic>Canton-S</italic> and 20 male <italic>Canton-S</italic> flies were added with the addition of 50 female Lh14. The experiment was run for 24 hr at 25°C in 70% humidity on a 12:12 light:dark cycle. After 24 hr, flies were anesthetized and were scored for color in their abdomens. A random subset of 12 females was taken after abdominal quantification for ovary dissection and DAPI staining. Three replicates were performed for these experiments.</p></sec><sec id="s4-3"><title>Mechanical manipulation</title><p>To assay whether or not wings were involved in the information transmission in the social learning period, 5 female and 1 male <italic>Canton S</italic> were anesthetized and their wings were cut at the base using micro-scissors (Fine Science Tools (Foster City, CA); Item No. 15,001-08). Following clipping, flies were placed into one chamber of The Fly Condo in the control, while 3 female Lh14 wasps were placed with the flies in the experimental setting for 24 hr. After the 24-hr exposure, wasps were removed by anesthetizing flies and wasps in the condos. Control flies underwent the same anesthetization. Wasps were removed and replaced with 3 female ‘student’ flies. All flies were placed into new clean condos for the second 24-hr period. The oviposition plate from each fly condo was replaced 24 hr after the start of the experiment, and the second plate was removed 48 hr after the start of the experiment. Fly egg counts from each plate were made at the 0–24 and 24–48 hr time points.</p><p>In order to assay whether a continued input from the brain is needed for flies to remember wasp exposure and to transmit that information, 5 female flies and 1 male fly were placed into one chamber of The Fly Condo in the control, while 3 female Lh14 wasps were placed with the flies in the experimental setting for 24 hr. After the 24-hr exposure, wasps were removed by anesthetizing flies and wasps in the condos. Control flies underwent the same anesthetization. During this anesthetization period, both male and female flies were decapitated using the micro-scissors. Decapitated flies that were not standing after anesthesia recovery were excluded. Wasps were removed and replaced with 3 female ‘student’ flies. All flies were placed into new clean condos for the second 24-hr period.

Clear aquarium silicone sealant was used to glue these glass slides together, making two compartments separated by one 1-mm thick glass slide. Sealant was allowed to cure for 48 hr; each duplex was then soaked in water and Sparkleen detergent overnight (1 gallon distilled water: 1 gram Sparkleen), rinsed in distilled water (dH<sub>2</sub>O) overnight, rinsed with 70% ethanol and air-dried. The interior dimensions of each of the two units measured approximately 23.5 mm (wide) × 25 mm (deep) × 75 mm (tall).</p><p>For experiments using Fly Duplexes, plates from The Fly Condo (Genesse Cat. Item No. 59-113) were filled to the rim with standard <italic>Drosophila</italic> media and allowed to cool. Upon cooling, a single Fly Duplex was inserted into the food such that it touched the bottom of the plate. The open end of the Fly Duplex was closed using a cotton plug (Genesse Scientific (San Diego, CA) Cat. Item No. 51-102B) to prevent insect escape. 10 female flies and 2 male flies were placed into one chamber of the Fly Duplex in the control, while 10 female Lh14 wasps were placed in the compartment adjacent to the flies in the experimental setting for 24 hr. After the 24-hr exposure, flies and wasps were removed by anesthetizing flies and wasps in the Fly Duplexes. Control flies underwent the same anesthetization.

For all food treatments, we pipetted a total liquid volume of 2250 µl directly onto the instant food. For experiments with RU486, an RU486 solution was used. This was prepared by dissolving 3.575 mg of RU486 in 800 µl methanol (Fisher Scientific (Pittsburgh, PA) Lot number 141313). This solution was added to 15.2 ml of distilled water. The total solution (16 ml) was thoroughly mixed and 2250 µl were pipetted onto the instant food into each well. For plates containing no RU486 (methanol only), 800 µl methanol was mixed with 15.2 ml of distilled water.

Your article has been favorably evaluated by Eve Marder (Senior editor) and two reviewers, one of whom, Leslie Griffith, is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors. Ralph Greenspan has also agreed to share his identity.</p><p>This paper provides an important and interesting contribution to the literature: to the evolution literature, for its start at delineating mechanisms for an ethologically-based behavioral response, and to the neurobiological literature as a potent paradigm for learning.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) In a number of places, the data presented in a panel are clearly the wrong data i.e. it is a copy of other panels found in other figures. I noted this in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s1">Figure 8–figure supplement 1C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9B</xref>, but there may be other instances of this. The authors need to go through the figures very carefully to make sure they are all correct.</p><p>2) There are some irregularities in the way genotypes are expressed. “&gt;” usually implies a two-tiered system like GAL4 driving a transgene's expression i.e. two transgenes. In a number of the figures, this symbol is used in a non-canonical way to indicate a single transgene. An example is <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig13s1">Figure 13–figure supplement 1</xref> where the labels say “<italic>UAS&gt;TeTx”</italic> when I believe what is trying to be indicated is a <italic>UAS-TeTx/+</italic> genotype. All the figures need to be edited to correct this.</p><p>3) Is there information on how flies were reared, aged, stored prior to assays? If I couldn't find it, no problem. If it's not there, it should be.</p><p>Note that the title “Predator-induced changes in <italic>Drosophila</italic> behavior and germline physiology are socially communicated by talking flies” needs to be modified. We suggest dropping the last three words “by talking flies” in the title since it is factually inaccurate and will be confusing to some readers.</p><p>[Editors’ note: a previous version of this study was rejected after peer review, but the authors submitted for reconsideration. The previous decision letter after peer review is shown below.]</p><p>Thank you for choosing to send your work entitled “Social learning allows <italic>Drosophila</italic> to anticipate a predator-threat by triggering ovarian apoptosis” for consideration at <italic>eLife</italic>. Your full submission has been evaluated by Eve Marder (Senior editor) and four peer reviewers, one of whom is Peggy Mason, a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the decision was reached after discussions between the reviewers. Based on our discussions and the individual reviews, we regret to inform you that this version of the manuscript will not be considered further for publication in <italic>eLife</italic>. While all reviewers found the topic of the manuscript fascinating, several of them felt that further experiments were needed to clarify the model proposed. As you know, <italic>eLife</italic> does not allow us to ask for significant new experiments at the revise stage. However the interest of your work is such that the reviewers wanted to encourage a new submission with the addition of a new experiment as detailed below.

If not, this may suggest that information has a half-life, and that its persistence is independent of the individual that initially observed it. If that's true, a pupil may be able to become a teacher if it is allowed to teach at an earlier time point.</p><p>2) While the removal of the wings clearly affects behavior, and this could be how information is being transferred to the student, this manipulation likely alters many aspects of behavior. Are the flies less mobile? Do they lay differently? It would be useful to parse this out.</p><p>3) What happens if the teachers are in the minority relative to the students?

The authors need to go through the figures very carefully to make sure they are all correct</italic>.</p><p>Thank you very much for catching our mistake. The labels for teacher and student in these graphs were reversed. We have triple checked our figures and the data is correct, and the labels have been fixed accordingly in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s1">Figure 8–figure supplement 1C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9B</xref> in addition to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref> (all which had reversed labels). We have thoroughly examined the other figures to ensure this mistake is not present elsewhere in the manuscript.</p><p><italic>2) There are some irregularities in the way genotypes are expressed. “&gt;” usually implies a two-tiered system like GAL4 driving a transgene's expression i.e. two transgenes. In a number of the figures, this symbol is used in a non-canonical way to indicate a single transgene. An example is</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig13s1"><italic>Figure 13–figure supplement 1</italic></xref> <italic>where the labels say “</italic>UAS&gt;TeTx” <italic>when I believe what is trying to be indicated is a</italic> UAS-TeTx/+ <italic>genotype. All the figures need to be edited to correct this</italic>.</p><p>We have corrected the nomenclature used in our manuscript figures. For instances where “&gt;” was used, we have replaced with “-” (i.e. <italic>UAS-TeTx</italic>) in both titles and labels of teachers and students (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig13s1">Figure 13–figure supplement 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig14s1">Figure 14–figure supplement 1</xref>, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig15s1">Figure 15–figure supplement 1</xref>). We have changed the text accordingly. Thank you for pointing this out to us.</p><p><italic>3) Is there information on how flies were reared, aged, stored prior to assays? If I couldn't find it, no problem. If it's not there, it should be</italic>.</p><p>We previously had a line of text explaining rearing and aging prior to the experiment. We feel a more in depth description detailing our fly preparation and husbandry would be beneficial. See text changes in the subsection headed “Fly Oviposition” that now emphasizes this point and states:</p><p>“Flies aged 3-5 days post-eclosion on fresh, molasses-based, <italic>Drosophila</italic> media were used in all experiments. […] We stress the importance of aging the flies on fresh media, as it appears that flies aged on old media (i.e. the same media in which they eclosed) are nutrient deprived and naturally lay very few eggs.”</p><p>[Editors’ note: the author responses to the previous round of peer review follow.]</p><p>As suggested in your decision letter, we have carefully considered the reviewers' comments and would be very grateful if you would consider this new submission. This is a much revised story with additional/new experiments that address all the reviewers' concerns. Below, please see our responses to the reviewers' concerns and suggestions and specific reference to how the text and/or data have been changed to reflect this.</p><p>The title of this new submission is “Predator-induced changes in behavior and physiology are socially transmitted from exposed to naïve flies.” We believe that this manuscript presents the first example of social communication between female <italic>Drosophila</italic> that is completely based on visual cues with physiological consequences (apoptosis) in germline cells. This change in germline development provides a molecular explanation for the change in reproductive behavior, thus establishing a link between the visual system and female germline cells. We also show that persistence of this change in reproductive behavior requires a functional mushroom body and wild-type functions of learning and memory genes, again demonstrating a link between adult brain function and germline cell physiology. Because both behavioral and physiological changes are triggered by an ecologically relevant predator, we suggest that <italic>Drosophila</italic> evolved these specific innate behavioral and physiological responses to this serious environmental threat. Therefore, we suggest that this story would have broad interest to the <italic>eLife</italic> readership.</p><p><italic>This manuscript describes a series of potentially exciting results that demonstrate social communication in flies.

Additional experiments have also been performed to address the role of visual cues. Please see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>. Briefly, first we conducted wasp-fly and teacher-student interactions in complete darkness and this led to no transmission of information from wasp-to-fly or from teacher-to-student; second, we constructed glass chambers where flies could see wasps or teachers through the glass but could not smell, touch or taste either wasp or teachers. In contrast to the exposure in the dark, these experiments allowed transmission of information from wasp-to-flies and teachers-to-students.</p><p><italic>2) The involvement of the MBs is not convincingly demonstrated.</italic> OK107 <italic>is not a clean MB driver</italic>.</p><p>We have performed the experiment involving blocking synaptic transmission with <italic>UAS-TeTx</italic> with a second MB driver (MB 247). Please see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig13s1">Figure 13–figure supplement 1</xref>. We have included additional experiments using the MB Gene-Switch line as well. Please see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig15">Figure 15</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig16">Figure 16</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig15s1">Figure 15–figure supplement 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig16s1">Figure 16–figure supplement 1</xref>.</p><p><italic>3) The learning genes that were studied have pleiotropic effects. Without complementary evidence to accompany the genetic findings, these results are not compelling</italic>.</p><p>We have tested additional alleles of the genetics mutants originally tested (<italic>rut, dnc, Adf1, orb2</italic>). We have also tested two additional mutants with two alleles of each (<italic>amn</italic> and FMR1). Please see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig12">Figure 12</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig12s1">Figure 12–figure supplement 1</xref>. We narrowed the scope to examine the role of Orb2 and expressed an RNA-hairpin against Orb2 using the OK-107 MB driver and the MB Gene-Switch line to specifically knockdown <italic>orb2</italic>. These RNAi results recapitulate the mutant results. Using the Gene- Switch line allows us to activate the RNA-hairpin construct after development has finished, minimizing pleiotropic results. Please see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig14">Figure 14</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig15">Figure 15</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig16">Figure 16</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig14s1">Figure 14–figure supplement 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig15s1">Figure 15–figure supplement 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig16s1">Figure 16–figure supplement 1</xref>.</p><p>We suggest that it is highly unlikely that multiple alleles of six (6) different genes (<italic>rut</italic>, <italic>dnc</italic>, <italic>Adf1</italic>, <italic>orb2</italic> and FMR1) all have the same type of pleiotropic effects. Additionally, that such pleiotropic effects be phenocopied by driving RNAi-hairpin targeting Orb2 (but not controls such as the white gene) in a specific tissue would be unprecedented. Lastly, that all these mutants and the RNAi lines are perfectly capable of perceiving wasps, reducing oviposition and triggering apoptosis strongly suggests that these mutants are not general and non-specific disruptors of behavior. Instead, we suggest that a more likely interpretation is that the observations we report are indeed indicative of bona fide memory of a learned experience, and that disruption of these genes affect learning and memory functions of the brain. We urge the reviewers to consider the use of these genetic tools (mutants and RNAi) in the context of all the other assays reported herein, and how very unlikely it would be that these observations were due to pleiotropic effects.</p><p><italic>Additional comments that the authors may want to consider in the future</italic>:</p><p><italic>1) Can the teacher fly still teach pupils 48 hours after exposure, or is teaching limited to 24-48 hours?
