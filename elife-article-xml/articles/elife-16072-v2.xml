While transcriptional regulation of injury-induced gene expression is widely studied, less is known about the roles of RNA binding proteins (RBPs) in post-transcriptional regulation during axon regeneration. In <italic>C. elegans</italic> the CELF (CUGBP and Etr-3 Like Factor) family RBP UNC-75 is required for axon regeneration. Using crosslinking immunoprecipitation coupled with deep sequencing (CLIP-seq) we identify a set of genes involved in synaptic transmission as mRNA targets of UNC-75. In particular, we show that UNC-75 regulates alternative splicing of two mRNA isoforms of the SNARE Syntaxin/<italic>unc-64</italic>. In <italic>C. elegans</italic> mutants lacking <italic>unc-75</italic> or its targets, regenerating axons form growth cones, yet are deficient in extension. Extending these findings to mammalian axon regeneration, we show that mouse <italic>Celf2</italic> expression is upregulated after peripheral nerve injury and that <italic>Celf2</italic> mutant mice are defective in axon regeneration. Further, mRNAs for several Syntaxins show CELF2 dependent regulation. Our data delineate a post-transcriptional regulatory pathway with a conserved role in regenerative axon extension.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.16072.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.16072.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.16072.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Nerve cells or neurons carry information around the body along projections known as axons. An injury or trauma, such as a stroke, can damage the axons and lead to permanent disability because the damaged axons fail to regenerate over long distances.</p><p>Axon damage triggers large changes in the activity of many genes that promote regeneration. When a gene is active, its DNA is copied to make molecules of messenger RNA (mRNA), which are then used as templates to make proteins. Many mRNAs undergo a process called alternative splicing, in which different combinations of mRNA sections may be removed from the final molecule. This enables a single gene to produce more than one type of protein.</p><p>Recent studies point to an important role for so-called RNA binding proteins in regulating the alternative splicing process. An RNA binding protein called UNC-75 in a worm known as <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic> has previously been shown to be involved in axon regeneration, but it was not clear how UNC-75 acts on neurons. Here, Chen et al. combined a technique called CLIP-seq (Cross-linking ImmunoPrecipitation-deep sequencing) with genetic testing to identify the mRNAs that UNC-75 regulates during axon regeneration.</p><p>The experiments found a set of <italic>C. elegans</italic> genes required for information to pass between neurons whose mRNAs are also targeted by UNC-75. Many of these genes are also required for axon regeneration. Chen et al. studied one of the mRNA targets – which encodes a protein called syntaxin – in more detail and found that the syntaxin mRNA is required for regenerating axons over long distances. UNC-75 alternatively splices this mRNA to produce a particular form of syntaxin that is mainly found in neurons. Mutant worms that lack either UNC-75 or syntaxin are unable to properly regenerate axons over long distances.</p><p>Further experiments show that a mouse protein known as CELF2 that is equivalent to worm UNC-75 plays a similar role in regenerating axons. Moreover, mouse CELF2 restores the ability of worm neurons that lack UNC-75 to regenerate. Like worm UNC-75, the mouse protein is also involved in alternative splicing of syntaxin. The next step is to examine the other mRNA targets of UNC-75 to find out what role they play in axon regeneration and other processes in neurons.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.16072.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.16072.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>post-transcriptional regulation</kwd><kwd>UNC-75</kwd><kwd>PNS regeneration</kwd><kwd>DRG</kwd><kwd>CUGBP</kwd><kwd>neurite outgrowth</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd><italic>C. elegans</italic></kwd><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>HG004659</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Fu</surname><given-names>Xiang-Dong</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>GM049369</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Fu</surname><given-names>Xiang-Dong</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000065</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01NS093588</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Chisholm</surname><given-names>Andrew D</given-names></name><name><surname>Jin</surname><given-names>Yishi</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000065</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01NS057317</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Chisholm</surname><given-names>Andrew D</given-names></name><name><surname>Jin</surname><given-names>Yishi</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000065</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R56NS057317</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Chisholm</surname><given-names>Andrew D</given-names></name><name><surname>Jin</surname><given-names>Yishi</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000011</institution-id><institution>Howard Hughes Medical Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Yishi Jin</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Jin</surname><given-names>Yishi</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Genetics and genomics approaches reveal a conserved post-transcriptional regulatory mechanism that promotes adult axon regeneration from worm to mammals.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Axon regeneration requires coordinated gene expression at many levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Benowitz et al., 1981</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Gervasi et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Glasgow et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Skene and Willard, 1981</xref>). While much work has focused on injury-regulated gene transcription, increasing evidence points to roles for post-transcriptional regulation of mRNAs by RNA binding proteins (RBPs). In rodents, the Zipcode Binding Protein ZBP1 can bind axonal mRNAs and affect peripheral nerve regeneration via mRNA transport and decay (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Donnelly et al., 2011</xref>). In Xenopus, hnRNP K binds mRNAs of growth-associated proteins such as GAP43 and NF-M and promotes protein synthesis in optic nerve regeneration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Liu et al., 2012</xref>). Recently, the conserved RNA 3’-terminal phosphate cyclase has been identified as an inhibitor of axon regeneration in <italic>C. elegans,</italic> Drosophila and mouse, acting through RNA repair and splicing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Kosmaczewski et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Song et al., 2015</xref>). Despite these advances, mechanistic understanding of the roles of RBPs in axon regeneration remains limited.</p><p>CELF (CUG-BP and ETR-3-like Factor) family RNA binding proteins are highly conserved throughout animals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Dasgupta and Ladd, 2012</xref>). All six mammalian CELF proteins are expressed in the nervous system and several have been implicated in neuronal alternative splicing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Ladd, 2013</xref>). Analysis of <italic>Celf</italic> mutant mice has begun to reveal their roles in neuronal development and behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Dev et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Dougherty et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Kress et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Wagnon et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Yang et al., 2007</xref>). <italic>Celf4</italic> deficient mice exhibit a seizure disorder (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Wagnon et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Yang et al., 2007</xref>), whereas <italic>Celf6</italic> mutant mice display abnormal behaviors and reduced brain serotonin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Dougherty et al., 2013</xref>). However, CELF proteins have not previously been examined in the context of axon regeneration.</p><p>Here, we addressed the roles of CELF proteins in axon regeneration, focusing on <italic>C. elegans</italic> UNC-75 and mouse CELF2, both of which are localized to the nucleus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Loria et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Otsuka et al., 2009</xref>). To identify direct targets of UNC-75 in <italic>C. elegans</italic> neurons we performed neuronal CLIP-seq to locate UNC-75 binding sites. Many UNC-75 target sites are in genes involved in synaptic transmission. We show that UNC-75 binding to an intronic site of UNC-64/Syntaxin promotes expression of neuronal UNC-64/Syntaxin isoforms. Loss of UNC-75 or of UNC-64 causes distinctive phenotypes in which regenerative growth cones are formed but are unable to extend. Overexpression of UNC-64 in <italic>unc-75</italic> null mutants can rescue axon regeneration defects, indicating that UNC-64 is a major target of UNC-75 in regenerating neurons. Extending these findings to mammals, we find that mouse <italic>Celf2</italic> expression is induced by axon injury and that CELF2 is required for effective peripheral axon regeneration. Furthermore, we identify multiple <italic>Syntaxin</italic> genes as CELF2 targets. Together, our data reveal a conserved pro-regeneration pathway operating at the level of alternative splicing.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>UNC-75/CELF functions cell autonomously in sensory and motor axon regeneration</title><p>PLM axon development was normal in all <italic>unc-75</italic> mutants tested except that around 5% of PLMs lacked ventral synaptic branches.

Motor neuron subtype alternative splicing of <italic>unc-16</italic>/JIP3 mRNA also involves UNC-75 binding to intron sequences, and the outcome of exon inclusion or exclusion partly depends on the Elav-like RBP EXC-7 in cholinergic neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Norris et al., 2014</xref>). These previous studies were based on comparisons of whole-organism RNA levels, which reflect both direct and indirect regulation by UNC-75. As neurons contribute a small fraction of the overall <italic>C. elegans</italic> transcriptome, many neuronal targets of UNC-75 may have been overlooked in such studies. Our use of neuronal CLIP-seq validates some previous targets as direct interactors of UNC-75 and has expanded the number of candidate targets by an order of magnitude.</p><p>Many of UNC-75’s neuronal targets are involved in synaptic transmission, and were also identified as required for axon regeneration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chen et al., 2011</xref>). The close similarity between <italic>unc-75</italic> and <italic>unc-64</italic> regeneration phenotypes, and the ability of UNC-64 overexpression to rescue <italic>unc-75</italic> defects suggest that they act in a common pathway for regenerative axon extension. We therefore focused on how UNC-75 mechanistically promotes UNC-64 expression. Our analysis shows that UNC-75 binding to intron 7b promotes inclusion of the upstream exon 8a, leading to production of UNC-64A at the expense of UNC-64B. These results support the general model that UNC-75 tends to promote inclusion of upstream exons by binding downstream intronic sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Kuroyanagi et al., 2013b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Norris et al., 2014</xref>). Loss of UNC-75 caused increased pre-mRNA containing <italic>unc-64</italic> intron 7a and decreased pre-mRNA containing intron 7b, suggesting that alternative splicing of <italic>unc-64</italic> is regulated via selective intron retention. In <italic>unc-75</italic> mutants, we detected reduced UNC-64A::GFP expression from our reporter line (P<italic>unc-64-unc-64A</italic>::gfp), although the reporter lacked intron 7b (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). The reduction of UNC-64A expression from this reporter was not as dramatic as that from the dual reporter containing intron 7b (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>). We speculate that if the primary binding site is not available (i.e. intron 7b), UNC-75 can bind to secondary sites (e.g. intron 7a) to regulate UNC-64A expression. Consistent with this idea, we detected UNC-75 binding tags from our CLIP-seq in intron 7a (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Functions and targets of CELF2 in neurons</title><p>CELF2 was identified almost 20 years ago, in multiple studies, first as a CUG repeat binding protein CUG-BP2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Timchenko et al., 1996</xref>); in screens for homologs of the Elav family (ETR-3) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Lu et al., 1999</xref>); and as a gene induced in apoptotic neuroblastoma cells (NAPOR) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Choi et al., 1998</xref>). However until now, in vivo functions of CELF2 have not been explored using genetics. We find that CELF2 is essential for viability. The cellular basis of the lethal phenotype remains to be determined, but may reflect CELF2 functions in non-neuronal cells, as animals with a neuronal deletion of CELF2 were viable, albeit smaller and short-lived compared to wild type.</p><p>Alternative splicing (AS) is pervasive in neurons and has been implicated in axon guidance, synaptogenesis and synaptic transmission (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Raj and Blencowe, 2015</xref>). The function of CELF family members in AS was first explored in non-neuronal cells (e.g. cardiomyocytes), but given their widespread expression in the brain increasing attention has been given to the neuronal roles of CELF proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Ladd, 2013</xref>). CELF4 appears to be predominantly expressed in the cytoplasm of neurons and is implicated in neuronal excitability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Wagnon et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Yang et al., 2007</xref>). A CELF4 CLIP-seq analysis in mouse brain identified numerous targets, including many genes implicated in synaptic transmission, although CELF4 is thought to primarily regulate mRNA translation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Wagnon et al., 2012</xref>). CELF2 is known to regulate the AS of specific neuronal genes, including NMDAR1, MAPT/tau, and NF1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Barron et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Han and Cooper, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Leroy et al., 2006</xref>). Screens for CELF2 targets have been performed using SELEX (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Faustino and Cooper, 2005</xref>) and by CELF2 overexpression in T-cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Mallory et al., 2015</xref>). Here we report a genome-wide CLIP-seq approach to find CELF2 targets in neuronal cells. Consistent with our analysis of UNC-75 neuronal targets, in neuroblastoma cells, CELF2 binding sites were found in several Syntaxin genes. Like UNC-64, several mammalian Syntaxins are known to undergo alternative splicing, and we find that expression of two Syntaxin isoforms (stx2-002 and stx16-001) is significantly reduced in <italic>Celf2</italic> mutant brains.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Regulation of CELF expression and function</title><p>We find that CELF2 expression is upregulated after nerve injury. Expression of CELF2 or other CELF genes is altered by cellular stress or damage in several contexts, although the mechanisms of induction remain poorly understood. In epithelial cells CELF2 expression is induced by UV or gamma irradiation injury (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Mukhopadhyay et al., 2003</xref>). In the nervous system CELF1 has been reported to be upregulated after spinal cord injury (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Yang et al., 2015</xref>). CELF2 expression is also downregulated in some models of ischemic brain injury and fetal alcohol syndrome, although it is unclear whether this is cause or consequence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Otsuka et al., 2009</xref>). Acute induction of CELF2 expression has been most extensively studied during T cell activation, and occurs partly at the level of transcription and partly by stabilization of <italic>Celf2</italic> transcripts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Mallory et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">2015</xref>). Recently CELF2 has been found to regulate alternative splicing of the MAPKK MKK7, facilitating a JNK-dependent positive feedback loop during T cell activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Martinez et al., 2015</xref>). JNK is required for the increased stability of CELF2 messages after T cell activation, by as-yet unknown mechanisms. Many targets of JNK-regulated AS are also dependent on CELF2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Martinez et al., 2015</xref>), suggesting the CELF2/JNK positive feedback loop might function widely to regulate inducible alternative splicing.</p></sec><sec id="s3-4"><title>Syntaxin isoforms and synaptic transmission genes function in axon extension</title><p>UNC-75 dependent splicing is critical for UNC-64A expression in neurons, at the expense of UNC-64B. The roles of the two UNC-64 isoforms and the mechanistic basis for their functional difference have remained a topic of debate. As truncation of UNC-64A causes apparent complete loss of function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Saifee et al., 1998</xref>), UNC-64A appears to be the predominant functional isoform in neurons. Overexpression of either A or B isoform rescued the axon regrowth defect of <italic>unc-64</italic> hypomorphs, but only the A isoform was sufficient to rescue <italic>unc-64</italic> locomotor defects when overexpressed. The level of UNC-64 function required in regeneration may be lower than in behavior. A recent study also reported <italic>unc-64</italic> splicing is regulated by <italic>unc-75</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Norris et al., 2014</xref>). However, using fosmid transgenes, this study found that while either A or B isoform could rescue <italic>unc-64</italic> Ric phenotypes, only UNC-64B could rescue <italic>unc-64</italic> locomotor phenotypes. The basis for this discrepancy might reflect differences in the promoters and nature of expression (pan-neural and cDNA in our study, endogenous regulatory sequences including splicing of 5’ exons in Norris et al.). We find that transgenic expression of UNC-64A (cDNA bypassing splicing) also significantly suppressed <italic>unc-75</italic> locomotor and regeneration phenotypes whereas overexpression of UNC-64B was unable to rescue. The simplest interpretation of these data is that UNC-64B is unable to fully substitute for reduced levels of UNC-64A. Possibly, UNC-64B but not UNC-64A requires some additional cofactor lacking in <italic>unc-75</italic>.</p><p>The C-terminal membrane anchors of UNC-64A and B are both 25 aa residues long and differ only in the last 14 aa, suggesting that the precise composition of the anchor is critical for Syntaxin function. Both have the same number of hydrophobic residues in their C-termini, with the only discernible difference being that these residues are more clustered in the B isoform. Nevertheless seemingly small differences in hydrophobicity can cause Syntaxins to sort into distinct membrane domains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Milovanovic et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Milovanovic and Jahn, 2015</xref>), and may underlie the nonequivalence of the UNC-64A and B isoforms.</p><p>UNC-64 is known to localize along the axonal plasma membrane, and may provide a SNARE function involved in membrane addition during axon extension. Like <italic>unc-64, Syntaxin2</italic> encodes two alternatively spliced isoforms that differ in the membrane anchor. Syntaxin2 (also called epimorphin) was first identified as an extracellular morphogen (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Hirai et al., 1992</xref>), but later was also found to function in the cytoplasm as t-SNARE regulating vesicle fusion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bennett et al., 1993</xref>). The localization of this protein on either the cytoplasmic face or the extracellular surface of the plasma membrane is determined by its distinct conformation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chen et al., 2009</xref>). Little is known of the neuronal functions of Syntaxin2. In mammals Syntaxin16 has been implicated in neurite outgrowth, and appears to localize to the Golgi (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Chua and Tang, 2008</xref>). Mammalian Syntaxin12 (previously called Syntaxin13) has been shown to promote axon regeneration under the control of the mTOR pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Cho et al., 2014</xref>). Whether other Syntaxins also play a role in axon regeneration remains to be tested.</p><p>The mechanism by which Syntaxin contributes to regenerative axonal elongation remains to be elucidated. Because <italic>unc-64</italic> mutants are defective in axon extension rather than growth cone reformation, we believe it is less likely that Syntaxin is required for membrane resealing immediately after injury. Instead, Syntaxin may contribute to the rapid plasma membrane expansion required during axon regrowth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bloom and Morgan, 2011</xref>). In mammalian neurons Syntaxin-3 has been implicated in fatty acid stimulated axon plasma membrane expansion resulting from fusion of transport organelles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Darios and Davletov, 2006</xref>). Such organelles might be related to the Syntaxin-containing transport packets involved in presynaptic assembly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Ahmari et al., 2000</xref>). The recycling endosome component Syntaxin13 is upregulated by injury and is thought to promote membrane recycling required for regrowth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Cho et al., 2014</xref>). Finally, Syntaxin might contribute to membrane expansion via a non-fusogenic mechanism as shown for the SNARE Sec22b (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Petkovic et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>In summary, we have revealed a novel regulatory pathway important for axon extension in regenerative regrowth, involving CELF-dependent alternative splicing of neuronal Syntaxins. As well as being relevant to axon regeneration, our finding may shed light on the roles of CELFs in neurological disease. CELF2 is misregulated in a mouse model of spinal muscular atrophy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Anderson et al., 2004</xref>) and CELF2 copy-number variation has been linked to schizophrenia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Xu et al., 2011</xref>).

Briefly, total RNA was extracted from synchronized worms using Trizol (Invitrogen). cDNA synthesis was performed using SuperScript III (Invitrogen) and 3 µg of total RNA, together with 1 µl of 50 µM Biotin labeled oligodT and Adaptor-Random primers. cDNA was then purified using PCR purification kit (Macherey-Nagel) followed by terminal transferase treatment to add ddNTP to protect 3’-end. cDNA was then captured using streptavidin coated magnetic beads and primer extension was done on beads with Adaptor-Random primers. DNA was then eluted from beads by heating to 95°C before PCR amplification using barcoded primers. PCR products were then size selected and used for deep sequencing.</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>Generation of <italic>Celf2</italic> floxed allele</title><p>Mouse husbandry and surgeries were performed under the supervision of the University of California San Diego Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC).

Sciatic nerves were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 3 hr, then washed with PBS, immersed in 30% sucrose in PBS, cryopreserved in OCT compound (TissueTek) and cryosectioned at 10 μm thickness. Samples were immunostained with anti-SCG10 (1:3000) (Novus Biologicals STMN2 NBP1-49461). After staining, multiple images along the nerve were taken using a 10X objective (Zeiss LSM710) and montaged using Photoshop (Adobe). Representative images are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>. We used Metamorph software to measure SCG10 staining fluorescence intensity in tdTomato positive axons (Cre-expressing neurons). At each distance point, at least 10–20 regions with tdTomato signal were randomly selected in the red channel and regions of interest (ROI) defined. These regions were then transferred to the green channel and the average intensity of green fluorescence measured. Average intensity from all the regions at each distance point was then normalized to the average intensity immediately proximal to the crush site.</p></sec><sec id="s4-11"><title>RNA extraction and RT-qPCR</title><p>Total RNA from worms or mouse tissues (E15.5 embryonic brains or dorsal root ganglia at different stages) were extracted using Trizol (Invitrogen) or RNeasy kit (Qiagen) following the manufacturers’ protocols.

Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, one of whom, Graeme W Davis, is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors and the evaluation has been overseen by Senior Editor. The following individuals involved in review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Aaron D Gitler (Reviewer #2).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>In this manuscript by Chen et al., the authors investigate the role of the RBP binding protein unc-75/CLEF and one of its targets unc-64/syntaxin in axonal regeneration. The authors provide compelling evidence that in <italic>C. elegans</italic> unc-75/CLEF is critical for regenerative axonal extension -but not for developmental axonal growth or regenerative growth cone formation, that it acts cell-autonomously, and that nuclear localization of unc-75/CLEF is critical for its pro-regenerative function. Through CLIP-seq the authors then identify neuronal unc-75/CLEF targets and demonstrate that unc-64/syntaxin is a major target critical for axonal regeneration.</p><p>The authors then complement their findings in <italic>C. elegans</italic> with definitive experiments in mice using conditional CLEF2 KO animals, a major step defining conserved gene function. Overall, this is an impressive manuscript that uncovers a conserved role for the unc-75/CLEF2 RNS binding protein in promoting axonal regeneration. Of particular note, this manuscript strongly reinforces the notion that genetic pathways critical for regeneration of single axons in <italic>C. elegans</italic> also function in multi- axonal regeneration of vertebrate peripheral nerves, a notion that no longer can be ignored.</p><p>This manuscript was reviewed by three individuals. All considered the data, interpretation or presentation to adhere to high standards and general interest consistent with publication at <italic>eLife</italic>. None of the reviewers had major concerns with the work. However, each had minor comments that the authors are asked to consider addressing prior to resubmission.</p><p>Minor Comments:</p><p>1) Please present non-normalized data in figure format or in table format to supplement the figures that contain normalized data.</p><p>2) Please re-visit the statistical analysis in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E</xref>.

The topic should have a broad appeal; at a molecular level (RBP function) and phenomenologically (regeneration). The manuscript is well written and the data are nicely presented. In each instance, the effects being observed are large and convincing. The genetic analyses are thorough, including the generation of splicing reporters that are convincing and show large effect. The genetic data are appropriately interpreted. At the end of this manuscript, we are left with the finding that alternative syntaxin splicing is involved in the regenerative response, but there is no indication how syntaxin might participate. However, the paper, as written, is strong and the authors should not be required to make that next mechanistic leap in this paper. The story is solid and already makes the leap from work to mammalian systems, providing evidence of conserved signaling across distant species. I have only minor concerns.</p><p>Reviewer #2:</p><p>The authors have presented a thorough study that characterizes how CELF RNA binding proteins can regulate the alternative splicing of syntaxins, which may play a role in axon regeneration. The experiments had a logical flow starting from a genomics approach using CLIP-seq to identify RNA binding targets of UNC-75, followed by more functional genetic studies in nematodes and mice. Overall, the experiments were of high quality, the results are interesting, and will be of interest to the neuroscience community. I only have the following questions for the authors to consider.</p><p>1) Are the quantifications of GFP intensity normalized somehow in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B–D</xref>?</p><p>2) In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>, it's stated that CELF2 is more effective than CELF4 at rescuing the unc-75 PLM defect. Are these mouse transgenes able to be expressed at similar levels?</p><p>Reviewer #3</p><p>In this manuscript by Chen et al., the authors investigate the role of the RBP binding protein unc-75/CLEF and one of its targets unc-64/syntaxin in axonal regeneration.

Overall, this is a very impressive manuscript that uncovers a conserved role for the unc-75/CLEF2 RNS binding protein in promoting axonal regeneration. I expect this manuscript to have a major impact on the field, in part because it delineates a novel, conserved pathway that promotes regeneration in vivo, but also because it strongly reinforces the notion that genetic pathways critical for regeneration of single axons in <italic>C. elegans</italic> also function in multi- axonal regeneration of vertebrate peripheral nerves, a notion that no longer can be ignored!</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.16072.030</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p> <italic>1) Please present non-normalized data in figure format or in table format to supplement the figures that contain normalized data.</italic> </p><p>We have provided a new <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD7-data">Supplemental file 7</xref> for the non-normalized axon regrowth data.</p><p>Experimental variation in axon regrowth length results in part from known sensitivity of the laser to changes in temperature and humidity, and thus wild type controls show slight variation in mean regrowth between different days. To compare data sets from day to day, we routinely normalize axon regrowth to the average regrowth length of wild type controls performed on the same day as the experiment. Nevertheless in the data sets presented here such day-to-day variation was relatively low, so the normalized data display very similar pattern when compared to the non-normalized data.</p><p><italic>2) Please re-visit the statistical analysis in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E</xref>. The t-test on individual points is not the appropriate approach.</italic></p><p>This point might be some kind of misunderstanding. As stated in the original MS, the analysis in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E</xref> uses one way ANOVA, not the t-test. Nonetheless, we have also rechecked the statistical analyses in other related figures.</p><p><italic>3) Are the quantifications of GFP intensity normalized somehow in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B–D</xref>?</italic></p><p>The GFP intensity in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B–D</xref> is not normalized. The bar graph shows the mean intensity ± SEM. All genotypes were imaged using the same microscope settings with same laser power. To keep laser illumination uniform across genotypes we used a relatively high laser power. This may potentially underestimate the intensity of bright GFP signals due to saturation. Thus the reduction in UNC-64A levels in unc-75 may be greater than estimated.</p><p><italic>4) In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>, it's stated that CELF2 is more effective than CELF4 at rescuing the unc-75 PLM defect. Are these mouse transgenes able to be expressed at similar levels?</italic></p><p>In the transgenes used here (<italic>juEx5488</italic> and <italic>juEx5490</italic>) CELF2 and CELF4 were tagged with mCherry, and by visual inspection the fusion proteins were expressed at similar levels (additional transgenic lines were tested, and representative data are shown). We have added a statement to this effect in the legend to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>. As this is a minor control we have elected to mention this as data not shown, although if necessary the data can be made available for review.</p><p><italic>5) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D</xref> shows axonal regeneration following crush injury in wild type and mutants, which is quantified in 7E.

Were data from all 4 mutants pooled? Is there substantial variability from nerve to nerve?</italic></p><p>The graph (assuming 7D/E is a typo for 6D/E) shows mean intensity ± SEM, with data pooled from 4 mutants and 5 controls. There was some variability from nerve to nerve in both controls and mutants. We have selected the images that are representative of the mean intensity to convey the mutant phenotypes</p><p> <italic>6) The authors demonstrate that in C. elegans syntaxin promotes axonal regeneration. While not the major focus of this manuscript, a possible mechanism how syntaxin promotes regeneration is not provided. A discussion regarding possible mechanisms would be helpful.</italic> </p><p>We thank the reviewer for the comment and have added a paragraph to the Discussion surveying previous relevant findings on syntaxins and axon growth:</p><p>“The mechanism by which syntaxin contributes to regenerative axonal elongation remains to be elucidated. Because unc-64 mutants are defective in axon extension rather than growth cone reformation, we believe it is less likely that syntaxin is required for membrane resealing immediately after injury. […] Finally, syntaxin might contribute to membrane expansion via a non-fusogenic mechanism as shown for the SNARE Sec22b (Petkovic et al., 2014).”</p><p><italic>7) The labeling of many figures could be improved for clarity.
