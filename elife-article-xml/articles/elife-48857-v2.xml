We investigated the underlying mechanisms using the developing tracheal tube network of <italic>Drosophila</italic> indirect flight muscles (IFMs) as a model. Live imaging revealed that tracheal sprouts invade IFMs directionally with growth-cone-like structures at branch tips. Ramification inside IFMs proceeds until tracheal branches fill the myotube. However, individual tracheal cells occupy largely separate territories, possibly mediated by cell-cell repulsion. Matrix metalloproteinase 1 (MMP1) is required in tracheal cells for normal invasion speed and for the dynamic organization of growth-cone-like branch tips. MMP1 remodels the CollagenIV-containing matrix around branch tips, which show differential matrix composition with low CollagenIV levels, while Laminin is present along tracheal branches. Thus, tracheal-derived MMP1 sustains branch invasion by modulating the dynamic behavior of sprouting branches as well as properties of the surrounding matrix.</p></abstract><kwd-group

sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Indirect flight muscles (IFMs) of flying insects display the highest known metabolic rates in the animal kingdom (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Weis-Fogh, 1964</xref>). In <italic>Drosophila</italic>, two sets of IFMs, the dorsal-longitudinal muscles (DLMs) and the perpendicularly oriented dorso-ventral muscles (DVMs) are anchored to the thoracic cuticle and move the wings indirectly by deforming the thoracic exoskeleton rather than by acting directly on the wings. Each adult IFM is approximately 1 mm long and 100 µm wide (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Spletter et al., 2018</xref>) and contains about 1000 nuclei (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Rai and Nongthomba, 2013</xref>). To supply these large muscles with sufficient oxygen, an extensive network of gas-filled tracheal tubes not only superficially enwraps the IFMs, but also invades the myotube interior. This remarkable physiological adaptation minimizes the distance for oxygen diffusion from tracheoles to muscle mitochondria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Weis-Fogh, 1964</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Wigglesworth and Lee, 1982</xref>) and provides efficient gas exchange for aerobic respiration to sustain flight over long time periods (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Götz, 1987</xref>).</p><p>Tracheal cell migration is controlled by Fibroblast growth factor (FGF) signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Ghabrial et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Hayashi and Kondo, 2018</xref>). The FGF ligand Branchless (Bnl) acts as a chemoattractant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Sutherland et al., 1996</xref>) that promotes tracheal cell motility by activating the receptor tyrosine-kinase (RTK) Breathless (Btl) on tracheal cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Klambt et al., 1992</xref>). IFMs receive their tracheal supply from tracheal cells that extend from the thoracic air sac primordium towards the notum region of the wing imaginal disc during larval development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Sato and Kornberg, 2002</xref>). Subsequently, during metamorphosis, tracheal terminal branches (tracheoles) ramify on and invade the developing IFMs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Peterson and Krasnow, 2015</xref>). Tracheal invasion into IFMs depends on the attraction of tracheal branches by Bnl FGF secreted on the muscle surface, followed by a switch to release of FGF from the interior transverse (T)-tubule system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Peterson and Krasnow, 2015</xref>). The T-tubule system is a network of tubular longitudinal and transversal membranes that extend around each sarcomere and are required for excitation-contraction coupling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Razzaq et al., 2001</xref>). It is continuous with the plasma membrane and was proposed to provide entry points for invasion of tracheal branches into the IFMs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Peterson and Krasnow, 2015</xref>). However, how tracheal cells interact with and enter the myotube, and how this process is coordinated with muscle development, has not been clear.</p><p>Tracheal invasion into IFMs presumably requires dynamic remodeling of extracellular matrix (ECM) and plasma membranes, but the underlying mechanisms are not well understood. Matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) are involved in tissue reorganization during branching morphogenesis in various systems, including the mammalian lung (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Atkinson et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Wiseman et al., 2003</xref>), mammary gland (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Wiseman et al., 2003</xref>), and the <italic>Drosophila</italic> tracheal system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Page-McCaw et al., 2003</xref>). The <italic>Drosophila</italic> genome encodes two MMPs, MMP1 and MMP2, which perform common and distinct functions during tissue remodeling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Llano et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Page-McCaw et al., 2007</xref>). MMP1 was shown to be required for tracheal remodeling during larval growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Glasheen et al., 2009</xref> ) and MMP2 for normal outgrowth of the air sac primordium (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Wang et al., 2010</xref>). MMPs can be either secreted or membrane-tethered (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">LaFever et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Page-McCaw et al., 2007</xref> ), and are thought to function mainly as enzymes cleaving ECM components. However, MMP-mediated proteolysis can also modulate signaling by processing growth factors such as TNF <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf1"><mml:mi>α</mml:mi></mml:math></inline-formula> and TGF <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf2"><mml:mi>β</mml:mi></mml:math></inline-formula> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">English et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Yu and Stamenkovic, 2000</xref>), by regulating growth factor availability and mobility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Lee et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Wang et al., 2010</xref>), or by cleaving growth factor receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Levi et al., 1996</xref>). MMP2 was shown to restrict FGF signaling through a lateral inhibition mechanism that maintains highest levels of FGF signaling in tracheal tip cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Wang et al., 2010</xref>). Moreover, MMPs can regulate mammary gland development independently of their proteolytic activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Kessenbrock et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Mori et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>To understand the mechanisms underlying tracheal invasion into IFMs, we analyzed the dynamics of the process in vivo. This revealed that tracheal cells invade IFMs directionally and migrate inside the myotubes with dynamic growth-cone-like structures at branch tips until tracheal branches fill the myotube volume. MMP1 activity is required in tracheal cells for normal invasive behavior and for the dynamic organization of growth-cone-like branch tips. We found that MMP1 remodels the Collagen IV-containing ECM around invading branch tips, suggesting that tracheal-derived MMP1 sustains branch invasion by modulating the properties of the surrounding matrix. </p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Tracheae invade flight muscles in a non-stereotyped, but coordinated manner</title><p>To understand the mode of IFM tracheation, we first analyzed tracheal branch pathways on the surface of and within IFMs. We focused our analysis on DLMs, which receive their tracheal supply from thoracic air sacs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Stochastic multicolor labeling of tracheal cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Nern et al., 2015</xref>) revealed that multicellular air sacs converge into unicellular tubes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>) with ramified tracheal terminal cells at their ends (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B’</xref>). Unlike tracheal terminal cells in other tissues, IFM tracheal cells not only ramify on the myotube surface, but also inside the syncytial myotube (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C,C’ and D,D’</xref>; <xref ref-type="video" rid="video1">Video 1</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Peterson and Krasnow, 2015</xref>).

To investigate potential roles of MMP1 in BM remodeling during branch invasion, we first analyzed the distribution of the BM components Laminin and Perlecan around tracheal branches at the onset of tracheal invasion 48 hr APF. Compared to adult IFM tracheae, which were covered with Laminin- and Perlecan-containing BM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1C–C’’</xref>), invading tracheal branches at 48 hr APF showed little detectable BM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1A–B’</xref>).

In flying insects the extreme energy demands of flight are met by a network of tracheal tubes that minimize the distance for oxygen diffusion to mitochondria by extending branches into the interior of the flight muscles. This requires a new developmental process that enables tracheal cells to invade and spread throughout the IFM myotubes, unlike all other insect muscle types, where tracheoles ramify on the muscle surface only. Hence, flight muscle tracheation provides a powerful model to study the interactions that promote invasion of sprouting branches into tissues.</p><p>To investigate the cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying tracheal invasion into IFMs, we analyzed the dynamics of the process in vivo. First, through live imaging of muscle tracheation, we found that tracheal cells invade the muscle directionally with growth cone-like structures at branch tips. Tracheoles ramify inside the muscle until they uniformly fill the myotube volume. Intriguingly, however, single-cell analyses revealed that individual IFM tracheal cells occupy largely separate territories within the myotube, reminiscent of neuronal dendritic tiling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Grueber and Sagasti, 2010</xref>), suggesting that IFM tracheation involves repulsion between tracheal cells. Second, using a tissue-specific RNAi-based approach to identify factors required for branch invasion, we found that MMP1 activity is required in tracheal cells for normal speed of invasion and for the dynamic organization of growth-cone-like structures at migrating branch tips. Third, we showed that ECM components are distributed non-uniformly along IFM tracheal branches, with Laminin covering the entire length of tracheal branches, whereas Perlecan and Collagen IV are excluded from the tracheal tip regions inside the myotube. Fourth, we showed that MMP1 is involved in remodeling the Collagen IV-containing matrix around invading branch tips. Together, these findings suggest that MMP1 sustains tracheal branch invasion by modulating the dynamic behavior of tracheal branch tips and by remodeling the surrounding ECM.</p><p>A unique aspect of IFM tracheation is the fact that tracheal terminal cells enter and ramify within another cell, in this case a syncytial muscle. Although this system represents a specialized adaptation towards the extensive oxygen demand of this tissue, the underlying cellular mechanisms may be relevant also for the development of other organs, such as the vasculature. Tracheal invasion involves dynamic adhesion to the substrate, guidance of tracheal cells, and remodeling of the myotube ECM and plasma membrane to accommodate the invading tubes. Angiogenesis, which is based on tip-cell-guided migration with invasive protrusions probing the environment, involves similar challenges, for instance in the case of blood vessels that grow into collagen-packed cornea tissue or into bones (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Sivaraj and Adams, 2016</xref>).</p><p>The ability of tracheal cells to enter the IFM myotubes is likely to depend on permissive and instructive cues provided by the muscle, as well as on factors that act in the tracheal cells to mediate their invasive behavior. We showed that tracheal invasion into IFMs critically depends on the transcription factor Salm, which specifies the fibrillar muscle type (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Schönbauer et al., 2011</xref>). The <italic>salm</italic>-dependent cell fate switch appears to induce a program that renders the myotube permissive for tracheal invasion, for example through modulating properties of the muscle plasma membrane or ECM. In addition, Salm may regulate factors that mediate the dynamic redistribution of the Bnl FGF chemoattractant from the muscle surface to the internal T-tubule network in IFMs. This switch in the mode of the subcellular pathway of FGF secretion was shown to guide tracheal cells into IFMs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Peterson and Krasnow, 2015</xref>).</p><p>Classical electron microscopy studies suggested that tracheoles enter the IFMs through plasma membrane invaginations that are continuous with T-tubules, and then spread through the T-tubule network (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Smith, 1961a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Smith, 1961b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Wigglesworth and Lee, 1982</xref>). Other muscle types that lack these membrane invaginations are not invaded by tracheal branches (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Peterson and Krasnow, 2015</xref>). Surprisingly, however, we did not find evidence that a normally organized T-tubule system is required for tracheal ingrowth and spreading in <italic>Drosophila</italic> IFMs, since <italic>amphiphysin (amph)</italic> mutants with a disorganized T-tubule system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Razzaq et al., 2001</xref>) showed a normal distribution of tracheoles in IFMs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1G,H</xref>). Although the exact topology of the T-tubule system in wild-type and in <italic>amph</italic> mutant IFMs remain to be characterized, these results suggest that invasion into and spreading of tracheal cells inside IFMs may not depend on a pre-existing regular membrane invagination system.</p><p>IFM tracheoles are closely associated with mitochondria, thus minimizing the distance for gas exchange via diffusion. While we confirmed this close association by electron and high-resolution confocal microscopy, we found, contrary to an earlier report (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Wigglesworth and Lee, 1982</xref>), no evidence that IFM tracheole endings encircle mitochondria. These earlier observations were based on dye infiltration experiments, which may be prone to artifacts due to leakage of the injected dye used for tracheal staining. Conversely, we discovered mitochondria that were partially enwrapping IFM tracheoles. This is likely due to extensive fusion of mitochondria, resulting in giant sleeve-like mitochondrial geometries around tracheal tubes in IFMs. Intriguingly, this arrangement is reminiscent of the mitochondria that wrap around the axoneme in sperm tails (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Woolley, 1970</xref>). Thus, mitochondrial wrapping may represent a common mechanism to sustain the extensive energy demands of specialized motile cell types such as flight muscle or sperm.</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>MMP1 modulates invasive behavior of IFM tracheal cells</title><p>In addition to the muscle-derived factors discussed above, we show that the matrix metalloproteinase MMP1 is required in IFM tracheal cells for their normal invasive behavior. ECM remodeling is crucial for branching morphogenesis of various organs, and MMPs are the main enzymes that mediate ECM degradation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bonnans et al., 2014</xref>). We showed that while the BM around invading branches is very thin at the beginning of IFM tracheation at 48 hr APF, tracheal branches in adult IFMs are surrounded by abundant, but molecularly heterogeneous, BM along their length. Laminin, but not Perlecan and Collagen IV, is present around branch tips. The presence of this molecularly distinct BM at the invasive branch tips suggests a reduced stiffness and increased distensibility of the BM, which has been observed also in other invading epithelia, including the mammalian salivary gland (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bernfield et al., 1972</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Grobstein and Cohen, 1965</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Harunaga et al., 2014</xref>), mammary gland (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Fata et al., 2004</xref>) and lung (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Moore et al., 2005</xref>). We found that depletion of MMP1 from tracheal cells led to a distinct effect on ECM remodeling. The tips of MMP1-depleted tracheal cells in mature IFMs displayed residual Collagen IV, suggesting that MMP1 is involved in modulating the mechanical properties of the ECM surrounding invading tracheal branch tips by removing CollagenIV-containing ECM. The moderate strength of this effect in MMP1 knock-down animals may be attributable to incomplete RNAi-mediated depletion or genetic redundancy of MMP1 with other matrix-degrading proteases. Furthermore, we cannot rule out that MMP1 might act on other ECM components, besides Collagen IV, that we did not test.</p><p>Since MMP1 has membrane-tethered and secreted isoforms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">LaFever et al., 2017</xref>), MMP1 may execute both cell-autonomous and cell-non-autonomous functions. However, our results based on genetic mosaic analysis suggest that MMP1 acts in a cell-autonomous manner during IFM invasion. This function relies largely on MMP proteolytic activity, as we showed by expressing the MMP activity inhibitor TIMP. These findings raise the question as to which are the relevant substrates of MMP1 activity.</p><p>Historically, MMPs have been mainly associated with ECM remodeling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bonnans et al., 2014</xref>). However, MMPs have broad substrate specificity and can cleave, besides several ECM components, also non-ECM proteins. Directional migration of tracheal cells in the embryo is mediated by the graded distribution of the Bnl FGF chemoattractant, which is expressed locally in small clusters of cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Sutherland et al., 1996</xref>). In case of the developing IFMs, the redirection of FGF secretion from the cell surface to T-tubules explains the switch from superficial to invasive tracheal cell migration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Peterson and Krasnow, 2015</xref>). Yet, it is not clear whether and how an FGF chemotactic gradient could be established along a syncytial muscle to control directional persistence of tracheal cell migration along the IFMs. Since MMP1 is expressed in the air sac primordium (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Wang et al., 2010</xref>), tracheal cell-associated MMP1 might influence the spatial distribution of the FGF chemoattractant by degrading Bnl FGF and thereby generating a local sink of chemoattractant around the invading branches. Localized degradation of the FGF chemoattractant by the migrating branch tips could sustain motility of sprouting branches towards areas with higher concentrations of FGF, even if FGF is initially distributed uniformly on the muscle surface. Although we have not been able to visualize the distribution of endogenous Bnl FGF on pupal IFMs due to the limited sensitivity of the available tools, analogous chemotactic gradients generated by migrating cells have been described in different developmental processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Donà et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Tweedy et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Venkiteswaran et al., 2013</xref>). A regulatory interplay between MMPs and FGFs has been reported to operate also in other contexts of branching morphogenesis. MMP2-expressing tracheal tip cells are part of a lateral inhibition mechanism during larval <italic>Drosophila</italic> air sac development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Wang et al., 2010</xref>). Here, cells at the tip of the air sac primordium receive highest levels of FGF signaling and induce ERK-dependent expression of genes, including <italic>Mmp2</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Wang et al., 2010</xref>). MMP2 mediates release of an inhibitory signal that acts non-autonomously to prevent FGF signaling in neighboring cells and consequently restricts tip cell fate to the MMP2-expressing cells. The nature of the inhibitory signal is still unknown. Interestingly, expression of MMP2 can be induced by FGF2 in mammalian endothelial cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Kohn et al., 1995</xref>). Mammalian MMP2 can also cleave FGFR1 to release a soluble receptor ectodomain fragment, which retains the ability to bind FGF and may influence FGF availability in the vascular BM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Levi et al., 1996</xref>). Together with our results, these findings suggest that MMP proteolytic activity may play conserved roles in different developmental contexts by controlling the invasive behavior of migrating cells through remodeling the properties of the surrounding matrix as well as by regulating growth factor signaling.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th valign="top">Reagent type <break/>(species) <break/>or resource</th><th valign="top">Designation</th><th valign="top">Source or <break/>reference</th><th valign="top">Identifiers</th><th valign="top">Additional <break/>information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td valign="top">Genetic reagent (<italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic>)</td><td valign="top"><italic>mef2-Gal4</italic></td><td valign="top"><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Ranganayakulu et al., 1995</xref> <break/>Dev Biol, 171(1), 169–181</td><td valign="top"/><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Genetic reagent (<italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic>)</td><td valign="top"><italic>btl-Gal4</italic></td><td valign="top"><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Shiga et al., 1996</xref> Development, Growth and Differentation, 38(1), 99–106</td><td valign="top"/><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Genetic reagent (<italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic>)</td><td valign="top"><italic>UAS-palmKate2-K7</italic></td><td valign="top"><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Caviglia et al., 2016</xref> <italic>Nat Cell Biol</italic> 18: 727–739</td><td valign="top"/><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Genetic reagent (<italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic>)</td><td valign="top"><italic>UAS-palm-mNeonGreen</italic></td><td valign="top"><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Sauerwald et al., 2017</xref><italic>Development</italic> 144: 657–663</td><td valign="top"/><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Genetic reagent (<italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic>)</td><td valign="top"><italic>UAS-FRT<sub>FRT&gt;STOP&gt;FRT</sub>-myr::smGFP-HA_V5_FLAG</italic></td><td valign="top"><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Nern et al., 2015</xref> <italic>PNAS</italic> 112: E2967–76</td><td valign="top"/><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Genetic reagent (<italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic>)</td><td valign="top"><italic>y<sup>1</sup> v<sup>1</sup>;;

Combining genetics with high-end imaging of live and fixed samples, and rigorous image analyses the authors provide a detailed description of the invasion process which requires directional migration of trachea inside the myotubes and spreading of the tracheal branches until they fill the myotubes. The authors characterize the dynamic behavior of the growth-cone-like structures at branch tips and the differential composition of the basal membrane along the tracheal branches. They show that Laminin is deposited along the entire tracheal branch while Perlecan and Collagen IV are restricted to the tracheal stalks. They provide causal genetic evidence for the role of MMP1 in the invasion process and implicate MMP1 in the dynamics of growth-cone-like branch tips through the remodeling of the ECM component Collagen IV. Based on the cell culture experiments, the authors propose an additional role for trachea-derived MMP1 in generating a chemoattractant gradient of FGF/Bnl around the migrating tracheal branches. The study provides novel insights into the mechanisms of muscle tracheation, which involves the paradigm of controlled cell invasion and intercellular crosstalk between different tracheal cells and the invaded myotube. The manuscript is well written and understandable, authors present a set of well-conducted, suited, high-quality experiments followed by rigorous data analyses and visualization generating a solid foundation to support the major conclusions of the study.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Although they detected the proximity of the trachea to the muscle mitochondria they could not detect the spectacular wrapping of tracheal projections around these organelles. In this context, it would be interesting for the reader to provide a quantification of the EM analysis.</p><p>2) To investigate the genetic determinants of the muscle-tracheal interactions, the authors performed small scale screen of preselected RNAi strains inactivating genes either in flight muscles or in the trachea. They show that the transcription factor Salm is required in the flight muscle for the attraction and penetration of tracheal cells. Conversely, Bnl signalling and Mmp1 are required in the tracheal cells for proper muscle invasion. They focused on the genetic analysis of Mmp1 in the process and they convincingly showed that Mmp activity is required for ECM remodelling. Interestingly collagen was the major target of Mmp1, compared to other ECM components like perlecan or laminin. The genetic analysis of Mmp1 inactivation suggested that additional roles for Mmp1 apart from the degradation of collagen. The authors tried to investigate the possibility that Bnl could be a proteolytic substrate of Mmp1. They overexpressed combinations of Bnl, Btl, and Mmp1 in S2 cells and detected Bnl and Mmp1 in the cellular extracts (or in culture medium?). They show a Western blot where they detect reduced Bnl when Mmp1 is coexpressed and conclude that Mmp1 cleaves and degrades Bnl. This experiment is poorly controlled and not necessary in the context of this work.

We carefully revisited our set of TEM data. In no case did we observe wrapping of tracheoles around mitochondria. To our knowledge, such wrapping has previously been reported only in studies based on dye infiltration experiments, which are prone to artifacts. However, in adult IFMs we found many cases of tracheoles that appeared to be partially enwrapped by large sleeve-like mitochondria. This is likely to be explained by the dramatic increase in mitochondrial size during late-pupal IFM development, which is accompanied by extensive fusion of mitochondria, giving rise to giant sleeve-like mitochondria around tracheal tubes. To support this point, we revisited our TEM images of IFM cross-sections at 32h h APF, 48 h APF and in adults, and analyzed the size of mitochondria and tracheal lumina. The cross-sectional area of mitochondria increased with developmental time, most dramatically between 48 h APF and adulthood, lending support to our hypothesis that growth and/or fusion of mitochondria results in enwrapping of tracheoles. We show the quantification of the EM data in a new panel (I) added to the figure supplement to Figure 2 (Figure 2—figure supplement 1I).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) To investigate the genetic determinants of the muscle-tracheal interactions, the authors performed small scale screen of preselected RNAi strains inactivating genes either in flight muscles or in the trachea.

We detected Bnl and Mmp1 proteins from cellular extracts as well as from the culture medium, indicating that both proteins were secreted by the cells. However, the experiment in Figure 6 shows an immunoblot of cellular extracts only. To address the specificity of Mmp1 activity towards Bnl as a possible proteolytic substrate, we tried to detect as an additional potential substrate the FGF receptor Breathless (Btl), but we were unable to obtain specific signals using an available rabbit anti-Btl antiserum.</p><p>To validate the results from the tissue culture experiments in vivo, we made extensive efforts to visualize the endogenous Bnl protein in IFMs. However, using the available reagents (anti-Bnl antiserum, flies expressing GFP-tagged Bnl from the endogenous <italic>bnl</italic> locus), we were unable to detect the Bnl protein in whole-mount preparations of pupal or adult flies. Given these results, we agree with the reviewer´s statement that the cell culture experiments do not contribute to the main conclusions of the paper. We therefore decided to remove the section describing these results, along with Figure 6, from the manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) The study refers too many times to &quot;data not shown&quot;.

We removed the reference to the number of tracheoles in <italic>amph</italic> mutants and the statement “data not shown”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) Did authors try to assess the MMP1 levels along the branches? Could the differential distribution of MMP1 support their proposed role for MMP1 in generating the Bnl gradient?</p></disp-quote><p>We tried hard to assess the distribution of Mmp1 protein using three different anti-Mmp1 monoclonal antibodies (3B8, 3A6, 5H7; Page-McCaw et al., 2003). However, although we tested various different fixation protocols (paraformaldehyde, glutaraldehyde, Bouin´s fixative), we were not able to obtain specific signals with these antibodies in immunostainings of whole-mount preparations of pupal or adult IFMs.</p><p>We also made considerable efforts to generate an endogenously tagged version of Mmp1. We inserted a V5 epitope tag into the MMP1 hinge region by targeting the endogenous <italic>mmp1</italic> locus using CRISPR-mediated genome editing. However, while V5-tagged Mmp1 protein was detectable in protein extracts by immunoblot, no specific signal was visible in anti-V5 immunostainings of whole-mount preparations of pupal or adult IFMs. We therefore did not include these results in the manuscript.</p><p>Moreover, we also analyzed flies carrying a genomic fosmid clone in which MMP1 has been fused at its C-terminus to superfolder GFP and FLAG, TY1, and V5 epitope tags (fTRG145; Sarov et al., 2016; VDRC). Although we were unable to detect MMP1-GFP signals in living specimens, we detected specific signals in whole-mount preparations stained with an anti-GFP antibody. Discrete MMP1-GFP staining was visible on the IFM-associated tracheal air sac epithelium and along tracheal branches inside IFM myotubes, consistent with our finding that MMP1 is required for normal invasive behavior of tracheal branches inside IFM myotubes. We describe these findings in the text (subsection “MMP1 is required in tracheal cells for invasion into myotubes”) and show the data in a new supplementary figure (Figure 4—figure supplement 1).</p><p>Addressing the reviewer’s question regarding the role of MMP1 in generating a Bnl gradient in IFMs, we tried extensively to detect Bnl FGF in situ, either in fixed specimens using anti-Bnl antibodies or in living pupal or adult specimens expressing a GFP-tagged knock-in allele of <italic>bnl</italic> (Du L, Sohr A, Yan G and Roy S (2018) Feedback regulation of cytoneme-mediated transport shapes a tissue-specific FGF morphogen gradient. <italic>eLife</italic> 7). However, neither of these approaches revealed specific signals in pupal or adult IFMs. Thus, based on these results we cannot provide more direct evidence for a role of MMP1 in modifying the distribution of Bnl FGF in developing IFMs.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) Is MMP1-induced Bnl degradation in the cell culture system associated with reduced downstream signaling?</p></disp-quote><p>To test whether signaling downstream of Bnl is reduced upon MMP1-induced degradation of Bnl we analyzed MAPK activation by detecting dpERK on immunoblots (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig1">Author response image 1</xref>). This did not reveal clear changes in dpERK levels between cells transfected with MMP1 and control cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig1">Author response image 1</xref>; compare lanes 3 and 4). Given these results, we agree with the reviewer´s statement that the cell culture experiments do not contribute to the main conclusions of the paper.
