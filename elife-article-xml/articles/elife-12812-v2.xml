ultra-high field 7 Tesla (7T) functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), we map the cortical and perceptual responses elicited by intraneural microstimulation (INMS) of single mechanoreceptive afferent units in the median nerve, in humans. Activations are compared to those produced by applying vibrotactile stimulation to the unit’s receptive field, and unit-type perceptual reports are analyzed. We show that INMS and vibrotactile stimulation engage overlapping areas within the topographically appropriate digit representation in the primary somatosensory cortex. Additional brain regions in bilateral secondary somatosensory cortex, premotor cortex, primary motor cortex, insula and posterior parietal cortex, as well as in contralateral prefrontal cortex are also shown to be activated in response to INMS. The combination of INMS and 7T fMRI opens up an unprecedented opportunity to bridge the gap between first-order mechanoreceptive afferent input codes and their spatial, dynamic and perceptual representations in human cortex.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.12812.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.12812.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.12812.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>The skin contains multiple types of sensory nerves that inform the brain about events occurring on the surface of the body. One way to study how this process works is to insert a very fine needle through the skin to stimulate a single sensory nerve with a small electrical current. This technique – known as intraneural microstimulation – can activate touch responses in the brain without an object actually contacting the skin.</p><p>Another technique called functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) has been used to measure brain activity. These studies have revealed that when objects come into contact with the skin of the fingers, they stimulate several sensory nerves at the same time, which results in brain activity in a region called the somatosensory cortex.</p><p>Sanchez Panchuelo, Ackerley et al. combined fMRI and intraneural microstimulation to map brain activity in response to the activation of individual sensory nerves in the fingers of human volunteers. The experiments show that intraneural stimulation activates many areas of the brain that are also activated by mechanical contact.

Penfield and Boldrey (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Penfield &amp; Boldrey 1937</xref>) derived the first maps of the somatotopic human body representation in S1 using electrical stimulation of the cortical surface. Somatosensory research in humans has involved using psychophysical (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Klatzky et al., 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Gescheider et al., 2002</xref>), microneurographic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Vallbo &amp; Johansson 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Johansson &amp; Vallbo 1983</xref>), and neuroimaging (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">McGlone et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Martuzzi et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Servos et al., 2001</xref>) techniques to study different stages and levels of detail in somatosensory function. Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) has been used extensively for the non-invasive study of the somatosensory cortices in humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Nelson and Chen, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">McGlone et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Sanchez-Panchuelo et al., 2010</xref>). Most fMRI studies have investigated the spatial pattern of cortical activation in response to vibrotactile (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Francis et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Sanchez-Panchuelo et al., 2010</xref>) or pneumatic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Huang and Sereno, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Overduin and Servos, 2008</xref>) mechanical stimulation of the digits, or to electrical stimulation of the skin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Blankenburg et al., 2003</xref>) or median nerve (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Kampe et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Ferretti et al., 2007</xref>). These approaches excite large populations of different classes of mechanoreceptive afferents resulting in relatively diffuse activations in contralateral S1 and bilateral secondary somatosensory cortex (S2).</p><p>Microneurography provides a method to record the spike discharge activity of a single mechanoreceptive afferent in conscious humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Vallbo and Hagbarth, 1968</xref>) to determine its response to skin contact and the properties of its receptive field, i.e. location, size, and shape. In this manner, mechanoreceptive afferents innervating the glabrous skin of the hand can be categorized into one of four types: fast-adapting type 1 (FA1), fast-adapting type 2 (FA2), slowly-adapting type 1 (SA1), and slowly-adapting type 2 (SA2) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Vallbo and Johansson, 1984</xref>). In intraneural microstimulation (INMS), single mechanoreceptive afferents are selectively activated by passing a small (1–7 μA) current through the recording microelectrode, thus evoking a quantal sensation in the projected sensory field, which matches the physiological qualities of the recorded mechanoreceptive afferent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Torebjörk et al., 1987</xref>). Microstimulation of an FA1 afferent evokes a well-defined, local sensation of ‘flutter’ or ‘buzzing’, while microstimulation of an SA1 afferent evokes a sensation of continuous pressure or inward pulling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Vallbo et al., 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Ochoa and Torebjörk, 1983</xref>). Microstimulation of an FA2 afferent evokes a diffuse sensation of vibration over a larger area, whereas microstimulation of an SA2 afferent does not produce a consistent, conscious sensory experience (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Vallbo et al., 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Ochoa and Torebjörk, 1983</xref>).</p><p>It has been shown in a small number of previous studies that INMS of single mechanoreceptive afferents can be combined with noninvasive imaging methods to advance our understanding of the effects of mechanoreceptive afferent activity in somatosensory cortices. For example, INMS of FA1 and SA1 afferents in the median nerve produces frequency-following electroencephalography responses within contralateral S1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Kelly et al., 1997</xref>). The single previous study combining INMS with fMRI (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Trulsson et al., 2001</xref>), using a 3 T scanner and a surface coil positioned over the parietal lobe contralateral to the site of stimulation, showed that INMS of FA1 and SA1 afferents induced activity in S1 and S2, which overlapped with regions activated by applying mechanical vibration to the relevant units’ receptive fields. However, a detailed characterization of the specificity of single unit INMS activations within the representation of the digits in S1 has yet to be performed.</p><p>Several studies have previously assessed the cortical response to vibrotactile stimulation of the glabrous skin of the human hand, and shown that this evokes a hemodynamic response in multiple primary and secondary cortical areas, including contralateral S1, bilateral S2, primary motor cortex (M1), supplementary motor area (SMA), cingulate cortex, posterior parietal cortex (PPC), and insula cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">McGlone et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Trulsson et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Gelnar et al., 1998</xref>). Ultra-high field (7T) fMRI has also recently been used in conjunction with vibrotactile stimulation to map individual digit representations and resolve the fine, within-digit organization (base-to-tip), thus revealing functional subdivisions of areas in S1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Sanchez-Panchuelo et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Sanchez-Panchuelo et al., 2012</xref>). Compared to lower field measurements, 7T fMRI provides greatly increased sensitivity and blood-oxygenation level dependent (BOLD) signal contrast, coupled with improved intrinsic spatial specificity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Gati et al., 1997</xref>). Here, we used 7T fMRI to resolve whole-brain cortical activation patterns evoked by INMS of single mechanoreceptive afferent units in the glabrous skin of the hand, and to assess the precise spatial localization of INMS-evoked BOLD responses in contralateral S1, in comparison to activation due to mechanical vibrotactile stimulation.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>A total of 33 mechanoreceptive afferents were found (17 FA1, 14 SA1, 1 FA2 and 1 SA2) in 4 participants during 10 experimental sessions. We focused our study on the cortical response to stimulation of type 1 afferents (FA1 and SA1), as these units are far more numerous in the volar hand than type 2 units (FA2 and SA2) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Vallbo and Johansson, 1984</xref>). Example recordings from FA1 and SA1 units are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1a and b</xref> respectively, demonstrating that good quality signals can be recorded from single mechanoreceptive afferents in the environment of a 7T magnetic resonance scanner.

Occasionally, participants reported that the sensation evoked by the INMS stopped, likely due to a minor dislodgement of the microelectrode. This occurred for U7 where a projected sensation was perceived prior to scanning, but no sensation was felt during the fMRI run. For some units, the sensation was weak (U2, U3; possibly due to difficulty in attending to the stimulus sensation when inside the scanner), or lost during the fMRI run (U5, U6, U8). We compared the location of fMRI responses of all perceived INMS units in contralateral S1 with the digit representation obtained from both vibrotactile stimulation of the microstimulated unit’s receptive field and the fMRI somatotopy maps formed from the traveling-wave (phase-encoding) vibrotactile paradigm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). We found that fMRI responses to INMS of single units (all except for U1; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>) were spatially localized within the relevant S1 digit representation identified from vibrotactile stimulation. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2a</xref> shows example maps of digit somatotopy defined from the vibrotactile traveling-wave paradigm for Participant 4 in the right and left hemispheres (left and right of the figure, respectively). <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2b</xref> shows the BOLD response to INMS of U11 (right) and U9 (left) for Participant 4.

This was achieved through the combined usage of two techniques: intra-neural microstimulation (INMS), to stimulate single mechanoreceptive afferents, and 7T fMRI, to map the cortex with superior spatial resolution. This work also shows that activity generated by stimulation of a single mechanoreceptive afferent can be perceptually characterized and produces a network of cortical responses.</p><p>Only one previous study has combined single unit INMS with fMRI, at 3T (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Trulsson et al., 2001</xref>), but this was only able to resolve activation in contralateral S1 and S2 as the use of a surface coil limited the spatial extent of activation maps. The greater signal-to-noise ratio and improved BOLD contrast afforded by 7T fMRI allowed us to improve the spatial resolution, with a reduction in the voxel volume by a factor of 6 compared to previous work at 3T (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Trulsson et al., 2001</xref>). We have exploited the improved spatial resolution to provide a detailed characterization of the location and extent of the cortical network involved in encoding inputs from single mechanoreceptive afferents, as well as in comparing these responses to somatotopical maps created from vibrotactile skin stimulation.</p><p>Measurements of cortical activity elicited by INMS demonstrated that when a singular, quantal touch from the stimulation of a single mechanoreceptive afferent is consciously felt, a precise area in contralateral S1 is active. The response in S1 was well-localized within the expected region, identified from maps of digit somatotopy obtained from vibrotactile stimulation of the fingertips. The extent of the S1 responses to INMS was less than that elicited by vibrotactile stimulation to the unit’s receptive field, although the response produced by single unit INMS was relatively extensive, considering that vibrotactile stimulation simultaneously engages a large number of afferents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Johansson and Vallbo, 1979</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Vallbo and Johansson, 1984</xref>).</p><p>Robust responses were found within the expected digital cortical area for all perceived microstimulated afferents (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">3</xref>), except for U1, for which no significant responses were found, in either contralateral or ipsilateral S1, despite the fact that the participant exhibited a complete somatotopic map of the digits in both hemispheres and reported feeling the sensation throughout INMS. To explore this finding further, we used the delineation of digit 2 from the somatotopic map obtained with the vibrotactile traveling-wave paradigm to inspect the time series of S1 responses evoked by INMS for U1 (located on the palm below digit 2). We also interrogated the BOLD response produced in contralateral S1 when vibrotactile stimulation was applied to the receptive fields of U1. In S1, we found negative BOLD responses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>) for both INMS and vibrotactile stimulation applied to the receptive field of the INMS. The negative BOLD response in this subject is possibly due to a steal effect from the nearby vasculature draining from the active cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bianciardi et al., 2011</xref>) since draining venous regions are highly modulated by block paradigms with periods of 'on’ and ‘off’ stimulation, as used to study the response to INMS and vibrotactile stimulation of the receptive field. In contrast, using the traveling-wave paradigm a complete map of the digits in S1 is seen. This is expected, as we have previously shown that a traveling-wave design is insensitive to the non-specific BOLD contributions from large veins that drain blood from across the whole hand representation in S1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Uğurbil et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Besle et al., 2013</xref>), thus suppressing the venous signal modulations found in the block INMS/vibrotactile stimulation data. In order to estimate the spatial spread of INMS BOLD responses to neighboring digits, we show that, at the group level, the z-score, proportion of active voxels and GLM parameter estimates are significantly higher (p&lt;0.01) in the stimulated ROI than in the neighboring digits (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). These results are in-line with our previous findings reported for vibrotactile stimulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Besle et al.,2013</xref>).</p><p>The network of cortical areas activated by both INMS of single mechanoreceptive afferents and mechanical vibrotactile stimulation of the units’ receptive field, included somatosensory areas such as S1, S2, and PIC, as well as areas involved in motor control, including M1, SMA and PMC. Although M1 has previously been shown to be activated by tactile input (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Francis et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Ackerley et al., 2012</xref>), we cannot exclude the possibility that the M1 activation observed in this study may originate from spatial blurring of somatosensory activation (given that M1 and S1 are located on opposite banks of the central sulcus). When comparing responses to INMS and vibrotactile stimulation applied to the afferents’ receptive fields, INMS activated a number of additional areas, specifically the AIC, PPC and PFC. Exploration of the INMS BOLD time series for these areas (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5b</xref>) suggests that the activity in these areas is locked to the S1/S2 activity and is not due to anticipation. Both insula and parietal cortices have been shown to contribute to the perception of touch (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Preusser et al., 2014</xref>), and a previous study of tactile attention (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Burton et al., 2008</xref>) has shown that a fronto-parietal network, which includes PFC and PPC, is involved in attention. Although identical paradigm timings were used for INMS and vibrotactile stimulation in order to compare the spatial localization of the BOLD response, there were differences in the attentional focus between the INMS and vibrotactile tasks. During the INMS fMRI runs, participants were aware that perception might be lost and hence had to concentrate on the stimulus and report any lack of sensation at the end of the run. In contrast, the vibrotactile stimulus was delivered at a suprathreshold level and participants did not have to monitor that the sensation was still present during the vibrotactile fMRI run. Hence, the increased activity in AIC, PFC and PPC observed in the present study may reflect the increased attentional effects (i.e., baseline or gain effects on evoked responses) during the INMS protocol compared to vibrotactile stimulation. However, this is a preliminary finding and requires further investigation with larger sample sizes and more quantitative analysis to be corroborated.</p><p>The capability of combining INMS with 7T fMRI has the following theoretical implications for human somatosensory research. Although the notion that peripheral input from the skin is represented directly by four cytoarchitectonic areas (BA 3a, 3b, 1 and 2) in S1, each containing an orderly somatotopic map of the body surface has been supported by findings from animal studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Kaas et al., 1979</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Paul et al., 1972</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Favorov et al., 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Tommerdahl et al., 2010</xref>) and 7T fMRI in humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Sanchez-Panchuelo et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Sanchez-Panchuelo et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Martuzzi et al., 2014</xref>), a simple point-to-point topographical correspondence between skin surface and cortical representation does not hold. In reality, there is integration and processing through axonal synapsing in the dorsal column nuclei and thalamus prior to mechanoreceptive information entering the cerebral cortex. There appears to be a preserved transmission from single, mechanoreceptive second-order neurons in the dorsal column (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Vickery et al., 1994</xref>). At the level of the thalamus, an axon of a single ventral posterolateral nucleus terminates over a fairly wide, roughly 0.5 mm, cortical territory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Rausell and Jones, 1995</xref>), where many individual thalamocortical axons spread out in discrete patches over several millimeters of S1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Landry et al., 1987</xref>). This spread corresponds well with our finding that the cortical activation from a single mechanoreceptive afferent extends over an area that is not dissimilar to the area activated by input from many afferents through point-vibrotactile stimulation. Also, neurons in S1 cortical columns have extensive lateral excitatory connections, not only with neighboring neurons, but also with neurons several millimeters away in the same cortical area (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Burton and Fabri, 1995</xref>). We have shown that single unit INMS produces bilateral somatosensory activation, as well as influencing motor areas and cognitive networks (e.g. PPC, PFC). Such a wide spreading of stimulus-evoked activity has been clearly documented in microelectrode recording studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Reed et al., 2010</xref>). Overall, the spatiotemporal pattern of S1 response to vibrotactile stimulation is far from simple and its functional significance remains to be unraveled.</p><p>Translational insights from in vivo neurophysiological studies in non-human primates have driven much of the theoretical understanding of cortical mechanisms that govern human tactile perception, but operative procedures, especially those which alter the neurochemistry of cortical synaptic transmission (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Masamoto et al., 2009</xref>), may confound relating such findings to normal functioning of the human brain. This demonstration of the feasibility of combining INMS with 7T fMRI opens up the possibility of a range of further neuroimaging studies that will allow interrogation of the precise anatomical and physiological properties of the fundamental encoding of touch. These include systematic investigation of the sub-cortical (e.g. thalamic) responses and laminar-specific cortical responses to INMS of different mechanoreceptive afferent classes using a variety of electrical stimulation patterns.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><p>Ten experimental sessions were conducted on four right-handed participants (30–64 years, 2 male). Procedures were approved by the University of Nottingham Medical School Ethics Committee and all participants gave full, written, informed consent. Due to the precision needed in performing INMS within the magnetic resonance scanner, participants were required to lie extremely still and feel relaxed; all participants were accustomed to the fMRI environment (two participants had participated in INMS experiments previously). Each experimental session involved three steps: (1) microneurography for the characterization of a single mechanoreceptive afferent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Vallbo and Hagbarth, 1968</xref>); (2) assessment of the sensation to INMS; (3) concurrent INMS and fMRI.

Survey, reference and B<sub>0</sub>-map scans were acquired, and an image-based shimming approach (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Sanchez-Panchuelo et al., 2010</xref>) used to minimize magnetic field inhomogeneity, with the optimized shim currents remaining fixed throughout the subsequent fMRI runs. The participant was moved out of the bore of the magnet to perform Steps (1) and (2).</p><sec id="s4-1"><title>Microneurography</title><p>In Step 1, the median nerve was accessed at the wrist in order to isolate single axonal responses from mechanoreceptive afferents in the volar hand, on which to perform INMS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Trulsson et al., 2001</xref>). A high-impedance (~300–500 kΩ), insulated, tungsten recording/stimulating electrode (15 mm length, shaft diameter 0.2 mm, tip diameter ~5 µm; FHC, Bowdoin, ME) was inserted percutaneously into the skin, ~3 cm from the wrist fold between the flexor carpi radialis and the flexor palmaris longus tendons. An uninsulated reference electrode was inserted subcutaneously 3–5 cm away, on the ulnar side of the recording/stimulating electrode, and a ground electrode was attached further up the participant’s arm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). The recording/stimulating electrode was advanced into the median nerve, which was located 0.3–1 cm below the skin surface. The preamplifier was taped to the participant’s arm, and the acquisition hardware and stimulator were located at the outer edge of the scanner room (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). Differential responses were amplified (x10,000) using a preamplifier (NeuroAmpEX; ADInstruments, Castle Hill, Australia), band-pass filtered (0.3–5 kHz) and sampled at 10 kHz using PowerLab hardware and LabChart 7 software (ADInstruments, Castle Hill, Australia).<fig id="fig6" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.12812.015</object-id><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><title>Figure of the experimental setup.</title><p>The PowerLab, NeuroAmp EX and ML180 stimulator were placed just inside the magnet room at a field strength not exceeding 5 mT. Placement of the interface equipment within the magnet room was preferred for safety reasons, as isolated cables connected to the participant did not then pass into the control room. The USB interface and trigger cables were passed through the radio frequency shield via a waveguide aperture. An amplifier and loudspeaker was driven from the NeuroAmp EX audio output to give audio feedback to the microneurographer. In addition, a projection of the computer screen could be viewed for visual confirmation of nerve signals. A switch was used to connect the electrodes to either the stimulator or the NeuroAmp head-stage pre-amplifier. In addition, a resistive shunt was placed across the stimulation leads to remove any build-up of charge before connecting or disconnecting the stimulator. Disconnection of the stimulator was necessary because of the high level of noise introduced when it was connected. Star-quad cable was used within the magnet environment to reduce the likelihood of induced currents due to scanner operation affecting the stimulus presentation.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.12812.015">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.12812.015</ext-link></p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="x-tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-12812-fig6-v2"/></fig></p><p>The microneurographer delivered light, stroking touch to the palm to evoke activity in low-threshold mechanoreceptive afferents. A loudspeaker in the scanner room allowed the microneurographer to hear the nerve activity and a projector displayed the recording onto the scanner exterior for visual inspection. The microneurographer systematically searched for the nerve until modulations of the signal from the electrode corresponded to mass activity from mechanoreceptive afferents as a result of touch were heard. Using fine adjustments, the electrode was manipulated within the nerve to an intra-fascicular location and single units were searched for by stroking the participant’s hand.</p><p>Single mechanoreceptive afferents were characterized by their audio and visual signals, and the extent of the receptive field of each afferent was explored using a wooden stick. The location of the receptive field was mapped using von Frey monofilaments and the minimal force required for mechanoreceptor activation noted. Afferents were identified as being myelinated Aβ mechanoreceptors, namely FA1, SA1, FA2 or SA2 afferents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Vallbo and Johansson, 1984</xref>). The middle of the receptive field was marked on the skin. Recordings of individual mechanoreceptive afferents in response to mechanical stimulation were made (e.g. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a,b</xref>) and analyzed in MATLAB (The Mathworks; Natick, MA). Data were preprocessed to verify the single-unit nature of all recorded mechanoreceptive afferents with an offline pattern-matching algorithm.</p></sec><sec id="s4-2"><title>Single unit INMS</title><p>Once a single mechanoreceptive afferent was identified, INMS was carried out to ascertain the sensation produced by a low-current electrical pulse sequence (Step 2). Trains of 30 Hz pulses (200 µs, positive, square-wave pulses over 0.5 s) were delivered (via Stimulus Isolator; ADInstruments, Castle Hill, Australia and controlled using the LabChart 7 software). The experimenter delivered 2–3 pulse sequences, while the current was increased slowly from 0 µA, in 1 µA steps, until the participant felt a sensation. Once a clear sensation was felt, the precise location of the sensation and its quality were recorded and tested to confirm whether the previously mapped receptive field spatially aligned with that perceived by the participant during INMS. This was done by a process of questioning the participant to determine whether mechanical touch to the receptive field matched the projected sensory field sensation during INMS to within ~1 mm. If so, it was deemed that microstimulation was being applied to the afferent from which recordings had been made. If the participant felt a clear small, point-sensation in the projected sensory field that did not align with the mapped receptive field, the stimulated unit was nevertheless explored. These units were included if the perceived sensation (e.g. pressure from an SA1) was similar in quality to those in matched physiology-INMS trials (e.g. perceived size, shape, sensation) (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>). The stimulating current intensity which generated a sensation was recorded, along with the stimulation currents delivered during each fMRI run. INMS of a stable, single mechanoreceptive afferent could be carried out successfully for up to ~45 min, although Step 3 was completed successfully for only a subset of mechanoreceptive afferents (see Results).</p></sec><sec id="s4-3"><title>fMRI paradigm</title><p>Each fMRI run consisted of a block paradigm, comprising 8 cycles of alternating periods of 8 s INMS followed by 23 s rest (acquisition time ~4 mins). The 8 s INMS period consisted of 0.5 s burst of stimulation (30 Hz pulse frequency; 200 μs pulse width) each second. For each afferent, 1–3 fMRI repeats of the INMS paradigm were conducted. In some cases, the stimulation current was adjusted between runs, e.g. due to loss of perception (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Vallbo et al., 1984</xref>), to ensure a clear and stable sensation. If the INMS-induced sensation remained stable, other parameters were also tested, including changing the stimulation frequency to 60 Hz, and increasing the stimulation current to investigate the effect of recruiting further mechanoreceptive afferents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Vallbo et al., 1984</xref>).</p><p>After Steps 1–3, fMRI of mechanical vibrotactile stimulation at each microstimulated afferent’s receptive field was carried out with identical timings to the INMS paradigm. Vibrotactile stimuli were delivered at 30 Hz to ~1 mm<sup>2</sup> of the skin using a piezo-electric device (Dancer Design, St-Helens, UK). In addition, the digit tips of each participant’s left hand (and right hand for participant 4) were stimulated with 5 independently-controlled piezo-electric devices using a traveling-wave or phase-encoding paradigm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Sanchez-Panchuelo et al., 2010</xref>), analogous to that used in retinotopic mapping, in which each individual digit of the hand is sequentially stimulated to create a travelling wave of activity across cortical regions containing a somatotopic map of the hand. Vibrotactile stimulation at 30 Hz was delivered to each digit tip in periods of 4 s (intermittent stimulation with 0. 1 s gap every 0.5 s), over a 20 s cycle.

To address the key aims, three analyses were performed:</p><sec id="s4-5-1"><title>Cortical responses to single unit INMS and vibrotactile stimulation in S1</title><p>The spatial localization of microstimulated afferents in S1 was compared with digit somatotopic maps formed for each participant using a traveling-wave paradigm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Sanchez-Panchuelo et al., 2010</xref>). The somatotopic map was used to define ROIs specific to each of the 5 digits of the hand, these were subsequently used as independent ROIs to allow group-level inference tests to be conducted (as performed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Besle, 2013</xref>). Here, data were not spatially smoothed in order to retain high spatial resolution. Both the INMS data, and data acquired during vibrotactile stimulation applied to the skin location where each afferent was perceived, were analyzed using a general linear model (GLM) employing a canonical HRF model and its orthogonalized temporal derivative. FDR adjustment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Benjamini and Hochberg﻿ 1995</xref>) was performed using an adaptive step-up method (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Benjamini et al., 2006</xref>). All adjusted P-values were converted to quantiles of standard normal distribution (Z-score). Analysis was restricted to voxels identified using the traveling-wave localizer (dilated by 5 voxels to ensure complete coverage of the S1 hand area) to reduce the number of inference tests on both the INMS and vibrotactile stimulation data to compute FDR corrected Z-scores. We investigated the spread of INMS induced activations, and vibrotactile stimulation to each unit’s receptive field, by computing the mean Z-score, proportion of active voxels, and GLM parameter estimates in each digit ROI. Subsequently, to quantify spread of responses into neighboring digits at the group-level, INMS and vibrotactile responses for the ROI corresponding to the stimulated digit were combined, by averaging the mean Z-score, proportion of active voxels, and GLM parameter estimates (N=7 units; 3 Digit 1 ROIs, 2 Digit 3 ROIs, 2 Digit 4 ROIs). This procedure was then repeated for the 1<sup>st</sup> degree (N = 11), 2<sup>nd</sup> degree (N = 9), 3<sup>rd</sup> degree (N = 5) and 4<sup>th</sup> degree (N = 3) neighboring digit ROIs. A one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) tests was then performed on this data, and post-hoc multiple pairwise comparison, adjusted for multiple comparisons using Bonferroni correction.</p><p>For those units for which the stimulus sensation was lost during the fMRI run, a further GLM analysis was run which included a regressor of linear parametric modulation in time, and the associated parameter estimates were assessed.</p><p>Functional statistical maps from each microstimulated afferent and the traveling-wave localizer were rendered onto flattened representations of the central sulcus obtained using the mrFlatMesh algorithm (VISTA software, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://white.stanford.edu/software/">http://white.stanford.edu/software/</ext-link>) based on cortical segmentations from the whole head T<sub>1</sub>-weighted anatomical data obtained using Freesurfer (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://surfer.nmr.mgh.harvard.edu/">http://surfer.nmr.mgh.harvard.edu/</ext-link>). Having aligned functional data to the participant’s whole head T<sub>1</sub>-weighted anatomical reference volume (see <italic>Alignment of functional data</italic>), statistical maps were transformed to flattened space using linear interpolation and displayed at the central cortical depth.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5-2"><title>Whole brain analysis</title><p>This was performed to compare those brain areas responding to INMS of a single mechanoreceptive afferent with those responding to vibrotactile stimulation. Data were spatially smoothed with a Gaussian FWHM 3 mm and a second GLM analysis was performed on the whole volume for both the INMS data and the vibrotactile stimulation data to the unit’s receptive fields. The resulting Z-score statistical maps were threshold at Z&lt;3.08 after FDR-adjustment and cluster-correction (p&lt;0.01) to visualize activation maps and to compute binary masks for each stimulated mechanoreceptive unit (and for corresponding vibrotactile stimulation to each unit’s receptive field).</p><p>Functional statistical maps from all five single FA1 afferents of the left hand stimulated during INMS at 30 Hz (U1, U4, U6, U8, and U11) were projected onto standard MNI space to identify active brain areas from probabilistic brain atlases (Harvard-Oxford cortical structure and Talairach Daemon labels, in FSL). Functional maps were transformed into the participant’s whole head anatomical reference volume (see <italic>Alignment of functional data</italic>). The whole-head anatomical T<sub>1</sub>-weighted MPRAGE from each participant was aligned to a standard T<sub>1</sub>-weighted MNI template using first an affine FLIRT registration, followed by a FNIRT non-linear registration algorithm (FSL, FNIRT). This alignment was then applied to the statistical maps from the participant’s INMS unit to warp the data into standard MNI space. A map was computed of the intersection of responses to all five FA1 afferents, from which to define significant regions of interest (ROIs). These ROIs were transformed to native EPI space for each individual afferent and the beta values, Z-scores and number of active voxels were interrogated for each significant ROI, in each afferent’s native space. Similarly, the corresponding BOLD maps resulting from vibrotactile stimulation applied to the skin location where each afferent was perceived were transformed into MNI space and identical analyses performed.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5-3"><title>Alignment of functional data to participant’s whole head anatomical reference volume</title><p>Statistical maps were moved from functional acquisition space into whole-head anatomical T<sub>1</sub>-weighted space for detailed comparison with digit somatotopy in flattened reconstructions of the cortical space and for combination in standard MNI space (see <italic>Whole brain analysis</italic>). We estimated the alignment between the (distorted) reference EPI volume from the motion correction and the undistorted T<sub>2</sub><sup>*</sup>-weighted anatomical volume using FNIRT. Functional maps were non-linearly transformed into structural T<sub>2</sub><sup>*</sup>-weighted volume space using FNIRT’s ‘applywarp' and then linearly transformed from the structural T<sub>2</sub><sup>*</sup>-weighted to whole-head T<sub>1</sub>-weighted volume space. Note that this registration was only used for the display of statistical maps; all statistical analyses of functional data were performed in native EPI space.</p></sec></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>Funding: Pain Relief Foundation grant, Medical Research Council, Vetenskapsrådet (Swedish Research Council), Royal Society International Exchanges scheme.

Your article has been favorably evaluated by Jody Culham (Senior editor) and three reviewers, one of whom, Eilon Vaadia, is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors.</p><p>The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Karl Friston (peer reviewer).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>The authors demonstrate a system that provides high resolution of monitoring cortical activity in response to localized activation of single mechanoreceptors in humans. The combination of 7-T field imaging, INMS and tactile stimulation provides a very impressive methodological advance, by demonstrating the feasibility of microneurography and fMRI and validating the approach against conventional tactile stimulation. The report establishes a nice correspondence between responses to microstimulation in S1, S2 and equivalent afferent input produced by somatosensory (vibrotactile) simulation. The nice thing about this correspondence is that the afferent input is carefully characterized using microneurography prior to scanning. The microneurography and MRI physics in this study are superb.</p><p>However, as noted at the initial submission stage, given methodological strengths and limited theoretical advances, the paper was viewed as more appropriate for the &quot;Tools and Resources&quot; format at <italic>eLife</italic>, which should provide clear and transparent descriptions of the technological advance and demonstrate that it works. This view was further reinforced by the external reviewers, who also thought that the paper's theoretical advances were too limited for a Research Article format.</p><p>The comments below address the required revisions of the manuscript as a &quot;Tools and Resources&quot; article. Most importantly, the strongest advance of the present work over past work from your group is the validation of the INMS technique compared to mechanical stimulation; however, at present, these comparisons are largely qualitative and need more robust statistical validation. The extension to 7-T scanning and the recruitment of a broader range of brain areas are interesting, but in consideration of potential confounds that could drive these areas, the arguments need some tempering.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Data Analysis</p><p>A) SI topographic specificity: Further characterization of the specificity of the INMS activation within the digit maps is lacking and at present the manuscript relies too heavily on example data (e.g., <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>) that, while compelling, do not convey how reliable the effects were. How consistent was the correspondence between the digit map finger-selectivity and the INMS activity across units? For example, did all units show topographically appropriate activity in SI? How much did the activity &quot;leak&quot; to other finger representations? Statistical quantification can improve the validity of the major findings. Given that the authors are arguing that the somatosensory representation of the two stimuli (INMS and vibrotactile) was similar, a direct comparison between the two modalities, and a contrast between two different locations within each modality seems more suitable to support this point. That said, as the stimulation used to construct the digit maps was on the fingertips, and the receptive fields (RFs) of the units were often more medial, I'm not sure the observed overlap is sensible. This warrants further consideration.</p><p>B) Although the results are sufficient to provide a description of the induced BOLD responses – and the correspondence between microstimulation and vibrotactile stimulation, the authors could have finessed the analysis in a number of ways. For example, if subjects reported the perceptual intensity changed during the fMRI scanning, it would have been better to perform a parametric analysis; testing for the effects of perception on induced responses. In other words, instead of simply showing that the activations in a particular subject reduced when they ceased to feel the microstimulation, you could have tested the hypothesis that perception was a key determinant of BOLD responses by using it as a parametric regressor. Similarly, when comparing the microstimulation with vibrotactile responses, instead of simply saying they are similar (or showing areas of conjunction) you could have modeled both in a single model. This would have allowed you to report the differences between microstimulation and somatosensory stimulation explicitly – by looking at the interaction between two experimental factors (on versus off and microstimulation versus vibrotactile stimulation). If you feel comfortable with the analyses above, it would be simple to say; for example, &quot;the differences between microstimulation and vibrotactile stimulation were tested formally in a general linear model of both time series (testing for interaction) and confirmed the recruitment of extra areas during microstimulation&quot;.</p><p>C) There are concerns about the meaning of the intriguing results showing activation in numerous higher order cortical areas, and the potential misinterpretation of the physiological mechanisms by which the brain interpret inputs, even from single mechanoreceptors. Given the activation of motor cortical areas, the response to INMS may depend on other factors (e.g., action and adaptive prediction, attention, arousal) by which the system may modulate the perceived response. The experiments and the data described here are not sufficient to address these points. Although one could continue this study further adding experiments where the subject has to respond by a movement or vice versa, (initiate a movement in order to trigger the INMS), the journal discourages requests for new experiments that are not essential to the paper. Therefore, the reviewers suggest leaving these findings for future experiments. You could briefly mention the finding and clearly state that these are preliminary results, suggesting that the method can be used in future experiments for quantitative studies.</p><p>Suggested revisions:</p><p>Given the limited data you have, the analyses of the currents you used and the frequency of microstimulation may be better left until another study (where you vary the intensity and frequency orthogonally in a factorial design). The three reviewers recommend to keep the focus on the stronger points (as summarized by the authors in the first section of the Discussion, and as we, the reviewers summarize above).</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were requested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for resubmitting your work entitled &quot;Mapping quantal touch using 7 Tesla functional magnetic resonance imaging and single-unit intraneural microstimulation&quot; for further consideration at <italic>eLife</italic>. Your revised article has been favorably evaluated by Jody Culham (Senior editor), Eilon Vaadia (Reviewing editor), and two reviewers. The following individuals involved in review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Karl Friston (Reviewer #2); Tamar R Makin (Reviewer #3).</p><p>This is an improved version of a previous submission. The authors appear to have dealt with many of the reviewers concerns. The new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figures 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">4</xref> in particular provide a highly compelling proof of concept.

How consistent was the correspondence between the digit map finger-selectivity and the INMS activity across units? For example, did all units show topographically appropriate activity in SI? How much did the activity &quot;leak&quot; to other finger representations? Statistical quantification can improve the validity of the major findings. Given that the authors are arguing that the somatosensory representation of the two stimuli (INMS and vibrotactile) was similar, a direct comparison between the two modalities, and a contrast between two different locations within each modality seems more suitable to support this point. That said, as the stimulation used to construct the digit maps was on the fingertips, and the receptive fields (RFs) of the units were often more medial, I'm not sure the observed overlap is sensible. This warrants further consideration.</italic></p><p>The correspondence between the digit selectivity and the INMS response is consistent across units, except for U1 as described in the Discussion.</p><p>In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>, we now include all 7 units for which INMS was perceived, showing the spatial correspondence between activation due to INMS and vibrotactile stimulation of each unit’s receptive field, as well as the individual digit ROIs derived from the traveling-wave paradigm. We have previously shown the spatial overlap of the representations of individual digits in S1 using vibrotactile stimulation (Besle et al., ‘Single-subject fMRI mapping at 7 T of the representation of fingertips in S1: a comparison of event-related and phase-encoding designs’, J Neurophys, 2013; Besle et al., ‘Event-Related fMRI at 7T Reveals Overlapping Cortical Representations for Adjacent Fingertips in S1 of Individual Subjects’, HBM, 2013). Applying similar analysis methods in this manuscript, we now use the independent ROIs derived from the traveling-wave paradigm to investigate the spread of activation to neighbouring digit ROIs during INMS and vibrotactile stimulation. In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3(C</xref>) and (D) we now plot quantitative results of the average FDR-corrected z-score and the proportion of active voxels in each digit ROI. In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>, we combine the data from all units at the group level to show that the z-score, proportion of active voxels and GLM parameter estimates are significantly higher in the ROI of the stimulated digit than in the ROIs of the neighboring digits. This is in-line with the findings we previously reported for vibrotactile stimulation.</p><p>We have also previously shown that the extent of activation in response to vibrotactile stimulation of the phalanges of the index finger (digit 2) from tip-to-base is encompassed within the digit 2 ROI obtained from a traveling-wave paradigm applied to the finger tips (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> (Sanchez Panchuelo et al., ‘Within-digit functional parcellation of Brodmann areas of the human primary somatosensory cortex using fMRI at 7 Tesla’, J Neurosci, 2012)). This is because S1 is divided into 4 Brodmann areas (3a/3b/1/2), with the tip of the finger being overrepresented in comparison to the base. It is thus appropriate to use ROIs derived from fingertip stimulation in a traveling-wave paradigm in order to assess the spatial localisation of more medial INMS units.</p><p><italic>B) Although the results are sufficient to provide a description of the induced BOLD responses – and the correspondence between microstimulation and vibrotactile stimulation, the authors could have finessed the analysis in a number of ways. For example, if subjects reported the perceptual intensity changed during the fMRI scanning, it would have been better to perform a parametric analysis; testing for the effects of perception on induced responses. In other words, instead of simply showing that the activations in a particular subject reduced when they ceased to feel the microstimulation, you could have tested the hypothesis that perception was a key determinant of BOLD responses by using it as a parametric regressor. Similarly, when comparing the microstimulation with vibrotactile responses, instead of simply saying they are similar (or showing areas of conjunction) you could have modeled both in a single model. This would have allowed you to report the differences between microstimulation and somatosensory stimulation explicitly – by looking at the interaction between two experimental factors (on versus off and microstimulation versus vibrotactile stimulation). If you feel comfortable with the analyses above, it would be simple to say; for example, &quot;the differences between microstimulation and vibrotactile stimulation were tested formally in a general linear model of both time series (testing for interaction) and confirmed the recruitment of extra areas during microstimulation&quot;.</italic></p><p>We have now performed a parametric analysis, including a regressor of linear modulation in time, on the three datasets in which subjects’ perception was lost during the fMRI run (U5, U6 and U8). However, no areas were found to display a significant suppression, and so parameter estimates were similar (within error) for the GLM, with and without this regressor. This is most likely to be because the loss of perception was not gradual, but rather perception was completely lost within a single cycle. We have now described this additional GLM analysis in the Methods and added a sentence to the Results to indicate that this analysis did not reveal a significant effect for U5, U6, and U8.</p><p>We have not modelled the microstimulation and vibrotacile data in a single GLM, as the microstimulation responses are variable in amplitude across units, adding between-subject variance to a INMS group map, and are also of lower amplitude than for vibrotactile stimulation. Thus we believe that the analysis we have carried out is more appropriate in this case for the high resolution INMS and vibrotactile stimulation data.</p><p><italic>C) There are concerns about the meaning of the intriguing results showing activation in numerous higher order cortical areas, and the potential misinterpretation of the physiological mechanisms by which the brain interpret inputs, even from single mechanoreceptors. Given the activation of motor cortical areas, the response to INMS may depend on other factors (e.g., action and adaptive prediction, attention, arousal) by which the system may modulate the perceived response. The experiments and the data described here are not sufficient to address these points. Although one could continue this study further adding experiments where the subject has to respond by a movement or vice versa, (initiate a movement in order to trigger the INMS), the journal discourages requests for new experiments that are not essential to the paper. Therefore, the reviewers suggest leaving these findings for future experiments. You could briefly mention the finding and clearly state that these are preliminary results, suggesting that the method can be used in future experiments for quantitative studies.</italic></p><p>We have considerably reduced this paragraph and have added a statement in the manuscript to reflect this point: ‘However, this is a preliminary finding and requires further investigation with larger sample sizes and more quantitative analysis to be corroborated.’</p><p><italic>Suggested revisions:</italic></p><p><italic>Given the limited data you have, the analyses of the currents you used and the frequency of microstimulation may be better left until another study (where you vary the intensity and frequency orthogonally in a factorial design). The three reviewers recommend to keep the focus on the stronger points (as summarized by the authors in the first section of the Discussion, and as we, the reviewers summarize above).</italic></p><p>As suggested by the reviewers, we now focus more on the characterization of the specificity of the INMS activation to the vibrotactile digit maps (results added to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>), and have removed the previous <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref> (effect of increasing the stimulation current) and Figure 3—figure supplement 2 (effect of increasing frequency).</p><p><italic>[Editors' note: further revisions were requested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</italic></p><p><italic>Comment 1:</italic></p><p><italic>At our request, the authors have included an additional analysis but it is introduced before being described in a confusing way (subsection “Cortical responses to single unit INMS and vibrotactile stimulation in S1”, third paragraph.

To clarify this, we have added ‘(phase encoding)’ next to the first mention of the travelling wave design (subsection “Cortical responses to single unit INMS and vibrotactile stimulation in S1”, first paragraph) and the paragraph that describes the traveling-wave design in the Materials and methods section now reads: ‘…. a traveling-wave or phase-encoding paradigm (Sanchez-Panchuelo et al. 2010), analogous to that used in retinotopic mapping, in which each individual digit of the hand is sequentially stimulated to create a travelling wave of activity across cortical regions containing a somatotopic map of the hand’.</p><p><italic>Comment 3:</italic></p><p><italic>In the third paragraph of the Introduction the authors describe the potential impact of their study given previous research.
