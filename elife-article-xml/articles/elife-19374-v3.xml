syndrome (RTT). Previous studies have shown that altered MeCP2 levels result in aberrant neurite outgrowth and glutamatergic synapse formation. However, causal molecular mechanisms are not well understood since MeCP2 is known to regulate transcription of a wide range of target genes. Here, we describe a key role for a constitutive BDNF feed forward signaling pathway in regulating synaptic response, general growth and differentiation of glutamatergic neurons. Chronic block of TrkB receptors mimics the MeCP2 deficiency in wildtype glutamatergic neurons, while re-expression of BDNF quantitatively rescues MeCP2 deficiency. We show that BDNF acts cell autonomous and autocrine, as wildtype neurons are not capable of rescuing growth deficits in neighboring MeCP2 deficient neurons <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic>. These findings are relevant for understanding RTT pathophysiology, wherein wildtype and mutant neurons are intermixed throughout the nervous system.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.19374.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.19374.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.19374.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Rett syndrome is a progressive brain disorder. Individuals with the condition (who are typically girls) grow normally until they are 6-18 months old and then developmentally regress, with symptoms including anxiety, impaired coordination, seizures and breathing problems.</p><p>Rett syndrome is caused by mutations in the gene that encodes a protein called MeCP2. Researchers know that MeCP2 is vital for “excitatory” neurons in the brain to communicate with (and activate) their neighbors. Neurons that lack MeCP2 tend to make fewer of the connections across which they communicate – called synapses – with others.</p><p>Many researchers who study Rett syndrome use male mice that lack the MeCP2 protein. This mouse model mimics the symptoms seen in Rett patients, but at a faster and more severe rate. These studies have shown that restoring normal levels of the protein in neurons prevents the majority of Rett-like symptoms in these mice and reverses the disorder.</p><p>MeCP2 controls the activity of a number of other genes. These include the gene that produces a protein called Brain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor (BDNF), which helps neurons to grow. Sampathkumar et al. have now studied neurons from mouse models of Rett syndrome to investigate whether BDNF can overcome the defects seen in neurons that lack MeCP2. Viewed under a high-powered microscope, the Rett-like neurons appear smaller than healthy neurons and form fewer synapses. However, increasing the amount of BDNF in the diseased neurons restores normal growth and enables the cells to form more synapses.</p><p>Girls with Rett syndrome tend to have a mixture of healthy neurons and those that do not produce the right amount of MeCP2. To mimic this, Sampathkumar et al. grew a mixture of normal and Rett-like mouse neurons in a culture dish. The healthy neurons did not help the diseased neurons to form the correct number of synapses. However, increasing the levels of BDNF in the Rett-like neurons enhanced their ability to form synapses, and increased their cell size to match their healthy counterparts.</p><p>Further work is now required to uncover whether manipulating the gene that encodes BDNF – or other genes that MeCP2 controls the activity of – in the brain can reduce the symptoms and slow the progression of Rett syndrome.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.19374.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.19374.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>Rett syndrome</kwd><kwd>synaptic transmission</kwd><kwd>glutamatergic</kwd><kwd>BDNF</kwd><kwd>cell autonomous</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001659</institution-id><institution>Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>SFB 665</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Sampathkumar</surname><given-names>Charanya</given-names></name><name><surname>Vadhvani</surname><given-names>Mayur</given-names></name><name><surname>Rosenmund</surname><given-names>Christian</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001659</institution-id><institution>Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Exc257</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Wu</surname><given-names>Yuan-Ju</given-names></name><name><surname>Vadhvani</surname><given-names>Mayur</given-names></name><name><surname>Eickholt</surname><given-names>Britta</given-names></name><name><surname>Rosenmund</surname><given-names>Christian</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Berlin Institute of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>CRG Congenital Diseases</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Sampathkumar</surname><given-names>Charanya</given-names></name><name><surname>Rosenmund</surname><given-names>Christian</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>In mouse models of Rett syndrome, the impaired cell autonomous BDNF feed forward signaling pathway results in abnormalities in neurite outgrowth and synapse formation in excitatory neurons.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Rett syndrome (RTT) is a severe progressive neurodevelopmental disorder, mainly caused by mutations in the X-linked gene encoding methyl-CpG binding protein 2 (MeCP2), a protein involved in transcriptional regulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Amir et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Wan et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Xiang et al., 2000</xref>). RTT patients show regression of head growth followed by various neurological symptoms including seizures, mental retardation, stereotypic hand-wringing movements, breathing irregularities, ataxia and autistic behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Rett, 1966</xref>). Mouse models with <italic>Mecp2</italic> mutations display similar neurological phenotypes, and have been quite critical in defining the pathophysiology of RTT. <italic>Mecp2<sup>Null/y</sup></italic> mice grow normally until 4–6 weeks of age, after which they display RTT-like symptoms such as reduced mobility, hindlimb clasping, abnormal breathing patterns and premature death (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Chen et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Guy et al., 2001</xref>). Similarly, mice engineered to express twice the endogenous levels of MeCP2 (<italic>Mecp2<sup>Tg1</sup></italic>) are characterized by seizures, forepaw clasping, hypoactivity, increased aggression, and around 30% die by one year of age (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Collins et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Jugloff et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Luikenhuis et al., 2004</xref>). Loss or doubling of MeCP2 in primary mouse hippocampal neurons results in reduction or enhancement of synaptic response respectively, primarily due to the number of glutamatergic synapses formed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Chao et al., 2007</xref>). Furthermore, restoring MeCP2 levels rescued neurological defects associated with loss of MeCP2 the extent of which depends on timing of activation and dynamic variation in MeCP2 levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Giacometti et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Guy et al., 2007</xref>).

Similarly, endogenous MeCP2 knockdown reduced dendritic length in E18 hippocampal neurons, which was fully rescued upon BDNF overexpression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Larimore et al., 2009</xref>). Considering that BDNF is an important regulator of neurite outgrowth and synapse formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Cheng et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Finsterwald et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Gottmann et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">McAllister et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Park and Poo, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Poo, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Tolwani et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Wang et al., 2015</xref>), it is essential to understand effects of BDNF modulation in <italic>Mecp2<sup>Null/y</sup></italic> neurons specifically in steering neuronal growth and glutamatergic synapses. Early work has focused mainly on phenotypic rescue upon increasing BDNF levels in MeCP2-deficient mice but mechanistic interactions have not been resolved.</p><p>In this study, we examine putative causal mechanisms of BDNF impacting cellular growth as well as the formation of excitatory synapses in hippocampal neurons lacking MeCP2. We found that increased BDNF levels restored synaptic output and morphological phenotypes in MeCP2 deficient neurons in a cell autonomous and autocrine manner <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic>. Importantly, blocking the BDNF pathway converted wildtype neurons to a phenotype that mimicked MeCP2-deficiency induced defects. These findings add to the current picture of BDNF signaling in stabilizing various features of RTT patients and are crucial for the profound understanding of BDNF-mediated therapeutic strategies and more generally, pathophysiology of the RTT disease.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Loss, but not doubling of MeCP2, alters neurite outgrowth and neuronal soma size in hippocampal glutamatergic neurons</title><p>We previously reported that loss or doubling of MeCP2 results in altered glutamatergic synapse number in vitro and in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Chao et al., 2007</xref>) underlining tightly controlled MeCP2 dosage as a prerequisite for optimal synapse formation. Why MeCP2 levels are rate limiting in glutamatergic synapse formation is not clear, and could include pre- or postsynaptic factors that regulate synapse formation as well as factors that regulate general neuronal development. Hence, we began this analysis by examining the role of neurite outgrowth. Single-cell hippocampal autaptic cultures were utilized and particularly beneficial due to the unambiguous assignment of axon and dendrite and the ability to restrict analysis to a cell autonomous condition.</p><p>Axonal and dendritic outgrowths were measured during the first 12 days in vitro (DIV) from <italic>Mecp2<sup>Tg1</sup></italic> and <italic>Mecp2<sup>Null/y</sup></italic>neurons as well as control neurons derived from their respective WT littermates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). Neurons were labeled with Tau1 and MAP2 to mark for axons and dendrites respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Comparative analysis revealed that <italic>Mecp2<sup>Tg1</sup></italic> neurons appeared normal and did not display any morphological deficits, with axonal and dendritic outgrowth similar to WT neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C and E</xref>). However, <italic>Mecp2<sup>Null/y</sup></italic> neurons showed a significant reduction of 23–41% and 27–41% in overall length of axons and dendrites respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B and D</xref>).

These results do not explain the Tg1 gain-of-function phenotype suggesting that an alternate mechanism may be necessary for enhanced synapse number. Additionally, the morphological findings reveal a general growth deficiency in glutamatergic neurons lacking MeCP2 possibly accounting for decreased synapse number.<fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.19374.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Loss of MeCP2 alters neurite outgrowth and neuronal soma size.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Co-immunostaining of glutamatergic hippocampal neurons from WT and <italic>Mecp2<sup>Null/y</sup></italic> mice at DIV 2, 4, 8 and 12 for Tau1 (cyan) and MAP2 (green).

In our study, we find a generalized growth and differentiation defect in glutamatergic <italic>Mecp2<sup>Null/y</sup></italic> neurons with MeCP2-deficient neurons displaying reduced neurite outgrowth and soma area (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). In examining causal mechanisms, we find a critical role for BDNF. The specific loss in neuronal growth can be attributed to suppression of BDNF synthesis since both synaptic output and morphological phenotypes could be restored by lentivirus-mediated and exogenous application of BDNF, in a TrkB-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). Moreover, we show that blocking BDNF-TrkB signaling in wildtype neurons leads to a MeCP2-deficient state, strongly arguing for nearly complete suppression of the canonical BDNF-TrkB pathway in mutant neurons. Further, we demonstrate that the BDNF-mediated growth pathway is strictly cell autonomous since (i) neighboring wildtype neurons fail to rescue <italic>Mecp2<sup>Null/y</sup></italic> neuronal morphological deficits in a RTT model <italic>in vitro</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>), and (ii) MeCP2-deficient neurons have smaller somata as well as nuclei in both two- and eight-week old <italic>Mecp2<sup>+/-</sup></italic> mice <italic>in vivo</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>), given the reduced BDNF protein levels in <italic>Mecp2<sup>+/-</sup></italic> mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Wang et al., 2006</xref>) and reduced mRNA levels in postmortem brain samples from RTT patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abuhatzira et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Deng et al., 2007</xref>). This cell autonomy further illustrates that a change in circuit activity is unlikely to explain synapse loss associated with MeCP2-negative neurons in RTT models.</p><p>Much attention has been received towards manipulating either MeCP2 levels or protein levels of MeCP2-regulated genes predominantly because reactivation of the <italic>Mecp2</italic> or target gene has been shown to rescue morphological phenotypes, behavior and overall neurological function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Chang et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Chao et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Guy et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Kline et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Larimore et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">McGraw et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Nguyen et al., 2012</xref>). The fact that several synaptic defects in <italic>Mecp2<sup>Null/y</sup></italic> neurons might be fundamentally linked to simply BDNF synthesis despite MeCP2 regulating transcription of a myriad of target genes renders MeCP2-BDNF interaction extremely pivotal. Along these lines, endogenous MeCP2 knockdown reduced dendritic length in E18 hippocampal neurons, which was fully rescued upon BDNF overexpression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Larimore et al., 2009</xref>), which is in agreement with our rescue data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). Differential BDNF function based on brain region and neuronal subtypes has been emphasized across various studies. In particular, reduced BDNF levels in the brainstem of <italic>Mecp2<sup>Null</sup></italic> mice increased the amplitude of spontaneous and evoked EPSCs in nTS (nucleus tractus solitarius) neurons, which were fully rescued upon exogenous BDNF application (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Kline et al., 2010</xref>). This is comparable to the BDNF-mediated rescue of synaptic function in glutamatergic <italic>Mecp2<sup>Null/y</sup></italic> neurons in our study (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F–I</xref>).</p><p>That BDNF is a neurotrophin with poor blood-brain barrier penetration characteristics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Poduslo and Curran, 1996</xref>) prompted the need for small molecule substitutes that act as TrkB agonists and activate TrkB signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Jang et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Massa et al., 2010</xref>).

In our unique WT/Null RTT-like model, 7,8-DHF application clearly substantiated the autocrine and cell autonomous function of BDNF as well as BDNF-TrkB feed-forward loop impairment in <italic>Mecp2<sup>Null/y</sup></italic> neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figures 5C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">6B</xref>). Impaired BDNF-TrkB activity could be due to differential surface expression of postsynaptic TrkB receptors and therefore inadequate availability of surface TrkB for binding to BDNF. However, complete rescue of both physiological and morphological phenotypes upon BDNF overexpression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>) eliminated this possibility and highlighted a crucial upstream deficit in BDNF synthesis and release. Further studies are required to elucidate how 7,8-DHF functions to act <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> to ameliorate RTT symptoms and enable normalization of glutamatergic synapse numbers.</p><p>BDNF synthesis deficit in MeCP2 lacking neurons has resulted in different phenotypic effects across various studies. In particular, Wang and colleagues reported decrease in absolute amounts of BDNF released but also an increase in percentage of BDNF content available for spontaneous release in <italic>Mecp2<sup>Null/y</sup></italic> nodose ganglion (NG) neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Wang et al., 2006</xref>). This may argue for cell-type specific effects of BDNF. Alternatively in our study, we demonstrate that glutamatergic synaptic output is normalized in <italic>Mecp2<sup>Null/y</sup></italic> hippocampal neurons upon restoring BDNF levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">3</xref>) and that BDNF neutralization experiments indicate a defect in synthesis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>), which suggest decreased availability of BDNF for release. By contrast, BDNF could also be functioning through other parallel pathways. For example, a study based on hippocampal slices demonstrated impaired activity-dependent endogenous BDNF release from presynaptic mossy fibers onto CA3 pyramidal neurons of symptomatic MeCP2 mutant mice that was correlated to impaired TRPC3 signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Li et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>BDNF and other neurotrophins bind to the cell surface due to their highly positive charge at physiological pH (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Blöchl and Thoenen, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Brigadski et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">de Wit et al., 2009</xref>), and locally modulate developing synapses by spatially restricting BDNF action (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Zhang and Poo, 2002</xref>). Additionally, several peptidergic hormones and secretory molecules including Wnt (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cadigan et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Papkoff and Schryver, 1990</xref>), Semaphorin 3A (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bouzioukh et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">De Wit et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Sahay et al., 2005</xref>) and BDNF (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">de Wit et al., 2009</xref>) have been shown to remain membrane resident after secretion. Indeed, we verified this hypothesis by examining the fate of BDNF secretion in WT and <italic>Mecp2<sup>Null/y</sup></italic> hippocampal neurons using the BDNF-superecliptic pHluorin (BDNF-SpH) live-cell imaging assay (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Kolarow et al., 2007</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>) (Refer Materials and methods). We measured activity-dependent BDNF release by 60 mM KCl-induced depolarization, and quantified surface fraction of BDNF-SpH by application of pH 5.5 MES-buffered acid solution. We found that a significant fraction of BDNF-SpH remained membrane-resident as evident from MES-buffered acid quenching experiments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1B and G</xref>), without affecting activity-induced BDNF secretion in both WT and <italic>Mecp2<sup>Null/y</sup></italic> neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1D–F</xref>). This complements our previous findings and shows that stable membrane deposits of BDNF could potentiate TrkB receptor activation cell autonomously and drive glutamatergic synapse number by confining activity to its own neurites. Additionally, the fact that activity-dependent regulated BDNF release was unaffected in MeCP2-deficient glutamatergic neurons suggested that the observed synaptic phenotypes were accounted for by a deficit in constitutive BDNF release. Further studies specifically measuring pre- and postsynaptic release of BDNF from WT and <italic>Mecp2<sup>Null/y</sup></italic> cultured glutamatergic neurons are essential to determine the locus of activity-dependent regulation of excitatory synapses.</p><p>What is the functional purpose of this autocrine feed-forward signaling loop? There seems to be a link between intrinsic activity and growth in WT neurons by allowing BDNF to work on its own neurons, coupling neuronal firing patterns to their basic growth properties. This further implies that reduced activity in <italic>Mecp2<sup>Null/y</sup></italic> neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Chang et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Chao et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Dani et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Tropea et al., 2009</xref>) may disrupt activity-dependent neuronal growth. This deficiency could be repaired by supplying an additional source of BDNF (or TrkB agonist) that activates WT-like TrkB signaling. BDNF has been suggested to act as an autocrine factor mainly in regulating dendrite development in adult-born granule cells (GCs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Wang et al., 2015</xref>) and promoting axon formation in embryonic hippocampal neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Cheng et al., 2011</xref>). In RTT pathophysiology in particular, we show for the first time that this localized autocrine function and cell autonomy of BDNF-TrkB together offer a plausible mechanism and explain why MeCP2 mosaicism in RTT females is ineffective in restoring phenotypes at a cellular, network or behavioral level. It may be possible that BDNF released could be less efficient in reaching neighboring neurons in co-cultures; however, the cell autonomous effect observed in autaptic neurons <italic>in vitro</italic>, and <italic>in vivo</italic>, as well as the autocrine BDNF dependence seen <italic>in vitro</italic>, argue against putative BDNF paracrine effects. However, what remains to be understood is if the predominant impact of impaired BDNF signaling on circuitry stems from the pre- or postsynaptic site. Initial morphological analysis showed axonal as well as dendritic growth deficiency (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). Further analysis in mixed co-culture experiments demonstrated a presynaptic deficit wherein densities of <italic>Mecp2<sup>Null/y</sup></italic> glutamatergic synapses onto the postsynaptic neuron remained independent of genotype (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>). This points towards a major ‘propagation’ defect specifically in <italic>Mecp2<sup>Null/y</sup></italic> neurons in a mosaic circuit wherein they receive synaptic input similar to WT neurons. However, MeCP2-deficient glutamatergic neurons show reduced capacity to communicate output signal to a postsynaptic neuron thereby reducing efficiency of innervation across specific brain regions and dampening synaptic output. In fact, one could postulate that glutamatergic neurons lacking MeCP2 are essentially not ‘deaf’ but ‘mute’. Interestingly, there is evidence of non-cell autonomous mechanisms contributing to neuronal development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Braunschweig et al., 2004</xref>) and dendritic arborization of cortical pyramidal neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Kishi and Macklis, 2010</xref>). In a mosaic brain, MeCP2-deficient mute neurons may contribute to reduced overall activity, which in turn could reduce activity-dependent BDNF secretion and thereby result in putative non-cell autonomous effects as well. Hence, future studies comparing wildtype and heterozygous <italic>Mecp2<sup>+/-</sup></italic> mice may help reveal additional non-cell autonomous effects <italic>in vivo</italic>.</p><p>It will be important to determine how the proposed presynaptic BDNF-mediated mechanistic pathway relates to other cell types, as well as to investigate specific downstream signaling pathways that might be affected as a result of BDNF synthesis deficiency. For example, MeCP2-deficient GABAergic neurons show decrease in inhibitory quantal size with reduced Gad1 and Gad2 levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Chao et al., 2010</xref>) while BDNF released from postsynaptic target neurons acts locally to modulate GABAergic synapse formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Kohara et al., 2007</xref>). More generally, besides providing a mechanistic role for BDNF in MeCP2 mutant neurons, our results substantiate the significance of manipulating BDNF-TrkB interaction as a potential therapeutic strategy in alleviating the course of the RTT syndrome.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Animals and cell culture</title><p>All procedures to maintain and use mice were approved by the Animal Welfare Committee of Charité Medical University and the Berlin State Government. <italic>Mecp2<sup>Null/y</sup></italic> male mice on a C57BLJ6/N background and/or <italic>Mecp2<sup>Tg1</sup></italic> male mice on a FVB/N background were used for morphological and electrophysiological studies.</p><p>Primary hippocampal neurons were prepared from P0-P2 newborn mice and cultured on astrocyte feeder layers.

Hypertonic sucrose solution was prepared as 500 mM sucrose in standard extracellular solution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Rosenmund and Stevens, 1996</xref>).</p><p>Excitatory postsynaptic currents (EPSCs) were evoked by briefly depolarizing neurons from −70 mV to 0 mV for 2 ms. Application of hypertonic sucrose solution for 5 s was facilitated using a fast-flow system triggering release of the readily releasable pool (RRP) characterized by a transient inward current. RRP charge was estimated by integrating the total area under the transient curve obtained. Vesicular release probability (P<sub>vr</sub>) was determined by calculating ratio of EPSC charge over RRP charge. Short-term plasticity was determined by evoking 2 EPSCs with an inter-stimulus interval of 25 ms to measure paired-pulse ratio (PPR). PPR was determined by calculating the ratio of EPSC amplitude of second over the first synaptic response.</p><p>Electrophysiological data were analyzed offline using Axograph X (Axograph Scientific, Berkeley, CA), Excel (Microsoft, Redmond, WA) and Prism (GraphPad, La Jolla, CA).

Quantification of all MAP2-positive processes with NeuronJ plugin was used to determine total dendrite length while measuring cross-sectional area across the MAP2+ cell body enabled estimation of area of neuronal somata. Nucleus cross-sectional area was measured by tracing the outline of the nucleus using NLS+ identified neurons. Total axonal length analysis was done by quantification of all Tau1+ MAP2- processes per neuron using NeuronJ plugin since an overlap of Tau1 labeling was observed in proximal MAP2-positive dendritic branches in several neurons. Pre- and postsynaptic puncta were estimated by manually counting individual VGLUT1+ and Homer1+ as well as double positive synapses on selected dendritic regions of interest. Glutamatergic synapse density in co-cultures was analyzed by manually counting VGLUT1 and synaptophysin double positive synapses on selected dendritic regions of interest.</p><p>Unless specified otherwise, statistical significance was determined using one-way ANOVA with Tukey <italic>post hoc</italic> test (for three or more groups with normal distribution) or Student’s <italic>t test</italic> (for two groups with normal distribution).

BDNF-SpH was expressed in primary hippocampal neurons and characterized using the pHluorin live-cell imaging assay. Neurons were placed in standard extracellular solution as described in case of electrophysiological measurements and 256 × 256 pixel images were acquired on an Olympus IX71 inverted microscope equipped with an Andor iXon back-illuminated CCD camera and Polychrome V Illumination Unit (Till Photonics, Germany) at 60x magnification (numerical aperture 1.2) and a sampling rate of 1 Hz.</p><p>Neurons were stimulated by application of 60 mM KCl (prepared in standard extracellular solution) for 30 s using the fast-flow system as mentioned above. 60 mM KCl-induced membrane depolarization of BDNF-SpH-expressing neurons resulted in an increase in fluorescence (ΔF) that resembled a punctate-pattern distribution representative of BDNF exocytosis. Some fusion events decayed abruptly while many others decayed slowly or remained persistent. 50 mM NH<sub>4</sub>Cl solution was applied for 30 s to neutralize intracellular pH, causing an abrupt increase in fluorescence intensity enabling visualization of all BDNF-SpH containing compartments. Low pH (pH 5.5) solution of 2-(<italic>N</italic>-morpholino) ethanesulfonic acid was applied for 30 s for acid wash experiments, causing acute dimming of all surface resident BDNF-SpH proteins.</p></sec><sec id="s4-10"><title>BDNF-superecliptic pHluorin image analysis</title><p>BDNF release events were analyzed from stacks acquired from time-lapse recordings of BDNF-SpH containing vesicle clusters upon application of KCl, NH<sub>4</sub>Cl, pH 5.5 solutions or standard extracellular solution. BDNF release was analyzed from both synaptic and extrasynaptic sites. Background subtraction was done using Rolling Ball (50 pixel radius, ImageJ) for all image stacks and ROIs were marked to measure ΔF, using ImageJ. 4 × 4 pixel regions of interest (ROIs) were identified and peak change in fluorescence (ΔF) in response to KCl-induced stimulation normalized to initial fluorescence (F<sub>0</sub> = average of five frames immediately before onset of stimulus) was measured as a function of time and averaged in Axograph X (Axograph). Baseline subtraction was done for each ROI per cell in Axograph X, and ΔF and ΔF/F<sub>0</sub> values for all groups were analyzed in Prism (GraphPad). Release events were characterized by their abrupt increase in fluorescence upon application of KCl followed by a rapid or gradual decrease of fluorescence back to baseline levels, and normalized to their corresponding peak NH<sub>4</sub>Cl events. The same ROIs were probed in recordings upon application of NH<sub>4</sub>Cl or MES-buffered acid solutions. Acid quenched BDNF fraction was normalized to corresponding peak NH<sub>4</sub>Cl response, reflecting the non-internalized pool of BDNF vesicles that are either found on the neuronal surface or easily accessible from the extracellular space around the cell membrane.</p></sec><sec id="s4-11"><title>Statistics</title><p>All statistical analyses were done using Excel (Microsoft) and Prism (Graphpad).

Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, one of whom, Sacha B Nelson (Reviewer #1), is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors and the evaluation has been overseen by a Senior Editor.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>It is <italic>eLife</italic> policy that titles should convey some details of the system under study. In this case it might be helpful to add the word &quot;mouse&quot; or &quot;mammalian&quot; to the title.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>Sampathkumar, Rosenmund, and colleagues use primary neuronal cultures, genetics, pharmacology and electrophysiology to investigate the role of BDNF signaling in mediating neuronal effects of mutations in MeCP2, the gene affected in Rett Syndrome. Although this is a well developed area of research, the authors provide a unique new set of insights showing that BDNF completely accounts for the observed cellular phenotypes and that the signaling is a local autocrine feed-forward mechanism that increases synapse number in a cell autonomous presynaptic fashion.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Two of the reviewers were concerned about the lack of a direct connection to in vivo analyses. This could be addressed by:a) Altering the text to limit the conclusions to those about the cell autonomous biology of isolated glutamatergic neurons from a Rett model, omitting those about the disease per se;b) Shoring up the in vivo observations to better integrate them into the rest of the manuscript. Specifically, nuclear size should also be measured in the cultured neurons and whether or not this is cell autonomous and BDNF-dependent should be assessed, ideally by comparing WT, mutant and BDNF overexpressing neurons. It would also be helpful to assess whether or not there are additional non-cell autonomous effects in vivo by comparing heterozygote to wild type animals.</p><p>2) Reviewers were also concerned about using two presynaptic markers rather than a pre- and postsynaptic marker to count synapses. At the very least, some of the observations should be repeated with an additional postsynaptic marker and the degree of correlation between pre-/post- identified synapses and pre-only synapses should be stated (for example Vglut and PSD95 would be good markers). In addition, it is important to rule out the possibility that synapse counts are influenced by the level of expression of the synaptic markers, as opposed to changes only in the physical presence or absence of synapses.</p><p>3) Reviewers felt that a clearer and more detailed explanation was needed concerning the basis for the authors' conclusion that there is no difference in BDNF release between WT and null cells, particularly given the NH<sub>4</sub>Cl data showing a lower fluorescence signal in the WT cells. In addition, it was felt that the authors need to clearly articulate a plausible hypothesis as to why autocrine, but not paracrine BDNF signaling would rescue the phenotypes they measured. It was suggested that characterizing TrkB phosphorylation under the conditions of bath application, and BDNF overexpression may help reveal the difference between autocrine and paracrine effects.</p><p>4) Reviewers were concerned that there was not sufficient evidence that BDNF overexpression was adequately achieved, especially in the mixed culture conditions.

Please also see Results subsection “BDNF overexpression in <italic>Mecp2<sup>Null/y</sup></italic> autaptic neurons restores evoked EPSC magnitude, RRP size, synapse number, dendrite length, soma and nucleus size” (for autaptic data) and “BDNF-induced TrkB activation regulates glutamatergic synapse number in a cell-autonomous and autocrine manner” (for co-culture data). In autaptic cultures, we found that nucleus size is smaller in <italic>Mecp2<sup>Null/y</sup></italic> glutamatergic neurons and restored to WT levels by BDNF overexpression in a TrkB-dependent manner. In co-cultured neurons, we found that nucleus size remains reduced in <italic>Mecp2<sup>Null/y</sup></italic> glutamatergic neurons although they are co-cultured with WT neurons. Furthermore, BDNF overexpression specifically in <italic>Mecp2<sup>Null/y</sup></italic> neurons restored nucleus size up to WT levels. These findings demonstrate that change in nucleus size upon loss of MeCP2 is cell autonomous as well as BDNF-dependent in vitro. The analyses were done blind to genotype and treatment of neurons.</p><p>To further shore up the in vivo observations, we have additionally analyzed soma area of MeCP2+ and MeCP2- neurons in the hippocampal CA1 region of <italic>Mecp2</italic><sup>+/-</sup> mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A, C and D</xref>). Please also see Results subsection “Neurons lacking MeCP2 have smaller somata and nuclei as compared to WT in Hippocampal CA1 of <italic>Mecp2<sup>+/-</sup></italic> mice” and Materials and methods subsection “Quantification of neuronal somata and nuclei in hippocampal CA1”. We found that the soma of neurons lacking MeCP2 were 20% and 14% smaller than those of MeCP2+ neurons in 2- and 8-week old <italic>Mecp2</italic><sup>+/-</sup> mice, respectively. This phenotype is similar to that of nucleus size data in vivo. These data suggest that both soma area and nucleus size were reduced upon loss of MeCP2 in a cell autonomous manner in vitro and in vivo. Since both in vitro and in vivo data on nucleus and soma show significant reduction in MeCP2-deficient neurons in a mosaic condition, it is safe to conclude that cell autonomy (both in vitro and in vivo data) and BDNF dependence (from in vitro data) play a critical role in regulating neuronal growth and glutamatergic synapse formation. Because of the short time frame for revisions, we were only able to analyze soma area of MeCP2+ and MeCP2- neurons in <italic>Mecp2</italic><sup>+/-</sup> heterozygous mice and uncovered further cell autonomous effects. Nevertheless, we have discussed the role of putative non-cell autonomous effects in the sixth paragraph of the Discussion section.</p><p><italic>2) Reviewers were also concerned about using two presynaptic markers rather than a pre- and postsynaptic marker to count synapses. At the very least, some of the observations should be repeated with an additional postsynaptic marker and the degree of correlation between pre-/post- identified synapses and pre-only synapses should be stated (for example Vglut and PSD95 would be good markers). In addition, it is important to rule out the possibility that synapse counts are influenced by the level of expression of the synaptic markers, as opposed to changes only in the physical presence or absence of synapses.</italic> </p><p>The reviewers raise an important point here: Are pre-/post- identified synapses and pre- only synapses correlated? This seems to be the case, as shown in the revised version of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref> with new experiments. Please also see Results subsection “BDNF overexpression restores synapse density in <italic>Mecp2<sup>Null/y</sup></italic> glutamatergic neurons”. We have labeled neurons with Homer1 as a postsynaptic marker, rather than PSD95 (for better specificity and signal to noise ratio in our hands), and VGLUT1 as a glutamatergic presynaptic marker; as seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>. We then evaluated synapse density of both VGLUT1+ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>) and Homer1+ puncta (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>) as well as VGLUT1-Homer1 colocalized puncta (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>) and rate of colocalization of VGLUT1 to Homer1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>). We found that both VGLUT1 and Homer1 synaptic densities were reduced to a similar degree in MeCP2-deficient neurons and rescued to WT levels upon both BDNF overexpression and exogenous BDNF application. To check specificity, we treated WT and BDNF overexpressing <italic>Mecp2<sup>Null/y</sup></italic> glutamatergic neurons with the anti-neutralizing BDNF antibody and found that restored pre- and postsynaptic densities were reverted to <italic>Mecp2<sup>Null/y</sup></italic> levels. We also measured VGLUT1-Homer1 colocalized puncta as well as rate of colocalization of VGLUT1 to Homer1 and found decrease in colocalized puncta upon loss of MeCP2, rescued by BDNF overexpression and exogenous BDNF in a BDNF-dependent fashion. In congruence, Chao 2007 analyzed colocalized VGLUT-PSD95 synaptic puncta as well as rate of colocalization in <italic>Mecp2<sup>Null/y</sup></italic> neurons, and observed reduced VGLUT1-PSD95 puncta and reduced rate of colocalization, similar to our findings. Altogether, these data indicate maturation defect in excitatory synapses upon loss of MeCP2.</p><p>The reviewers also raise questions regarding the expression levels of synaptic markers used. To address this, we have measured expression levels of VGLUT1 in both autaptic and continental neuronal cultures, and Homer1 expression levels (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1A–C</xref>). Please also see Results subsection “BDNF overexpression restores synapse density in <italic>Mecp2<sup>Null/y</sup></italic> glutamatergic neurons”. We do not observe any changes in synaptic marker expression levels and so can conclude that expression levels of pre- or postsynaptic markers do not influence synapse counts.</p><p><italic>3) Reviewers felt that a clearer and more detailed explanation was needed concerning the basis for the authors' conclusion that there is no difference in BDNF release between WT and null cells, particularly given the NH<sub>4</sub>Cl data showing a lower fluorescence signal in the WT cells. In addition, it was felt that the authors need to clearly articulate a plausible hypothesis as to why autocrine, but not paracrine BDNF signaling would rescue the phenotypes they measured. It was suggested that characterizing TrkB phosphorylation under the conditions of bath application, and BDNF overexpression may help reveal the difference between autocrine and paracrine effects.</italic> </p><p>We apologize for the lack of clarity in explaining the BDNF release data. BDNF release events were normalized to their corresponding peak NH<sub>4</sub>Cl events in WT and <italic>Mecp2<sup>Null/y</sup></italic> neurons. This demonstrates that changes in NH<sub>4</sub>Cl data in WT and <italic>Mecp2<sup>Null/y</sup></italic> neurons do not impact the quantification of BDNF release events. Hence, we can safely conclude that activity-dependent BDNF release remains unchanged upon loss of MeCP2. We have mentioned this in Materials and methods subsection “BDNF-superecliptic pHluorin live cell imaging” and in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1D</xref>.</p><p>Additionally, as asked by the reviewers, we have discussed in greater detail about autocrine versus paracrine BDNF signaling in the sixth paragraph of the Discussion section. While we agree with the reviewers that characterizing TrkB phosphorylation under different conditions is an interesting suggestion; we believe that autocrine BDNF signaling is predominantly responsible for rescue of measured phenotypes for the following reasons: (i) Our comprehensive analysis of morphological and physiological phenotypes in autaptic <italic>Mecp2<sup>Null/y</sup></italic> neurons demonstrates that all measured phenotypes were rescued upon BDNF overexpression and exogenous BDNF application, in a TrkB-dependent manner. (ii) Specific restoration of glutamatergic synapse number and nucleus size in BDNF overexpressing <italic>Mecp2<sup>Null/y</sup></italic> neurons co-cultured with WT neurons shows that these phenotypes are regulated in a cell autonomous manner via autocrine BDNF signaling. Furthermore, both phenotypes failed to be rescued by simply co-culturing WT neurons with <italic>Mecp2<sup>Null/y</sup></italic> neurons, arguing against putative paracrine effects.</p><p><italic>4) Reviewers were concerned that there was not sufficient evidence that BDNF overexpression was adequately achieved, especially in the mixed culture conditions. Also in the mixed cultures, how were contributions to synaptic measurements from excitatory synapses on interneurons excluded?</italic> </p><p>The reviewers raise an important point if BDNF expression was adequately achieved. This indeed seems to be the case as seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>, where BDNF overexpression in autaptic <italic>Mecp2<sup>Null/y</sup></italic> neurons convincingly rescued both morphological and physiological phenotypes. Furthermore, this rescue mimicked exogenous BDNF application data, as seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>, in a BDNF- and TrkB-dependent manner as shown by BDNF neutralization and TrkB antagonist experimental data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">4</xref>). Additionally, commercial BDNF antibodies did not work effectively in our hands. Other elegant approaches to test specificity in future studies besides BDNF overexpression, neutralization and TrkB antagonist experiments, may include characterizing BDNF knockdown and rescue with exogenous BDNF. In the case of mixed co-cultures, we have strong proof of sufficient BDNF expression based on glutamatergic synapse number and nucleus size rescue data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C and D</xref>). These data also mimic the in vitro autaptic data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>) as well as in vivo soma and nucleus data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). This co-culture data is particularly significant since we designed a unique in vitro experimental labeling technique to closely mimic Rett in vivo mosaicism, wherein we were able to locate synapse origin based on genotype. To our satisfaction, results matched autaptic and in vivo data, hence confirming robustness of the experimental design.</p><p>To address the second question (exclusion of excitatory synapses on to interneurons), we labeled all co-cultured WT and <italic>Mecp2<sup>Null/y</sup></italic> neurons with VGLUT1, besides MAP2 and intrinsic Syp-mKate and Syp-GFP, to specifically mark excitatory synapses. We were not able to label additionally for the vesicular GABA transporter VGAT since all 4 channels were utilized for MAP2, VGLUT1, Syp-mKate and Syp-GFP. However, in all fields of view analyzed from three hippocampal cultures, we observed that the vast majority of Syp+ synapses were also VGLUT1+. Hence, we believe that excitatory synapses were primarily formed on to excitatory neurons, and contributions of synaptic measurements from excitatory synapses on to interneurons, would did not influence our findings.</p><p><italic>5) Was the person performing the analyses blind to the genotype/treatment of neurons?</italic> </p><p>Yes, of three cultures analyzed, analyses for the first two cultures were done blind to both the genotype as well as treatment of neurons.</p></body></sub-article></article>
