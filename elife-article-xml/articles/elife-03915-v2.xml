differentiated cells, consistent with a role in cell state regulation. We found that Msi genes are rarely mutated but frequently overexpressed in human cancers and are associated with an epithelial-luminal cell state. Using ribosome profiling and RNA-seq analysis, we found that Msi proteins regulate translation of genes implicated in epithelial cell biology and epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT), and promote an epithelial splicing pattern. Overexpression of Msi proteins inhibited the translation of Jagged1, a factor required for EMT, and repressed EMT in cell culture and in mammary gland <italic>in vivo</italic>. Knockdown of Msis in epithelial cancer cells promoted loss of epithelial identity. Our results show that mammalian Msi proteins contribute to an epithelial gene expression program in neural and mammary cell types.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.03915.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.03915.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.03915.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>All living things start life as a single cell, but many organisms develop into a collection of different, specialized cells. Most of the cells in an organism can only divide to make more of the same type of cell; however, stem cells are different because they can ‘differentiate’ and develop into several different cell types.</p><p>A key step in the development of an embryo is called the epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition, in which an epithelial cell—a cell type that normally lines body surfaces and cavities—begins to crawl away from the tissue it is in and starts to differentiate. This transition also allows cancer cells to leave tumors and spread around the body, in a process known as metastasis.</p><p>In mammals, two proteins called Musashi1 and Musashi2 are abundant in stem cells and brain cancers, but are rarely found in specialized tissues and cells. Katz, Li et al. now find that the Musashi proteins are also often overexpressed in human breast, lung, and prostate tumors. In addition, Musashi proteins are much less abundant in cells that have completed an epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition.</p><p>When Katz, Li et al. artificially reduced the amounts of Musashi proteins in breast cancer cells, the cells migrated and dispersed, as if becoming mesenchymal cells. Furthermore, many of the genes normally used in epithelial cells were switched off. In comparison, artificially increasing the levels of Musashi proteins halted the movement of mesenchymal cells and led to increased levels of genes used in epithelial cells, as if they were reverting to epithelial cells. Therefore, it appears that the Musashi proteins prevent epithelial cells from developing mesenchymal properties.</p><p>Katz, Li et al. investigated how Musashi proteins work at the molecular level by studying neural and mammary cells in mice. This revealed that Musashi proteins control the steps that lead to the epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition by binding to the tail end of the RNA molecules that include the instructions to make certain proteins. This affects how often these proteins can be made from the RNA molecules. Katz, Li et al. suggest that Musashi proteins may similarly control the behavior of progenitor and stem cells in many other tissues as well; however, further study is needed to confirm this.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.03915.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.03915.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author keywords</title><kwd>cancer genomic</kwd><kwd>translational regulation</kwd><kwd>alternative splicing</kwd><kwd>epithelial–mesenchymal transition</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000057</institution-id><institution>National Institute of General Medical Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01-GM085319</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Burge</surname><given-names>Christopher B</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000054</institution-id><institution>National Cancer Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>U01-CA184897</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Burge</surname><given-names>Christopher B</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000054</institution-id><institution>National Cancer Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>RO1-CA084198</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Jaenisch</surname><given-names>Rudolf</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000057</institution-id><institution>National Institute of General Medical Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01-GM096193</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Airoldi</surname><given-names>Edoardo M</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Genetic mouse models and human cell lines show that Musashi proteins promote an epithelial/luminal state and inhibit epithelial–mesenchymal transition (EMT), and genome-wide maps of translational regulatory targets connect Musashi proteins to an epithelial alternative splicing program and to the regulation of EMT.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>During both normal development and cancer progression, cells undergo state transitions marked by distinct gene expression profiles and changes in morphology, motility, and other properties. The Epithelial-to-Mesenchymal Transition (EMT) is one such transition, which is essential in development and is thought to be co-opted by tumor cells undergoing metastasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Polyak and Weinberg, 2009</xref>). Much work on cell state transitions in both the stem cell and cancer biology fields has focused on the roles that transcription factors play in driving these transitions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Polyak and Weinberg, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Lee and Young, 2013</xref>), such as the induction of EMT by ectopic expression of the transcription factors Snail, Slug, or Twist (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Mani et al., 2008</xref>).</p><p>Recent work has shown that RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) also play important roles in cell state transitions, by driving post-transcriptional gene expression programs specific to a particular cell state. The epithelial specific regulatory protein (ESRP) family of RBPs are RNA splicing factors with epithelial tissue-specific expression whose ectopic expression can partially reverse EMT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Warzecha et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Shapiro et al., 2011</xref>). RBPs have also been implicated in other cell state transitions, such as reprogramming of somatic cells to induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs), which have the essential characteristics of embryonic stem cells (ESCs). For example, overexpression of the translational regulator and microRNA processing factor Lin28 along with three transcription factors is sufficient to reprogram somatic cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Yu et al., 2007</xref>). The Muscleblind-like (Mbnl) family of RBPs promote differentiation by repressing an ESC-specific alternative splicing program, and inhibition of Mbnls promotes cellular reprogramming (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Han et al., 2013</xref>). For ESRP, Lin28, and Mbnl proteins, the developmental or cell-type-specific expression pattern of the protein provided clues to their functions in the maintenance of epithelial, stem cell, or differentiated cell state.</p><p>The Musashi (Msi) family comprises some of the most highly conserved and tissue-specific RBPs, with <italic>Drosophila Msi</italic> expressed exclusively in the nervous system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Nakamura et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Busch and Hertel, 2011</xref>). In mammals, the two family members <italic>Msi1</italic> and <italic>Msi2</italic> are highly expressed in stem cell compartments but are mostly absent from differentiated tissues. <italic>Msi1</italic> is a marker of neural stem cells (NSCs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Sakakibara et al., 1996</xref>) and is also expressed in stem cells in the gut (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Kayahara et al., 2003</xref>) and epithelial cells in the mammary gland (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Colitti and Farinacci, 2009</xref>), while <italic>Msi2</italic> is expressed in hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Kharas et al., 2010</xref>). This expression pattern led to the proposal that Msi proteins generally mark the epithelial stem cell state across distinct tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Okano et al., 2005</xref>), with HSCs being an exception. <italic>Msi1</italic> is not expressed in the normal adult brain outside a minority of adult NSCs but is induced in glioblastoma (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Muto et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>Msi proteins affect cell proliferation in several cancer types. In glioma and medulloblastoma cell lines, knockdown of <italic>Msi1</italic> reduced the colony-forming capacity of these cells and reduced their tumorigenic growth in a xenograft assay in mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Muto et al., 2012</xref>). Msi expression correlates with HER2 expression in breast cancer cell lines, and knockdown of Msi proteins resulted in decreased proliferation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Wang et al., 2010</xref>). These observations, together with the cell-type specific expression of Msi proteins in normal development, suggested that Msi proteins might function as regulators of cell state, with potential relevance to cancer.</p><p>Msi proteins have been proposed to act as translational repressors of mRNAs—and sometimes as activators (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">MacNicol et al., 2011</xref>)—when bound to mRNA 3′ UTRs, and were speculated to affect pre-mRNA processing in <italic>Drosophila</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Nakamura et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Okano et al., 2002</xref>). However, no conclusive genome-wide evidence for either role has been reported for the mammalian Msi family. Here, we aimed to investigate the roles of these proteins in human cancers and to gain a better understanding of their genome-wide effects on the transcriptome using mouse models.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Msi genes are frequently overexpressed in multiple human cancers</title><p>To obtain a broad view of the role Msis might play in human cancer, we surveyed the expression and mutation profiles of Msi genes in primary tumors using genomic and RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) data from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Cancer Genome Atlas Network., 2012</xref>). To determine whether Msi genes are generally upregulated in human cancers, we analyzed RNA-Seq data from five cancer types for which matched tumor-control pairs were available. In these matched designs, a pair of RNA samples was obtained in parallel from a single patient's tumor and healthy tissue-matched biopsy, thus minimizing the contribution of individual genetic variation to expression differences. We observed that <italic>Msi1</italic> was upregulated in at least 40% of breast, lung, and prostate tumors, while <italic>Msi2</italic> was upregulated in at least 50% of breast and prostate tumors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, top). Overall, <italic>Msi1</italic> or <italic>Msi2</italic> were significantly upregulated in matched tumor-control pairs for 3 of the 5 cancer types, compared to control pairs. Kidney tumors showed the opposite expression pattern, with <italic>Msi1</italic> and <italic>Msi2</italic> downregulated in a majority of tumors and rarely upregulated, and in thyroid cancer neither <italic>Msi1</italic> nor <italic>Msi2</italic> showed a strong bias towards up- or down-regulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, top). In breast tumors, a bimodal distribution of <italic>Msi1</italic> expression was observed, with a roughly even split between up- and down-regulation of <italic>Msi1</italic>, consistent with the idea that <italic>Msi1</italic> upregulation might be specific to a subtype of breast tumors. The bimodality of <italic>Msi1</italic> expression was not seen when comparing control pairs, so is not explained by general variability in <italic>Msi1</italic> levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, bottom, solid vs dotted lines).<fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.03915.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Msi genes are frequently overexpressed in breast, lung, and prostate cancer but downregulated in kidney cancer.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Top: percentage of matched tumor–control pairs with upregulated (black-fill bars) or downregulated (grey-fill bars) <italic>Msi1</italic> or <italic>Msi2</italic> in five cancer types with matched RNA-Seq data.

One notable exception was kidney cancer (KIRC), where non-silent mutations in <italic>Msi1</italic> were significantly overrepresented, detectable in 9% of tumors (ranked in the 99<sup>th</sup> percentile of mutations per gene in this cancer) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>). This observation, together with the lower Msi mRNA levels observed in matched kidney tumors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>), is consistent with a model in which loss of Msi function is selected for in kidney tumor cells, either as a result of downregulation or mutation. The observation that <italic>Msi1</italic>/<italic>Msi2</italic> was not significantly mutated in most tumors but are overexpressed in several tumor types (including glioblastoma) makes their profile more similar to oncogenes like FOS or HER2, than to tumor suppressors like PTEN and TP53, which tend to have the opposite pattern (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Verhaak et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Cancer Genome Atlas Network., 2012</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Msi expression marks an epithelial-luminal state and is downregulated upon EMT</title><p>To determine whether Msi overexpression is specific to a particular cancer cell state, we focused on breast cancer, where tumors with distinct properties can be robustly classified by gene expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Parker et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Cancer Genome Atlas Network., 2012</xref>).

Using this classification, we found that <italic>Msi2</italic> was highly expressed in Luminal tumors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). <italic>Msi1</italic> was more variable across tumor subtypes, often showing a bimodal profile, split between up- and down-regulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1B</xref>). <italic>Msi2</italic> expression was highest in Luminal B tumors, which are known to be more aggressive and highly proliferating (Ki67-high) than Luminal A types and are thought to share properties with epithelial mammary progenitor cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Das et al., 2013</xref>).

MSI1 expression was predominantly cytoplasmic (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>, top panel). Across luminal tumors, MSI1 was co-expressed with ECAD (as in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>, top panel). In triple negative/basal-like tumors, a minority of ECAD-positive cells showed strong MSI1 staining, whereas ECAD-negative cells showed little to no expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>, blue and red arrowheads, respectively), supporting an association between Msi and epithelial cell state in tumors. Given the heterogeneity of human tumor samples, it is possible that the increased expression of Msi genes in luminal tumors (compared with basal) reflects the generally higher fraction of epithelial cells in these tumors.</p><p>To explore whether Msi expression is associated with a luminal as opposed to basal state in a more homogenous system, we analyzed RNA-Seq data for luminal and basal breast cancer cell lines generated by multiple independent labs (RNA-Seq data sets used are listed in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Supplementary file 1</xref>). Gene expression profiles from the same cell lines generated independently tended to cluster together in unsupervised clustering (supporting consistency of data across labs), and overall the basal cell lines were distinguishable from the luminal lines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A</xref>). Matching the pattern observed in primary tumors, we observed higher <italic>Msi1</italic> and <italic>Msi2</italic> expression in luminal breast cancer lines than in basal lines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>, left panel). Expression of Fibronectin (<italic>Fn1</italic>), Vimentin (<italic>Vim</italic>), and Jagged1 (<italic>Jag1</italic>), which are associated with the basal/mesenchymal state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Yamamoto et al., 2013</xref>), had the opposite pattern, showing strong enrichment in basal over luminal lines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>, right panel). The enrichments of these four genes for either the luminal or basal state were unusual when compared to the background distribution of these enrichments across all expressed genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1C</xref>), indicating that these genes are strong indicators of the two states.</p><p>To further investigate the connection between Msi expression and EMT in breast cancer, we examined Msi expression in a panel of breast cancer-derived cell lines. Consistent with the RNA-Seq data from primary tumors, HER2+ epithelial cell lines expressed higher levels of <italic>Msi1</italic> and <italic>Msi2</italic> compared with HER2– lines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>, lane 6 and 7). A standard cell culture model of EMT is the immortalized inducible-Twist human mammary epithelial (HMLE-Twist) cell line, which undergoes EMT when induced to express the transcription factor Twist (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Mani et al., 2008</xref>). We found that <italic>Msi1</italic> was strongly downregulated in HMLE cells following Twist-induced EMT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>), consistent with the epithelial-associated expression pattern of Msis in primary tumors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A–C</xref>). Similarly, Msi protein expression was higher in luminal, HER2+ breast cancer lines (BT474, SKBR3 in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>) compared with basal HER2– breast cancer lines (brain and bone metastatic derivatives of MDAMB231, 231-Brain and 231-Bone, and SUM159 in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>).</p><p>We next asked whether the epithelial expression signature of Msis is present in other primary tumors. Given the established role of Msi proteins as regulators of Glioblastoma (GBM) cell growth and as markers of primary tumors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Muto et al., 2012</xref>), we examined whether there is a similar subtype expression pattern in GBM tumors from TCGA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Verhaak et al., 2010</xref>). We used an EMT gene signature to rank GBM tumors from more epithelial to more mesenchymal, based on the similarity of each tumor's gene expression profile to that of cells undergoing EMT in culture (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Feng et al., 2014</xref>). Using this ranking, we found that the top 20 most epithelial tumors expressed higher levels of Msi and epithelial markers like ECAD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>). By contrast, the top 20 most mesenchymal tumors expressed lower levels of Msi and higher levels of mesenchymal markers like Fibronectin and Vimentin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>). Thus, Msi expression is enriched in epithelial tumors in GBM as well, consistent with the results obtained in breast cancer tumors and cell lines.</p><p>Taken together, these results show that Msi genes are rarely mutated but frequently overexpressed across human cancers and are strong markers of the epithelial-luminal state. This pattern suggests that Msi proteins may play a role in the maintenance of an epithelial state and/or repression of EMT, in both breast and neural cell types. To better understand the molecular functions of Msi proteins, we turned to a controlled cell culture system.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Genetic system for inducible overexpression and depletion of <italic>Msi1/2</italic> in NSCs</title><p>The upregulation of Msi genes in glioblastoma motivated the choice of NSCs as a system to study the molecular roles of Msi proteins, a cell type where both proteins are highly expressed in normal development, and where their target mRNAs are likely to be present.

The high similarity between MSI1 and MSI2 proteins (over 70% identity at the amino acid level, with highly similar RNA recognition motifs) suggests similarity in function, and we confirmed that <italic>Msi2</italic> overexpression also repressed JAG1 protein expression by Western analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4H</xref>). To directly test the hypothesis that Msi proteins regulate <italic>Jag1</italic> translation via UTR binding, we constructed luciferase reporters for the <italic>Jag1</italic> 3' UTR and transfected these into 293T cells.

To compare mouse and human splicing patterns, we identified human alternative exon trios orthologous to mouse alternative and flanking exon trios using synteny in a multi-genome alignment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref> and Supp. ‘Materials and methods’).

Here, we show that Msi proteins are associated with the epithelial-luminal cell state in several cancer types, notably breast cancer, where Msi genes are highly enriched in luminal tumors and luminal breast cancer cell lines. We showed that in breast cancer cells, knockdown of Msi genes leads to loss of epithelial identity and upregulation of mesenchymal markers, while their ectopic activation promotes the epithelial state and suppresses mesenchymal properties such as cell migration. As in cancer cells, overexpression of <italic>Msi2</italic> in healthy mammary gland tissue suppressed EMT and resulted in a defective mammary ductal branching pattern. These observations all support a role for Msi proteins in maintenance of a luminal/epithelial cell state and inhibition of EMT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>). The consistency between our observations in mammary epithelial cells and NSCs and between mouse and human suggests that these functions are shared across cell types and evolutionarily conserved.<fig id="fig8" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.03915.022</object-id><label>Figure 8.</label><caption><title>Model for Msi roles in regulation of cell state.</title><p>Model for Msi role in the control of the epithelial state.

We showed that Msi proteins can translationally repress <italic>Jag1</italic>, an important regulator of Notch signaling. However, the role of Notch signaling in cancer remains complex and may vary between cancer types (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Dickson et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Lobry et al., 2011</xref>). The upregulation of <italic>Jag1</italic> in the basal state suggests that Notch pathway activity is high in and required for the entry into the mesenchymal state, consistent with previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Zavadil et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Dickson et al., 2007</xref>). In mammary epithelial cells, <italic>Jag1</italic>-triggered activation of Notch was shown to reduce E-cadherin expression and increase Slug expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Leong et al., 2007</xref>). Furthermore, <italic>Jag1</italic> activation in breast cancer cells promotes their metastasis into the bone in vivo by activating Notch in neighboring bone cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Sethi et al., 2011</xref>). The dependence of EMT on Notch activation has been observed in normal development as well. During heart development, cardiac valves are generated from endocardium through EMT, and Notch activity was shown to be required for this process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Timmerman et al., 2004</xref>). Collectively, these studies are consistent with our working model in which Msi represses <italic>Jag1</italic> translationally, in turn altering Notch activity required for EMT.</p><p>The molecular mechanisms by which Msi proteins regulate translation of a subset of mRNAs like <italic>Jag1</italic> remains unclear. Our genome-wide data and in vitro binding assays indicate that Msi proteins act by binding UAG-containing motifs at 3' UTRs of messages. A model where Msi proteins repress translation by outcompeting eIF4G for PolyA-binding protein (PABP) was proposed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Kawahara et al., 2008</xref>), but the conditions under which binding to mRNA results in translational repression are unclear, since only a subset of mRNAs are detectably regulated. It is possible that co-factors are required in vivo for Msi to affect translation following binding to the mRNA. It is also possible that other RNA-binding factors outcompete Msi protein for binding, though MSI1 has relative high RNA-binding affinity. The molecular mechanism underlying Musashi-dependent translational control and the nature of any co-factors involved are not known.</p><p>This study complements recent reports of the involvement of post-transcriptional regulatory factors in cell state maintenance and EMT. For example, the epithelial-specific splicing factors of the ESRP family play important roles in maintenance of epithelial state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Warzecha et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Reinke et al., 2012</xref>). A recent study presented evidence that the transcription factor Snail can promote the mesenchymal state in part by repressing <italic>Esrp1</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Reinke et al., 2012</xref>), further highlighting the importance of post-transcriptional control in driving cell state transitions like EMT.</p><p>Like master transcription factors, master post-transcriptional regulatory factors globally alter gene expression—by affecting RNA splicing, stability, localization, or translation—which makes them suitable for controlling cell identity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Jangi and Sharp, 2014</xref>). Our study shows that post-transcriptional regulatory factors like Msi proteins can impact both translation and pre-mRNA splicing, utilizing multiple layers of RNA regulation to reshape the transcriptome for a particular cell state. Many of the impacted splicing events are part of an epithelial splicing program, suggesting that effects of Msis on splicing may reinforce the effects of <italic>Jag1</italic> repression on maintenance of epithelial cell state. The predominantly cytoplasmic expression of Msis makes it likely that splicing is affected indirectly, e.g., through translational regulation of specific splicing factors, though our data do not rule out that a small fraction of Msi protein may be nuclear localized and could directly regulate splicing. We have also observed that other RBPs are also enriched in the epithelial state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Shapiro et al., 2011</xref>), suggesting that RBPs as a group may play a broad role in maintenance of this state, and might provide attractive targets for therapeutic efforts to manipulate cell state.</p><p>Msi proteins are co-expressed with various proliferation markers in a wide variety of stem cell niches, including the breast, stomach, intestine, lung, and brain. This observation suggests the hypothesis that Msis may act as general epithelial stem cell/progenitor regulators across tissues. Our findings are consistent with this hypothesis, but further study of Msi in multiple stem cell compartments will be needed to directly test it. The role of Msi in the normal development and transformation of other adult tissues will also be important to understand. For example, our observation that Msi is frequently overexpressed in lung tumors suggests that ectopic expression of Msi proteins in the lung could elucidate their role in lung cancer. Furthermore, the systematic downregulation of <italic>Msi1/Msi2</italic> and high frequency of <italic>Msi1</italic> mutations in kidney tumors suggests that kidney would be an informative model for studying Msi loss-of-function and its consequences in cancer.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Mouse strains and derivation of neural stem cell lines</title><p>Inducible overexpression mice (tetO-Msi1/Msi2) were generated as previously described in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Beard et al.

Inguinal mammary glands were spread on glass slides, fixed in Carnoy's fixative (6:3:1, 100% ethanol: chloroform: glacial acetic acid) for 2 to 4 hr at room temperature, washed in 70% ethanol for 15 min, rinsed through graded alcohol followed by distilled water for 5 min, then stained in carmine alum overnight, washed in 70%, 95%, 100% ethanol for 15 min each, cleared in xylene, and mounted with Permount.</p></sec><sec id="s4-18"><title>Immunofluorescence on mammary gland sections</title><p>Mammary glands were fixed in 4% PFA, paraffin-embedded and 5-μm sections were used for immunofluorescence assay. Paraffin sections were microwave pretreated and incubated with primary antibodies, then incubated with secondary antibodies (Invitrogen) and counterstained with DAPI in mounting media. The following antibodies were used: anti-K14 (Abcam), anti-K8 (Abcam), anti-E-cadherin (CST), anti-Msi2 (Novus Biologicals), anti-Hes1 (Abcam), anti-Slug (CST).</p></sec><sec id="s4-19"><title>Quantitative RT-PCR analysis in mammary glands</title><p>Mouse mammary epithelial cells were prepared according to the manufacturer's protocol (StemCell Technologies, Vancouver, Canada). Briefly, following removal of the lymph node, mammary glands dissected from 10-week-old virgin female mice were digested in EpiCult-B with 5% fetal bovine serum (FBS), 300 U/ml collagenase, and 100 U/ml hyaluronidase for 8 hr at 37°C. After vortexing and lysis of the red blood cells in NH<sub>4</sub>Cl, mammary epithelial cells were obtained by sequential dissociation of the fragments by gentle pipetting for 1–2 min in 0.25% trypsin, and 2 min in 5 mg/ml dispase plus 0.1 mg/ml DNase I (DNase; Sigma). Total RNA was isolated from mammary epithelial cells. Complementary DNA was prepared using the MMLV cDNA synthesis kit (Promega). Quantitative RT-PCR was performed using the SYBR-green detection system (Roche).

The authors initially analyze tumour and normal tissue RNA-Seq data from the Cancer Genomic Atlas repository, as well as from cancer cell lines, to document changes between Msi expression and specific cancer/normal cell types. Ribosome profiling and RNA-sequencing analyses are then used to identify Msi mRNA targets. The results suggest that Msi functions in establishing epithelial status. An important finding is that Msi proteins inhibit the translation of the Notch ligand Jag, which plays an important role in EMT. An indirect role for Msi proteins in alternative splicing is also suggested. The data supporting the first set of observations and associated conclusions in the manuscript are extensive, well presented, and backed by statistical analyses. The second part of the manuscript documents cellular phenotypes associated with altered expression of Msi. While these data are less quantitative, overall they are consistent with the view that Msi contributes to establishing and maintaining the epithelial state in both cancerous and normal developmental contexts.</p><p>Main points:</p><p>1) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>. The relationship between Msi expression and cancer is complex, as expression levels for these factors display increases and decreases within the same type of cancer, between different cancers, and there are also substantial differences between Msi1 and Msi2 expression. Given that tumors are typically highly heterogeneous and that epithelial tumor tissues are often contaminated with surrounding normal stromal/mesenchymal cells, do the above variations reflect this heterogeneity? While the subsequent analysis of cell lines partially addresses this issue, the authors should at least discuss that levels of Msi in tumour tissues may be more reflective of epithelial content than cancerous state.</p><p>2) It would be informative to use the Cancer Genomic Atlas data to compare expression levels of additional RBPs that have been linked to post-transcriptional regulatory programs associated with EMT/MET transitions, such as RBFOX2 and MBNLs. In this regard, the authors are referred to relevant work by Venables et al. (Mol Cell Biol. 2013 Jan;33(2):396-405), which should be referenced.</p><p>3) The authors' study would be strengthened by providing a more definitive functional link between one or more targets of Msi1/2 and epithelial state. For example, they could test whether Jag1 knockdown and/or over-expression rescues Msi manipulations in scratch wound (see below), or cell scatter assays in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A and C</xref>, respectively.</p><p>4) The authors should provide more information on how they define Msi translation targets. How many genes were considered as targets? What fraction of genes have 3' UTRs enriched in UAGs (in the 85% percentile range) that are not regulated by Msi?</p><p>5) The changes in splicing are proposed to be indirect, in large part because the bulk of Msi proteins are cytoplasmic. However, a possible direct role should be acknowledged in the absence of additional data.</p><p>6) It is an overstatement to say that Msi OE inhibits wound healing. Wound healing is a complex process that is tightly regulated and involves multiple layers of tissues acting in a coordinated way. To say that Msis inhibit wound healing may be taken to suggest that the authors have observed Msis actually acting in the process of wound healing rather than in the in vitro phenotypic scratch wound assay. The authors should change their language from “wound healing” to “migration”.</p><p>7) The authors should verify induction of EMT upon knock down of Msis in the cell scatter assays in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>, and recovery of an epithelial phenotype upon Msi expression in the scratch assays.</p><p>8) Msi OE causes a slight delay in cell migration as it may also do to mammary ductal branching. The defect in mammary ductal branching is actually unclear (is it amplitude, number of branches?). Where possible, quantification should be applied. The authors propose that mammary gland development is a « a type of EMT ». References linking mammary development to EMT should be provided.</p><p>9) Typically, EMT has been linked to metastasis. It would be most relevant to test the impact of Msi OE on the metastatic potential of cancer cells injected into mice.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.03915.025</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p>Our primary new results are summarized below. We have:</p><p>1) Showed that knockdown of Msi1/Msi2 in luminal breast cancer cell lines decreases epithelial marker expression, and increases mesenchymal marker expression. We showed this using qRT-PCR for EMT markers, as suggested by reviewers. We additionally overexpressed Msi1 in a mesenchymal breast cancer cell line, which resulted in reduced mesenchymal marker expression and increased epithelial marker expression, supporting our model that Msi activation promotes an epithelial state.</p><p>2) Performed a transwell migration in a mesenchymal cancer cell line and showed that overexpression of Msi1 significantly hinders migration, consistent with Msi activation suppressing EMT.</p><p>3) Further explored regulation of Msi targets, by performing luciferase reporter assays for the Notch-ligand <italic>Jag1.</italic> We showed that knockdown of Msi1/Msi2 in 293T cells increases expression of the <italic>Jag1</italic> 3’ UTR reporter, supporting our model that <italic>Jag1</italic> protein expression is regulated by Msi binding to its 3' UTR. This result not only further strengthens Msi’s role in regulating <italic>Jag1</italic>, but also demonstrates that this regulation is conserved in human cells. Finally, we showed that Msi2 overexpression in the healthy mouse mammary gland results in reduced <italic>Jag1</italic> expression. Together, our results show that Msi proteins regulate <italic>Jag1</italic> in mouse and human, and across distinct cell types (NSCs and mammary epithelial cells).</p><p>4) Extended our computational analyses to other EMT-associated RNA-binding proteins in the TCGA dataset, as suggested by reviewers, and clarified our methods of analysis.</p><p>5) Quantified the ductal branching phenotype in mammary glands of Msi2 overexpressing mice.</p><p><italic>Main points:</italic></p><p><italic>1)</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1"><italic>Figure 1</italic></xref><italic>.

(Mol Cell Biol. 2013 Jan;33(2):396-405), which should be referenced</italic>.</p><p>We examined the expression of RBFOX2 and MBNL1 in breast cancer tumors from TCGA. Consistent with the findings of Venables et. al. (2013), we observed that both RBFOX2 and MBNL1 are more highly expressed in basal tumors compared with the epithelial-luminal tumor subtypes. These data are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2–figure supplement 2</xref>, and we have added a citation of Venables et. al. 2013 to the text.</p><p><italic>3) The authors' study would be strengthened by providing a more definitive functional link between one or more targets of Msi1/2 and epithelial state.

We showed that translation of a reporter with the Jag1 3' UTR is enhanced by knockdown of Msi1/Msi2 in 293T cells. These experiments strengthen the link between Msi and Jag1 and also demonstrate that the regulation of Jag1 by Msi is conserved in human cells. The responses to MPs 7 &amp; 8 below provide more information. In addition, we now show that Jag1 protein expression is reduced in mouse mammary glands following overexpression of Msi2.</p><p><italic>4) The authors should provide more information on how they define Msi translation targets. How many genes were considered as targets? What fraction of genes have 3' UTRs enriched in UAGs (in the 85% percentile range) that are not regulated by Msi?</italic></p><p>We have included more information in the manuscript on how translational targets were defined using filters to eliminate genes with low read coverage or large mRNA level changes and requiring a minimum 3-fold change in TE. The majority of genes containing the UAG motif in the 3' UTR are not translationally regulated by Msi in NPCs, since only a small number of genes were differentially translated, while the UAG motif is relatively common in 3' UTR regions. For example, only 39 genes in were differentially expressed in the Msi1 overexpression experiments, out of which only a handful of genes showed very large changes in TE. It is possible that co-factors are required in vivo for Msi to affect translation following binding to the mRNA, or that other RNA-binding factors outcompete Msi protein for binding. The molecular mechanism underlying Musashi-dependent translational control and the nature of any co-factors involved are not known.</p><p><italic>5) The changes in splicing are proposed to be indirect, in large part because the bulk of Msi proteins are cytoplasmic. However, a possible direct role should be acknowledged in the absence of additional data</italic>.</p><p>We agree that we cannot exclude based on current data that Msi proteins directly affect splicing and have added this point to the Discussion.</p><p><italic>6) It is an overstatement to say that Msi OE inhibits wound healing. Wound healing is a complex process that is tightly regulated and involves multiple layers of tissues acting in a coordinated way.

The authors should change their language from “wound healing” to “migration”</italic>.</p><p>We agree with the reviewers that “migration” is more precise than “wound healing” given our data. We have changed the text to use “migration” in place of “wound healing”, and used a new assay to specifically test migration (see response to MPs 7 &amp; 8 below).</p><p><italic>7) The authors should verify induction of EMT upon knock down of Msis in the cell scatter assays in</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6"><italic>Figure 6</italic></xref><italic>, and recovery of an epithelial phenotype upon Msi expression in the scratch assays</italic>.</p><p>Response is combined with response to main point 8 below.</p><p><italic>8) Msi OE causes a slight delay in cell migration as it may also do to mammary ductal branching.

We verified induction of EMT upon knockdown of Msis in cancer cell lines, where the EMT transition is most relevant. Our new data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>) show that epithelial markers are generally downregulated while mesenchymal markers are upregulated upon knockdown of Msis in an epithelial cancer cell line. To further solidify this connection, we overexpressed Msi1 in a mesenchymal cell line (MDAMB231) where Msi1 levels were initially extremely low. We found that Msi1 overexpression led to a decrease in mesenchymal markers and an increase in epithelial markers, consistent with our model that Msi proteins promote an epithelial state. To address reviewer comments regarding cell migration, we performed a migration transwell assay in breast cancer cell lines. We found that overexpression of Msi1 in the mesenchymal cell line LM2 (a derivative of MDAMB231) strongly impaired migration in the transwell assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>). These migration assays are more quantitative and controlled than the scratch assay we performed previously, and we feel that the use of breast cancer cell lines for migration analysis is particularly relevant, given the roles for EMT in breast cancer.</p><p>We added quantitation and additional explanation of the mammary ductal branching phenotype that occurs upon Msi2 overexpression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7–figure supplement 1</xref>). The results show that Msi2 overexpression reduces the number of ductal branch points by approximately twofold at both 4 weeks and 7 weeks following induction of Msi2 (both P &lt; 0.01 by t-test), and that Msi2 overexpression also delays ductal branch growth (P &lt; 0.01 at 4 weeks, but indistinguishable from control at 7 weeks).</p><p><italic>9) Typically, EMT has been linked to metastasis. It would be most relevant to test the impact of Msi OE on the metastatic potential of cancer cells injected into mice</italic>.</p><p>We agree that it would be worthwhile to investigate the impact of Musashi proteins on metastasis in vivo, but we feel that this is beyond the scope of our manuscript. While we have linked Musashi proteins to regulation of the epithelial state and EMT in cancer (through functional analysis of cancer cell lines and computational analysis of TCGA data), and in normal development (through in vivo analyses of healthy mammary gland development), we do not directly address metastasis in this work. We have been careful not to imply in the text that our work bears directly on metastasis, or that the role of Musashi proteins in cancer occurs through their effect on metastatic processes. We believe that our results on the regulation of the epithelial state (and of EMT in a healthy mammary gland context) have consequences that are significant independent of possible effects on metastasis, and may not directly bear on metastasis. In some cancers like glioblastoma, where Msis are highly expressed, metastases are rare. In breast cancer, highly proliferative epithelial tumors (like Luminal B type tumors) can be aggressive and harmful to patients without possessing the mesenchymal properties that lead to metastases. Therefore, we feel that potential links to metastasis are very worthwhile to explore, but are not essential to the conclusions of this paper.</p></body></sub-article></article>
