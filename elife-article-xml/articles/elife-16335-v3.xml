In M71 transgenic mice with a “monoclonal nose”, glomerular input patterns in the olfactory bulb are massively perturbed and olfactory behaviors are altered. To gain insights into how olfactory circuits can process such degraded inputs we characterized odor-evoked responses of olfactory bulb mitral cells and interneurons. Surprisingly, calcium imaging experiments reveal that mitral cell responses in M71 transgenic mice are largely normal, highlighting a remarkable capacity of olfactory circuits to normalize sensory input. In vivo whole cell recordings suggest that feedforward inhibition from olfactory bulb periglomerular cells can mediate this signal normalization. Together, our results identify inhibitory circuits in the olfactory bulb as a mechanistic basis for many of the behavioral phenotypes of mice with a “monoclonal nose” and highlight how substantially degraded odor input can be transformed to yield meaningful olfactory bulb output.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.16335.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.16335.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.16335.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>The lining of the nose contains cells called olfactory sensory neurons that allow different smells to be detected. Odor molecules bind to receptor proteins that are embedded in the surface of the olfactory sensory neuron. Different receptors respond to different odors, and the nose contains hundreds of different receptors that work together to distinguish thousands of scents. When an odor molecule binds to a receptor, it triggers a pattern of electrical activity in the neuron. These patterns are the building blocks that allow smells to be recognized and if necessary, acted upon – by not eating food that smells rancid, for example.</p><p>In 2008, researchers genetically engineered mice so that nearly all of their olfactory sensory neurons produced the same type of olfactory receptor. Unexpectedly, these mice could still detect and discriminate between many different smells. Now, Roland, Jordan, Sosulski et al. – including several of the researchers involved in the 2008 study – have tracked the brain activity of these mice as they were exposed to various smells to find out how they can recognize such a wide range of odors with such a limited repertoire of receptors.</p><p>The results of the experiments revealed that neural circuits in the brains of these modified mice still produce largely normal patterns of activity in response to an odor. This ‘normalization’ of activity relies on a fine balance between ‘excitatory’ processes that increase the activity of neurons and ‘inhibitory’ processes that reduce this activity.</p><p>Overall, the findings of Roland, Jordan, Sosulski et al. provide a link between how a scent is detected and how this information is processed in the brain. In future experiments, it will be important to determine how this processing of odor information is influenced by learning and experience to generate the long-lasting odor memories that guide behavior.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.16335.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.16335.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>olfaction</kwd><kwd>olfactory bulb</kwd><kwd>signal normalization</kwd><kwd>excitation/inhibition balance</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100002915</institution-id><institution>Fondation pour la Recherche Médicale</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>AJE201106</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Fleischmann</surname><given-names>Alexander</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000265</institution-id><institution>Medical Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>MC_UP_1202/5</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Schaefer</surname><given-names>Andreas T</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004189</institution-id><institution>Max-Planck-Gesellschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>DFG-SPP 684 1392</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Schaefer</surname><given-names>Andreas T</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100005156</institution-id><institution>Alexander von Humboldt-Stiftung</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Fukunaga</surname><given-names>Izumi</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000780</institution-id><institution>European Commission</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>IRG 276869</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Fleischmann</surname><given-names>Alexander</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>DC009839</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Franks</surname><given-names>Kevin M</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Inhibitory circuits in the olfactory bulb can amplify or suppress sensory inputs over a wide range of intensities to generate robust mitral cell output.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Odorants in the environment are detected by a large repertoire of odorant receptor, expressed on the dendrites of sensory neurons in the olfactory epithelium (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Buck and Axel, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Zhang and Firestein, 2002</xref>). In mice, each olfactory sensory neuron expresses only one of ~1300 odorant receptor genes, and each of these receptors interacts with multiple odorants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chess et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Malnic et al., 1999</xref>). Neurons expressing a given receptor are distributed randomly across large zones of the olfactory epithelium, but project to two spatially invariant glomeruli in the olfactory bulb, the first processing center of olfactory information in the mammalian brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Ressler et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Vassar et al., 1994</xref>). Thus, the distributed pattern of neural activity that is evoked by the binding of an odorant to a given receptor in the olfactory epithelium is transformed into a topographically organized, invariant map of glomerular activity at the level of the olfactory bulb (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bozza et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Meister and Bonhoeffer, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Rubin and Katz, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Uchida et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Wachowiak and Cohen, 2001</xref>).</p><p>The principal neurons of the olfactory bulb, mitral and tufted cells, extend their apical dendrite into a single glomerulus, and thus only receive direct input from sensory neurons expressing a single odorant receptor. Electrophysiological and imaging experiments have revealed that, consistent with this anatomical organization, mitral cells tend to be narrowly tuned and only respond to a small number of odorants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Davison and Katz, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Tan et al., 2010</xref>). The spatiotemporal patterns of mitral cell firing are strongly shaped by the activity of local inhibitory neurons, including periglomerular cells, EPL interneurons, and granule cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Banerjee et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Fukunaga et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Kato et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Luo and Katz, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Miyamichi et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Yokoi et al., 1995</xref>). Ultimately, mitral and tufted cells relay this odor information to several higher brain regions, including the piriform cortex, amygdala, and entorhinal cortex, via a dense elaboration of axonal projections (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Ghosh et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Igarashi et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Luskin and Price, 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Miyamichi et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Nagayama et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Sosulski et al., 2011</xref>). How the patterns of activity evoked by odor stimulation in the cells of the olfactory bulb ultimately relate to odor perception, discrimination, and behavior, however, remains largely undefined.</p><p>A major challenge for the olfactory system is that it must function across a wide range of stimulus intensities. For example, salient odor cues must reliably be detectable against strong and highly dynamic background odors. To explore potential neural mechanisms that can mediate such signal amplification and noise reduction we used previously generated M71 transgenic mice with a 'monoclonal nose' (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Fleischmann et al., 2008</xref>). In these mice, more than 95% of all olfactory sensory neurons express a single odorant receptor, M71. As a consequence of this genetic manipulation, the frequency of sensory neurons expressing endogenous odorant receptor genes is reduced 20-fold, and the canonical glomerular odor map observed in wild-type mice disappears: most odorants now fail to elicit detectable levels of glomerular activity, while the majority of glomeruli respond to acetophenone, a known M71 ligand (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>).</p><p>Surprisingly, despite this striking alteration of odor-evoked neural activity, M71 transgenic mice are able to smell a variety of odors. They can detect and discriminate several odorants in a go/no go operant conditioning task, although their performance in this task decreases compared to controls when M71 transgenic mice are required to discriminate mixtures of structurally and perceptually similar odorants. Moreover, M71 transgenic mice fail to discriminate acetophenone, a known strong M71 ligand, from air in this go/no go discrimination assay, despite the fact that acetophenone activates the vast majority of sensory neurons and glomeruli in these mice.</p><p>This apparent discrepancy between molecular alteration and receptor neuron physiology on the one side and behavioral phenotype on the other now allows us to investigate the neural mechanisms at play: What does allow M71 transgenic mice to detect and discriminate most odorants despite the 20-fold decrease in the expression of endogenous odorant receptors? Conversely, what underlies the inability of these mice to detect the pervasive glomerular activity evoked by acetophenone? To explore the link between odor-evoked sensory neuron activity and behavior we analyzed the activity of olfactory bulb mitral cells, the main output neurons of the olfactory bulb. Two-photon calcium imaging and whole cell patch-clamp recordings of mitral cells revealed that mitral cell odor responses in M71 transgenic mice greatly resembled the responses observed in wild-type mice. Indeed, the fraction of responsive mitral cells and odor-evoked changes in firing rates were indistinguishable from controls. Calcium imaging and whole cell recordings further indicated that much of this normalization of odor-evoked activity is achieved through inhibition by periglomerular interneurons. Finally, we found that M71 transgenic mice exhibit spontaneous sniff adaptation in response to acetophenone exposure, suggesting that while they consistently fail to discriminate acetophenone from air in a go/no-go operant conditioning tasks they are indeed able to detect the presence of acetophenone. Together, our data reveal that odor-evoked patterns of glomerular activity can be substantially transformed by olfactory bulb neural circuits, to extract meaningful odor information from massively degraded sensory input and point towards a key role of glomerular inhibition.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>The ability of M71 transgenic mice to detect acetophenone is task-dependent</title><p>Previous behavioral experiments using a go/no go operant conditioning task indicated that M71 transgenic mice failed to discriminate acetophenone from its diluent, mineral oil, but could detect and discriminate other odorants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Fleischmann et al., 2008</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). To better understand the link between odor-evoked neural activity and behavior we first replicated these behavioral observations with an independent cohort of mice. Consistent with our initial observations, we found that M71 transgenic mice consistently failed to detect acteophenone in this task (acetophenone versus mineral oil, repeated measure ANOVA, (block x genotype) F<sub>(9,90)</sub> = 5.43, p&lt;0.001), yet readily discriminated other pairs of odorants (ethyl acetate versus mineral oil, citronellol, or carvone, (block x genotype) F<sub>(9,90)</sub> = 1.49, p=0.17, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A and B</xref>). Individual experiments consisted of 10 blocks of 20 odor presentations, and all 15 M71 transgenic mice failed to reach a 'correct lick ratio' surpassing 75%.

To address this question we measured exploratory sniffing behavior in response to novel odors, a simple, spontaneous test for odor perception, which does not require training (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Welker, 1964</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Wesson et al., 2008</xref>). As previously described, wild-type mice exhibited increased sniff frequencies when exposed to a novel odorant (mean response = 2.1 Hz, SD = 1.6 Hz) that then decreased upon repeated presentation of the same odorant (mean response for 2<sup>nd</sup> and 3<sup>rd</sup> presentation = 0.3 Hz, SD = 1.2 Hz, p=3.3 x10<sup>-7</sup>, paired t-test 1<sup>st</sup> presentation versus mean of 2<sup>nd</sup> and 3<sup>rd</sup>, n = 27 mouse-odor pairs, n = 7 mice, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C–F</xref>). Consistent with their ability to detect and discriminate most odorants, M71 transgenic mice exhibited an initial increase in sniff frequency to ethyl acetate, hexanone, heptanal, or a mixture of isoamyl acetate, 2-nonanone and cyclohexanol (referred to as 'non-acetophenone' odors in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>, mean response = 2.7 Hz, SD = 1.4 Hz). This response was indistinguishable from controls (p=0.12, t-test), and similarly displayed a significant decrease in sniff frequencies upon re-exposure (p=1.7 x 10<sup>–8</sup>, paired t-test, n = 29 mouse-odor pairs, n = 8 mice, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>). Surprisingly, similar results were obtained for acetophenone presentations: both control and M71 transgenic mice displayed initial high frequency responses (control: mean = 3.0 Hz, SD = 1.6 Hz; M71 transgenic: mean = 3.8 Hz, SD = 1.9 Hz, p=0.38, t-test), and reductions in response frequencies during the second and third acetophenone presentation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F and G</xref>, right panels).</p><p>Together, these results indicate that in contrast to the aforementioned go/no go operant conditioning task, M71 transgenic mice can identify acetophenone in a spontaneous test for odor detection. Thus, in M71 transgenic mice the strong M71 ligand acetophenone results in major behavioral perturbations - while acetophenone is spontaneously detected, it cannot reliably be discriminated from background in an operant conditioning experiment.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Rabies virus-mediated expression of GCaMP3 in olfactory bulb mitral cells</title><p>The ability to probe the cellular processes that underlie changes in olfactory-driven behaviors in this massively perturbed system can provide important general insights into how odor information is normally processed in the olfactory bulb. We therefore next asked how perturbed glomerular inputs in M71 transgenic mice are transformed into olfactory bulb outputs. We developed an in vivo imaging approach that permits the visualization of odor-evoked responses specifically in mitral cells, the main output neurons of the olfactory bulb. We used a replication-deficient recombinant rabies virus to drive the expression of the calcium-sensitive indicator of neural activity GCaMP3 (RVΔG-4GCaMP3) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Tian et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Wickersham et al., 2010</xref>) in large populations of mitral cells. We made multiple injections of this rabies-GCaMP3 virus into the olfactory cortex underneath the lateral olfactory tract (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). After injections, mice were allowed to recover for 5–7 days before two-photon imaging of neural activity was performed under ketamine/xylazine anesthesia. Because this modified rabies virus lacks the gene encoding its viral glycoprotein, it is unable to spread transsynaptically, thereby restricting the expression of GCaMP3 to neurons directly infected via their axonal terminations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Wickersham et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">2010</xref>). However, because the virus retains its ability to replicate in infected cells, we found that infected cells began exhibit clear signs of toxicity after 12 days (not shown). We therefore performed all imaging experiments within 5–7 days after virus injections.<fig id="fig2" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.16335.006</object-id><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Normalization of odor-evoked mitral cell activity in M71 transgenic mice.</title><p>(<bold>A–I</bold>) Two-photon in vivo imaging of mitral cell odor responses in anesthetized mice.

In wild-type mice, we found that odorants at low concentrations (0.01%, or 1/10,000 vol./vol. dilution) typically evoked sparse, spatially distributed patterns of activity in ~15% of mitral cells (mean = 14.5%, standard deviation (SD) = 11.2%; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F and H</xref>). These observations are consistent with recent results using adeno-associated virus (AAV)-mediated and transgenic GCaMP3 expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Blauvelt et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kato et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Wachowiak et al., 2013</xref>). We observed mitral cell responses to a variety of structurally and perceptually diverse odorants, regardless of whether the neurons were located in the posterior, medial, or anterior dorsal olfactory bulb (13 odorants at 0.01% vol./vol. dilution; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F and H</xref>, and data not shown). Furthermore, mitral cells responsive to a given odorant were typically distributed across the imaging site and did not exhibit the segregated patterns observed in odor-evoked glomerular activity.</p><p>We next performed these same imaging experiments using M71 transgenic mice. Remarkably, we found that the fraction and distribution of odor-responsive mitral cells in M71 transgenic mice and their wild-type littermate controls were strikingly similar (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2I</xref>). Interestingly, our test set of odorants includes several odorants that have been reported to not activate the M71 receptor. Ethyl acetate or eugenol, for example, do not activate M71-expressing olfactory sensory neurons at all concentrations tested (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bozza et al., 2002</xref>), and do not elicit detectable glomerular activity in M71 transgenic mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Fleischmann et al., 2008</xref>). However, we found that all test odorants including ethyl acetate and eugenol evoked mitral cell responses. Moreover, the fractions of odor-responsive neurons were indistinguishable from wild-type littermate controls (mixed-effect ANOVA (genotype x odorants), F<sub>(13, 242)</sub> = 0.58, p=0.87, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2H and I</xref>). Thus, at least at the gross level of overall activation, different odorants including odorants that barely engage the large population of M71 expressing olfactory sensory neurons, result in the excitation of a population of mitral cells that is similar to wild-type mice.</p><p>Given that 95% of all olfactory sensory neurons in these mice express the M71 receptor, we next examined mitral cell responses to acetophenone, a known strong M71 receptor ligand (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Bozza et al., 2002</xref>) that evoked pervasive glomerular activation of the dorsal surface of the olfactory bulb of M71 transgenic mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Fleischmann et al., 2008</xref>). We observed two surprising findings: first, the fraction of mitral cells activated by acetophenone was virtually identical to littermate controls, and second, the fraction of mitral cells responding to acetophenone was highly similar to the fractions of mitral cells responding to other odorants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2H,I</xref> right). Given the massively altered glomerular input and essentially normal mitral cell output, these imaging data indicate that the OB circuitry profoundly normalizes activity, strengthening the weakened input from odorants that do not activate the M71 receptor, and suppressing the overt excitation due to the M71 ligand acetophenone, resulting in responses that – on the crude level of overall activation – were indistinguishable from wild-type mice.</p><p>A more detailed analysis of our imaging data, however, did reveal subtle differences between the response properties of M71 transgenic mitral cells and wild-type littermate controls. In controls, individual mitral cells generally displayed narrow stimulus tuning at low odor concentrations, in accord with previously published results from electrophysiological and optical recordings (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Davison and Katz, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kato et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Tan et al., 2010</xref>). Approximately half of the neurons (46.1%) did not respond to any of the 13 odorants in the stimulus set used to probe selectivity, while the majority of odor-responsive neurons (43.9% of all neurons) displayed significant increases in fluorescence to only 1–5 odor stimuli. A small subpopulation (10.0%) of mitral cells were more broadly tuned. Moreover, the majority of stimulus-evoked mitral cell response magnitudes were small, with peak ΔF/F values below 35%, although we could observe a small number of large stimulus-evoked responses with ΔF/F values of up to 200% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). Finally, the fluorescence levels of most odor-responsive neurons (&gt;80%) returned to baseline within 8 s after response onset (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>). In M71 transgenic mice, mitral cells tended to be more broadly tuned (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A and B</xref>), but this difference did not reach statistical significance (Chi-squared test: χ2 = 17.7, p=0.17). For acetophenone and the 12 other odorants, the distribution of the response magnitudes of mitral cell was shifted towards smaller peak ΔF/F values, with a particularly large reduction in the number of strongly responding neurons (i.e. those reaching ΔF/F values of greater than 50%; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>, median ΔF/F: control: 0.36, M71 transgenic: 0.32; mean ΔF/F: control: 0.47, M71 transgenic: 0.38, Two-sample Kolmogorov-Smirnov test: D<sub>4116,1639</sub> = 0.12, p&lt;0.01, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>).

Mice were presented with the same odorant 4 times (average inter-trial interval ~10 min), and the presentation of each odorant was interleaved with other odorants to avoid habituation. In littermate controls, 56% of responsive mitral cells responded on only one out of 4 trials, 20% of cells responded twice, 10% three times, and 14% of cells responded on all 4 out of 4 trials (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>). In M71 transgenic mice, the fraction of neurons responding on all 4 out of 4 repeat presentations of the same odorant was reduced from 14% in controls to 2.9% in M71 transgenic mice. Furthermore, we calculated the Pearson correlation coefficients of the activity patterns after odor onset. We found that for acetophenone and the 12 other odorants, the mean correlation of response patterns to individual exposures of the same odorant was reduced in M71 transgenic mice compared to controls (controls: mean across 13 odorants = 0.75 ± 0.11; M71: mean = 0.25 ± 0.17, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E and F</xref>).</p><p>Taken together, these data suggest that the neural circuits of the olfactory bulb of M71 transgenic mice can greatly amplify weak odor-evoked signals while suppressing overly strong signals. Such amplification may explain how M71 transgenic mice can still detect and discriminate most odorants. However, an increase in the trial-to-trial variability of mitral cell responses will degrade the fidelity of the odor representation, and may underlie the impairments in odor discrimination that M71 transgenic mice exhibit with more challenging assays.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>Intrinsic and odor-evoked mitral cell activity in M71 transgenic mice</title><p>Our calcium imaging experiments provide information about the patterns of odor-evoked activity in large ensembles of mitral cells.

We measured evoked MTC response profiles to a one-second pulse of 4 non-acetophenone stimuli (3 monomolecular odorants - hexanone, heptanal, ethyl acetate - and a mixture of isoamyl acetate, 2-nonanone and cyclohexanol, at a concentration of 1% of absolute vapor pressure). As previously reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Cury and Uchida, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kollo et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Shusterman et al., 2011</xref>), MTC activity in these awake, head-fixed mice was modulated by odor in a diverse manner, with prominent excitatory as well as inhibitory responses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4H,J and K</xref>). On average, odor exposure resulted in a moderate hyperpolarization (mean ΔVm = -1.8 mV, SD = 2.1 mV, 27 cell/odor pairs), and a small increase in the firing rate (mean Δ firing rate = 2.2 Hz, SD = 13.3 Hz, 27 cell/odor pairs). Consistent with our imaging data, we found that overall firing rate distributions to the same 4 stimuli were more compact in M71 transgenic mice; mean changes in firing rate were indistinguishable from controls (mean Δ firing rate<sub>M71</sub> = 0.75 Hz, SD = 2.2 Hz, 20 cell/odor pairs, p=0.67, Rank-sum, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4M</xref>), yet the fraction of excitatory responses was similar (control: 32%, M71: 25%). Odor presentation generally resulted in both excitatory and inhibitory responses, with only a small change in the average membrane potential (mean ΔVm = 0.10 mV, SD = 1.1mV, 20 cell/odor pairs; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4I,J and M</xref>). However, both excitatory and inhibitory responses were generally weaker (Δ|Vm|<sub>M71</sub> = 0.5+[-0.3 0.8] mV, Δ|Vm|<sub>cntrl</sub> = 1.3+[-0.6 2.5] mV, p=0.006, Wilcoxon rank sum; Δ |firing rate|<sub>M71</sub> = 0.8+[-0.3 1.6]yy Hz, Δ|firing rate|<sub>cntrl</sub> = 6.0+[-3.0 6.2] Hz, p&lt;0.001, Wilcoxon rank sum, median +[lower quartile, upper quartile]), and strong excitatory responses notably absent in M71 transgenic mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4M</xref>).

These alterations in inhibition were not a consequence of altered sampling behavior e.g. due to anxiety (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Glinka et al., 2012</xref>) or other behavioral state changes, as whole-cell recordings in anaesthetized mice showed a similarly profound and selective increase in inhibitory responses to acetophenone exposure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>).</p><p>Previous work indicated that such slow, odor-evoked phasic inhibition likely originates in the glomerular layer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Fukunaga et al., 2014</xref>), and the position and connectivity of PG cells make them prime candidates to mediate both presynaptic and feedforward inhibition in response to acetophenone in M71 transgenic mice. Therefore, we performed two-photon imaging experiments in mice engineered to selectively express GCaMP3 in PG cells. Selectivity was achieved by injecting Cre-dependent AAV (AAV5.hSynap.Flex.GCaMP3.WPRE.SV40) into the olfactory bulbs of either M71 transgenic mice that also carried a <italic>Gad2-Cre</italic> transgene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Taniguchi et al., 2011</xref>), or littermate controls expressing the <italic>Gad2-Cre</italic> transgene only. AAV injections resulted in the labeling of large numbers of GABA-positive interneurons in the glomerular layer, with extensive processes extending into individual glomeruli (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5K–M</xref>). In control mice, only a fraction of PG cells displayed responses to either acetophenone or ethyl acetate (acetophenone: 10.9%; ethyl acetate: 12.1%, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5O</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6G</xref>). The magnitudes of these odor-evoked responses were small, with more than 80% of peak ∆F/F values below 10% (data not shown). Unlike mitral cells, where responses in M71 transgenic mice and their littermate controls were often indistinguishable, odor responses were strikingly different in PG cells. Exposure of M71 transgenic mice to acetophenone, even at the lowest concentration (0.01% vol./vol.), resulted in pervasive, strong and persistent activity in over 48% of PG cells, significantly higher than in littermate controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5P</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6H</xref>, Rank-sum test n<sub>co</sub> = 10, n<sub>M71 transgenic</sub> = 9, U = 83, p&lt;0.01). Furthermore, the magnitude and duration of acetophenone-evoked PG cell activity was significantly increased in M71 transgenic mice compared to controls (data not shown). In contrast to these robust and pervasive responses to acetophenone, ethyl acetate elicited PG cell activity in only a small population of neurons (&lt;10%, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5P</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6H</xref>), and response magnitudes were consistently below 10% peak ∆F/F values (data not shown). These responses tended to be fewer and with smaller ∆F/F values than those observed in littermate controls, but this observation did not reach statistical significance. Taken together, electrophysiology and imaging experiments indicate that pervasive and strong glomerular excitation is balanced by similarly pervasive and strong periglomerular inhibition to normalize olfactory bulb mitral cell output.<fig-group><fig id="fig6" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.16335.013</object-id><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><title>The olfactory bulb excitation/inhibition balance in M71 transgenic mice breaks down at high acetophenone concentrations.</title><p>(<bold>A–D</bold>) Two-photon in vivo imaging of mitral cell odor responses in anesthetized mice.

As mentioned above, acetophenone and ethyl acetate at low concentrations (0.01% vol./vol.) activate approximately 10% of mitral cells in both M71 transgenic mice and controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C and D</xref>). In control mice, a 10- and 100-fold increase in acetophenone or ethyl acetate concentration only caused a modest increase in mitral cell activity: about 15% of mitral cells responded to either odorant at 0.1% dilutions, and ~20% of mitral cells responded at 1% dilutions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A and C</xref>). Response magnitudes and durations increased slightly while trial-to-trial variability decreased with increasing odor concentrations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>).</p><p>In marked contrast to controls, increasing concentrations of acetophenone in M71 transgenic mice dramatically increased the fraction of responsive mitral cells: acetophenone at 0.1% activated over 28% of mitral cells (mean = 28.7% ± 17.1%), while over 50% (mean = 50.1% ± 25.8%) of mitral cells responded at 1% acetophenone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B and D</xref>). The number of responsive neurons was highly correlated to acetophenone concentration (n = 10, Pearson’s correlation coefficient = 0.71), indicating that the strong dependence of acetophenone responses on concentration is consistently observed across all imaging sites. Furthermore, although response magnitudes sharply increased with increasing acetophenone concentrations, response durations were reduced (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>). The striking sensitivity to acetophenone concentration was not observed for ethyl acetate. A ten-fold increase in ethyl acetate concentration resulted in only a ~1.5-fold increase in the fraction of responsive mitral cells, and a hungred-fold increase in ethyl acetate activated ~2 times more cells, essentially identical to what we observed in controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B and D</xref>). We did not observe robust concentration-dependent changes in the distributions of peak ∆F/F values and response durations to ethyl acetate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>). To quantify these differences, we calculated the difference in concentration-driven linear change between stimuli (∆LC = LC<sub>acetophenone</sub> – LC<sub>ethyl acetate)</sub>in control and M71 transgenic mice. A ∆LC of 0 indicates no difference in the effect of concentration on the response to the two stimuli, while a positive ∆LC indicates the greater linear change in acetophenone-evoked response density with increasing concentration. We found no difference in linear change between ethyl acetate and acetophenone responses for controls (∆LC = -0.04), indicating that control mice responded similarly to increasing concentrations of these 2 stimuli. In contrast, we found a positive ∆LC in M71 transgenic mice (∆LC = 0.18), highlighting that the density of neural responses to acetophenone is strongly modulated by concentration in these mice.</p><p>Earlier we suggested that PG cell-mediated feedforward inhibition plays an important role in normalizing olfactory bulb output (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). We therefore next asked how increasing odorant concentration affects the activity of PG cells in both M71 transgenic mice and controls. While PG cells were already quite responsive to low acetophenone concentrations in M71 transgenic mice, increasing acetophenone concentrations dramatically increased PG cell activity in these mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6F and H</xref>): 0.1% activated over 85% (mean 85.1% ± 13%) of PG cells in M71 transgenic mice compared to only 10.8% ( ± 6.6%) observed in controls. A further ten-fold increase in concentration (1%) increased the fraction of responsive neurons to 94% ( ± 8%) in M71 transgenic mice. Increasing acetophenone concentration also markedly increased response magnitudes and durations, which was not observed in controls (data not shown). Interestingly, exposure of M71 transgenic mice to intermediate concentrations of ethyl acetate at (0.1%) activated only 14.6% ( ± 11%) of PG cells, similar to the 18.2% ( ± 9.3%) responsive PG cells observed in littermate controls (Mann-Whitney test n<sub>co</sub> = 10, n<sub>M71 transgenic</sub> = 9, U = 35, p=0.45). Interestingly, however, a hundred-fold increase in ethyl acetate concentration (1%) activated 77.9% ( ± 20%) of PG cells, more than double that observed in controls. Although ethyl acetate has previously been reported not to activate the M71 receptor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Bozza et al., 2002</xref>), these data suggest that ethyl acetate may in fact be a weak M71 receptor agonist that activates M71 at high concentrations. This speculation is supported by the observation that while odorants activate segregated, glomerulus-specific clusters of PG cells in wild-type mice, PG cell responses to both acetophenone and ethyl acetate were pervasive and not restricted to individual glomeruli in M71 transgenic mice, consistent with the pervasive glomerular innervation by M71-expressing sensory inputs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E and F</xref>).</p><p>Taken together, these data demonstrate that the pervasive glomerular activity elicited by acetophenone in M71 transgenic mice results in strong, stimulus-specific PG cell activation, even at low concentrations. At higher concentrations, acetophenone-evoked PG cell activity appeared to saturate in M71 transgenic mice while the proportion of responsive mitral cells dramatically increased. These data therefore suggest that at high acetophenone concentrations, periglomerular inhibition fails to counterbalance excitation.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>We have characterized the transformation of odor-evoked activity in the olfactory bulb of M71 transgenic mice with a 'monoclonal nose', in which glomerular input patterns are massively perturbed. Calcium imaging experiments reveal that olfactory bulb mitral cell output in M71 transgenic mice is surprisingly similar to that observed wild-type mice. The olfactory bulb of M71 transgenic mice thus provides a powerful model system with which to explore neural mechanisms of signal normalization. Cell-specific calcium imaging together with in vivo patch-clamp recordings identify feedforward periglomerular inhibition as a major candidate neural circuit mechanism for signal amplification and suppression. Our results thus highlight the capacity of the olfactory bulb to extract meaningful information from degraded sensory input.</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>The ability of M71 transgenic mice to detect acetophenone is task-dependent</title><p>Our previous behavioral analyses of M71 transgenic mice using a go/no go operant conditioning task indicated that M71 transgenic mice could readily detect and discriminate most odorants. In contrast, M71 transgenic mice failed to discriminate the M71 receptor ligand acetophenone from air. We have replicated these initial findings with an independent cohort of mice. In total, 15 M71 transgenic mice were tested in this task, and all 15 mice failed to reach a correct lick ratio of above 75%. Why do M71 transgenic mice fail this test? We previously hypothesized that pervasive glomerular activation elicits inhibition at multiple stations along the olfactory pathway, which could entirely suppress acetopheone-evoked neural activity. However, our calcium imaging and electrophysiological recordings do not support this hypothesis. Instead, we observe that acetophenone-evoked suprathreshold mitral cell activity in M71 transgenic mice is surprisingly similar to that observed in wild-type mice: the fraction of acetophenone-responsive neurons, and acetophenone-induced changes in mitral cell firing rates are indistinguishable from controls. Furthermore, alterations in mitral cell response magnitude, duration, and changes in the dynamic range of mitral cell responses do not provide a simple explanation for the observed behavioral deficit. The most striking acetophenone-specific effect we observe is a massive amplification of theta oscillations. A single one second puff of acetophenone elicits strong theta oscillations that last for at least 20 s. The behavioral consequences of this oscillatory activity are unknown, but it is possible that these prolonged network perturbations interfere with the discrimination of acetophenone from clean air in the go/no go operant conditioning task. Alternatively, we cannot exclude that our clean air stimulus contains contaminating traces of acetophenone, and that acetophenone at extremely low concentrations is sufficient to elicit neural activity in M71 transgenic mice that makes it indistinguishable from the acetophenone odor puff. This would suggest that the observed behavioral deficit results from the inability of M71 transgenic mice to discriminate between different acetophenone concentrations, rather than from the inability to detect it. Finally, strong oscillatory network activity may precede an epileptic state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Nguyen and Ryba, 2012</xref>), which could obstruct odor discrimination.</p><p>In contrast to their inability to discriminate acetophenone from air in the go/no go operant conditioning task, M71 transgenic mice adapt their spontaneous sniffing behavior in response to acetophenone exposure, suggesting that they can indeed detect acetophenone in this test. Spontaneous sniff adaptation does not require that mice accurately discriminate between successive presentations of two different stimuli. Therefore, while acetophenone-induced network perturbations may interfere with odor discrimination, mice may be able to detect and recognize acetophenone as a previously encountered stimulus in this test. Additionally, the heightened level of anxiety in M71 transgenic mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Glinka et al., 2012</xref>) might amplify sniff responses to novel stimuli including to non-olfactory components of the stimulus. Another important difference between the two behavioral tasks is that unlike spontaneous sniff adaptation, operant conditioning requires extensive training. It is possible that training, which is performed with non-acetophenone odorants, may shape the processing of odor-evoked activity, and that such plastic changes may underlie the task dependency of the behavioral deficit.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Suppression of pervasive glomerular activity in M71 transgenic mice</title><p>Changes in the expression of odorant receptor genes in M71 transgenic mice have two major consequences for odor-evoked glomerular activity. First, exposure to the M71 receptor ligand acetophenone activates the vast majority of sensory neurons and elicits pervasive glomerular activity. Second, the number of sensory neurons responsive to most odorants, i.e. those that do not activate the M71 receptor, is strikingly reduced, resulting in glomerular activity that is below the detection threshold of in vivo synapto-pHluorin imaging experiments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Fleischmann et al., 2008</xref>). Despite these massive perturbations in odor-evoked olfactory bulb input, both our calcium imaging experiments and electrophysiological recordings reveal that mitral cell responses to acetophenone and non-acetophenone odorants are highly similar. Thus, M71 transgenic mice provide an exaggerated genetic setting in which we have examined neural circuit mechanisms for generating normalized sensory output for downstream targets that direct olfactory behaviors.</p><p>The fraction of acetophenone-responsive mitral cells as well as acetophenone-evoked changes in mitral cell firing rates are indistinguishable between M71 transgenic mice and controls. This observation immediately suggests that powerful inhibitory mechanisms must exist within the olfactory bulb to prevent massive excitation evoked by pervasive inputs to the glomerular layer. We now show that PG cells are pervasively and robustly activated by acetophenone in M71 transgenic mice. Furthermore, mitral cell patch-clamp recordings reveal that acetophenone evokes strong and prolonged phasic inhibition in M71 transgenic mitral cells, reminiscent of PGC-mediated feedforward inhibition described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Fukunaga et al., 2014</xref>). This feedforward inhibitory activity is likely to provide an effective mechanism to transform pervasive glomerular activity into sparse mitral cell responses.</p><p>Interneuron populations in the deeper layers of the olfactory bulb could further modify neural activity evoked by acetophenone. Candidates include superficial dopaminergic interneurons that have previously been suggested to mediate signal normalization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Banerjee et al., 2015</xref>), as well as parvalbumin-expressing interneurons, which reside in the external plexiform layer and receive direct input from widely distributed mitral cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Kato et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Miyamichi et al., 2013</xref>). In addition, deep layer granule cells, which form dendrodendritic synapses on the lateral dendrites of nearby mitral cells can modulate neighboring mitral cell output by means of powerful feedback and feedforward inhibition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abraham et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Isaacson and Strowbridge, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Jahr and Nicoll, 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Margrie et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Rall et al., 1966</xref>). Altogether, these interglomerular inhibitory networks can normalize response magnitudes across a range of input intensities and enhance contrast between patterns of odor-evoked glomerular activity, and feedforward inhibition from primary onto secondary olfactory neurons represents an olfactory circuit function that appears highly conserved in evolution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Olsen and Wilson, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Zhu et al., 2013</xref>). However, we found that increasing acetophenone concentration dramatically increased the fraction of responsive mitral cells, resulting in dense neural odor representations similar to the dense patterns of acetophenone-evoked glomerular activity. Thus, at high acetophenone concentrations, excitation may override inhibition, exposing the limits of olfactory bulb circuit mechanisms to normalize glomerular activity.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>The amplification of weak sensory inputs in the olfactory bulb of M71 transgenic mice</title><p>We observed that all odorants tested elicit sparse and unique, overlapping patterns of mitral cell activity in M71 transgenic mice. Strikingly, the fraction of responsive neurons to a panel of 13 odorants (including acetophenone) was not significantly different from what was observed in littermate controls. While individual ligand-receptor interactions remain incompletely characterized, calcium imaging experiments suggest that most odorants do not activate M71-expressing olfactory sensory neurons, or do so only at high odorant concentrations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Bozza et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Fleischmann et al., 2008</xref>). Thus, our data provide a striking example of signal amplification by olfactory bulb neural circuits.</p><p>Whole cell recordings of mitral cells reveal that odorants commonly evoke phasic inhibition in wild-type mice (as described previously e.g <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Fukunaga et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Margrie et al., 2001</xref>), and that this inhibition in response to odorants other than acetophenone is significantly reduced in M71 transgenic mice. This result suggests that olfactory bulb inputs ordinarily evoke non-specific inhibition that can only be overcome by strong and specific input. Such inhibition coupled with specific excitation can increase signal-to-noise ratios and enhance contrast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Cleland and Sethupathy, 2006</xref>). By contrast, in the M71 transgenic mice, non-acetophenone inputs are too weak to recruit inhibition, allowing these weak inputs to evoke responses. This may at least partially explain why responses are prolonged, and why trial-to-trial variability of responses is increased in these animals. However, weak signals may also be actively amplified. For example, electrical coupling electrical coupling between mitral cells connected to the same glomerulus, and self-excitation of intraglomerular mitral cell assemblies, can further facilitate the detection of weak odor signals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Christie et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Isaacson, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Margrie et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Murphy et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Schoppa and Westbrook, 2001</xref>). However, a multi-synaptic pathway involving olfactory bulb tufted cells may also directly amplify the output of mitral cells in response to weak inputs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">De Saint Jan et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Fukunaga et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Gire et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Najac et al., 2011</xref>). These different neural mechanisms are likely to cooperate in improving the ability of M71 transgenic mice to detect odorants that do not activate the M71 receptor. Interestingly, however, we observed that the patterns of mitral cell activity are more variable across multiple odorant presentations. The fraction of mitral cells responding reliably to the same stimulus is significantly reduced in M71 transgenic mice, and the variation of the average fraction of responsive neurons for a given trial is increased. Odorants will therefore activate more variable ensembles of cells. One important source of variability in neural responses to sensory stimuli is noise, and neural circuit mechanisms to reduce variability due to noise often rely on averaging signals from neurons carrying redundant information (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Faisal et al., 2008</xref>). Large numbers of sensory neurons expressing the same odorant receptor and converging onto only two glomeruli in the olfactory bulb provide a striking example of this principle. In M71 transgenic mice, the number of sensory neurons expressing a given odorant receptor are strongly reduced, thus limiting the power of averaging to reduce variability. We speculate that this increased variability of a neural odor representation will affect the accuracy of odor discrimination in M71 transgenic mice, a model consistent with the olfactory discrimination deficits observed for difficult to discriminate odorant mixtures.</p><p>In conclusion, we report a number of ways in which the olfactory bulb can modify substantially altered primary inputs to generate meaningful odor representations. Amplification of weak signals and suppression of strong, pervasive input patterns are likely to be crucial under normal circumstances, for example by allowing the system to tune to odors with considerable variations in vapor pressures.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Mice</title><p>Adult (6–10 week-old) mice on a mixed 129SvEv; C57BL/6 genetic background were used for all experiments. <italic>Omp-ires-tTA</italic> and <italic>tet<sub>o</sub>-M71-ires-lacZ</italic> mouse lines were bred to generate hemizygous <italic>Omp-ires-tTA /tet<sub>o</sub>-M71-ires-lacZ</italic> transgenic mice (referred to as M71 transgenic mice).

Briefly, mice were water-restricted (1–1.5 ml water/day) and maintained on a reverse 12 hr light/dark cycle. Initial training was performed with ethyl acetate, citronellol, and carvone. All odorants were used at 1% vol./vol. dilution in mineral oil. Individual experiments consisted of at least 200 trials and typically lasted for ~30 min. Individual trials consisted of a 2 s odor sampling period, followed by an inter-trial interval of at least 4 s. The median time from the end of one odor presentation (closing of the odor valve) to the beginning of the next was 6.3 ± 0.5 s (mean and SD across 7 animals, 300 trials each). Discrimination accuracy was calculated as the percent correct licks during a two second interval following valve opening for blocks of 20 trails each. Behavioral data were analyzed in R by fitting a linear mixed-effects model to test the effect of genotype on the fraction of correct licks (fraction correct lick ~ genotype * block + 1 | mouse Id / block).</p><p>Sniff behavior was measured in head-fixed passive mice using a fast mass flow sensor (FBAM200DU, Sensortechnics, Puchheim, Germany) externally placed in close proximity to the left nostril. Baseline sniff frequencies for each trial were calculated by taking the inverse of the mean inter-sniff interval (time between successive inhalation peaks) during the 2 s prior to odor period. Responses were calculated by subtracting the baseline sniff frequency from the sniff frequency measured similarly for all sniff cycles beginning and ending within the odor period. Inter-trial interval was 10 s and 8 odor stimuli were presented in a fixed order (1% acetophenone, ethyl acetate, 0.5% acetophenone, mixture 1, 0.1% acetophenone, hexanone, 0.05% acetophenone, heptanal). This block was repeated at least 3 times. The sequence of odors was randomized between animals ensuring alternating acetophenone and non-acetophenone odors. No blank controls were presented. For analysis, sniff responses were analyzed for the first and second/third acetophenone presentation irrespective of concentration.</p></sec><sec id="s4-3"><title>Rabies-GCaMP3 virus Injections</title><p>Deletion-mutant rabies virus was generated as described in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Wickersham et al.

Mice were anaesthetized with ketamine/xylazine (100 mg/kg / 10 mg/kg, Sigma Aldrich) and body temperature was maintained at 37°C using a feedback-controlled heating pad (Fine Science Tools). The scalp was removed, and the membrane overlying the skull was cleared using a microblade (Roboz). An aluminum headpost was attached to the skull using RelyX luting cement (Henry Schein). The skin overlying the cheek and zygomatic bone was removed, and vessels over the zygomatic bone were sealed using a cauterizing iron (Fine Science Tools). The muscle above and attached to the zygomatic bone was peeled away, and the bone was removed with microscissors (Roboz). The membrane and muscle holding the jawbone and associated tissue in place were then slightly peeled back to allow access to the skull underneath. A dental drill was used to thin the bone directly overlying the lateral olfactory tract (LOT), and fine forceps (Fine Science Tools, USA) were used to remove the thinned skull and dura underneath. Using a micromanipulator and injection assembly kit (Narishige; WPI), 3000–3500 nL of rabies-GCaMP3 virus was slowly pressure injected via a pulled glass pipette at five locations; three approximately equidistant locations directly underneath the LOT (normal to the surface of the brain), and two locations ~500 µm deep to the surface of the brain in the anterior portion of the exposed area. The craniotomy was covered with silicone sealant (WPI), and the surgical exposure was covered with a layer of lidocaine jelly (Henry Schein Veterinary) followed by a layer of silicone sealant. No signs of virus toxicity, such as highly fluorescent or blebbing cells could occasionally be observed before 9 days post-infection, but were clearly evident after 2 weeks post-infection. Therefore, mice all imaging experiments were performed 5–7 days post-infection.</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>Histological processing</title><p>Animals were deeply anaesthetized with ketamine/xylazine and transcardially perfused with 10 ml PBS, followed by 10 ml 4% paraformaldehyde.

A vibratome was used to cut 85 µm-thick coronal slices through the olfactory bulb, and slices were counterstained overnight in 1/1000 NeuroTrace 435 (Invitrogen) in PBS and mounted in Vectashield (Vector Labs) for imaging on a Zeiss 710 confocal microscope (Zeiss) using a 10x water immersion objective (Zeiss 0.45 NA).</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Olfactory bulb imaging</title><p>Mice were anaesthetized using ketamine/xylazine (100 mg/kg / 10 mg/kg, Sigma Aldrich) and the skull overlying the olfactory bulb was thinned using a dental drill and removed with forceps, and the dura was peeled back using fine forceps. A small circular coverslip cut from a cover glass (Corning #2870–18) using a diamond scriber (VWR) was placed over the exposed bulb and sealed in place using 2% agarose to minimize movement of the brain. Animals were then moved to a two-photon microscope (Ultima, Prairie Technologies, or Leica SP5) for imaging. A 16x objective at 2x zoom (Ultima) or a 25x (Leica SP5) was used to focus on the glomerular layer (~150 µm below the pial surface) or the mitral cell layer (~300–400 µm below the pial surface), and a Ti-Sapphire laser (Coherent) was tuned to 910 nm for experiments. Images (256 x 256 pixels) were acquired at a frame rate of 2.53 Hz (Ultima) or 2.9 Hz (Leica SP5). Odors were delivered at a flow rate of 1L/min for 2 s with inter-trial intervals of ~60 s. Odor stimuli for a given experiment consisted of one of two odor sets, delivered through a 16 channels olfactometer (Automate Scientific): a set of 13 monomolecular odorants (purchased from Sigma-Aldrich with the highest purity available) diluted at 1/10 000 vol./vol. dilution in mineral oil (Sigma-Aldrich), and a set of 'concentration series' consisting of three odors of ten fold increasing concentrations (1/100, 1/1 000 and 1/10 000 vol./vol. dilutions of acetophenone, ethyl acetate, and hexanone). Odorants were presented 4 times each, in pseudorandomized order. A total of 2–3 spatially distinct sites (often consisting of the posterior, medial, and anterior dorsal surface of the bulb) were imaged in each mouse.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Electrophysiology</title><p>For anaesthetized recordings, male and female M71 transgenic mice and their littermate controls (6–9 weeks old) were anaesthetized intraperitoneally with ketamine and xylazine (100 mg/kg and 20 mg/kg, respectively for induction; xylazine concentration was reduced to 10 mg/kg for maintenance) and kept warm (37°C; DC temperature controller, FHC, Bowdoin ME, USA) for the duration of the experiments. A small craniotomy and duratomy of approximately 1–2 mm in diameter was made over the dorsal right olfactory bulb, which was submerged in Ringer solution containing (in mM): NaCl (135), KCl (5.4), HEPES (5), MgCl2 (1), CaCl2 (1.8), and its pH adjusted to 7.2 and 280 mOsm/kg. Whole-cell recordings were made with borosilicate glass pipette filled with (in mM): KMeSO4 (130), HEPES (10), KCl (7), ATP<sub>2</sub>-Na (2), ATP-Mg (2), GTP (0.5), EGTA (0.05), biocytin (10), with pH and osmolarity adjusted to 7.3 and 275–80 mOsm/kg, respectively. Signals were amplified and filtered at 30 kHz by an Axoclamp 2B (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA, USA) and digitized at 20 kHz with a micro 1401 (Cambridge Electronic Design, Cambridge, UK). Odors were presented to the animals using a custom-made flow-dilution olfactometer at approximately 1% of saturated vapor with an inter-trial interval of 10 s (awake) or 20–25 s (anaesthetized). All recordings were done blindly with respect to the genotype of the animals. Data were analysed in Matlab (MathWorks, Natick, Massachusetts, USA). To calculate the evoked membrane potential (Vm) in anaesthetized animals, voltage traces were first aligned to expiration peaks of respiration rhythms (chest distension, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Fukunaga et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Schaefer et al., 2006</xref>). The average waveform from the baseline period was subtracted from the aligned voltage trace from first complete sniff-cycle after odor valve opening. Evoked Vm for each cell was the mean of this subtracted component, averaged across trials. Responses were defined as significantly hyperpolarizing or depolarising if the evoked Vm deviated by more than -2 or 2 standard deviations from baseline fluctuations, respectively. For two-sample KS test, the test statistic, D, was max (| F<sub>1</sub>(x) - F<sub>2</sub>(x) |), where F(x) is the cumulative distribution function for each dataset.</p><p>For awake recordings, head plate surgery and craniotomy was performed either directly preceding the electrophysiological recording or up to 2 days before (cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kollo et al., 2014</xref>) under isoflurane anaesthesia (5% for induction, 1.5–3% for maintenance in 95% oxygen), with local (0.5% mepivicaine s.c.) and general anaesthesia (5mg/kg carprofen, s.c.) administered. Recordings, solutions and analysis were as described above for anaesthetized animals. The only exception was that in awake animals, where sniff length is more variable, for each trial, the baseline Vm was calculated as the mean Vm during the 2 s prior to odor onset, and this was subtracted from the Vm during odor period. Evoked response was directly calculated as the mean Vm during the 1 s odor period, averaged over all trials. For FR responses, FR was calculated within each 0.25 s time bin aligned to the first inhalation post odor onset. Baseline FR was calculated on each trial as the mean within the 2 s prior to odor onset, and this was subtracted from the odor period. FR response was calculated as the mean FR in all time bins of the odor period across all trials. To test whether FR responses were significant, a paired T-test was performed between FR calculated during baseline in the 2 s prior to odor onset, and those calculated during the 1 s odor stimulus for all trials. Theta tuning was calculated from Vm during sniffs of durations &gt;0.2 s and &lt;0.32 s within the inter-trial intervals as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Fukunaga et al., 2012</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Imaging data analysis</title><p>Data analysis was conducted in ImageJ and Matlab. Motion artifacts were first corrected by using a subpixel translational-based discrete Fourier analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Guizar-Sicairos and Fienup, 2008</xref>). ROIs were then manually drawn on an average image of the imaging site, and the pixel gray values averaged in each ROI were used to estimate the fluorescence of single cells at each time frame. For each trial, the change in fluorescence (∆<italic>F/F<sub>0</sub></italic>)was calculated as <italic>(F-F<sub>0</sub></italic>) <italic>/ F<sub>0</sub>,</italic> where <italic>F<sub>0</sub></italic> is the median value between seconds 2 and 6 of the pre-odor period. We estimated the baseline fluctuation at a given trial as the standard deviation (SD) of ∆<italic>F/F<sub>0</sub> </italic>during the baseline period. Odor responses were assessed over a 10 s period following odor onset. A cell was deemed responsive if it exceeded response threshold (3.2 x SD for mitral cells, false positive rate (FPR) = 1.3%, 3.4 x SD for periglomerular cells, FPR = 3.8%) during at least 3 frames in this period. Using a more stringent response criterion for mitral cells (3.8 x SD) yielded reduced numbers of odor-responsive neurons, but did not change the relative distributions of odor-responsive neurons between M71 transgenic mice and controls, or mitral cell response variability (data not shown). The percent of responding neurons to each stimulus was calculated as the average number of active neurons across 4 trials. To construct the odor spot maps and to calculate the tuning curves, only cells that responded at least 2 out of the 4 trials were included. To build the cross-correlation matrix of the patterns of activity we combined ∆<italic>F/F<sub>0</sub> </italic>responses of all mitral cells, averaged over the 4 s following odor onset into a single mitral cell x odor trial matrix. We then calculated the cross-trial correlations of the patterns of mitral cell activity.</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>Statistics</title><p>All descriptive statistics in the text are mean ± SD.

Your article has been favorably evaluated by a Senior editor and three reviewers, one of whom, Upinder S Bhalla, is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors.</p><p>The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Naoshige Uchida.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>The reviewers felt that there were some points about presentation of theresults that the authors should address.</p><p>1) The authors should explain the behavioral results more clearly, especiallyclarifying the design of the experiment and its interpretation.</p><p>2) Figure legends from in-vivo recordings should clearly state if therecordings are from awake or anesthetized animals.</p><p>3) The results regarding response variability should be reanalyzed withmore stringent odor response criteria to test if the main conclusionsremain the same. A more thorough discussion of response variability shouldalso be included.</p><p>By way of context, the full reviews are appended here. Please note that the essential revisions are in the 3 points of the synthesis above, but we felt that the fuller reviews may give some insights into the viewpoints of the reviewers.</p><p><italic>Reviewer 1:</italic> </p><p>This is a substantially enhanced resubmission of an earlier manuscript that was considered at <italic>eLife</italic>. The authors have done several additional experimentsand analyses, strengthening the conclusions of the paper.</p><p>An initial experiment is to verify and extend earlier work on the inabilityof M71 transgenic mice to discriminate between acetophenone and mineral oildiluent. They confirm this, but extend the result by showing that the micedo detect acetophenone in an exploratory sniff behavior test. This is aninteresting additional nuance to the behavior, and shows that there is somekind of detectability still available to the system. This possibly sheds lighton the paradox of observed activity changes not appearing to map to behavior.</p><p>This would be an interesting line to follow up in future work.</p><p>The previously presented observations on the responses of mitral cellsin the wt and M71 cases remain strong, and are now extended in thisresubmission. There is better analysis, especially of concentration dependence.</p><p>There is an additional analysis of respiration tuning, which yields the interesting result of higher tuning in M71 mice than wild-type.</p><p>One of the key original concerns was the lack of in-vivo awake recordings,which the authors have now done. These support the original anesthetizedrecording results. The number of recorded neurons is somewhat small andthus limits the kinds of analysis possible, but the basic observations arewell supported by the new, awake recording data.</p><p>Overall I feel that this manuscript is now strong, and its conclusions well-supported.</p><p><italic>Reviewer 2:</italic> </p><p>The authors have addressed my previous concerns adequately. I have no further concerns.</p><p><italic>Reviewer 3:</italic> </p><p>The current version of the manuscript is significantly stronger. The authors followed many of the reviewer's suggestions. However, a few things still need some work.</p><p>1) Behavioral results.</p><p>The authors repeated behavioral experiments previously published in 2008 and got the same result. They also performed a new experiment, which was very revealing, and demonstrated that the monoclonal mice can detect acetophenone. However, the mystery still remains. In the Discussion, the authors tried to explain such a strange outcome. They proposed two potential explanations.</p><p>First, the presentation of acetophenone evokes a prolonged network perturbation, which may last &quot;for several tens of seconds after stimulus offset&quot;, and such a perturbation interferes with the task. It was very difficult to make sense of this explanation, given that the description of the behavioral paradigm lacks details. For example, the authors stated that inter-trial interval was only 1-2 seconds? Why was it so short? Is it an obvious parameter to change given the proposed explanation? The behavioral parameters should be fully described in the methods section.</p><p>The second potential explanation is that an animal cannot discriminate a puff of acetophenone from a puff of clean air contaminated with acetophenone; i.e., even a very low concentration, acetophenone evoked sufficient MT cell activity, which was indistinguishable from activity at the higher concentration of the odorant. This is a very intriguing explanation with profound consequences. It means that monoclonal nose animals lack the ability to discriminate concentrations of the ligand, and their concentration dynamic range is very low. This result may inform us about concentration/intensity coding in the olfactory system. I wonder why the authors stopped short. Why in their imaging studies would they not lower acetophenone concentration to test this hypothesis? It would be ideal if they can present odors in their imaging studies using exactly the same odor delivery system used in the behavioral setup. The Knosys olfactometer may indeed suffer from a contamination problem, because it has C-flex tubing in the odor pathway.</p><p>The paper by itself is already standing at a high level and addresses multiple questions. It is significantly improved compared to the previous version. However, the authors are in a good position to make relatively small efforts and solve the mystery. This probably won't change the paper conclusion about massive renormalization in the olfactory bulb, and I would not insist on it. However, one of the main problems of systems level neuroscience is to relate the network phenomena to behavior, but the current behavioral experiments are not conclusive.</p><p>In any case, I strongly insist the authors make a much better description of the behavioral methods.</p><p>2) Awake vs. anesthetized.</p><p>Presenting the results from awake animals is a major improvement compared to the previous version. In the Methods section the authors described both e-phys recordings in awake and anesthetized states, but reading the manuscript it is difficult to sort out which experiments were performed in which state. Please make direct references in all figure captions if the data obtained in awake or anesthetized mice. In the Discussion, the authors should also address this question, specifically imaging data in the light of results from Kato 2012.</p><p>3) Response variability.</p><p>It is very intriguing result, but it is still hard to make sense of it.</p><p>First, the variability of control and monoclonal mice were measured in anesthetized state. It is not clear how these results can be extrapolated to functional significance. Kato 2012 results showed that MT cell responses in awake mice become sparser. Do they become more or less variable? Can the authors propose and discuss the sources of variability, and why it is different in control and experimental mice?</p><p>Second, the previous papers about Ca imaging in MT cells have different criteria for cell stimulus responses. Kato 2012 defined odor responses as &quot;Odor-ROI pair was considered responsive only when its response exceeds threshold both 1) in at least 4 of the 7 trials and 2) in the trial-average trace.&quot; Livneh 2014 defines as &quot;Normally we used for analysis all four repetitions, in rare cases we had to discard one trial.&quot; The way the authors defined the odor responses may lead to increase of variability estimates. The result is still valid: for a given response definition, the monoclonal mice have higher response variability than the control mice. However, if the authors choose stricter criteria for odor responses, the monoclonal mice, which have higher variability, may have lower number of odor responsive cells. This will change one of the central claims of the paper.</p><p>I may be missing something, but this subject definitely needs more analysis and discussion.</p><p>My overall conclusion is that the results are definitely worth publishing, but the paper needs more work.</p><p>[Editors’ note: a previous version of this study was rejected after peer review, but the authors submitted for reconsideration. The previous decision letter after peer review is shown below.]</p><p>Thank you for choosing to send your work entitled &quot;Massive normalization of olfactory bulb output in mice with a &quot;monoclonal nose&quot;&quot; for consideration at <italic>eLife</italic>. Your full submission has been evaluated by a Senior editor and three peer reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the decision was reached after discussions between the reviewers. Based on our discussions and the individual reviews below, we regret to inform you that your work will not be considered further for publication in <italic>eLife</italic>.</p><p>The reviewers agreed that the monoclonal nose model of olfaction is very interesting and the questions on mechanisms for apparent similarity of M/T responses to odor between M71 mice and wildtype were important.</p><p>The three reviewers agreed that the conclusions of the paper were not adequately supported by the presented data. The key point of concern was that the conclusion of mitral cell response similarity between M71 and wild-type mice would probably change if the animal was awake. A further set of conclusions about the reliability of odor responses was also felt to be sensitive to the changed dynamics of responses in awake animals.</p><p>In addition to these primary concerns, the reviewers noted that the observations of a strong M/T response to acetophenone seems difficult to reconcile with the previously reported behavioral inability to detect M/T responses. They felt that confirmation of previous results on non-detection of acetophenone by M71 mice would be important to clarify this point, and would be of great interest to the field. Further behavioral support for the conclusion about reliability of odor responses would also be desirable. While the reviewers would like to see these results, these points were not felt to be crucial for the paper.</p><p>The reviewers also made a number of other suggestions for strengthening the paper.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic> </p><p>The study uses 'monoclonal nose' mice with GCAMP-3 imaging to look at how representations change. The key finding is that mitral cell responses are remarkably normal looking, except at high odor concentrations. This is despite the fact that 95% of sensory neurons express the M71 receptor. In some respects this kind of resilience is reminiscent of the Slotnick papers where odor discrimination remained intact despite lesions to 95% of the olfactory bulb.</p><p>1) The authors investigate the mechanisms for how the olfactory bulb circuitry achieves this level of robustness in function. They carry out patch recordings from mitral cells as well as calcium imaging of populations of mitral cells that project to the piriform. These recordings in wt animals are consistent with previous work, and the M71 recordings are very similar. The authors do identify a few interesting differences, in amplitude, duration and consistency of response. While the point about consistency of response is readily understood, as the authors say, if the circuit can &quot;greatly amplify weak odor-evoked signals,&quot; it would be useful for the authors to suggest mechanisms for the other differences. It wasn't clear if the authors had used their patch recordings in the context of odor tuning. If so, this data might provide insights.</p><p>2) The analysis of the inhibition of acetophenone-evoked activity is interesting but possibly there are further insights to be gleaned from the available data. The authors build their case by combining intracellular mitral-cell recordings with Ca, imaging of PG cells, and then examine a concentration range for stimuli. I am intrigued that in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>, the response of the mitral cells does not saturate by 1% even though that of PG cells saturates around 0.1%. The authors suggest in the Discussion that this may imply that there are further stages of negative feedback, possibly in the granule cell layer.</p><p>I wonder if there may be some clues to this proposed mechanism in the spatial distribution of the responsive mitral cells as the acetophenone concentration is raised. Another possible clue might come if the authors examine their data on trial-to-trial variability for their mitral cell responses. Do the authors have this data for a range of acetophenone concentrations?</p><p>3) Did the authors obtain patch recordings from mitral cells at a range of acetophenone concentrations? This too may provide insights about the origins and levels of negative feedback.</p><p>4) Unfortunately the authors do not estimate the respiration tuning in the imaging, as they use only a 2.5 Hz frame rate. However, the patch recordings from mitral cells could be used to examine respiration tuning. The authors have done some aligning to respiration in the analysis of evoked Vm. I feel that a systematic analysis of respiration tuning could be quite informative. For example, how consistent is the respiration tuning to acetophenone between different M/T cells in a wt transgenic? Is there a preferred phase of inhibition? This might be expected for bulk PG cell inhibition, but not if there were more complex circuit mechanisms operating.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic> </p><p>In this manuscript Sosulski et al., study a very interesting model of olfactory processing, a &quot;monoclonal nose&quot; mouse, which expresses a single olfactory receptor (OR) gene (M71) in 95% of olfactory sensory neurons (OSNs), while all other OR genes are expressed in the remaining 5% of OSNs. This work is a follow up to the first work describing this mouse (Fleischmann, 2008). The current paper attempts to answer a few interesting problems formulated in the first paper: 1) How, despite the drastic decrease in the number of OSNs expressing a given OR type (except M71), do these mice show no behavioral deficits in discriminating or detecting non-M71 ligands? 2) Why, despite overexpression of the M71 receptor, are these mice unable to detect an M71 ligand (acetophenone)? Both the imaging and electrophysiological data presented in this paper are promising; however, they do not answer either of these questions, and, I would say, do not add much to our knowledge about the olfactory bulb processing.</p><p>1) In the first paper (Fleischmann, 2008), it was proposed that feedforward inhibition could suppress the mitral/tufted (M/T) cells' responses in the absence of the contrast of glomeruli pattern, as an explanation for the deficit in behavioral response to M71 ligands. The current paper reports an obvious M/T cell response to acetophenone, and a strong concentration dependence to this ligand. How, then, do authors explain the inability of monoclonal mice to detect M71 ligands? The arguments about postsynaptic inhibition do not reconcile with their current findings, because the measured calcium activity in mitral cells is a putative proxy of spiking output. No matter the differences in bulbar circuitry and processing, if a somewhat normal signal is sent to cortex, the animal should be able to detect it.</p><p>While I will focus my comments on the current paper, some of its conclusions are based on data from the previous paper, published years ago. The result that an M71 monoclonal mouse cannot detect M71 ligands is very important, yet quite controversial. I would suggest that if the authors want to build on this observation, they should reproduce it. Given the current result that the mitral cells in M71 mice respond more or less normally to acetophenone, I harbor doubts that these mice would not be able to detect the odor. Either the previous behavioral result is incomplete or conclusions from anesthetized mice may not reflect the whole picture (see below).</p><p>2) One of the main arguments of the paper is that the statistics of mitral cell responses to non-M71 odors are similar in M71 and control mice. It has been shown that not only is the resting state of M/T cells quite different in awake and anesthetized states (Rinberg, 2006, but also see Kollo, 2014), but also that M/T cell odor responses become sparser in the awake state (Kato, 2012). Thus, the balance between excitation and inhibition in these two states is likely very different (see also Cazakoff, Nat.Neuro., 2014). Since it is unclear exactly how the balance differs in these M71 mice, it is hard to predict if M/T cell activity would transition in a similar way to control mice between anesthetized and awake states, or how well the anesthetized activity reflects the potential difference in network function that could emerge in the awake-state activity of these mice. Given that the current technology allows recording in awake mice, I do not see any reason why authors did not address the question more directly. Also, state-dependent changes in inhibition and M/T output were not even mentioned in the Discussion.</p><p>3) I found it very interesting that the 5% of OSNs carrying the odor signal can evoke a similar effect on postsynaptic cells, mitral cells, as a population. After reading this paper it is very hard to make definite conclusions about the mechanisms for such normalization. The authors proposed a role for PG cells in this process. It is one plausible explanation, but I am not sure how much this paper adds to revealing the mechanisms of signal normalization.</p><p>In my opinion, there are two basic approaches. First, that the proposed mouse model can help us understand basic mechanisms of olfactory processing. The data presented does not convince me that this is the case. Second, a new model by itself presents an interesting phenomenon, and it is worth understanding how, with such unnatural structure of receptor input, the system can behave in an almost &quot;normal&quot; way. I am not sure that this question has been answered here.</p><p>4) Another result is very intriguing: the reliability of the odor responses in M71 mouse is significantly lower than in a control mouse. The authors suggest that the decrease of the Pearson correlation coefficient from 0.4 to 0.17 tells us something about the decrease of the mouse's ability to discriminate odors. First, we do not know if the increased variability of the responses remains in awake mice. Second, the comparison to behavioral performance seems like a stretch. Do M71 mice perform poorer than control mice with the same odors for which variability was measured? The authors should either make a more direct connection between the physiological and behavioral observations, or they should explain the origin of such variability.</p><p>I think that the authors have a very interesting and promising system to work with. However, I would caution them to reproduce their behavioral result before building on it. Overall, the current observations are not conclusive enough to explain the phenomena of this altered system or to expand our knowledge about the olfactory system in general.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic> </p><p>In this manuscript, Sosulski and colleagues characterized the neural activity in the olfactory bulb (OB) of transgenic mice exogenously expressing the M71 odorant receptor (OR) gene in the vast majority of olfactory receptor neurons (ORNs). A previous study (Fleischmann et al., 2008) demonstrated that the expression of endogenous ORs was greatly reduced in M71 transgenic mice. Despite this alteration, these mice were able to detect and discriminate a variety of odors, with noticeable deficits in discriminating very similar odors. They also showed that these mice failed to detect acetophenone, an M71 receptor ligand, despite the fact that acetophenone activates the vast majority of ORNs and OB glomeruli. The neural basis of these behavioral deficits remains to be clarified.</p><p>In the present study, the authors characterized the neural activity in the OB in anesthetized animals using two-photon calcium imaging and whole-cell patch clamp recording. The authors demonstrate that the fractions of mitral cells activated by an odor were very similar between wild-type and M71 transgenic mice (~15% ) despite the great reduction in endogenous OR expressions in M71 transgenic mice. Interestingly, the trail-to-trial variability of odor responses was greater in M71 transgenic mice. The authors then measured the subthreshold membrane voltage dynamics with whole cell recording and showed that odor stimulation often evoked hyperpolarization in M71 transgenic mice, consistent with a role of inhibitory mechanisms in normalization. These results demonstrate that massive normalization of odor-evoked activities occurs at the level of the OB and the increased trial-to-trial variability may underlie the behavioral deficits. The latter idea is consistent with the idea that massive convergence of ORN axons increases the reliability of odor responses.</p><p>These findings are striking and provide important insights into the neural mechanisms underlying the behavioral phenotypes of M71 transgenic mice, which in turn reveals aspects of neural processing that occur in the OB. Overall, this work contains various findings that are of interest to those who are interested in the olfactory system.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.16335.018</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>Reviewer 3:</italic></p><p><italic>1) Behavioral results.</italic></p><p><italic>The authors repeated behavioral experiments previously published in 2008 and got the same result. They also performed a new experiment, which was very revealing, and demonstrated that the monoclonal mice can detect acetophenone. However, the mystery still remains. In the Discussion, the authors tried to explain such a strange outcome. They proposed two potential explanations.</italic></p><p><italic>First, the presentation of acetophenone evokes a prolonged network perturbation, which may last &quot;for several tens of seconds after stimulus offset&quot;, and such a perturbation interferes with the task. It was very difficult to make sense of this explanation, given that the description of the behavioral paradigm lacks details. For example, the authors stated that inter-trial interval was only 1-2 seconds? Why was it so short? Is it an obvious parameter to change given the proposed explanation? The behavioral parameters should be fully described in the methods section.</italic></p><p>[…]</p><p><italic>In any case, I strongly insist the authors make a much better description of the behavioral methods.</italic> We agree with the reviewer that the go/no go conditioning tasks needs be to described in more detail, and we thank the reviewer for bringing this to our attention.</p><p>In our experiments, all mice were well trained to perform the task, i.e. they discriminated simple odor pairs (ethyl acetate, citronellol, carvone, in various combinations) with high accuracy. Individual experiments consisted of 200-300 trials, and experiments typically lasted for ~30 minutes, characterized by periods of intense odor sampling that were occasionally interrupted by periods of exploration of the conditioning chamber. Our previous comments about inter-trail intervals were indeed misleading. We have now detailed the structure of each behavioral trial in the Methods section. In brief, initiated by a light beam break by the animal, each trial starts with a 0.5 second preparation period to ensure rapid odor presentation, followed by a two second odor presentation. Mild suction ensures clearing of odors after each trial, but the system was not designed for rapid clearing. After a variable time interval chosen by the animal the next trial commences. In order to specifically compare the inter-trial interval with the post-odor exposure theta oscillations we have now analyzed inter-trial intervals for 7 animals. We find that the median time from the end of one odor presentation (closing of the odor valve) to the beginning of the next is 6.3 ± 0.5 seconds (25 percentile: 6 ± 0 sec, 75 percentile 8.7 ± 2.6 sec, mean and SD across 7 animals, 300 trials each). This is substantially lower than the prolonged theta oscillations we observe during our head-fixed in vivo whole cell recordings following acetophenone presentation, which last for at least 20 seconds. We did not attempt to change inter-trial intervals in this task, as enforced, longer inter-trial intervals can substantially alter odor discrimination learning (Bodyak and Slotnick, 1999; Walker and O’Connell, 1986). Controlled variation of the inter-trial interval simultaneous with physiological recordings probing subthreshold theta oscillations is indeed a possible next step in probing the hypothesis of how acetophenone perception might be perturbed, but would go substantially beyond the scope of this manuscript. To clarify these points, we have added a detailed description of the task in the Methods section of the revised manuscript.</p><p><italic>2) Awake vs. anesthetized.</italic></p><p><italic>Presenting the results from awake animals is a major improvement compared to the previous version. In the Methods section the authors described both e-phys recordings in awake and anesthetized states, but reading the manuscript it is difficult to sort out which experiments were performed in which state. Please make direct references in all figure captions if the data obtained in awake or anesthetized mice. In the Discussion, the authors should also address this question, specifically imaging data in the light of results from Kato 2012.</italic> </p><p>We appreciate the reviewer’s suggestion to clarify this point. We now specify the experimental conditions (imaging in anesthetized mice, recordings in awake or anesthetized mice) at the beginning of each figure legend.

It is not clear how these results can be extrapolated to functional significance. Kato 2012 results showed that MT cell responses in awake mice become sparser. Do they become more or less variable? Can the authors propose and discuss the sources of variability, and why it is different in control and experimental mice?</italic></p><p>[…]</p><p><italic>My overall conclusion is that the results are definitely worth publishing, but the paper needs more work.</italic></p><p>We thank the reviewer for his/her suggestion to clarify this important point. We agree with the reviewer that defining appropriate criteria for mitral cell odor responses is critical to correctly interpret our calcium imaging results. We chose a response threshold of 3.2 x SD, based on a ROC analysis, yielding a true positive rate (TPR) of 92.4%. In response to the reviewer’s concern, we have reanalyzed our data with a more stringent response criterion (3.8 x SD of the baseline trace, TPR = 86%). We find that modifying the response threshold does not change the interpretation of our results: the percentage of odor-responsive mitral cells is indistinguishable between M71 transgenic mice and controls, but response variability is increased in M71 transgenic mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Author response image 1</xref>).<fig id="fig7" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.16335.015</object-id><label>Author response image 1.</label><caption><title>Increasing threshold stringency does not change the comparison of the fraction of responsive mitral cells or their response variability between M71 transgenic mice and controls.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Mean fraction of neurons (horizontal line) responding to a given odorant at 0.01% vol./vol. dilution, with the response threshold set at 3.8 x SD, in control (black) and M71 transgenic (red) mice.

Together, these results show that M71 transgenic and control mitral cell responses are similarly affected by a change in our thresholding criterion.</p><p>We chose not to use the averaged response across individual trials as a criterion to select cells in our analysis. While averaged responses are indeed commonly used to assess odor-evoked response significance in calcium imaging experiments, we believe that they may incorrectly bias the analysis by excluding variable, yet robustly responding neurons. Therefore, data representing mitral and periglomerular call activity reflect the percent of active neurons averaged across individual trials, or the raw, unthresholded ∆F/F values. The only exception are the spot maps of mitral cell responses in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2H-I</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">6A and B</xref>, where we chose to depict cells responsive in at least two out of 4 trials.</p><p>Finally, in accord with the reviewer’s suggestion, we now discuss the increased variability of mitral cell responses in M71 transgenic mice in the revised version of the manuscript. One important source of variability in neural responses to sensory stimuli is noise, and neural circuit mechanisms to reduce variability often rely on averaging neural signals carrying redundant information (Faisal et al., 2008). Sensory neurons expressing the same odorant receptor, and converging onto two glomeruli in the olfactory bulb provide a striking example of this principle. In M71 transgenic mice, the number of sensory neurons expressing a given odorant receptor are strongly reduced, thus limiting the power of averaging to reduce variability.</p><p><italic>[Editors’ note: the author responses to the previous round of peer review follow.]</italic></p><p>Reviewer #1:</p><p><italic>1) The authors investigate the mechanisms for how the olfactory bulb circuitry achieves this level of robustness in function. They carry out patch recordings from mitral cells as well as calcium imaging of populations of mitral cells that project to the piriform.

The authors do identify a few interesting differences, in amplitude, duration and consistency of response. While the point about consistency of response is readily understood, as the authors say, if the circuit can &quot;greatly amplify weak odor-evoked signals,&quot; it would be useful for the authors to suggest mechanisms for the other differences.

While the reduced amplitude of response is readily explained by the substantially reduced input strength (Fleischmann et al., 2008), we can only speculate about the mechanisms underlying the increased response duration: One possible explanation for this observation could be that – as stimulus-driven glomerular input strength is reduced – this in turn might elicit levels of inhibition below those observed in wild-type mice, resulting in inefficient shutdown of – and thus prolonged – mitral cell responses. We now discuss these possibilities in the Discussion of the revised manuscript.</p><p>We have now performed whole cell recordings in mitral cells of awake mice and determined their responses to acetophenone, heptanal, ethyl acetate, hexanone, and an odorant mixture containing isoamyl acetate, 2-nonanone and cyclohexanol. Consistent with imaging data and electrophysiology in anaesthetized animals, our new experiments reveal that mitral cell responses in M71 transgenic mice are remarkably similar to littermate controls, including their odor-evoked firing rates. We do not observe any striking differences in odor tuning between M71 transgenic mice and littermate controls. However, the limited number of cell-odor pairs we can obtain in in vivo patch-clamp recordings precludes a systematic analysis of odor tuning.</p><p><italic>2) The analysis of the inhibition of acetophenone-evoked activity is interesting but possibly there are further insights to be gleaned from the available data. The authors build their case by combining intracellular mitral-cell recordings with Ca, imaging of PG cells, and then examine a concentration range for stimuli. I am intrigued that in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>, the response of the mitral cells does not saturate by 1% even though that of PG cells saturates around 0.1%.

We calculated the nearest neighbor distances for all cell-odor pairs that responded at least once to one of the stimuli (acetophenone, ethyl acetate, and hexanone, at three different concentrations). We used the average of this distance across responding neuron as a measure of clustering: the smaller the distance, the more clustered the responding neurons. We find that responses in M71 transgenic mice were slightly more clustered than in controls, consistent with the response maps presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G</xref>. However, this difference did not reach statistical significance. An analysis of the trial-to-trial variability of mitral cell responses to acetophenone and ethyl acetate across the 100-fold concentration range was presented in the original <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>. However, we now recognize that the analysis was difficult to read and incomplete. We have therefore included an analysis of cross-trial correlations in the revised manuscript (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>). We find that acetophenone-evoked patterns of mitral cell activity are highly variable at low concentration but become more consistent at higher concentrations. However, it is important to emphasize that the more reliable response patterns elicited by acetophenone at higher concentrations are comprised of substantially larger neural ensembles than those observed for other odorants.</p><p>To measure the spatial distribution of odor-responsive mitral cells we identified cells that responded at least once to each stimulus, and we calculated the distance to their nearest neighbor. The average of these distances yields an estimate for the clustering of responsive neurons.

A more detailed statistical analysis of the concentration dependence of acetophenone responses is precluded by the limited number of cell-odor pairs we can obtain in in vivo patch-clamp recordings in awake mice and by the residual variability in odor-evoked responses.

We have now systematically analyzed respiration tuning in response to acetophenone in M71 transgenic mice. We find that theta coupling in response to acetophenone exposure is indeed massively amplified in M71 transgenic mice after acetophenone exposure. During baseline conditions, theta coupling of MTCs was slightly weaker in M71 transgenic mice. There was no significant difference in the preferred phase of M71 transgenic or control MTCs. During odor exposure there was no significant difference in phase preference. With respect to inhibitory responses it is difficult to ascertain preferred phase as inhibition tends to be strong, prolonged and seemingly unmodulated. We do now show the average acetophenone response for each cell recorded in the awake animal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>). One potential explanation would be that odor-evoked inhibition might clamp the membrane potential to the Cl<sup>-</sup>reversal potential at the site of the synaptic input, thus masking any modulation.

We have also added a more quantitative description of these findings, which was not provided in the original publication, and show the raw data for each animal in the supplementary figure. These data recapitulate our original findings that M71 transgenic mice, which otherwise perform well on a go/no go operant conditioning odor discrimination task, do not discriminate between acetophenone and air in the same task.</p><p>However, we take the reviewer’s comment that failure to discriminate odor from air in such as task is not equivalent to stating that the animal cannot detect the ligand. We have also performed a new and different type of behavioral experiment that assesses the ability of M71 transgenic mice to detect odors. In the somewhat cruder, spontaneous task (sniff modulation in response to novel odor exposure), we find that M71 transgenic animals respond to both general odors and to acetophenone. This finding indicates that the previous interpretation that M71 transgenic mice are generally and completely unable to detect acetophenone was indeed an over-simplification.</p><p>Again following the reviewer’s suggestion, we performed whole cell recordings in awake mice. The finding that phasic odor responses to be acetophenone and other odorants are similar in wild-type and M71 transgenic mice are consistent in both awake and anesthetized mice. However, these new experiments also revealed a striking amplification of acetophenone-evoked theta oscillations. We hypothesize that these long-lasting (tens of seconds) and massively increased oscillatory network perturbations may impair the discrimination of acetophenone from air in the go/no go operant conditioning task. Therefore, these findings, together with the new result that sniffing is altered in response to acetophenone, require a more sophisticated explanation for our original findings that M71 transgenic mice do not discriminate between acetophenone and air in the go/no go operant conditioning task. We are grateful to the reviewer for this demanding and ultimately important critique.</p><p><italic>2) One of the main arguments of the paper is that the statistics of mitral cell responses to non-M71 odors are similar in M71 and control mice. It has been shown that not only is the resting state of M/T cells quite different in awake and anesthetized states (Rinberg, 2006, but also see Kollo, 2014), but also that M/T cell odor responses become sparser in the awake state (Kato, 2012). Thus, the balance between excitation and inhibition in these two states is likely very different (see also Cazakoff, Nat.Neuro.,2014). Since it is unclear exactly how the balance differs in these M71 mice, it is hard to predict if M/T cell activity would transition in a similar way to control mice between anesthetized and awake states, or how well the anesthetized activity reflects the potential difference in network function that could emerge in the awake-state activity of these mice.</italic></p><p>We agree with reviewer 2 that the balance of excitation and inhibition in the olfactory bulb is crucial to understanding the normalization of sensory input strength we observe in M71 transgenic mice, and that it is often believed that this balance is strongly affected by anesthesia. However, we disagree with the notion that olfactory bulb activity is vastly different between anaesthetized and awake, and we have indeed demonstrated that this is not the case when the entire population of cells is taken into account in an unbiased way, and if activity is analyzed on behaviorally relevant time scales of &lt;2 seconds (Kollo et al, 2014). However, we recognize that a more detailed characterization of mitral cell responses in awake M71 transgenic mice can provide important new mechanistic insight intoolfactory bulb signal normalization. Therefore, to directly test for potential differences between awake and anaesthetized recordings we have performed whole cell recordings in awake mice to complement our imaging data in anesthetized mice. In addition, this new set of experiments allows for a detailed analysis of the temporal response properties of mitral cells while avoiding the biases associated with extracellular recording. The main findings that emerge from these new experiments are:</p><p>A) The basic physiological properties of mitral cells, including their input resistance, time constant and spontaneous firing rates are similar between M71 transgenic mice and controls.</p><p>B) In M71 transgenic mice, inhibition in response to acetophenone is increased and prolonged. In contrast, inhibition in response to non-acetophenone odorants is decreased.</p><p>C) Theta modulation in response to acetophenone is massively increased in M71 transgenic mice.</p><p>D) Mitral cell firing rates in M71 transgenic mice in response to acetophenone and non-acetophenone odorants are similar to wild-type.</p><p>E) Most parameters of mitral cell activity, including spontaneous and odor-evoked firing rates are similar in awake and anesthetized mice. Consistent with our published data (Kollo et al., 2014), anesthesia primarily appears to affect mitral cell response durations. No differences in the effects of anesthesia were observed between M71 transgenic and wild-type littermate controls.</p><p><italic>3) I found it very interesting that the 5% of OSNs carrying the odor signal can evoke a similar effect on postsynaptic cells, mitral cells, as a population. After reading this paper it is very hard to make definite conclusions about the mechanisms for such normalization. The authors proposed a role for PG cells in this process. It is one plausible explanation, but I am not sure how much this paper adds to revealing the mechanisms of signal normalization. In my opinion, there are two basic approaches. First, that the proposed mouse model can help us understand basic mechanisms of olfactory processing. The data presented does not convince me that this is the case. Second, a new model by itself presents an interesting phenomenon, and it is worth understanding how, with such unnatural structure of receptor input, the system can behave in an almost &quot;normal&quot; way. I am not sure that this question has been answered here.</italic> </p><p>We agree with reviewer 2 that it is important to understand how olfactory bulb circuits can extract meaningful information from massively degraded sensory input. We believe that our manuscript, including new whole cell recordings in awake mice, substantially extends our mechanistic understanding of signal normalization in the olfactory bulb. Therefore, particularly in light of the new behavioral data and the extended electrophysiological data, we provide a considerably more refined mechanistic explanation for the behavioral phenotype of the model system.</p><p><italic>4) Another result is very intriguing: the reliability of the odor responses in M71 mouse is significantly lower than in a control mouse. The authors suggest that the decrease of the Pearson correlation coefficient from 0.4 to 0.17 tells us something about the decrease of the mouse's ability to discriminate odors. First, we do not know if the increased variability of the responses remains in awake mice. Second, the comparison to behavioral performance seems like a stretch. Do M71 mice perform poorer than control mice with the same odors for which variability was measured? The authors should either make a more direct connection between the physiological and behavioral observations, or they should explain the origin of such variability.</italic> </p><p>The reviewer is correct that we cannot claim that the observed mitral cell trial-to-trial variability directly causes the odor mixture discrimination deficits observed in M71 transgenic mice. Rather, we state that these data are consistent with poorer performance. Although Reviewer 1 found this connection <italic>‘readily understood’</italic> and Reviewer 3 agrees that ‘[this variability] is consistent with the idea that massive convergence of ORN axons increases the reliability of odor responses’we have now clarified the link between this observation and the behavior in the text. Unfortunately, the limited numbers of cell-odor pairs that can be obtained in in vivo patch-clamp recordings in awake mice precludes a reliable statistical analysis of trail-to-trial variability under these conditions.</p></body></sub-article></article>
