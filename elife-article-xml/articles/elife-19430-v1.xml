diseases, including diabetes. Although the functional roles of the respective signaling pathways have been extensively studied, the control of insulin production and release is only partially understood. Herein, we show that in <italic>Drosophila</italic> expression of insulin-like peptides is regulated by neprilysin activity. Concomitant phenotypes of altered neprilysin expression included impaired food intake, reduced body size, and characteristic changes in the metabolite composition. Ectopic expression of a catalytically inactive mutant did not elicit any of the phenotypes, which confirms abnormal peptide hydrolysis as a causative factor. A screen for corresponding substrates of the neprilysin identified distinct peptides that regulate insulin-like peptide expression, feeding behavior, or both. The high functional conservation of neprilysins and their substrates renders the characterized principles applicable to numerous species, including higher eukaryotes and humans.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.19430.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.19430.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.19430.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>The hormone insulin and similar molecules called insulin-like peptides act as signals to control many processes in the body, including growth, stress responses and aging. Disrupting these signaling pathways can cause many diseases, with diabetes being the most common of these. Although the roles of the signaling pathways have been well studied, it is less clear how the body controls the production of insulin and insulin-like peptides.</p><p>Neprilysins are enzymes that can cut other proteins and peptides by a process known as hydrolysis. Their targets (known as “substrates”) include peptides that regulate a range of cell processes, and neprilysins have therefore been linked with many diseases. Fruit flies have at least five different neprilysin enzymes, but their substrates have not yet been identified. One of these, known as Nep4A, is produced in muscle tissue and appears to be important for muscles to work properly.</p><p>Hallier, Schiemann et al. reveal that Nep4A regulates the production of insulin-like peptides. The experiments used fruit fly larvae that had been genetically engineered so that the level of Nep4A could be altered in muscle tissue. Larvae with very high or very low levels of Nep4A eat less food, have smaller bodies and produce different amounts of insulin-like peptides compared to normal larvae.</p><p>Further experiments show that Nep4A can hydrolyze a number of peptides that regulate the production and the release of insulin-like peptides. This suggests that the enzymatic activity of neprilysins plays a direct role in controlling the production of insulin. The next challenge is to find out whether these findings apply to humans and other animals that also have neprilysins.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.19430.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.19430.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>insulin signaling</kwd><kwd>insulin expression</kwd><kwd>feeding behavior</kwd><kwd>peptide metabolism</kwd><kwd>metallopeptidase</kwd><kwd>neprilysin</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd><italic>D. melanogaster</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001659</institution-id><institution>Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>SFB944</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Paululat</surname><given-names>Achim</given-names></name><name><surname>Meyer</surname><given-names>Heiko</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>University of Osnabrück</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Incentive Award</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Meyer</surname><given-names>Heiko</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100003099</institution-id><institution>FAZIT Stiftung</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>PhD stipend</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Hallier</surname><given-names>Benjamin</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>State of Lower Saxony</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>11-76251-99-15/12 (ZN2832)</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Paululat</surname><given-names>Achim</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The catalytic activity of a <italic>Drosophila</italic> neprilysin is critical to proper insulin expression and food intake by regulating homeostasis of distinct signaling peptides.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Neprilysins are highly conserved ectoenzymes that cleave and thereby inactivate many physiologically relevant peptides in the extracellular space, thus contributing considerably to the maintenance of peptide homeostasis in this compartment. Members of the neprilysin family generally consist of a short N-terminal cytoplasmic domain, a membrane spanning region, and a large extracellular domain with two highly conserved sequence motifs (HExxH; ExxA/GD) critical for zinc coordination, catalysis, and substrate or inhibitor binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Matthews, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Oefner et al., 2000</xref>). Because of these characteristics, neprilysins are classified as M13 zinc metallopeptidases. For human Neprilysin (NEP), the most well-characterized family member, identified substrates include endothelins, angiotensins I and II, enkephalins, bradykinin, atrial natriuretic peptide, substance P, and the amyloid-beta peptide (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Turner et al., 2001</xref>). Because of this high substrate variability, NEP activity has been implicated in the pathogenesis of hypertension (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Molinaro et al., 2002</xref>), analgesia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Whitworth, 2003</xref>), cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Turner et al., 2001</xref>), and Alzheimer’s disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Iwata et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Belyaev et al., 2009</xref>). Recent clinical trials have demonstrated significant efficacy of Neprilysin inhibitors in the treatment of certain indications (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Jessup, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">McMurray et al., 2014</xref>). However, despite the clinical relevance of the neprilysins, the physiological function and <italic>in vivo</italic> substrates of most family members are unknown.</p><p>In <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic>, at least five neprilysin genes are expressed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Meyer et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Sitnik et al., 2014</xref>), two of the corresponding protein products, Nep2 and Nep4, were reported to be enzymatically active (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bland et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Meyer et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Thomas et al., 2005</xref>). With respect to Nep4, a critical function of the enzyme's non-catalytic intracellular N-terminus has been demonstrated: when present in excess, the domain induces severe muscle degeneration concomitant with lethality during late larval development. Because the intracellular domain interacts with a carbohydrate kinase, impaired energy metabolism has been proposed as the underlying cause of the phenotype (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Panz et al., 2012</xref>). In addition, Nep2 has been implicated in the regulation of locomotion and geotactic behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bland et al., 2009</xref>), and neprilysin activity in general appears to be critical to the formation of middle- and long-term memory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Turrel et al., 2016</xref>), as well as to the regulation of pigment dispersing factor (PDF) signaling within circadian neural circuits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Isaac et al., 2007</xref>). However, despite these experiments and recent findings that suggest a critical role of neprilysins in reproduction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Sitnik et al., 2014</xref>), the physiological functionality of these enzymes is still far from being understood. In this respect, the lack of identified substrates with <italic>in vivo</italic> relevance is a major hindrance.</p><p>Herein, we describe the identification of numerous novel substrates of <italic>Drosophila</italic> Neprilysin 4 (Nep4) and provide evidence that Nep4-mediated peptide hydrolysis regulates insulin-like peptide (ILP) expression and food intake. These results establish a correlation between neprilysin activity and ILP expression and thus clarify our understanding of the complex mechanisms that control the production and release of these essential peptides.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Modulating the expression of Neprilysin 4 affects lifespan and body size</title><p>In previous experiments, we showed that Nep4 is expressed in larval body wall muscles and that increased expression of the peptidase in this tissue interferes with muscle function and integrity and severely impairs movement of the larvae (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Panz et al., 2012</xref>). In the present study, we found that an increase in Nep4A in muscle cells (<italic>mef2</italic>-Gal4 driver) also induced biphasic lethality. An early phase occurred throughout embryonic and early larval development, and a late phase was evident by the end of larval development (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Significantly, early lethality was observed only upon overexpression of the active enzyme; expression of catalytically inactive Nep4A, carrying a glutamine instead of an essential glutamate (E873Q) within the zinc-binding motif, did not affect viability at this point of development. By contrast, overexpression of catalytically active or inactive Nep4A constructs induced late larval lethality. These distinct effects demonstrate that lethality during early development is caused exclusively by a detrimental increase in catalytic activity, whereas late larval lethality appears to be a consequence of multiple physiological impairments. Comparable overexpression levels of the wild-type enzyme and the mutated construct were demonstrated previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Panz et al., 2012</xref>). Muscle-specific knockdown of <italic>nep4</italic> slightly increased embryonic mortality, but the majority of the respective animals died during metamorphosis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). To confirm RNAi specificity, we also analyzed flies expressing both the respective RNAi construct as well as the Nep4A overexpression construct. Simultaneous overexpression of Nep4A completely rescued the RNAi phenotypes (embryonic/pupal lethality), thus confirming specificity of the knockdown (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). The result that respective animals exhibited a marginally, yet significantly increased lethality rate during third instar larval stage indicates that overexpression of Nep4A is somewhat more effective than knockdown, eventually resulting in slightly increased expression levels of the peptidase, which, as depicted above, result in elevated larval lethality.<fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.19430.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Modulating <italic>nep4</italic> expression affects life span and body size.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Lethality assay. The percentages (%) of animals of a specific stage that did not develop into the next stage are shown. While muscle-specific overexpression of Nep4A (<italic>mef2</italic>-Gal4 x UAS-Nep4A) led to biphasic lethality with critical phases during embryonic and late larval development, overexpression of catalytically inactive Nep4A in the same tissue (<italic>mef2</italic>-Gal4 x UAS-Nep4A<sub>inact</sub>) led to lethality only in the third instar larval stage. Muscle-specific <italic>nep4</italic> knockdown (<italic>mef2</italic>-Gal4 x UAS-<italic>nep4</italic> RNAi) slightly increased embryonic lethality, but the majority of the animals died as pupae. Glial cell-specific overexpression (<italic>repo</italic>-Gal4 x UAS-Nep4A) or knockdown of the peptidase (<italic>repo</italic>-Gal4 x UAS-<italic>nep4</italic> RNAi) did not affect life span, which was also observed for neuronal overexpression or knockdown (<italic>elav</italic>-Gal4 x UAS-Nep4A; <italic>elav</italic>-Gal4 x UAS-<italic>nep4</italic> RNAi). <italic>mef2</italic>-Gal4 x w1118, <italic>repo</italic>-Gal4 x w1118, <italic>elav</italic>-Gal4 x w1118, UAS-Nep4A x w1118, UAS-<italic>nep4</italic> RNAi x w1118, and w1118 were used as controls.

To determine whether the effects described above (using <italic>mef2</italic>-Gal4 as a driver) are exclusively based on Nep4 activity in muscles, or if neuronal Nep4 is also involved, we used pan-neuronal <italic>elav</italic>-Gal4 as a driver to increase or reduce <italic>nep4</italic> expression. In this line of experiments, neither overexpression nor knockdown of <italic>nep4</italic> had any significant influence on viability (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). This result indicates that the effects observed with <italic>mef2</italic>-Gal4 are muscle-specific.</p><p>In addition to muscle tissue, Nep4 is also expressed in glial cells of the central nervous system (CNS) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Meyer et al., 2009</xref>). However, in contrast to the effects observed in muscle cells, neither increased nor reduced <italic>nep4</italic> expression in glial cells, using glia-specific <italic>repo</italic>-Gal4 as a driver, significantly affected life span (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>).</p><p>Besides reduced viability, elevated Nep4A levels in muscle tissue affected body size. Interestingly, as with increased lethality during early development, the effects on body size depended on enzymatic activity. In third instar larvae, muscle-specific overexpression of the active enzyme decreased the size and weight of the animals relative to control animals, whereas overexpression of catalytically inactive Nep4A did not affect size or weight. Knockdown of the peptidase in the same tissue did also not significantly alter these parameters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). In contrast to the muscle-specific effects, increased <italic>nep4A</italic> expression in glial cells or neurons did not affect the size or weight of the larvae. Glial cell specific <italic>nep4</italic> knockdown slightly reduced both parameters, whereas neuronal knockdown had no effect (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). In line with the lethality assay, the effects of <italic>nep4</italic> knockdown on size and weight were completely rescued by simultaneous overexpression of Nep4A, which again confirms specificity of the respective RNAi construct. The depicted results indicate essential functions of Nep4 in muscle tissue and glial cells. However, the effects of modifying <italic>nep4</italic> expression were more severe in muscles, suggesting the active enzyme has a critical function particularly in this tissue.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Modulating the expression of Neprilysin 4 interferes with basal metabolic processes</title><p>To understand the physiological basis of this function in more detail, we analyzed the metabolite composition in animals with increased or reduced <italic>nep4</italic> levels and compared the respective compositions to those in control specimens. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>, increasing or decreasing the expression of <italic>nep4</italic> in muscle tissue affected metabolite concentrations in transgenic third instar larvae. Of note, the depicted PCA scores plot is purely based on the amplitude of correlated between-sample variations, implicating that the strongest variations in metabolite composition are those separating the three genotypes. Further analysis of the respective data revealed that profound changes are related to the energy metabolism. Knockdown of <italic>nep4</italic> increased the levels of fructose and a purine and decreased the levels of NAD, a purine nucleotide, and glutamine (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B,C</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3-data">Figure 2—source data 1</xref>). Nep4A overexpression increased the signals of histidine, glutamine, and the same purine. In addition, a significant increase was observed in the spectral regions specific to glucose and fructose, indicating elevated levels of the two monosaccharides. Of note, only the glucose and fructose signals with contributions from both sugars (depicted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>) were significantly affected, implying that there is a more stable response in the sum of the two than in either of them. However, evaluation of the corresponding individual spectra clearly suggested that both sugars are increased (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). On the other hand, lactate, NAD, trehalose, and tyrosine concentrations were reduced in Nep4A-overexpressing animals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B,C</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3-data">Figure 2—source data 1</xref>). Of note, increased formation of lactate and NAD is a hallmark of aerobic glycolysis, a specific metabolic program that starts approximately 12 hr before the end of embryogenesis. Aerobic glycolysis enables hatched 1st instar larvae to efficiently convert dietary carbohydrates into biomass, thereby supporting the considerable increase in body mass that occurs during larval development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Tennessen et al., 2014</xref>). Inhibition of aerobic glycolysis in the course of this growth phase prevents the animals from metabolizing sufficient quantities of sugar, resulting in larval lethality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Tennessen et al., 2011</xref>). The fact that animals overexpressing Nep4A die primarily during the embryonic-larval transition and during larval development (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>) and exhibit considerably reduced lactate and NAD levels indicates that an excess of Nep4A may interfere with this distinct metabolic program.

We focused on <italic>dilps 1</italic>, <italic>2</italic>, <italic>3</italic>, and <italic>5</italic> because they encode the major insulin-like peptides expressed by larval insulin-producing cells (IPCs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Rulifson et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Brogiolo et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Cao and Brown, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Ikeya et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Lee et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Nässel et al., 2013</xref>). IPCs are located within the median neurosecretory cell cluster of the central brain and apparently function like pancreatic β-cells, since IPC ablation in <italic>Drosophila</italic> results in elevated levels of circulating glucose. In addition, animals with ablated IPCs are smaller than wild-type specimens, and they weigh less (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Broughton et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Rulifson et al., 2002</xref>). Significantly, these characteristic effects of IPC ablation were phenocopied by muscle-specific Nep4A overexpression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">2</xref>). Furthermore, the respective transgenic animals exhibited considerably reduced expression of the selected <italic>dilps</italic>. In Nep4A-overexpressing animals, <italic>dilp1</italic> expression decreased by 59%, <italic>dilp2</italic> by 83%, <italic>dilp3</italic> expression by 88%, and <italic>dilp5</italic> expression by 84%, relative to expression in controls.

The rather mild effect of <italic>nep4</italic> knockdown on <italic>dilp</italic> expression, when compared to the effects of Nep4A overexpression, suggests that other, yet unknown peptidases can compensate for reduced Nep4 activity. In line with the results from the feeding assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>), <italic>dilp</italic> expression is only affected by the wild type enzyme, while overexpression of catalytically inactive Nep4A did not significantly alter expression of the selected <italic>dilps</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>).</p><p>To determine if expression of insulin-like peptides is regulated exclusively by muscle-derived Nep4 or if intrinsic CNS signaling is also involved, we altered <italic>nep4</italic> expression in a nervous-system-specific manner.

Although these effects were minor compared to the effects of modulating the expression of muscle-bound Nep4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>), they demonstrate that proper regulation of <italic>dilp</italic> expression also requires adequate Nep4 levels within the CNS.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>Neprilysin 4 localizes to the surface of larval body wall muscles and IPCs</title><p>In order to understand the physiological relation between <italic>dilp</italic> expression and Nep4 activity in more detail, we analyzed the expression pattern and the subcellular localization of the peptidase in larval body wall muscles and the larval CNS.

insulin- and IGF-signaling have been intensively studied, the control of ILP production and release is not well understood. This study demonstrates that modulating the expression of a <italic>Drosophila</italic> neprilysin interferes with the expression of insulin-like peptides, thus establishing a correlation between neprilysin activity and the regulation of insulin signaling. A high physiological relevance is confirmed by the fact that altering <italic>nep4</italic> expression phenocopies characteristic effects of IPC ablation, including reduced size and weight of corresponding animals, as well as increased levels of carbohydrates such as glucose and fructose (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">2</xref>). The result that the levels of these sugars are increased, although food intake rates are reduced (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>) presumably reflects the physiological impact of the diminished <italic>ilp</italic> expression that is also obvious in corresponding animals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). In this respect, the impaired insulin signaling likely results in inefficient metabolization and thus accumulation of the sugars, which overcompensates the diametrical effects of reduced food intake. By identifying 16 novel peptide substrates of Nep4, the majority of which are involved in regulating <italic>dilp</italic> expression or feeding behavior (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>), and by localizing the peptidase to the surface of body wall muscles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>) and IPCs within the larval CNS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>), we provide initial evidence that neprilysin-mediated hydrolysis of hemolymph circulating as well as CNS intrinsic peptides is the physiological basis of the described phenotypes. The finding that only the catalytically active enzyme affected <italic>dilp</italic> expression whereas the inactive construct did not (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>), substantiates this evidence because it confirms aberrant enzymatic activity and thus abnormal peptide hydrolysis as a causative parameter. Interestingly, we observed the strongest effects on size and <italic>dilp</italic> expression with muscle-specific overexpression of Nep4; overexpression of the peptidase in the CNS was less detrimental (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>). These results indicate that hemolymph circulating peptides accessible to muscle-bound Nep4 are mainly responsible for the observed effects, while CNS intrinsic peptide signaling is less relevant. The fact that all peptides cleaved by Nep4 (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>) could be released into the hemolymph, either from enteroendocrine cells or from neurohormonal release sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Nässel and Winther, 2010</xref>), substantiates this indication. Since the <italic>Drosophila</italic> midgut is the source of several neuropeptides (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Veenstra et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Reiher et al., 2011</xref>), it is conceivable that a main reason for the observed phenotypes is aberrant cleavage of certain gut-derived peptides that are required for proper midgut-IPC communication. Allatostatin A, neuropeptide F, diuretic hormone 31, and some tachykinins are produced by endocrine cells of the gut (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Veenstra et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Reiher et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Lenz et al., 2001</xref>). Interestingly, all have been implicated in regulating <italic>dilp</italic> expression and/or feeding behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Nässel et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Pool and Scott, 2014</xref>), and most of them, namely allatostatin A1-4, diuretic hormone 31, and tachykinin 1, 2, 4, and 5, were cleaved by Nep4 (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>), indicating enzyme-substrate relationships. Thus, these results suggest that Nep4 activity at the surface of muscle cells is necessary to maintain homeostasis of distinct hemolymph circulating signaling peptides, probably gut-derived, thereby ensuring proper midgut-IPC communication. On the other hand, fat body-IPC feedback may be affected as well. However, the only factors known to mediate this process, Unpaired 2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Rajan and Perrimon, 2012</xref>), DILP6 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bai et al., 2012</xref>), and Stunted (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Delanoue et al., 2016</xref>﻿) have molecular masses of more than 5 kDa, and thus exceed the maximum mass of a putative neprilysin substrate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Oefner et al., 2000</xref>). Consequently, a direct regulatory influence of Nep4 on Unpaired 2, DILP6, or Stunted activity appears unlikely.</p><p>In addition to body wall muscles, <italic>nep4</italic> is expressed in numerous cells of the central nervous system, predominantly in glial cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). Interestingly, compared to the muscle-specific effects, modulating <italic>nep4</italic> expression in this tissue has distinct and less severe effects on <italic>dilp</italic> expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>). This result suggests that CNS intrinsic Nep4 activity affects different neuropeptide regulatory systems than the corresponding muscle-bound activity. Considering the rather broad expression in glial cells, it is furthermore likely that the CNS regulation affects more than one system. However, localization at the IPC surface (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>) clearly supports a direct function in the regulation of <italic>dilp</italic> expression. In this context, spatial proximity of the peptidase may be necessary to ensure low ligand concentrations and thus tight regulation of specific neuropeptide receptors present at the surface of IPCs. Such receptors include an allatostatin A receptor (Dar-2) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Hentze et al., 2015</xref>), a tachykinin receptor (DTKR) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Birse et al., 2011</xref>), and the short neuropeptide F receptor (sNPFR) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Lee et al., 2008</xref>). All are essential to proper <italic>dilp</italic> expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Lee et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Hentze et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Birse et al., 2011</xref>). Interestingly, with respect to sNPFR, corresponding ligands (sNPF1<sub>1–11</sub>, sNPF1<sub>4–11</sub>, and sNPF2<sub>12–19</sub>) exhibit very high-binding affinities, with IC<sub>50</sub> values in the low nanomolar range (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Garczynski et al., 2006</xref>), a finding that further emphasizes the need for effective ligand clearance mechanisms in order to prevent inadvertent receptor activation. Localization of Nep4 to the surface of IPCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>) and confirmation of Dar-2, DTKR, and sNPFR ligands as substrates of the peptidase (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>) strongly indicate that Nep4 participates in such clearance mechanisms.</p><p>Of note, sNPF species were detected in both, CNS and hemolymph preparations, with neuroendocrine functions of the respective peptides being suggested (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Veenstra et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Garczynski et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Baggerman et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Wegener and Gorbashov, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Wegener et al., 2006</xref>). The dual localization is interesting because both compartments are accessible to Nep4, either to the CNS resident or to the muscle-bound enzyme. Significantly, sNPF is a potent regulator of <italic>dilp</italic> expression. Increased sNPF levels result in upregulation of <italic>dilp</italic> expression, and decreased sNPF levels have the opposite effect (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Lee et al., 2008</xref>). The fact that these results inversely correlate with the effects of modulating <italic>nep4</italic> expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>) suggests a functional relationship between sNPF and the neprilysin. Nep4-mediated cleavage of distinct sNPF species (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>) represents further evidence for this relationship.</p><p>Besides sNPF, Nep4 also cleaves corazonin, drosulfakinins, and allatostatin A (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). Interestingly, corazonin promotes food intake (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Hergarden et al., 2012</xref>), while allatostatin A and drosulfakinins inhibit it (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Hergarden et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Söderberg et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Chen et al., 2016</xref>). This regulatory activity on peptides with opposing physiological functions indicates that Nep4 affects multiple aspects of feeding control, rather than promoting or inhibiting food intake in a mutually exclusive manner. Our finding that both, <italic>nep4</italic> knockdown and overexpression larvae exhibit reduced food intake (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>) supports this indication since it suggests that regular Nep4 activity adjusts the general peptide homeostasis in a manner that promotes optimal food intake, with deviations in either direction being deteriorative. The result that <italic>nep4</italic> knockdown animals exhibit reduced food intake for only up to 20 min of feeding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>) may reflect this complex regulation since it indicates that at the onset of feeding reduced cleavage of peptides inhibiting food intake (e.g. allatostatin A, drosulfakinins) is a dominant factor. With ongoing feeding, accumulation of peptides promoting food intake (e.g. corazonin) may become decisive, thus restoring intake rates.</p><p>In addition, Nep4 hydrolyzes numerous peptides that regulate <italic>dilp</italic> expression, including tachykinins, allatostatin A, and sNPF. However, AKH, a functional homolog of vertebrate glucagon that acts antagonistically to insulin, is also a substrate of Nep4 (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). This finding indicates that the Nep4-mediated regulation of <italic>dilp</italic> expression and sugar homeostasis can also not be attributed to a single substrate or cleavage event. Rather, it is a result of the concerted hydrolysis of several critical peptides, including both, hemolymph circulating and CNS intrinsic factors. Taking into account that overexpression and knockdown of <italic>nep4</italic> have discrete effects on <italic>dilp</italic> expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>), but comparable effects on feeding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>), it furthermore appears likely that dysregulation of the Nep4-mediated peptide homeostasis affects both processes somewhat independently of each other. The fact that among the novel Nep4 substrates we identified peptides that presumably affect either <italic>dilp</italic> signaling (e.g. DH<sub>31</sub>), or food intake (e.g. leucokinin, drosulfakinins) in a largely exclusive manner supports this indication.</p><p>Because neprilysins and many of the novel substrates identified in this study are evolutionarily conserved factors, neprilysin-mediated regulation of insulin-like peptide expression and feeding behavior may be relevant not only to the energy metabolism in <italic>Drosophila</italic>, but also to corresponding processes in vertebrates, including humans. Interestingly, a critical function of murine Neprilysin in determining body mass has already been reported. The regulation depended primarily on the catalytic activity of peripheral NEP, while the CNS-bound enzyme was less important (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Becker et al., 2010</xref>). However, until now, the underlying physiology has been obscure, essentially because no causative hydrolysis event had been identified. Our finding that also in <italic>Drosophila</italic> mainly peripheral (muscle-bound) Nep4 activity affected body mass, while CNS-specific modulations had only minor effects on size or weight (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>), indicates that the neprilysin-mediated regulation of food intake, body size and insulin expression involves similar physiological pathways in both species. Furthermore, the fact that altered catalytic activity and thus abnormal peptide hydrolysis is a critical factor in mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Becker et al., 2010</xref>) and in <italic>Drosophila</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">3</xref>) emphasizes the need to generate comprehensive, enzyme-specific lists of neprilysin <italic>in vivo</italic> substrates. In this context, the results of our screen for novel Nep4 substrates (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>) may be a valuable resource in order to identify corresponding substrates in vertebrates and humans.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Fly strains</title><p>The following <italic>Drosophila</italic> lines were used in this work.

Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and K VijayRaghavan as the Senior Editor.

They show that overexpression and knock down of Nep4 in muscle tissue cause stage specific lethality and size/mass difference in the 3rd instar larvae. Manipulation of Nep4 also potently impacts development and the metabolome. The authors also assessed the endogenous expression of Nep4 in larval tissue and find that Nep4 is expressed in the muscle as well as in the central nervous system, including in the neuroendocrine cells that produce insulin like peptides. Given the role of neprilysins in regulation of neuropeptide signaling and the novelty of these phenotypes, these findings are interesting and could be of interest to a broad audience. However, currently the data presented is somewhat preliminary and several issues need to be addressed. In particular, the authors need to clarify how Nep4 is regulating metabolism, through muscle or through other cell types including neurons.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) In this manuscript, the authors use <italic>mef2</italic>-Gal4 to knock down Nep4 expression in muscle tissue. They conclude that Nep4 acts on the muscle tissue to regulate metabolism. However, the authors also show that Nep4 is expressed in the nervous system including the cells that produce the insulin like peptides. Although <italic>mef2</italic> is a well-known muscle marker in <italic>Drosophila, mef2</italic> gene and enhancers are also expressed in other types of cells, including neurons. These neurons include clock cells, which may play a direct role in regulating insulin signaling, release and therefore larval metabolism and feeding behavior.</p><p>The authors could asses the expression pattern of the <italic>mef2</italic>-Gal4 driver that is used in the manuscript to exclude the possibility that the phenotypes observed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">3</xref> are not neuronal but muscle specific.</p><p>The authors could also try a neuron specific driver such as <italic>elav</italic>-Gal4 or <italic>nsyb</italic>-Gal4 to repeat the experiments in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>. If the Nep4 function is required in the muscle then neuron specific drivers will have no effects on lethality, body size or mass.</p><p>2) Another major concern is the specificity of the RNAi experiments. In some cases there is little effect of RNAi, but a large effect with overexpression, while in other situations the opposing manipulations result in the same phenotype. It is easy to imagine that the effect of Nep4A is resulting in non-physiological effects? This is particularly important for interpreting the phenotypes of reduced <italic>dilp</italic> expression. Additionally, is it concerning that the RNAi and overexpression have comparable effects on feeding, but different effects on ilp levels?</p><p>Another issue is that the genetic control for the experiments shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">3</xref> do not include a UAS-control (UAS-nep4A x w1118, UAS-<italic>nep4</italic> RNAi). This is an important control, as a background expression of UAS-constructs is not rare and may have effects on its own (unlike GAL4 background expression). To demonstrate a lack of effect of the UAS construct alone, however, at least data for the effects of the UAS-controls in the genetic experiments shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> should be included.</p><p>3) Another issue is whether the authors need to include heterozygote controls. If there is a small ubiquitous background expression of Nep4, it is not difficult to see that this might have effects by itself.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.19430.019</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>[…] Essential revisions:</italic> </p><p><italic>1) In this manuscript, the authors use mef2-Gal4 to knock down Nep4 expression in muscle tissue.

Simultaneous overexpression of Nep4A completely rescued the <italic>nep4</italic> RNAi phenotypes (embryonic/pupal lethality, reduced size/weight), thus confirming specificity of the knockdown. The result that respective animals exhibited a marginally, yet significantly increased lethality rate during third instar larval stage indicates that overexpression of Nep4A is somewhat more effective than knockdown, eventually resulting in slightly increased expression levels of the peptidase. The fact that increased Nep4A levels result in elevated larval lethality was already depicted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>. The “Materials and methods”, “Results”, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> were amended accordingly.</p><p>Regarding the observation that <italic>nep4</italic> RNAi and overexpression have comparable effects on feeding, but different effects on ilp levels, we do not consider this point unexpected. It rather indicates that impaired Nep4 activity, which likely causes aberrant hydrolysis of numerous peptides (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>), affectsboth processes somewhat independently of each other. This indication is supported by the fact that among the novel Nep4 substrates we identified peptides that presumably affect either <italic>dilp</italic> signaling (e.g. DH<sub>31</sub>), or food intake (e.g. leucokinin, drosulfakinins) in a largely exclusive manner. We amended the “Discussion” to include this point.</p><p><italic>Another issue is that the genetic control for the experiments shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">3</xref> do not include a UAS-control (UAS-nep4A x w1118, UAS-nep4 RNAi).

Thus, if there is a small background activity of the UAS-constructs, it is of no distinct physiological relevance. The respective UAS-controls were included in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>.</p></body></sub-article></article>
