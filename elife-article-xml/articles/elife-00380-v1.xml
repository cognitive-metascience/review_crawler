Although the <italic>PTEN</italic> mutant cells were sensitive to starvation, they successfully competed with neighboring cells by autonomous and non-autonomous mechanisms distinct from cell competition. The overgrowth was strictly dependent on the activity of the downstream components Akt/PKB and TORC1, and a reduction in amino acid uptake by reducing the levels of the amino acid transporter Slimfast caused clones of <italic>PTEN</italic> mutant cells to collapse.

If one or more mutations result in a cell proliferating in an unregulated manner, it is referred to as a cancer cell. The generation of cancer cells is a relatively common occurrence within organisms, but these rogue cells are generally recognized and destroyed by the organism’s immune system. However, when the immune system fails to identify and eliminate cancer cells, they can proliferate to form malignant, life-threatening tumors.</p><p>Mutations in a gene called <italic>PTEN</italic> are often found within cells that develop into cancerous tumors. This gene is normally expressed as a protein that is involved in the regulation of cell division, preventing cells from growing and dividing too quickly. However, when the protein PTEN is absent or non-functional, cells experience enhanced growth, proliferation, and survival. Such cells are also thought to be resistant to nutrient restriction, but the mechanism responsible for this resistance is not well understood.</p><p>Here, Nowak et al. investigate the behavior of cells lacking PTEN in a fly model under a variety of nutritional conditions. When the supply of nutrients is limited, cells lacking PTEN shift resources from cell growth to cell multiplication. This appears to allow PTEN-deficient cells to outcompete neighboring wild-type cells; Nowak et al. suggest these rapidly proliferating cells are capable of effectively hoarding nutrient stores, both in their immediate vicinity and organism-wide. Further studies that focus on changes in gene expression may be able to uncover the mechanism that allows PTEN-deficient cells to proliferate when nutrients are restricted. Moreover, by shedding light on a factor that has an important influence on tumor development, these results may have implications for cancer treatment strategies.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.00380.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.00380.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author keywords</title><kwd>tumor suppression</kwd><kwd>PTEN</kwd><kwd>insulin signaling</kwd><kwd>hyperplasia</kwd><kwd>apoptosis</kwd><kwd>nutrient restriction</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>D. melanogaster</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Swiss National Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>31003A_125208</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Stocker</surname><given-names>Hugo</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>ETH Zürich</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Hafen</surname><given-names>Ernst</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Nutrient limitation elicits differential responses in cells lacking the tumor suppressor PTEN and in normal cells, resulting in hyperplastic overgrowth of <italic>PTEN</italic> mutant tissue independent of additional mutations.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Clinically detectable cancer cells carry a multitude of mutations and chromosomal aberrations, and they display an enormous genetic heterogeneity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Salk et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Wong et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Brosnan and Iacobuzio-Donahue, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Marusyk et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Turner and Reis-Filho, 2012</xref>). It is therefore desirable to target earlier tumorigenic stages but we know comparatively little about how pre-cancerous cells progressively develop into tumors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Moreno, 2008</xref>). The model system <italic>Drosophila</italic> allows analyzing the behavior of cells lacking particular tumor suppressor functions. During the growth phase (larval instars), the cells of the imaginal discs (that will eventually give rise to adult appendages) remain diploid and proliferate until the discs have reached an appropriate size. The simple architecture of the imaginal discs (the disc proper consists of a single cell-layered epithelium and is covered by the peripodial epithelium) enables the labeling and tracking of cell populations. These cell populations can be genetically manipulated with the help of sophisticated tools. Finally, since the larvae live in their food, cellular stress situations can be imposed by controlling the food source.</p><p>We have focused our analysis on cells lacking the tumor suppressor PTEN (phosphatase and tensin homolog deleted on chromosome 10). PTEN is well conserved from flies to humans, and it is the second most frequently mutated tumor suppressor found in many types of human cancers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Goberdhan and Wilson, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Salmena et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Hollander et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Song et al., 2012</xref>). PTEN antagonizes the function of the lipid kinase Phosphatidylinositide 3-kinase (PI3K); therefore, in the absence of PTEN<italic>,</italic> high levels of the lipid second messenger PIP3 result in an increased membrane recruitment and activation of the serine/threonine kinase PKB (protein kinase B, also known as Akt), which leads to enhanced cellular growth, proliferation, and survival (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Altomare and Testa, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Georgescu, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Song et al., 2012</xref>). The consequences of activating PI3K signaling due to <italic>PI3K</italic> overexpression or loss of <italic>PTEN</italic> function has been extensively studied in <italic>Drosophila</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Leevers et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Goberdhan et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Huang et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Weinkove et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Gao et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Britton et al., 2002</xref>). Cells overexpressing <italic>Dp110/PI3K</italic> are enlarged and, in the fat body, increase their nutrient storage. This stockpiling of nutrients helps them to cell-autonomously bypass the nutritional requirements for cellular growth and DNA replication during amino acid deprivation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Britton et al., 2002</xref>). In mitotic tissues, clones of <italic>PTEN</italic> mutant cells are enlarged, which is mainly caused by an increase in cell size (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Leevers et al., 1996</xref>). However, given the importance of PTEN as a tumor suppressor, the overgrowth caused by the loss of PTEN is rather mild (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Goberdhan et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Huang et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Gao et al., 2000</xref>).</p><p>Recently, it has been demonstrated that tumors lacking PTEN or with increased PI3K activity are resistant to dietary restriction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Kalaany and Sabatini, 2009</xref>). This observation underscores the importance of understanding the intrinsic changes in early tumors caused by the microenvironment. Furthermore, it remains largely unknown how a growing tumor impacts on its environment.</p><p>In this study, we attempted to mimic early events in tumor development by inducing clones of <italic>PTEN</italic> mutant cells under conditions in which nutrients become limiting. We show that cells lacking PTEN switch from hypertrophic growth to hyperplastic growth under nutrient restriction (NR). This hyperproliferation occurs at the expense of neighboring wild-type cells, probably by competition for local and systemic pools of nutrients and other growth-promoting factors.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Reduced insulin signaling is required for a proper starvation response</title><p>To assess the impact of starvation on survival, developmental timing, and weight, we reared larvae on food with varying yeast content. Yeast is the main source for micronutrients and amino acids in standard fly media. We observed a three-phase starvation response (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A,B</xref>). Our standard medium contains 100 g/l yeast. Down to 50 g/l yeast, larvae can be regarded as fully fed since the developmental time, weight, and survival were not affected. At a yeast concentration range between 50 g/l and 10 g/l, the development was gradually delayed and the weight decreased. This phase can be regarded as mild starvation, since survival was not compromised down to 25 g/l yeast concentration. Reduction of the yeast concentration to and below 10 g/l increased the developmental time from first instar to pupa and severely decreased body weight. Since mortality was also increased, this phase is regarded as severe starvation. Based on these results, the turning point between mild starvation and severe starvation is approximately at 10 g/l concentration of yeast.<fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.00380.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Response to yeast starvation in wild-type and insulin signaling defective <italic>Drosophila</italic>.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold> and <bold>B</bold>) Control flies reared on standard culture medium with varying yeast concentrations.

This is consistent with the findings that larvae with randomly induced PI3K overexpression clones are starvation sensitive (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Britton et al., 2002</xref>).

To mimic the clonal nature of cancer, we analyzed the loss of <italic>PTEN</italic> function in clones generated in mitotic tissues (imaginal discs) by hsFlp/FRT-mediated mitotic recombination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Golic and Lindquist, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Xu and Rubin, 1993</xref>). This system enables the generation of single genetically marked epithelial cells mutant for a defined tumor suppressor. Subsequent mitoses give rise to a patch of cells (‘clone’) devoid of the tumor suppressor. The clones can be tracked throughout development due to genetically encoded markers (usually GFP). In a typical experiment, we induced clones by a heat shock 24 hr after egg laying. Subsequently, the larvae were split into two populations and transferred to vials with yeast concentrations of 100 g/l and 10 g/l, respectively.

As previously published, <italic>PTEN</italic> clones were enlarged in fed larvae but they did not severely impact on the structure of the imaginal discs and of the adult eyes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Goberdhan et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Gao et al., 2000</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). Under mild starvation conditions (30 g/l yeast), <italic>PTEN</italic> clones were further increased in size, resulting in an overall increase in disc size as compared to discs harboring control clones. Reducing the yeast concentration to 20 g/l and below led to a massive size increase of the <italic>PTEN</italic> clones and to a concomitant reduction of the surrounding tissue. Furthermore, the <italic>PTEN</italic> clones had fused and rendered the discs lobed in appearance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>). At 5 g/l yeast concentration, the eye discs with <italic>PTEN</italic> mutant tissue were severely overgrown with polyp-like structures protruding from the discs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>). The resulting adult eyes displayed strong malformations and outgrowths, indicating a loss of epithelial integrity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>, red squares). In some cases, no clones could be recovered in the adult eyes, probably due to a collapse of the <italic>PTEN</italic> clones resulting in melanized scars (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3</xref>, white arrow). Tangential eye sections did not reveal any structural defects in ommatidial arrangement (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s4">Figure 2—figure supplement 4</xref>). <italic>PTEN</italic> mutant cells overgrow in a cell-autonomous manner as the enlarged ommatidia were exclusively composed of mutant cells. The overgrowth phenotype of <italic>PTEN</italic> clones is not specific to the eye; it was also observed in other imaginal tissues like the wing disc (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s5">Figure 2—figure supplement 5</xref>).</p><p>Since starvation causes a developmental delay, the overgrowth of <italic>PTEN</italic> clones could be a consequence of the prolonged growth period. We therefore analyzed the <italic>PTEN</italic> clones at earlier time points (36 hr, 48 hr, and 60 hr after induction; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). Already 36 hr after clone induction, the <italic>PTEN</italic> clones were increased in size, and the overgrowth of <italic>PTEN</italic> clones and the reduction in wild-type tissue were fully apparent after 60 hr (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>), excluding the developmental delay as a main cause of the overgrowth.</p><p>To investigate whether the early stages of starvation are crucial for the <italic>PTEN</italic> clones to overgrow, we performed ‘food switch’ experiments by transferring larvae with <italic>PTEN</italic> clones from starvation (10 g/l) to normal (100 g/l) food and vice versa at given time points. We used the eyeless-(ey)Flp/FRT system to induce clones specifically in the eye imaginal tissues early during larval development. When the transfer from starvation to normal food occurred within the first 72 hr, the overgrowth of the <italic>PTEN</italic> clones was efficiently rescued. Later shifts were no longer effective in suppressing the overgrowth. Consistently, it was sufficient to transfer larvae within the first 48 hr from normal to starvation food to produce the overgrowth phenotype. After this time point, <italic>PTEN</italic> clones did not acquire the full growth advantage over the surrounding tissue, confirming the importance of the initial stages for <italic>PTEN</italic> clones to develop the overgrowth phenotype (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s6">Figure 2—figure supplement 6</xref>).</p><p>We quantified the <italic>PTEN</italic> induced overgrowth by measuring the eye size of eyFlp/FRT-induced <italic>PTEN</italic> clones (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D,D′</xref>). Similar to the hsFlp/FRT-induced clones, the eyFlp/FRT-induced <italic>PTEN</italic> clones and the entire eyes were slightly enlarged in flies raised on normal food. Under starvation conditions, the mutant tissue occupied most of the adult eye and the wild-type tissue was severely reduced. This overrepresentation of the mutant tissue resulted in an absolute increase of eye size under starvation as compared to normal food conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D,D′</xref>).</p><p>To investigate the effects of reduced nutrition on ommatidia size and number, we generated eyes almost completely composed of <italic>PTEN</italic> mutant tissue by means of the eyFlp/FRT cell lethal system and analyzed them by scanning electron microscopy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E–E′′</xref>). Under normal food conditions, the eye size increase was mainly caused by larger ommatidia (+27%), and to a minor extent by more ommatidia (+14%). Under 10 g/l yeast food, the ommatidial size was roughly proportionally reduced in wild-type and <italic>PTEN</italic> mutant eyes. Intriguingly, whereas the ommatidia number was decreased by 6% in wild-type eyes, it was massively increased in <italic>PTEN</italic> mutant eyes (+44%). Since the composition of the <italic>PTEN</italic> mutant ommatidia remained unchanged, the size and number of ommatidia reflects cell size and cell number. Thus, the <italic>PTEN</italic> mutant tissue displays a switch from hypertrophy to hyperplasia.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>The growth advantage of <italic>PTEN</italic> mutant cells is not due to cell competition</title><p>Cell competition, a process that results in the elimination of suboptimal cells from a growing tissue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Morata and Ripoll, 1975</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Simpson, 1979</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Simpson and Morata, 1981</xref>), could contribute to the overgrowth of <italic>PTEN</italic> clones. ‘Winner’ cells actively eliminate ‘loser’ cells by inducing apoptosis and thereby take over the tissue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Moreno et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Moreno and Basler, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">de la Cova et al., 2004</xref>).

Consistent with the above results and the apoptosis pattern, <italic>PTEN</italic> clones overgrew even more in the dorsal compartment, and the surrounding tissue still got strongly reduced. Thus, the cells neighboring <italic>PTEN</italic> clones are not eliminated by apoptosis.</p><p>We also tested for the requirement of JNK signaling in the tissue neighboring the <italic>PTEN</italic> clones. hsFlp/FRT clones of <italic>bsk<sup>1</sup></italic> over a chromosome carrying a GFP marker and a <italic>PTEN</italic> mutation were induced. In this way, mitotic recombination events generate two adjacent twin spots mutant for <italic>bsk<sup>1</sup></italic> and <italic>PTEN,</italic> respectively. If <italic>PTEN</italic> cells attained the growth advantage by inducing JNK-mediated cell death in the twin spot, the overgrowth would be suppressed and the twin spot should grow larger.

In the corresponding adult eyes, we often observed scars that were probably left behind by the collapsing clones (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3</xref>). Those eyes contained more wild-type cells, indicating that the lost <italic>PTEN</italic> mutant tissue was compensated for. Thus, <italic>PTEN</italic> mutant cells are running at the edge of survival under limited nutrient conditions.

These results were further confirmed by a Western blot analysis comparing discs exclusively composed of <italic>PTEN</italic> mutant tissue with discs bearing wild-type clones under normal food conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2</xref>). Due to the extremely small size of the wild-type discs under NR, we were not able to generate enough tissue for the analysis. Although the total levels of PKB were decreased in <italic>PTEN</italic> mutant tissue under both conditions as compared to the control under normal food conditions, the P-PKB levels were elevated. Thus, high PIP3 levels result in robust PKB activation under standard and starvation conditions. Consistently, reducing or removing <italic>PKB</italic> function by using a PH-domain mutant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Stocker et al., 2002</xref>) and a kinase-dead PKB (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Staveley et al., 1998</xref>), respectively, completely suppressed the <italic>PTEN</italic> overgrowth under normal as well as under starvation conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>).</p><p>The transcription factor FoxO is an important target of PKB. Upon high PI3K signaling activity, FoxO is phosphorylated by PKB and sequestered in the cytoplasm, and FoxO-mediated transcription of growth-suppressing genes is thus inhibited (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Brunet et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Kops et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Burgering and Kops, 2002</xref>). FoxO was localized in the cytoplasm in <italic>PTEN</italic> mutant tissue under both conditions, whereas starvation induced the shuttling of FoxO into nuclei in the control tissue (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>). It has been shown that overexpression of <italic>FoxO</italic> decreases eye size, which is exacerbated under starvation conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Junger et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Kramer et al., 2003</xref>).

High TORC1 activity boosts cellular growth, at least in part via the phosphorylation of S6K and 4E-BP (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hietakangas and Cohen, 2009</xref>). <italic>PTEN</italic> mutant cells did respond to starvation by reducing the levels of S6K and of phosphorylated S6K (P-S6K), as revealed by Western blot analysis on discs bearing eyFlp/FRT cell lethal clones of <italic>PTEN</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2</xref>). PKB signaling activity was also slightly reduced as compared to standard conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2</xref>). We next inhibited TORC1 activity selectively in <italic>PTEN</italic> clones by co-overexpression of Tuberous Sclerosis Complex-1 and -2 (Tsc1/2)—which together form a complex with GTPase activating protein (GAP) activity towards the small GTPase Rheb, an essential activator of TORC1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Garami et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Zhang et al., 2003</xref>)—or by removing <italic>Rheb</italic> function. Reducing TORC1 activity suppressed the overgrowth of the <italic>PTEN</italic> mutant tissue (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F,G, 4G′</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s5">Figure 4—figure supplement 5</xref>). P-PKB levels, however, were increased in the mutant tissue under both fed and NR conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s6">Figure 4—figure supplement 6</xref>), which is in agreement with the negative feedback regulation of TORC1 on the activation of PKB (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Radimerski et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kockel et al., 2010</xref>). Eyes mutant for <italic>PTEN</italic> and a hypomorphic allele of <italic>TOR</italic> were reduced to the size of control eyes at both fed and starved conditions, indicating that the overgrowth of <italic>PTEN</italic> clones strictly depends on normal TORC1 function (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s7">Figure 4—figure supplement 7</xref>). Interestingly, whereas the size reduction of <italic>PTEN</italic> clones caused by impaired TORC1 function was primarily due to smaller ommatidia under normal conditions, ommatidia size was only slightly affected under starvation. By contrast, the hyperproliferation observed in <italic>PTEN</italic> clones under NR was almost completely abolished (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s7">Figure 4—figure supplement 7</xref>). Thus, TORC1 is indispensable for the switch to hyperproliferation observed in <italic>PTEN</italic> mutant tissue upon NR.</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>Knockdown of the amino acid transporter Slimfast suppresses the overgrowth of <italic>PTEN</italic> mutant cells</title><p>The cationic amino acid transporter Slimfast (Slif) has been shown to activate TOR signaling in the fat body, and it appears to be an important component of a systemic nutrient sensor mechanism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Colombani et al., 2003</xref>). Slif function is also required in mitotic tissues, as clones in which <italic>Slif</italic> has been knocked down (<italic>Slif</italic><sup><italic>anti</italic></sup>) are reduced in size, possibly due to reduced TORC1 activation. Since TORC1 is required for the overgrowth of <italic>PTEN</italic> clones, knocking down <italic>Slif</italic> should suppress this phenotype in a similar way as observed for <italic>Tsc1/2</italic> overexpression. Whereas expressing <italic>Slif</italic><sup><italic>anti</italic></sup> in <italic>PTEN</italic> clones resulted in a slight reduction of the mutant tissue under normal conditions, it caused a nearly complete elimination of the <italic>PTEN</italic> mutant tissue under starvation conditions, while not affecting the control clones (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>). The loss of <italic>PTEN</italic> mutant tissue was accompanied by a massive increase in apoptosis, and GFP-positive (and thus <italic>PTEN</italic> mutant) cellular remnants were scattered throughout the disc (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>), suggesting that <italic>PTEN</italic> clones collapsed after an initial overgrowth. Indeed, early overgrowth of <italic>PTEN</italic> clones and high P-PKB signals were observed under starvation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref> upper panel).

To this end, we simultaneously generated <italic>PTEN</italic> clones and clones of <italic>Tsc1</italic> mutant cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1</xref>). Interestingly, the mutant clones did not have additive effects on overgrowth. The introduction of <italic>Tsc1</italic> clones into the neighborhood of <italic>PTEN</italic> clones rather reduced their overgrowth under starvation. The discs were completely composed of either <italic>Tsc1</italic> or <italic>PTEN</italic> mutant tissue, as the clones did not heavily overlap. Thus, when neighboring with a tissue that also has a growth advantage, <italic>PTEN</italic> clones themselves experience competition for common resources.</p><p>To investigate whether the overgrowth of <italic>PTEN</italic> clones is enabled by a non-autonomous influence from the starved neighboring tissue, we genetically starved the surrounding tissue of <italic>PTEN</italic> clones by reducing TORC1 activity. We induced eyFlp/FRT clones of <italic>PTEN</italic> with sister clones mutant for <italic>TOR</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s2 fig7s3">Figure 7—figure supplements 2 and 3</xref>)<italic>.</italic> The resulting eyes were completely composed of <italic>PTEN</italic> mutant tissue already under standard conditions. However, the eyes were smaller as compared to eyes bearing <italic>PTEN</italic> clones only.</p><p>We also observed that clones of <italic>TOR</italic> mutant cells generated in otherwise wild-type eyes were massively underrepresented. The adult eyes were almost completely composed of wild-type twin clone tissue (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>), suggesting that not only <italic>PTEN</italic> mutant cells with a high growth potential but also wild-type cells neighboring with cells impaired in TORC1 function attain a growth advantage and proliferate in place of the slower growing cells. Similar observations were made with mutations impinging on IIS activity (e.g., <italic>PKB</italic>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s4">Figure 7—figure supplement 4</xref>). Thus, relative differences in IIS activity cause a differential growth behavior.</p><p>We next tested how the combination of genetically starved neighboring cells (mutant for <italic>TOR</italic>) with real starvation during development impacts on the growth behavior of <italic>PTEN</italic> clones. Interestingly, when in competition with <italic>TOR</italic> mutant cells, <italic>PTEN</italic> clones did overgrow under NR as opposed to normal conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s2">Figure 7—figure supplement 2</xref>). The overgrowth was even more pronounced than without <italic>TOR</italic> mutant neighbors, and it was apparent already early during larval development (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s3">Figure 7—figure supplement 3</xref>). SEM analysis revealed that the additional overgrowth was primarily caused by more cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s5">Figure 7—figure supplement 5</xref>).</p><p>Finally, we wondered whether systemically dampening IIS would allow the overgrowth of <italic>PTEN</italic> clones under normal conditions. We ubiquitously expressed <italic>Imp-L2</italic>, which encodes a secreted antagonist of Dilp-2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Honegger et al., 2008</xref>). In this context, <italic>PTEN</italic> clones did overgrow, irrespective of whether they were neighboring with <italic>TOR</italic> mutant cells or wild-type cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>). The overgrowth of the <italic>PTEN</italic> clones caused a further reduction in body size, as evidenced by decreased shoulder width (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>). Cells devoid of <italic>PTEN</italic> also reacted to the decrease in IIS activity (by slightly reducing cell size) but the massive increase in cell number caused the total overgrowth (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s6">Figure 7—figure supplement 6</xref>). Thus, systemically decreasing IIS enhances the proliferative potential of <italic>PTEN</italic> mutant cells.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Tumors with high PI3K pathway activity are associated with increased resistance to starvation. Here, we describe how the loss of the tumor suppressor PTEN contributes to early clonal expansion. <italic>PTEN</italic> mutant cells tolerate and survive starvation in a clonal situation in <italic>Drosophila</italic> imaginal discs. This response is completely dependent on high PKB and sustained TORC1 activities within the <italic>PTEN</italic> clones. <italic>PTEN</italic> mutant cells also acquire a growth advantage under starvation conditions at the expense of wild-type cells in the immediate neighborhood and in the entire organism.</p><p>It has previously been demonstrated that activation of PI3K (or of TORC1) results in starvation insensitivity in endoreplicative tissues (ERTs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Britton et al., 2002</xref>). The role of activated PI3K in starvation resistance of <italic>Drosophila</italic> epithelia is also not unprecedented. Anaplastic Lymphoma Kinase (ALK)-dependent activation of PI3K is necessary for bypassing the amino acid requirement in growing neuroblasts (neural progenitors) under NR conditions (brain sparing) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cheng et al., 2011</xref>). However, imaginal tissues are not spared upon starvation, arguing against an important function of ALK in mediating growth of imaginal discs under NR conditions.</p><p>Mitotically active imaginal disc cells with high PIP3 levels respond differently to starvation as compared to corresponding cells in the ERTs. <italic>PTEN</italic> mutant imaginal disc cells do react to starvation by reducing their size like control cells do. The cell size reduction is proportional: <italic>PTEN</italic> mutant cells are still enlarged with respect to control cells under starvation. However, the cell size reduction is compensated for by a massive increase in proliferation, causing a net increase in mutant tissue. In fact, the <italic>PTEN</italic> mutant tissue is absolutely enlarged under starvation conditions.</p><p><italic>PTEN</italic> mutant cells therefore gain a growth advantage and can take over a complete organ when the surrounding tissue is starved. This advantage is neither due to a prolonged growth period (<italic>PTEN</italic> clones are increased in size early after clone induction) nor to a complete insensitivity to starvation. It rather reflects a change in their mode to respond to a limited access to nutrients: <italic>PTEN</italic> mutant cells switch from hypertrophic to hyperplastic growth under starvation. This tolerance towards increased proliferation could favor the selection for secondary mutations that enhance proliferation and thus tumor progression.</p><p>To our surprise, <italic>PTEN</italic> clones display increased levels of apoptosis, and selective inhibition of apoptosis within the clones results in tremendous hyperplastic overgrowth. The induction of apoptosis in <italic>PTEN</italic> mutant tissue contrasts the known pro-survival function of PKB (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Scanga et al., 2000</xref>). However, it indicates that the starved <italic>PTEN</italic> mutant cells, despite their proliferative advantage, exist on the edge of survival and are highly susceptible to apoptosis. Our findings also suggest that acquisition of factors preventing apoptosis would strongly enhance the growth of tumors lacking PTEN.</p><p>How can <italic>PTEN</italic> mutant cells grow at the expense of the non-mutant tissue? Comparing the P-PKB levels in the heterozygous and wild-type tissue revealed a reduction in the tissue surrounding <italic>PTEN</italic> clones as compared to tissue adjacent to control clones. Furthermore, cells neighboring with <italic>PTEN</italic> mutant tissue are smaller than those in the discs containing control clones. Thus, <italic>PTEN</italic> clones impact on IIS activity in the surrounding tissue, thereby reducing its growth potential. This appears to be sufficient to explain the strong reduction of the surrounding tissue, since the process of ousting the neighboring tissue is completed as early as 60 hr after clonal induction, when the disc still contains relatively few cells. This non-autonomous growth reduction is not restricted to the local neighbors in a cell–cell contact-dependent manner, but rather affects all tissues of the organism.</p><p>The impact of <italic>PTEN</italic> mutant tissue on its surroundings suggests that the cells compete for common factors, most likely growth factors and nutrients. Under starvation, the circulating levels of growth factors and nutrients are strongly reduced, and thereby can become limiting (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cheng et al., 2011</xref>). <italic>Drosophila</italic> insulin-like peptides (DILPs) produced by the insulin-producing cells (IPCs) in the brain stimulate the growth of imaginal disc cells via the InR. Starvation reduces the secretion of DILPs from the IPCs, and thus reduces growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Geminard et al., 2009</xref>). Removing <italic>InR</italic> function in <italic>PTEN</italic> clones only mildly affects the overgrowth. Thus, despite lacking the signal input via InR, these cells are able to accumulate PIP3, probably because of the basal activity of PI3K. Therefore, low levels of circulating DILPs are sufficient to boost PIP3 levels and PKB activity in <italic>PTEN</italic> mutant cells under starvation.</p><p>The cationic amino acid transporter Slimfast (Slif) has been described as an upstream activator of TORC1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Colombani et al., 2003</xref>). We show that, in contrast to inhibiting TORC1 activity, reducing Slif does not block the initial overgrowth of <italic>PTEN</italic> clones under starvation. However, it causes the overgrown clones to collapse. We speculate that the high metabolic demands of <italic>PTEN</italic> mutant cells require an efficient amino acid uptake, which is blocked by reducing Slif. Thus, <italic>PTEN</italic> mutant cells rely on their ability to efficiently compete for nutrients and growth factors under starvation conditions with their direct neighbors and the peripheral tissue. Since the reduction of Slif affects the growth of the wild-type and the <italic>PTEN</italic> mutant tissue in a differential manner, this amino acid transporter could represent a target for a dosage-dependent drug therapy of tumors with PI3K activation.</p><p>Our results suggest the following sequence of events when a single cell embedded in a mitotic tissue loses the tumor suppressor PTEN (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>). The loss of <italic>PTEN</italic> function triggers high PIP3 levels, thereby activating PKB and TORC1, thus stimulating cell growth and division. Under starvation conditions, circulating growth factors and nutrients are scarce. In response to these limited resources, both wild-type and <italic>PTEN</italic> mutant cells adjust their growth with respect to cellular size. In sharp contrast to wild-type clones, <italic>PTEN</italic> clones retain high PI3K activity and strongly increase their cell number. This hyperplastic clonal overgrowth depends on withdrawing nutrients from the neighborhood and ultimately the entire organism. The active scavenging of resources is dependent on efficient amino acid transporters (Slif), which also ensure that TORC1 remains active. During their entire growth, cells are at the brink of death as evidenced by the high apoptosis rate within the <italic>PTEN</italic> clones. Thus, enhanced PIP3 levels in cells that lost the tumor suppressor PTEN not only leads to starvation resistance at the cellular level, but also suppresses growth in their direct tissue neighborhood and in peripheral tissues by competing for nutrients and growth factors. Our findings demonstrate how limiting nutrient conditions enhance the proliferative potential of <italic>PTEN</italic> mutant cells, independent of additional genetic alterations.<fig id="fig8" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.00380.041</object-id><label>Figure 8.</label><caption><title>Model of hyperplastic overgrowth of <italic>PTEN</italic> mutant tissue under starvation.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Under standard conditions (normal food), the <italic>PTEN</italic> mutant tissue overgrows in a hypertrophic manner.

Indeed, we considered measuring DILP levels. However, as DILP-2, the most potent growth- promoting DILP, is retained in the mNSCs upon starvation, it would be difficult to determine increased retention by immunostaining. For a reliable mass-spectrometric quantification, the amount of tissue obtained from our experimental setup is limiting.</p><p>As our genetic experiments pointed to an important role of amino acids, we measured amino acid concentrations in the hemolymph of larvae bearing eye- specific <italic>PTEN</italic> clones and of control larvae by gas chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry (GC-MS). However, the results we obtained are rather complex. It has been reported that the concentrations of alanine, isoleucine, leucine, and valine decrease upon acute starvation (Anaplastic lymphoma kinase spares organ during nutrient restriction in <italic>Drosophila,</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cheng et al., 2011</xref>). In our experiment, only two of them, isoleucine and valine, exhibited the same tendency, whereas the concentration of alanine, the most abundant amino acid, even increased upon starvation. Leucine levels were not considerably affected. The results of a representative experiment are shown below in Author response image 1. The discrepancies may be a consequence of the differences in the experimental setups. In our experiment, we subjected the larvae to chronic starvation instead of acute starvation. We checked the changes at the end of a long-term process, which may no longer reflect the situation at the beginning of the starvation. It is also conceivable that changes in amino acid concentrations occur rather locally and not in the systemic pool in the hemolymph.<fig id="fig9" position="float"><label>Author response image 1.</label><caption><title>Concentrations of amino acids in the hemolymph of larvae bearing <italic>PTEN</italic> clones and control larvae under normal and starvation conditions.</title></caption><graphic xlink:href="elife-00380-resp-fig1-v1.tif"/></fig></p><p>We also assessed the starvation response in the fat body, a central organ in nutrient sensing. We performed a gene expression analyses for <italic>InR</italic> and <italic>4EBP-1,</italic> two genes known to be transcriptionally upregulated upon starvation. This experiment is expected to be more sensitive with respect to systemic changes than the measurement of DILPs in the mNSCs by immunostaining. We dissected fat bodies of the tightly staged larvae (egg laying for 5 hours) with <italic>PTEN</italic> mutant and control eye discs early in the third instar (72 h under standard conditions and 120 h under starvation conditions) to avoid any changes in gene expression associated with the metamorphosis processes taking place in the fat body. mRNA levels in fat bodies were determined by qRT-PCR. The levels of <italic>InR</italic> and <italic>4EBP-1</italic> mRNAs were consistently upregulated upon starvation. However, we did not detect any differences between the larvae bearing <italic>PTEN</italic> clones and the control larvae (Author response image 2). Again, changes in gene expression may have been alleviated by adaptation mechanisms occurring during chronic starvation. It is also possible that key events triggering the overgrowth of <italic>PTEN</italic> mutant tissue take place at the onset of starvation.<fig id="fig10" position="float"><label>Author response image 2.</label><caption><title>Expression levels of the starvation-induced genes <italic>InR</italic> and <italic>4EBP-1</italic> in the fat body of control larvae and larvae bearing <italic>PTEN</italic> clones (see text for explanations).</title></caption><graphic xlink:href="elife-00380-resp-fig2-v1.tif"/></fig></p><p>As the quantifications of amino acid levels and of starvation-responsive genes did not yield conclusive results, we resorted to a genetic experiment to support our notion that the growth properties of <italic>PTEN</italic> mutant tissue influence the growth of the surrounding and peripheral tissues, and vice versa. We attempted to genetically starve the larvae in order to mimic the starvation response in the animals. To this end, we systemically dampened IIS by ubiquitously expressing Imp-L2, a secreted antagonist of Dilp2 (by means of <italic>arm-Gal4).</italic> In this context, <italic>PTEN</italic> mutant clones did overgrow more, which was accompanied by a further reduction in body size. Thus, <italic>PTEN</italic> mutant cells compete with the surrounding normal cells for pools of systemic growth factors, and a systemic reduction in IIS enhances the overgrowth of <italic>PTEN</italic> mutant tissue. Closer analysis of the overgrown eyes by SEM revealed that cells devoid of PTEN reacted to systemically decreased IIS by slightly reducing their size, but a massive increase in cell number caused the net overgrowth. Thus, systemically decreasing IIS enhances the proliferative potential of <italic>PTEN</italic> mutant cells. These data are shown in the new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref> and the accompanying <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s6">Figure 7—figure supplement 6</xref>.</p><p><italic>2) Second, it is important to test if a boost in the levels of secreted DILPs is sufficient to rescue the growth defect of wild-type cells in animals with</italic> PTEN<italic>-null clones. In a similar vein, does an increase in Slimfast in wild-type cells ameliorate their growth defects in the context of</italic> PTEN <italic>mutant clones</italic>?</p><p>We performed both experiments suggested by the reviewers. Expression of <italic>Dilp2</italic> by means of <italic>ey-Gal4</italic> in the context of <italic>PTEN</italic> clones restored the growth of the surrounding and peripheral tissue and suppressed the <italic>PTEN</italic> overgrowth, while not affecting control eyes. These results are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>. Similar results were obtained by the expression of wild-type <italic>InR</italic> (data not shown).</p><p>An analogous experiment was performed with <italic>Slimfast.</italic> Expression of <italic>Slif</italic> (by means of <italic>ey-Gal4)</italic> slightly increased the sizes of control and <italic>PTEN</italic> mutant eyes, but this effect did not reach statistical significance (Author response image 3). Thus, the increased expression of Slif did not restore the growth of the surrounding tissue. However, as we do not know whether increasing the levels of the amino acid transporter Slif enhances its total activity, the experiment is not conclusive and we did not include it in the manuscript.<fig id="fig11" position="float"><label>Author response image 3.</label><caption><title>Overexpression of <italic>Slif</italic> does not rescue the growth of the tissue neighboring with <italic>PTEN</italic> clones.</title></caption><graphic xlink:href="elife-00380-resp-fig3-v1.tif"/></fig></p><p><italic>3) To expand the scope of the work, it is important to determine if</italic> Tsc1 <italic>mutant clones behave similarly to those with reduced PTEN function.

Cells devoid of Tsc1 are overgrowing under starvation conditions, similar to <italic>PTEN</italic> mutant cells. However, a thorough analysis revealed significant differences between <italic>PTEN</italic> and <italic>Tsc1</italic> clones. As this story is rather complex, we did not want to include it in the present manuscript.</p><p>Acknowledgement: The authors thank Manuel Hörl and Nicola Zamboni (Institute of Molecular Systems Biology, ETH Zürich) for the GC-MS analyses shown in Author response image 1.</p></body></sub-article></article>
