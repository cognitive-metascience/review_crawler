To gain insight into the mechanisms underlying evolutionary changes in pharyngeal arch development, here we investigate embryos and larvae of bichirs. Bichirs represent the earliest diverged living group of ray-finned fishes, and possess intriguing traits otherwise typical for lobe-finned fishes such as ventral paired lungs and larval external gills. In bichir embryos, we find that the anteroposterior way of formation of cranial segments is modified by the unique acceleration of the entire hyoid arch segment, with earlier and orchestrated development of the endodermal, mesodermal, and neural crest tissues. This major heterochronic shift in the anteroposterior developmental sequence enables early appearance of the external gills that represent key breathing organs of bichir free-living embryos and early larvae. Bichirs thus stay as unique models for understanding developmental mechanisms facilitating increased breathing capacity.</p></abstract><kwd-group

sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The vertebrate pharynx is composed of a series of repeated embryonic structures called pharyngeal arches (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Graham, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Grevellec and Tucker, 2010</xref>). In the majority of jawed vertebrates, the first, or mandibular arch contributes to the jaws; the second, or hyoid arch serves as the jaw support, and the more posterior branchial arches typically bear internal pharyngeal gills. Pharyngeal arches form in a highly stereotyped sequence from anterior to posterior, where the contacts between endodermal pouches and surface ectoderm physically separate the mesoderm- and neural crest-derived arch tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Graham and Smith, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Shone and Graham, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Choe and Crump, 2015</xref>). The progressive development of the pharynx has deep deuterostome origins, as it is characteristic of both cephalochordates and hemichordates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Willey, 1891</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Gillis et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Koop et al., 2014</xref>). In vertebrates, sequential formation of pharyngeal segments represents a fundamental aspect of the metameric organization of the head and face (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Piotrowski and Nüsslein-Volhard, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Couly et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Choe and Crump, 2015</xref>). Any modifications of this well-established anteroposterior differentiation scheme would represent a radical alteration in development of the stereotypic chordate bauplan (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Square et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>Polypterid bichirs represent the earliest diverged living group of ray-finned (Actinopterygian) fishes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hughes et al., 2018</xref>) and they are often referred to as the most relevant species for studying character states at the dichotomy of ray- and lobe-finned fishes (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Standen et al., 2014</xref>). This places bichirs in a unique phylogenetic position among vertebrates, which can be exploited for evolutionary and developmental comparative studies (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Takeuchi et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Standen et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Minarik et al., 2017</xref>). Adult bichirs possess several intriguing characteristics that have been associated with air-breathing during the transition from water to land, such as ventral paired lungs or spiracular openings on the head (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Clack, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Coates and Clack, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Graham et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Tatsumi et al., 2016</xref>). Moreover, bichirs also share several key larval features with lungfishes or amphibians, such as cranial adhesive organs, and larval external gills (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kerr, 1907</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Diedhiou and Bartsch, 2009</xref>).</p><p>The external gills of bichirs represent prominent adaptive structures, and constitute major breathing organs of their free-living embryos and early larvae (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kerr, 1907</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Diedhiou and Bartsch, 2009</xref>). Strikingly, while external gills of amphibians and lungfishes derive from branchial arches as a rule (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Duellman and Trueb, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Witzmann, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Nokhbatolfoghahai and Downie, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Schoch and Witzmann, 2011</xref>), those of bichirs have historically been considered as unique hyoid arch derivatives due to their blood supply from the hyoid aortic arch (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kerr, 1907</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Goodrich, 1909</xref>). Importantly, the external gills of bichir embryos represent the first cranial structures to appear, emerging before the eyes or mouth are evident (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Minarik et al., 2017</xref>).</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.43531.002</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>External gills of the Senegal bichir derive from the accelerated epidermal outgrowth of the hyoid segmental origin.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Budgett’s illustration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kerr, 1907</xref>) of a 3 cm long bichir larva with prominent external gills (exg).

Our results reveal that bichir external gills are definitively derived from the hyoid arch and develop by orchestrated acceleration of tissues of all germ layers of the hyoid segment. Thus, in bichir embryos, the standard anteroposterior differentiation scheme of cranial segments is modified by the unique heterochronic development of the hyoid metamere, allowing early and enhanced development of their external gills.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results|discussion"><title>Results and discussion</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>External gills of the Senegal bichir are developmentally associated with the hyoid segment</title><p>In order to examine the origin of bichir external gills, we first followed the morphological development of this structure from the earliest stages of embryogenesis onwards. The first sign of external gill development is a pair of outgrowths situated lateral to the closing neural folds (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). The hyoid origin of these outgrowths is suggested by the expression pattern of the <italic>Hoxa2</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>), a selector gene characteristic of hyoid identity in other vertebrates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Rijli et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Hunter and Prince, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Baltzinger et al., 2005</xref>). Later, at early pharyngula stages, the hyoid outgrowths produce protuberant bulges situated in the pre-otic region on each side of the embryo (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E–H</xref>), that rapidly increase in size (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1I</xref>), and finally, differentiate into many secondary branches (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1J–L</xref>). This suggests that the prominent external gills of bichir larva (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>) initially arise from striking accelerated development of the epidermal outgrowths (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>) that are of hyoid segmental origin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Accelerated and predominant hyoid neural crest stream supplies bichir external gills</title><p>To gain insights into the accelerated development of the hyoid segment, we focused on the cranial neural crest that arises from the closing neural folds. Cranial neural crest cells emerge in a characteristic pattern and split into mandibular, hyoid, and branchial streams, which in most vertebrates arise in a sequential anteroposterior order of appearance. As a marker for migrating neural crest cells, we used expression of <italic>Sox9</italic>, a transcription factor critical for their emergence, migration, and differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Cheung and Briscoe, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Mori-Akiyama et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Theveneau and Mayor, 2012</xref>). In bichir embryos, <italic>Sox9</italic> expression pattern reveals that the hyoid neural crest segment is developmentally advanced, as it forms concurrently with the mandibular neural crest segment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). Sections through the neural folds, however, demonstrate that mandibular neural crest cells still reside within the neuroepithelium (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>), while the hyoid neural crest cells have already emigrated from the neural folds (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). This premature emigration of the hyoid neural crest stream correlates with the previously observed external outgrowths of the hyoid area (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). Later in migration, the hyoid neural crest stream remains predominant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>), as it is much larger when compared to the mandibular neural crest stream (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E,F</xref>). The hyoid neural crest stream still progresses at later stages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G</xref>), and as such, the majority of the mesenchyme in the early bichir head appears to arise from this source (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2H</xref>). The Sox9 immunoreactivity further shows that cells of the leading edge of the hyoid stream delaminate from the neural folds prior to the emigration of the mandibular stream (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2I</xref>), and illustrates the voluminous (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2J</xref>) and extended (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2K</xref>) mesenchymal production of the hyoid neural crest segment.</p><fig id="fig2" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.43531.003</object-id><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Accelerated formation and heterochronic development of the hyoid neural crest cells supply mesenchyme for the bichir external gills.</title><p>(<bold>A, D, G</bold>) <italic>Sox9</italic> expression pattern in NC cells, from neurulation until early tailbud stages, dorsal views.

Whole-mount antibody staining against skeletal muscle marker 12/101 revealed that the first muscles differentiate stereotypically from the post-otic somites in the trunk region, as in other vertebrates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). However, within the cranial region of bichir embryos, the earliest developing muscles form within the hyoid arch and are associated with the external gills (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B,C</xref>).

The premature differentiation of the external gill-associated muscles is further supported by their innervation from the hyo-opercular ramus of the facial nerve, allowing voluntary movement of external gills from the earliest larval stages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E,F</xref>). Other cranial muscles fully differentiate only at later larval stages when the external gill muscle complex becomes supplemented by other muscles of hyoid and mandibular origins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3G</xref>).

These posterior outpocketings belong to the hyoid segment, as the first pharyngeal pouch (mandibulo-hyoid, or spiracular) is situated rostrally (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C,D</xref>, white arrowhead) and the second pharyngeal pouch (hyoid-branchial) more caudally (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4H</xref>, black arrowhead).

Morphogenesis of the pharyngeal pouches is critically regulated by factors from many signaling pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Graham and Smith, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Graham, 2008</xref>), among which alterations in Fibroblast growth factor (Fgf) signaling lead to defects in proper endodermal pouch development and pharyngeal segmentation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Jandzik et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abu-Issa et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Crump et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Walshe and Mason, 2003</xref>). To assess the possible role of Fgf signaling during bichir external gill development, we scored expression of the <italic>Fgf8</italic> ligand and the readouts of Fgf signaling activity. <italic>Fgf8</italic> expression is present in endodermal outpocketings and becomes confined to their lateral portions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>). These portions of endoderm in fact constitute the outgrowing tips of the prospective external gill (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4K</xref>). Expression of <italic>Dusp6</italic> and <italic>Pea3</italic> (the Fgf signaling pathway readouts) and antibody localization for activated MAPK (marker of active Fgf signaling) are present in the external gill mesenchyme adjacent to the outgrowing endodermal tips or both in the mesenchyme and the endodermal tips (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4L–N</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2</xref>). The topographical relation of endodermal outpocketings and the direction of Fgf signaling within the external gill primordium thus suggest that the endodermal epithelium signals to the adjacent mesenchyme through Fgf signaling to regulate outgrowth of the external gill (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4O</xref>).</p><p>To test the possible role of signaling events, we treated bichir embryos with SU5402, a collective Fgf and Egf signaling inhibitor, at early neurulation and scored the phenotypes at later pharyngula stages. In contrast to control embryos displaying well-developed hyoid endodermal outpocketings and external gill primordia (18/18, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4P–Q</xref>), disrupting Fgf signaling perturbs morphogenesis of the hyoid endodermal outpocketings and leads to the loss of the external gill primordia (14/15, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4R–S</xref>) possibly due to the loss of expression of downstream genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4T–U</xref>). These results support a central role of the pharyngeal endoderm in triggering early development of bichir external gills. The pharyngeal origin of the external gill primordia is surprising given that the external gills are commonly considered as outer surface structures composed of ectoderm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Takeuchi et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Diedhiou and Bartsch, 2009</xref>). However, our finding of an endodermal component in the early formation of bichir external gills reveals an unanticipated similarity with the true, internal gills of vertebrates, which typically form as pharyngeal endodermal structures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Warga and Nüsslein-Volhard, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Gillis and Tidswell, 2017</xref>). Pharyngeal morphogenesis might thus represent a central developmental component of vertebrate gill breathing organs irrespective of their actual topographic position.</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>Conclusions</title><p>The sequential formation of pharyngeal segments during embryonic development has deep deuterostome origins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Willey, 1891</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Koop et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Gillis et al., 2012</xref>) and it is well conserved among vertebrates, where all the embryonic cranial segments typically follow the sequential anteroposterior order during development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Quinlan et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Grevellec and Tucker, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Schilling, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Santagati and Rijli, 2003</xref>).

The hyoid segmental origin represents a major developmental dissimilarity and suggests an independent evolution of bichir external gills. Developmentally, bichir external gills likely correspond to opercular structures that in ray-finned fishes typically form as caudal expansions of the hyoid arch to cover the gill-bearing branchial arches, and that persist in amniotes as early embryonic opercular flaps (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Richardson et al., 2012</xref>). In bichirs, the opercular flap forms directly from the base of their external gills, and it progressively expands during early larval stages while external gills become reduced (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Diedhiou and Bartsch, 2009</xref>). Interestingly, the hyoid arch-derived external gills and opercular flaps are both engaged in breathing and gill ventilation in bichir larvae. Moreover, in adult bichirs, the hyoid domain also contributes to air-breathing by forming paired spiracular chamber with openings located on the dorsal surface of the skull (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Graham et al., 2014</xref>). Bichirs thus seem unique across recent vertebrates in enhancing breathing capacity through the development of several structures associated with the hyoid cranial segment.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s3-1"><title>Embryo collection</title><p>Fish were manipulated in accordance with the institutional guidelines for the use of embryonic material and international animal welfare guidelines (Directive 2010/63/EU).

Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by Tanya Whitfield as Reviewing Editor and Diethard Tautz as the Senior Editor. The following individuals involved in review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Andrew Gillis (Reviewer #1); Per E Ahlberg (Reviewer #2).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>This is a very interesting investigation into pharyngeal arch development in bichir. Bichir have a number of unusual features, which makes their study of interest from an evo-devo point of view, and this paper follows from an earlier study published by the group in Nature last year. Here the development of the larval external gills is followed, confirming the second arch origin of these elements with elegant DiI tracing and highlighting a heterochronic shift in pharyngeal arch development.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Reviewers 1 and 3 comment on the interpretation of the SU5402 experiments to inhibit Fgf signalling. They suggest further in situ hybridisation experiments: as a minimum, please aim to examine the expression of at least FGF8 and a transcriptional readout of Fgf signalling (e.g. <italic>pea3</italic> or <italic>dusp6</italic>). The reviewers predict that you will either see signalling interactions between pharyngeal mesoderm and endoderm (similar to what has been described in zebrafish), or some kind of signalling at the distal tip of the outgrowing gills (similar to what we see in the external gills of chondrichthyans). Either could fit with the result of your inhibition experiment. If there is no evidence of Fgf signalling, then the conclusion would need to be adjusted.</p><p>The reviewers are sympathetic of the challenges of working in systems with limited embryonic material, but hope that sufficient stocks of fixed embryos will be available to do the ISH. Thus, please attend to these revisions if at all possible. In the event that it is not possible to complete these experiments, the interpretations must be toned down as suggested.</p><p>2) Other suggested revisions do not involve further experimental work, but concern interpretations or conclusions drawn from the data. Please address these points or provide reasons for rebuttal.</p><p>The full reviews are appended below for your information.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic> </p><p>This manuscript reports on a very interesting study. The external gills of bichirs have long been viewed as an oddball structure in the field of vertebrate comparative anatomy, and little is known about their development (owing to the difficulty of obtaining and working with bichir embryos). These authors have produced some really nice work that blends anatomy and development in the bichir, <italic>Polypterus senegalus</italic>, and for this I commend them. The figures are very nice and clear, and support the authors' observations. The authors demonstrate convincingly that the external gills of bichir are of hyoid arch origin (as opposed to the post-hyoid gill arch origin of external gills in other vertebrate lineages), and they show that the hyoid arch of bichir exhibits a heterochronic acceleration of development (with relatively early/enhanced NC, mesodermal and pharyngeal endodermal contributions).</p><p>One section that might need a bit of revision is the text describing the final experiment with SU5402. It has been well established that loss of Fgf signalling results in failed endodermal pouch formation in zebrafish. We now know from work in Gage Crump's lab (e.g. Choe and Crump, 2015) that <italic>Fgf8</italic> functions in conjunction with <italic>Wnt11r</italic> as a guidance cue to direct pharyngeal endodermal pouch morphogenesis. The dynamics of this signalling are well known, with an origin of the <italic>Fgf8</italic> signalling from pharyngeal mesoderm, and a response in the pharyngeal endoderm. At the same time, there are many examples of Fgf signalling-dependence of lateral outgrowth (fins, limbs, gill filaments, gill arch appendages, etc). Here, the authors show that bichir embryos exposed to the pan-FGFR inhibitor SU5402 fail to form external gills, and conclude from this observation that pharyngeal endoderm &quot;triggers&quot; the early development of bichirs external gills. However, in the absence of gene expression data showing direction of signalling (e.g. which tissue expresses a gene encoding an Fgf ligand, and which tissue expresses a transcriptional readout of Fgf signalling), it is difficult to identify particular tissues as &quot;drivers&quot; of an Fgf-dependent developmental process. Is the failure of external gill initiation due to a failure of mesodermal-endodermal signalling (equivalent to the signalling that drives zebrafish pharyngeal pouch formation)? Or could it be because of a failure of some other source of Fgf signalling which contributes to the proximo-distal expansion of the external gills?</p><p>If it is not possible to carry out additional ISH experiments because of unavailability of embryonic material, then perhaps the authors could adjust their interpretations slightly, to be a bit more conservative – i.e. these experiments point to a likely Fgf-dependence of external gill formation, which could have a basis in X, Y or Z.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic> </p><p>This is an interesting manuscript that deserves publication. I have no concerns regarding the experiments or the conclusions that the authors draw from them. There are however a couple of points that I would like to discuss in relation to the Introduction and Discussion.</p><p>Introduction:</p><p>The authors claim that polypterids &quot;originated soon after the key divergence of ray- and lobe-finned fishes&quot; and cite Giles et al., 2017 in support of this statement. However, the conclusions of Giles et al., 2017 do not actually support that claim: quite the contrary. It used to be thought that polypterids were a really deep branch among the actinopterygii, with only a few fossil forms like Cheirolepis falling below them in the actinopt stem group. Giles et al. showed that polypterids derive from a Mesozoic actinopt group called scanilepids, and that this places them much higher up in the tree. They are still the deepest living branch, but they fall only just below the sturgeons and paddlefishes, and a whole slew of Devonian actinopterygians such as Moythomasia and its relatives (essentially what we used to call 'palaeoniscids') are now relegated to the actinopterygian stem. Giles et al., 2017 estimate the age of the split between polypterids and other living actinopts to somewhere around the end of the Devonian – say 360 million years. But the actinopt-sarcopt split almost certainly occurred during the late Silurian, no later than 420 million years at the earliest. So the polypterid lineage originated at least 60 million years after the actinopt-sarcopt divergence, which isn't what I would call &quot;soon&quot;. Of course it is still true that they are topologically the closest living branch to the divergence on the actinopt side, just as the coelacanths are the closest branch on the sarcopt side.</p><p>Conclusion:</p><p>I am dubious about the argument regarding spiracle size and the specific relevance of polypterids for understanding the developmental basis of increased air-breathing capacity. It is true that polypterids have nice big spiracles that they use for breathing air, but the authors offer no evidence that this is in any way linked with their precocious hyoid arch development. And they are not unique: large spiracles are also seen in rays, where they are used for inhaling water. Furthermore, while the spiracles appear to have been large in early tetrapods and elpistostegids (see Brazeau and Ahlberg, 2006), this is not linked to a large spiracular arch; the hyomandibula in particular actually becomes progressively smaller across the fish-tetrapod transition. So if the final claim of the manuscript, that &quot;bichirs might serve as models to understand the developmental basis of increased air-breathing capacity during the fish-tetrapod transition from water to land&quot;, specifically references the accelerated hyoid development of <italic>Polypterus</italic>, then I have to disagree. I see no particular reason to believe that the large spiracles of elpistostegids and early tetrapods were produced by accelerated hyoid arch development; indeed, given the conservation of the 'normal' front-to-back sequence of pharyngeal arch development in both tetrapods and non-polypterid fishes, there is good reason to believe that they were not.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic> </p><p>That the second arch develops before the first, throws out the usual anterior posterior pattern of differentiation observed in other vertebrates.

The reviewers predict that you will either see signalling interactions between pharyngeal mesoderm and endoderm (similar to what has been described in zebrafish), or some kind of signalling at the distal tip of the outgrowing gills (similar to what we see in the external gills of chondrichthyans).

It has been well established that loss of Fgf signalling results in failed endodermal pouch formation in zebrafish. We now know from work in Gage Crump's lab (e.g. Choe and Crump, 2015) that Fgf8 functions in conjunction with Wnt11r as a guidance cue to direct pharyngeal endodermal pouch morphogenesis. The dynamics of this signalling are well known, with an origin of the Fgf8 signalling from pharyngeal mesoderm, and a response in the pharyngeal endoderm. At the same time, there are many examples of Fgf signalling-dependence of lateral outgrowth (fins, limbs, gill filaments, gill arch appendages, etc). Here, the authors show that bichir embryos exposed to the pan-FGFR inhibitor SU5402 fail to form external gills, and conclude from this observation that pharyngeal endoderm &quot;triggers&quot; the early development of bichirs external gills. However, in the absence of gene expression data showing direction of signalling (e.g. which tissue expresses a gene encoding an Fgf ligand, and which tissue expresses a transcriptional readout of Fgf signalling), it is difficult to identify particular tissues as &quot;drivers&quot; of an Fgf-dependent developmental process. Is the failure of external gill initiation due to a failure of mesodermal-endodermal signalling (equivalent to the signalling that drives zebrafish pharyngeal pouch formation)? Or could it be because of a failure of some other source of Fgf signalling which contributes to the proximo-distal expansion of the external gills?</p><p>If it is not possible to carry out additional ISH experiments because of unavailability of embryonic material, then perhaps the authors could adjust their interpretations slightly, to be a bit more conservative – i.e. these experiments point to a likely Fgf-dependence of external gill formation, which could have a basis in X, Y or Z.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you very much for this vital comment. For this revised submission, we performed additional whole-mount and section analyses of <italic>Fgf8</italic> expression patterns at consecutive bichir stages 23-27 (Figure 4—figure supplement 1), and also tested the presence of transcripts of Fgf pathway readouts <italic>Pea3</italic> and <italic>Dusp6</italic> (Figure 4—figure supplement 2). Interestingly, we found the presence of <italic>Fgf8</italic> transcripts solely in the pharyngeal endoderm, with no signs of mesodermal <italic>Fgf8</italic> expression, in contrast to the zebrafish data of Choe and Crump (2015). Importantly, readouts of the Fgf pathway <italic>Pea3</italic> and <italic>Dusp6</italic> were found in the adjacent mesenchyme, or in a colocalization with <italic>Fgf8</italic> expression pattern in the endoderm. Based on these expression patterns, we infer the direction of Fgf signaling from the hyoid pouch endoderm to the underlying external gill mesenchyme.

I have no concerns regarding the experiments or the conclusions that the authors draw from them. There are however a couple of points that I would like to discuss in relation to the Introduction and Discussion.</p><p>Introduction:</p><p>The authors claim that polypterids &quot;originated soon after the key divergence of ray- and lobe-finned fishes&quot; and cite Giles et al., 2017 in support of this statement. However, the conclusions of Giles et al., 2017 do not actually support that claim: quite the contrary. It used to be thought that polypterids were a really deep branch among the actinopterygii, with only a few fossil forms like Cheirolepis falling below them in the actinopt stem group. Giles et al. showed that polypterids derive from a Mesozoic actinopt group called scanilepids, and that this places them much higher up in the tree. They are still the deepest living branch, but they fall only just below the sturgeons and paddlefishes, and a whole slew of Devonian actinopterygians such as Moythomasia and its relatives (essentially what we used to call 'palaeoniscids') are now relegated to the actinopterygian stem. Giles et al., 2017 estimate the age of the split between polypterids and other living actinopts to somewhere around the end of the Devonian – say 360 million years. But the actinopt-sarcopt split almost certainly occurred during the late Silurian, no later than 420 million years at the earliest. So the polypterid lineage originated at least 60 million years after the actinopt-sarcopt divergence, which isn't what I would call &quot;soon&quot;.

In the revised submission, the problematic part of the sentence has been rephrased as follows: 'Polypterid bichirs represent the earliest diverged living group of ray-finned (Actinopterygian) fishes (Hughes et al., 2018) and they are often referred to as the most relevant species for studying character states at the dichotomy of ray- and lobe-finned fishes (e.g., Standen et al., 2014).'</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Conclusion:</p><p>I am dubious about the argument regarding spiracle size and the specific relevance of polypterids for understanding the developmental basis of increased air-breathing capacity.

We agree that the addition of the slightly earlier stage than stage 19 would nicely complement the table.

We agree that a general textbook as the single reference citation is not a sufficient prime source for the described phenomenon. In the revised submission, we have added several references to original research articles (Schoch and Witzman, 2011; Witzmann, 2004; Nokhbatolfoghahai and Downie, 2008) in order to support the branchial arch origins of external gills of amphibian and lungfish larvae.

We agree that neural crest cells emigrate prior to lateral outpouching of the hyoid arch endoderm, and this situation resembles other vertebrate embryos, where neural crest cells appear first and lateral endodermal pouches later (see e.g. Cerny et al., 2004 for neural crest migration and pharyngeal morphogenesis in axolotl). We therefore removed the statement of endodermal outpocketings prefiguring development of the external gill. On the other hand, endoderm turns out to be the likely source for signals regulating outgrowth of the external gill (see also below).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The endodermal contribution, particularly at later stages when the gills have formed, cannot really be assessed by microCT.

According to our data, microCT imaging can be used to track the endodermal contribution reliably only until bichir stage 26. Therefore, we performed CM-DiI injections into the pharynx in order to directly test the endodermal contribution to the external gills. Unfortunately, our CM-DiI labelling did not seem to hit specifically the hyoid segment endoderm (<italic>n=</italic>4). In parallel, we also performed labelling of the superficial ectoderm by carboxyfluorescein (CFDA-SE). However, the dye became quickly washed out from the embryonic surface (<italic>n</italic>=10). Thus, until now, all our attempts failed to discern the exact germ layer origin of the adult external gill epithelia. Despite this deficiency, we feel that the remaining data still show interesting phenomena connected with the early formation of bichir external gills.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The last part of the paper brings in functional experiments to test the roles of Fgf signalling using SU5402.
