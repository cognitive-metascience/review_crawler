The membrane-associated E3 ubiquitin ligase ZNRF2 is released into the cytosol upon its phosphorylation by Akt. In this study, we show that ZNRF2 interacts with mTOR on membranes, promoting the amino acid-stimulated translocation of mTORC1 to lysosomes and its activation in human cells. ZNRF2 also interacts with the V-ATPase and preserves lysosomal acidity. Moreover, knockdown of ZNRF2 decreases cell size and cell proliferation. Upon growth factor and amino acid stimulation, mTORC1 phosphorylates ZNRF2 on Ser145, and this phosphosite is dephosphorylated by protein phosphatase 6. Ser145 phosphorylation stimulates vesicle-to-cytosol translocation of ZNRF2 and forms a novel negative feedback on mTORC1. Our findings uncover ZNRF2 as a component of the amino acid sensing machinery that acts upstream of Rag-GTPases and the V-ATPase to activate mTORC1.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.12278.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.12278.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.12278.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>During digestion, proteins are broken down into their constituent parts called amino acids. Amino acids are transported in the bloodstream and are used to build up new cells and repair old ones. Optimal regulation of the cellular rates of amino acid uptake and protein synthesis is critical to the overall health of our bodies.</p><p>Inside each of our cells is a molecule called mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR for short), which acts as a controller that receives information about amino acid availability. mTOR also senses how much of each amino acid the cell needs and calibrates the cell’s amino acid uptake and protein synthesis machineries accordingly.</p><p>When investigating an enzyme named ZNRF2, Hoxhaj et al. discovered that it interacts with mTOR on membranes inside cells. This raised questions about how ZNRF2 might work with mTOR to sense amino acid supplies and regulate cell growth.</p><p>Hoxhaj et al. found that when cells are provided with amino acids and growth-stimulating hormones, mTOR is activated and attaches a phosphate group to ZNRF2. This chemical modification promotes the release of ZNRF2 from membranes so that ZNRF2 separates from mTOR. In contrast, when cells are starved of amino acids, this phosphate group is removed from ZNRF2, which then returns to the membranes. On membranes, ZNRF2 also influences the activity of a pump called V-ATPase, which controls the internal acidity of the membrane-enclosed vesicles named lysosomes that help to recycle amino acids inside cells. The action of ZNRF2 on the pump may help to prime mTOR so that it is ready to sense amino acids.</p><p>These findings by Hoxhaj et al. suggest that ZNRF2 and mTOR may ‘tune’ each other, making constant to-and-fro adjustments to help ensure that levels of amino acid uptake and cell growth are set just right. However, many questions about ZNRF2 still remain to be addressed. For example, are genetic mutations in ZNRF2 involved in cancers, developmental disorders or growth syndromes? Is ZNRF2 most important in the brain, where it is particularly abundant? And how does ZNRF2 affect acidity within the lysosomes?</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.12278.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.12278.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>ZNRF2</kwd><kwd>mTORC1</kwd><kwd>amino acid sensing</kwd><kwd>V-ATPase</kwd><kwd>PP6</kwd><kwd>Ragulator</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000265</institution-id><institution>Medical Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>U127084354</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>MacKintosh</surname><given-names>Carol</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The ZNRF2 enzyme helps the mTOR protein complex to sense amino acid levels and regulate mammalian cell growth.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) is a conserved serine/threonine protein kinase of the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)-related kinase family (PIKK), which functions as the catalytic subunit of two distinct complexes, mTORC1 and mTORC2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Wullschleger et al., 2006</xref>). In mTOR complex 1 (mTORC1), mTOR associates with Raptor, mLST8, PRAS40 and Deptor. The second mTOR-containing complex, mTORC2, comprises mTOR, Rictor, mSIN1, mLST8, Deptor and Protor. The functions of the two complexes can be distinguished through the use of the mTOR inhibitor, rapamycin, which acutely and specifically inhibits mTORC1, but has no short-term effect on mTORC2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Sarbassov et al., 2006</xref>).</p><p>mTORC1 is a central integrator of regulatory inputs from intracellular amino acids, ATP, O<sub>2</sub> and extracellular signals such as insulin and growth factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Dibble and Manning, 2013</xref>). When active, mTORC1 initiates transcriptional, translational and post-translational responses to promote a multitude of anabolic activities and to suppress catabolic processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Duvel et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Howell et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Sarbassov et al., 2005</xref>). Through phosphorylation of its substrates, including ribosomal protein S6 kinase (S6K) and the eIF4E-binding proteins (4-EBP), mTORC1 stimulates mRNA translation and, ultimately, cell growth and proliferation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Fingar and Blenis, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Showkat et al., 2014</xref>). mTORC1 activation involves its recruitment onto late endosomes and lysosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Ogmundsdottir et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Sancak et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Zoncu et al., 2011</xref>). Growth stimuli regulate mTORC1 via the heterotrimeric TSC1-TSC2-TBC1D7 complex, which negatively regulates the Rheb-GTPase, an activator of mTORC1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Dibble and Manning, 2013</xref>). In parallel, amino acids signal to mTORC1 via the Rag GTPases, which consist of RagA or RagB bound to RagC or RagD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Hirose et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Kim et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Sancak et al., 2008</xref>). Amino acids, through the Rag-GTPases, promote mTORC1 recruitment and activation at the lysosomal surface, where Rheb resides (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Dibble and Manning, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Menon et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Sancak et al., 2008</xref>). Rag-GTPases are anchored to the lysosomes via the Ragulator complex that comprises of p18, p14, MP1, HBXIP and C7orf59 proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bar-Peled et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Sancak et al., 2010</xref>). This pentameric Ragulator complex was shown to possess guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) activity towards RagA and RagB (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bar-Peled et al., 2012</xref>). More recently, work from the Sabatini group identified the GATOR1 complex as a GTPase-activating protein (GAP) for the RagA/B GTPases, and as a major negative regulator of the amino acid sensing pathway, loss of which causes mTORC1 signalling to be completely insensitive to amino acid deprivation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bar-Peled et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>Interestingly, the vacuolar proton-ATPase (V-ATPase) was reported to be involved in activation of mTORC1 by amino acids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Zoncu et al., 2011</xref>), however the mechanisms linking the V-ATPase, amino acids and mTORC1 activation are still unclear. The V-ATPase pump was shown to interact with the Ragulator complex in an amino acid-sensitive manner. This pump also supports the amino acid-promoted interaction between Ragulator and Rags, and the export of amino acids from the lysosome <italic>via</italic> PAT1 (proton-assisted transporter 1) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bar-Peled and Sabatini, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bar-Peled et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Nada et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Zoncu et al., 2011</xref>). The V-ATPase is a large, multisubunit H<sup>+</sup> pump composed of V1 (catalytic) and V0 (membrane-spanning) subcomplexes. At the surface of membrane vesicles, V-ATPase couples the energy of ATP hydrolysis to proton translocation across plasma and intracellular membranes, which results in acidification of intracellular compartments such as secretory vesicles, early and late endosomes and lysosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Forgac, 2007</xref>). Inhibition of the V-ATPase by compounds such as conconamycin A or bafilomycin A results in increased lysosomal pH, as well as inhibition of the mTORC1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Hinton et al., 2009</xref>).</p><p>Our previous study showed that the E3 ubiquitin ligase ZNRF2 is an enzyme tethered to intracellular membranes, via an N-myristoyl moiety, where it ubiquitylates the Na<sup>+</sup>/K<sup>+</sup>ATPase pump (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Hoxhaj et al., 2012</xref>). ZNRF2 is robustly phosphorylated on Ser19, Ser82 and Ser145 in response to growth factors, phorbol ester (PMA) and forskolin. Akt and PKC were identified as kinases phosphorylating of Ser19 and Ser82, respectively, and these sites are responsible for mediating the binding of ZNRF2 to 14-3-3 proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Hoxhaj et al., 2012</xref>). Furthermore, the phosphorylations of Ser19 and Ser145 promote the release of ZNRF2 from intracellular membranes into the cytosol in an Akt-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Hoxhaj et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>Here, we show that ZNRF2 is a regulator of mTORC1 activation by amino acids. Upon growth factor and amino acid stimulation, mTORC1 phosphorylates ZNRF2 at Ser145 promoting its dissociation from membranes. We also show that the protein phosphatase 6 (PP6) dephosphorylates ZNRF2 at Ser145, re-localizing ZNRF2 to the membranes. Interestingly, we also find that on membranes ZNRF2 interacts with the V-ATPase and positively regulates its functions. Our findings present ZNRF2 as a positive regulator of nutrient-mediated mTORC1 signalling, which is also a negative feedback target of mTORC1 signalling.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>ZNRF2 interacts with mTOR</title><p>To better understand the molecular function of ZNRF2, we aimed to identify ZNRF2-interacting proteins. To do this, extracts of HEK293 cells stably expressing GFP-ZNRF2 (N-terminal tag, non-myristoylated) and ZNRF2-GFP (C-terminal tag, myristoylated) were subjected to immunoprecipitation. After SDS-PAGE, strong bands at the molecular weights expected for the GFP-tagged ZNRF2 proteins were identified as such by mass spectrometric analyses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1a,b</xref>). As reported previously, the E2 conjugating enzyme UBE2N/UBC13 co-purified with both forms of ZNRF2, whereas the Na<sup>+</sup>/K<sup>+</sup>ATPase ATP1A1 subunit co-purified only with the N-myristoylated ZNRF2-GFP protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Hoxhaj et al., 2012</xref>). In addition, we identified mTOR as a high-score hit in the immunoprecipitates of N-myristoylated ZNRF2-GFP protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1b</xref>). The interactions of mTOR with ZNRF2 was confirmed by Western blotting, which showed that endogenous mTOR bind to ZNRF2-GFP, but not to the GFP-only control nor to an N-myristoylation-defective mutant (G2A) of ZNRF2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Hoxhaj et al., 2012</xref>), indicating that N-myristoylation of ZNRF2 is important for this interaction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref>). ZNRF2 also interacted with other components of the mTORC1 complex, namely raptor and mLST8 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1b</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1c</xref>) and showed co-localization with mTOR in HEK293 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1d</xref>). To test whether the binding of ZNRF2 to mTOR was direct or mediated by one of the mTORC1 or mTORC2 components, we immunoprecipitated ZNRF2-GFP from cells depleted of Raptor or from mouse embryonic fibroblast (MEF) cells lacking rictor, Sin1 and mLST8 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1e,f</xref>, respectively). ZNRF2 interacted with mTOR under all these conditions, indicating that raptor, rictor, Sin1 and mLST8 do not mediate the binding of ZNRF2 to mTOR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1e,f</xref>). We next aimed to identify regions in ZNRF2 responsible for interacting with mTOR. mTOR bound to both the N-terminal (1 to 156) region of ZNRF2 and C-terminal RING (catalytic) domain-containing region of ZNRF2, provided these fragments also carried an N-terminal myristoyl group (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1c</xref>), but was not able to interact to ZNRF2 with a defective UBZ domain (Cys160Ala/Cys163Ala mutations) or to the RING domain alone (residues 156-end). These data indicate that membranal localization is required for the mTOR-ZNRF2 interaction, consistent with lack of mTOR binding to non-N- myristoylated ZNRF2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref>), and suggest that while the UBZ domain is involved, more than one domain of ZNRF2 contributes to mTOR binding.<fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.12278.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>ZNRF2 binds to mTOR and is a substrate of mTORC1.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) Lysates of cells expressing GFP control, ZNRF2-GFP and a myristoylation mutant G2A-GFP (with GFP-tag at the C-terminus) were subject to immunoprecipitation with GFP-Trap beads. Precipitates were immunoblotted with the indicated antibodies.

To explore this, we first performed in vitro kinase assay using bacterially purified ZNRF2-GST as a substrate of mTOR, which was immunoprecipitated from HEK293 cells. mTOR could phosphorylate ZNRF2-GST in vitro, and this was prevented by the mTOR-specific inhibitor Ku-0063794 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1d</xref>). Mass spectrometric analysis revealed a single phosphorylated residue, namely Ser145 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1e</xref>). Though ZNRF2 is conserved across eukaryotes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1—figure supplement 2a–c</xref>), Ser145 is conserved only in the vertebrate proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2c</xref>). To validate this phosphorylation, we raised a phospho-specific antibody against Ser145. In cells, the mTOR catalytic inhibitor, Ku-0063794, decreased Ser145 phosphorylation in response to IGF1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1f</xref>). Since this compound inhibits both mTORC1 and mTORC2, to distinguish between these complexes, we selectively stimulated mTORC1 with either amino acids or cycloheximide (CHX) in the absence of growth factors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1g,h</xref>, respectively). Ser145 was markedly phosphorylated in response to these treatments and this effect was blocked by the mTORC1 specific inhibitor, rapamycin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1g,h</xref>), suggesting that mTORC1 rather than mTORC2 mediates Ser145 phosphorylation. However, while mTORC1 is solely responsible for amino acid-stimulated phosphorylation of Ser145, rapamycin decreased, but did not abolish Ser145 phosphorylation in response to IGF1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1g</xref>), which suggests that another IGF1-activated kinase can also phosphorylate this site. The phosphorylation of Ser145 was not affected by the p70 S6 kinase 1 (S6K1)-specific inhibitor PF-4708671 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Pearce et al., 2010</xref>), indicating that ZNRF2 is directly phosphorylated by mTORC1 rather than via S6K (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1j</xref>). Moreover, phosphorylation of Ser145 was not decreased in rictor or mLST8 knock-out MEFs, ruling out the possibility that mTORC2 phosphorylates this site (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1k and 1l</xref>, respectively). Together, these data are consistent with Ser145 of ZNRF2 being phosphorylated by mTORC1 in response to growth factors and amino acids.</p><p>Previously, we reported that ZNRF2 is translocated from intracellular membranes to the cytosol upon IGF1 stimulation and that Ser145Ala mutation hampered the IGF1-stimulated dissociation of ZNRF2 into the cytoplasm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Hoxhaj et al., 2012</xref>). Consistent with mTORC1 being a Ser145 kinase, rapamycin increased the membranal localization of ZNRF2-GFP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Hoxhaj et al., 2012</xref>). In addition, Ser145Ala mutation of ZNRF2 resulted in a more distinct membranal localization in comparison to the wild-type protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3b</xref>). The expressed ZNRF2-GFP and Ser145Ala-ZNRF2-GFP co-localized predominantly with Golgi and to a lesser extent with the lysosomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3a,b</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>PP6 interacts with ZNRF2 and dephosphorylates phosphoSer145 of ZNRF2</title><p>In addition to mTOR, several components of the protein serine/threonine phosphatase PP6 complex were identified as high-score hits in ZNRF2 immunoprecipitates analyzed by mass spectrometry (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1b</xref>). The PP6 holoenzyme is a heteromeric complex, comprising the catalytic (PPP6C), three regulatory subunits PP6R1/2/3 (also called SIT4 phosphatase–associated protein (SAPS1/2/3) and three ankyrin repeat-domain containing regulatory subunits (ANKRD28/44/52) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Stefansson and Brautigan, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Stefansson et al., 2008</xref>). The binding of PP6 complex components to ZNRF2-GFP was unaffected by the position of the GFP tag (N- or C-terminus) suggesting that the N-myristoylation of ZNRF2 is not required for the interaction of PP6 to ZNRF2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2a</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1a</xref>).

Only knockdown of PPP6C resulted in a decrease in the levels of other subunits in cell lysates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1c</xref>). Depletion of PPP6C, PP6R1 (SAPS1) and PP6R3 (SAPS3) did not affect the ability of other PP6 holoenzyme components to interact with ZNRF2. In contrast, knockdown of PP6R2 (SAPS2) and ANKRD28 decreased the amounts of PPP6C, SAPS1 and SAPS3 that co-immunoprecipitated with ZNRF2-GFP. These data suggest that SAPS2 and ANKRD28 mediate the interaction of the PP6 complex with ZNRF2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2c</xref>).</p><p>The yeast orthologue of PP6 (Sit4), functions downstream of the rapamycin-sensitive TOR complex 1 to regulate G1 to S phase cell cycle progression, Gcn2-regulated translation and expression of certain nitrogen catabolite-repressed genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Beck and Hall, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Morales-Johansson et al., 2009</xref>). PP6 is also proposed to dephosphorylate GCN2 when mTORC1 is inhibited in mammalian cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Wengrod et al., 2015</xref>). Since we found that ZNRF2 is a substrate of mTORC1 and interacts with PP6, we tested whether PP6 could dephosphorylate ZNRF2 in vitro. Active PP6 holoenzyme, but not the catalytically inactive mutant, dephosphorylated phosphoSer145, but not phosphoSer19 (Akt site) in vitro (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2d</xref>). Importantly, rapamycin treatment of HEK293 cells decreased phosphorylation of Ser145 and this was rescued by PPP6C knockdown (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2e,f</xref>). These data suggest that Ser145 is phosphorylated by mTOR and dephosphorylated by PP6 in vivo (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2i</xref>). We also tested the effect of PP6 knock-down on known substrates of mTORC1 such as p-S6K, p-ULK1 and 4EBP1, and observed that while PP6 knockdown increases S6K phosphorylation, it does not affect ULK1 phosphorylation or 4EBP1 mobility shift (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1d</xref>). To our knowledge, this is the first report of PP6-dependent changes in S6K phosphorylation.</p><p>Furthermore, we investigated the role of ZNRF2 Ser145 phosphorylation on mTORC1 signaling and found that overexpression of untagged ZNRF2 significantly increased the activation of mTORC1 by amino acids, while overexpression of ZNRF2-Ser145Ala augmented this effect, suggesting that phosphorylation of Ser145 negatively regulates ZNRF2 function towards mTORC1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2g,i</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1e</xref>). This augmented activation of mTORC1 did not occur when the overexpressed ZNRF2-Ser145Ala mutant also carried a Gly2Ala mutation, rendering ZNRF2 non-myristoylatable (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2h</xref>). Interestingly, enhancement of mTORC1 activation by amino acids upon expression of wild-type or Ser145A ZNRF2 was decreased 2-fold by ligase dead C199A mutation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1f</xref>). These findings suggest that both membranal localization of ZNRF2 and its E3 ubiquitin ligase activity are important for its effect on mTORC1 activation by amino acids.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>Knockdown of ZNRF2 decreases mTORC1 activation by amino acids</title><p>We next explored whether ZNRF2 plays a role in mTORC1 signalling.

Overexpression of these Rag mutants rescued the decrease in mTORC1 activity caused by ZNRF2 knockdown, suggesting that ZNRF2 acts upstream of the Rag GTPases. These experiments reinforce a model in which ZNRF2 contributes to mTORC1 activation by amino acids upstream of V-ATPase and Rag GTPases, via regulating V-ATPase localization and function (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5g</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>The activation of mTOR, as part of mTORC1 complex, is dependent on lysosomal localization and the vacuolar H<sup>+</sup>-ATPase (V-ATPase) activity; however, the precise mechanism underlying regulation of mTORC1 by the V-ATPase remains unclear. In this study, we identified a new binding partner of mTOR, ZNRF2, which acts as a positive effector functioning upstream of V-ATPase to mediate amino acid-activation of mTORC1. Furthermore, we show that ZNRF2 is also a new substrate of mTORC1 and PP6 that promotes negative feedback regulation of mTORC1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2i</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5g</xref>).</p><p>Similar to mTOR, ZNRF2 is conserved among eukaryotes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>). Putative ZNRF2 orthologues in <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> (Pib1p), <italic>D. melanogaster, C. elegans</italic> and vertebrates share most similarity in their UBZ and RING E3 ligase domains. The <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> and <italic>C. elegans</italic> orthologues of ZNRF2 also have a conserved N-myristoylation signal, which is critical for membranal localization of ZNRF2. Notably, the S288C strain of <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> that carries a null allele for ZNRF2 orthologue Pib1p has abnormal vacuolar morphology, increased replicative lifespan and decreased growth in minimal medium, indicative of roles analogous to the V-ATPase- and mTOR-related functions of ZNRF2 that we describe in this study (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.yeastgenome.org">http://www.yeastgenome.org</ext-link>).</p><p>Our data suggest that ZNRF2 is targeted via N-myristoylation to Golgi and other intracellular membranes where it interacts with the V-ATPase. According to size-exclusion chromatography analysis, knockdown of ZNRF2 has no effect on V-ATPase or mTORC1 complex assembly. However, several observations indicate that ZNRF2 promotes the trafficking of newly-synthesized V-ATPase to the lysosomes. When ER to Golgi trafficking was resumed after a BFA block and also after V-ATPase was released from inhibition by ConA, we found that ZNRF2 depletion prevented the recovery of amino acid-stimulation of mTORC1. Furthermore, ZNRF2 knockdown reduced the association of the V-ATPase V0A2 subunit with lysosomes, with a parallel increase in lysosomal pH. These data suggest that ZNRF2 is a key regulator of V-ATPase trafficking, impacting on its key function of maintaining vesicle pH. Lysosomes are acidic (pH ~4.5) intracellular organelles and their primary function is degradation of extracellular and intracellular material (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Appelqvist et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Settembre et al., 2013</xref>). Concomitantly with increased lysosomal pH, ZNRF2 depletion decreased mTORC1 signalling, consistent with requirement of functional lysosomes to sustain mTORC1 activation.</p><p>We also demonstrate that ZNRF2 knockdown affects the lysosomal recruitment of mTORC1, which is mediated by the Rag GTPases, the Ragulator complex and the V-ATPase. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Zoncu et al. (2011)</xref> proposed an inside-out mechanism for sensing amino acids that requires the V-ATPase, which in turns interacts with the Ragulator complex. Constitutively active Rag GTPase mutants can rescue the decrease in mTORC1 activity due to knockdown of ZNRF2. This finding suggests that ZNRF2 regulates mTORC1 recruitment to lysosomes upstream of Rag GTPases. We therefore hypothesize that attenuation of mTORC1 recruitment to the lysosomal membranes upon ZNRF2 knockdown is due to impaired function of V-ATPase and subsequent effects on the Ragulator and Rag GTPases.</p><p>As well as being a positive regulator of mTORC1, ZNRF2 is also a new target of negative regulation by mTORC1, indicative of a self-regulating feedback mechanism. Our findings are consistent with ZNRF2 having been identified in an unbiased quantitative phosphoproteomics screen aiming to find mTOR substrates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Yu et al., 2011</xref>). Together with previous work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Hoxhaj et al., 2012</xref>), this study suggests that mTORC1-mediated phosphorylation of ZNRF2 on Ser145 enhances the release of ZNRF2 from intracellular membranes into the cytosol. We therefore propose the existence of an auto-inhibitory feedback loop in which the release of ZNRF2 from membranes limits the activation of mTORC1 in response to amino acids and growth factors, perhaps preventing unrestrained cell growth. Consistent with this proposal, overexpressing wild-type ZNRF2 enhanced cellular mTORC1 activation by amino acids, and expressing a Ser145Ala mutant did so to greater extent. This finely balanced dynamic regulation of ZNRF2 is reminiscent of the negative feedbacks by mTORC1 via S6K on IRS1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Harrington et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Shah et al., 2004</xref>) and Grb10 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Hsu et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Yu et al., 2011</xref>).</p><p>In our model, mTORC1 mediate release of ZNRF2 from membranes into the cytosol, resulting in decreased mTORC1 activity through lysosome basification via the V-ATPase pathway. Hampering activation of mTORC1 by amino acids, during strong activation of the pathway by growth factors/insulin, may ensure that hyperactivation of mTORC1 does not occur. Consistent with this proposal, ZNRF2 knockdown results in decreased mTORC1 signalling in cells lacking TSC2, that have constitutively active mTORC1 (data not shown). In other words, ZNRF2 adjusts the homeostatic set point for mTORC1.</p><p>We also show that the mTORC1-phosphorylated Ser145 on ZNRF2 is dephosphorylated by PP6, making PP6 a positive regulator of ZNRF2 by promoting its rebinding to membranes where it can regulate the V-ATPase and mTORC1.PhosphoSer145 of ZNRF2 should provide a useful reporter for studying how PP6 is regulated, which is critical because the relative activity of PP6 versus mTORC1 will set the level of membrane bound ZNRF2, mTORC1 activity and cell growth.</p><p>In summary, this study introduces ZNRF2 as a positive regulator of mTORC1 activation by amino acids, which functions upstream of the V-ATPase and of Rag-GTPases.

Briefly, 10<sup>6</sup> HEK293 cells were seeded in each well of a 6-well plate and treated after 8–12 hr with 30 μg/ml of Dextran-Oregon Green 514 (D-7176, Invitrogen) for 6 to 12h. Excess dye was washed out by three rinses in PBS, and cells incubated for a further 2 hr in amino acid-free EBSS or in full medium and collected via pipetting. The media was removed by centrifugation at 1000 rpm for 1 min and cells were resuspended in 200 μl physiological buffer containing 10 mM HEPES pH7.4, 2.5 mM KCl, 2 mM CaCl<sub>2</sub>, 136 mM NaCl, 1.3 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub> and 5 mM glucose. The fluorescence of Dextran Oregon Green was measured in black 96-multiwell plates. The samples were excited at 440 nm and 490 nm, and data collected at 530 nm. To calculate pH, a calibration curve was created by loading HEK293 cells with Dextran-Oregon Green, washing out excess dye and resuspending the cells in K<sup>+</sup> isotonic buffers at different pH values. The calibration standards were generated using a K<sup>+</sup> solution consisting of 145 mM KCl, 10 mM glucose, 1 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, buffered with 20 mM HEPES (for pH 7–8), 20 mM of MES (for pH 5–6.5), or 20 mM acetate (for pH 3.5–4.5). Nigericin (10 μg/ml) was also added to the calibration samples, and 490/440 ratios were fitted to a Boltzmann sigmoid using Prism and plotted as function of pH.</p></sec><sec id="s4-14"><title>Cell lysis</title><p>After treatments, the medium was aspirated and cells were rinsed once with ice-cold PBS and lysed in 0.35 ml (10-cm dish) or 0.5 ml (15-cm dish) of ice-cold Triton X-100 lysis buffer.

responses. A lightly edited version of the letter sent to the authors after peer review is shown, indicating the most substantive concerns; minor comments are not usually included.</p></boxed-text><p>Thank you for submitting your work entitled &quot;ZNRF2 is a substrate of mTORC1 and a mediator of its activation by amino acids&quot; for peer review at <italic>eLife</italic>. Your submission has been favorably evaluated by Tony Hunter as Senior Editor and three reviewers.</p><p>In this paper the authors demonstrate that ZNRF2, a membrane-associated E3 ubiquitin ligase, promotes mTORC1 activity in response to amino acids, identifying ZNRF2 as an mTOR-associated protein that interacts directly with mTOR, and showing that depletion of ZNRF2 resulted in reduced activation of mTORC1 in response to amino acids and IGF1. Mechanistically, ZNRF2 is required for proper trafficking of vacuolar ATPase (V-ATPase) to the lysosome. In ZNRF2-depleted cells, a decrease in lysosomal V-ATPase inhibits amino acid-induced mTORC1 activation. In addition, the authors showed that mTORC1 phosphorylates ZNRF2 at Ser145 and releases ZNRF2 from membranes. This ZNRF2 release from a membrane compartment inhibits amino acid-induced mTORC1 activation, serving as a negative feedback loop.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission. The following major points will need to be addressed in a revised version.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The authors previously showed that Akt phosphorylates ZNRF2 at Ser19, which releases ZNRF2 from intracellular membrane compartments into the cytosol. In this study, they demonstrate that mTORC1 phosphorylates ZNRF2 at Ser145, which also releases ZNRF2 from intracellular membrane compartments (partially the lysosome) to the cytosol. Overexpression of phospho-deficient ZNRF2 (S145A and S19A) enhances membrane association of ZNRF2 (Hoxhaj et al. 2012 and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2B</xref>). The phospho-deficient ZNRF2 also enhances mTORC1 activation in response to amino acids. Based on these data, the authors propose a model in which the insulin-Akt pathway inhibits ZNRF2 and thus mTORC1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5G</xref>). However, this is inconsistent with previous publications showing Akt as a positive regulator of mTORC1 through inhibition of the TSC complex, a negative regulator of mTORC1. According to authors' model, growth factors would inhibit mTORC1, which is not the case even in this study (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>).</p><p>2) The authors performed amino acid stimulation experiments in the absence of growth factors. Some previous publications have shown that inputs from both amino acids and growth factors, but neither alone, are necessary to activate mTORC1 in most cells (e.g., Sancack et al. Science, 2008). How do the authors explain mTORC1 activation in response to amino acids in the absence of growth factors? In this regard, it would be informative if the authors tested the effect of amino acids on mTORC1 activity in ZNRF2-depleted or overexpressed cells in the presence of growth factors.</p><p>3) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>: Consistent with the authors' model that Ser145 phosphorylation is inhibitory to ZNRF2 and mTORC1, a ZNRF2-S145A mutant enhances amino acid-induced activation of mTORC1. The also authors show that protein phosphatase 6 (PP6) directly dephosphorylates ZNRF2 at Ser145. However, contrary to what one would expect given the inhibitory effect of Ser145 phosphorylation on mTORC1, phospho-S6K (an mTORC1 target) increases in PP6-knockdown cells. No explanation is provided. Also, to investigate further this apparent discrepancy, other mTORC1 targets such as ULK1 and 4E-BP should be examined.</p><p>4) The authors did not address whether ZNRF2 E3 ligase activity is required for this function, and, if so, what protein(s) it ubiquitylates. In their earlier paper, they showed that ZNRF2 isolated from HEK239 cells could ubiquitylate Na<sup>+</sup>/K<sup>+</sup> ATPase α1 in vitro, which raises the question of whether ZNRF2 ubiquitylates a V-ATPase (or Ragulator) subunit, and whether it affects the level of any of these proteins, e.g. does ZNRF2 depletion cause a decrease in lysosomal V-ATPase abundance at steady state?

In this study, they demonstrate that mTORC1 phosphorylates ZNRF2 at Ser145, which also releases ZNRF2 from intracellular membrane compartments (partially the lysosome) to the cytosol. Overexpression of phospho-deficient ZNRF2 (S145A and S19A) enhances membrane association of ZNRF2 (Hoxhaj et al. 2012 and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2B</xref>). The phospho-deficient ZNRF2 also enhances mTORC1 activation in response to amino acids. Based on these data, the authors propose a model in which the insulin-Akt pathway inhibits ZNRF2 and thus mTORC1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5G</xref>). However, this is inconsistent with previous publications showing Akt as a positive regulator of mTORC1 through inhibition of the TSC complex, a negative regulator of mTORC1. According to authors' model, growth factors would inhibit mTORC1, which is not the case even in this study (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>).</italic> We apologize that our previous model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5G</xref>) was not an accurate portrayal of our findings and we have now amended it. We agree with the reviewer that the net effect of insulin/Akt signaling is positive regulation of mTORC1. The effect of Akt on mTORC1 activation is a sum of multiple inputs, at least two of which (phosphorylations of TSC2 and Pras40) are positive. To our knowledge, ZNRF2 is the first negative input from Akt to mTORC1. However, deconvoluting these three inputs to <italic>prove</italic> that Akt negatively regulates mTORC1 via ZNRF2 is not feasible (it would require generation of knock-in of TSC2-S939A/S981A/S1130A/S1132A/T1462A and Pras40-T246A mutations) and is beyond the scope of the manuscript, so we have removed it from the model.</p><p>We also amended the Discussion section accordingly. The Discussion section first considers ZNRF2 activation of mTORC1 upstream of the V-ATPase. Next, we discuss the regulation of ZNRF2 in several paragraphs that start as follows: “As well as being a positive regulator of mTORC1, ZNRF2 is also a new target of negative regulation by mTORC1, indicative of a self-regulating feedback mechanism.”</p><p><italic>2) The authors performed amino acid stimulation experiments in the absence of growth factors. Some previous publications have shown that inputs from both amino acids and growth factors, but neither alone, are necessary to activate mTORC1 in most cells (e.g., Sancack et al. Science, 2008). How do the authors explain mTORC1 activation in response to amino acids in the absence of growth factors? In this regard, it would be informative if the authors tested the effect of amino acids on mTORC1 activity in ZNRF2-depleted or overexpressed cells in the presence of growth factors.</italic> </p><p>We agree with the reviewer that full activation of mTORC1 requires inputs from both amino acids and growth factors. Amino acids act through the Ragulator and Rag GTPases to localize mTORC1 to the lysosome (Kim et al., 2008; Sancak et al., 2008,2010), bringing it in close proximity to Rheb, a potent stimulator of mTORC1 kinase activity (Sancak, 2007; Menon, Dibble et al. 2014). In turn, through Akt, growth factors stimulate dissociation of the TSC complex from Rheb at the lysosomal surface, therefore leading to activation of mTORC1.</p><p>In our experimental set up, we performed amino acid starvation without growth factors for 90 minutes, prior to stimulation with amino acids. This treatment seemed to be sufficient to translocate mTORC1 away from lysosomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>), resulting in complete loss of p-S6K and p-4EBP1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>). But, during these 90 minutes, Rheb-GTP pools may not fully convert into Rheb-GDP. It is possible that under these conditions, there is sufficient active Rheb-GTP to activate mTORC1 that is potently recruited to lysosomal surface by amino acid treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>).</p><p>We have now tested the effects of ZNRF2 knockdown on mTORC1 activation in the presence of growth factors (dialyzed FBS) and found that ZNRF2 knockdown significantly decreases mTORC1 activation by amino acids under these conditions as well (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1C</xref>).</p><p> <italic>3) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>: Consistent with the authors' model that Ser145 phosphorylation is inhibitory to ZNRF2 and mTORC1, a ZNRF2-S145A mutant enhances amino acid-induced activation of mTORC1. The also authors show that protein phosphatase 6 (PP6) directly dephosphorylates ZNRF2 at Ser145. However, contrary to what one would expect given the inhibitory effect of Ser145 phosphorylation on mTORC1, phospho-S6K (an mTORC1 target) increases in PP6-knockdown cells. No explanation is provided. Also, to investigate further this apparent discrepancy, other mTORC1 targets such as ULK1 and 4E-BP should be examined.</italic> We show that PP6 dephosphorylates phosphoS145 of ZNRF2 in response to rapamycin treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>) and that PP6 dephosphorylates phosphoS145 in vitro (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). We further show that S145A enhances amino acid-induced mTORC1 activation suggesting that this phosphorylation induced a negative feedback to decrease mTORC1 activation by amino acids.</p><p>We agree with the reviewer that the increase in phospho-S6K (an mTORC1 target) in PP6-knockdown cells might seem counterintuitive since one would expect that Ser145 should be phosphorylated, leading to mTORC1 inhibition. However, as in the case with many other phosphatases, we think that there are very likely many other biological events affected by knockdown of PP6 (acutely or long term transcriptional regulation) which could modulate mTORC1 and therefore S6K phosphorylation independently of ZNRF2.</p><p>To further test the effect of PP6 knock-down on the activity of mTORC1 we analyzed other known substrates of mTORC1 such as p-ULK1 and 4EBP, and observed that while PP6 knockdown increases S6K phosphorylation, it does not affect ULK1 phosphorylation or 4EBP1 mobility shift (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1D</xref>). These observations confirm our notion that PP6 is a pleiotropic phosphatase and therefore we cannot measure a direct effect of PP6 knock-down on mTORC1 via ZNRF2 Ser145 phosphorylation increase.</p><p><italic>4) The authors did not address whether ZNRF2 E3 ligase activity is required for this function, and, if so, what protein(s) it ubiquitylates. In their earlier paper, they showed that ZNRF2 isolated from HEK239 cells could ubiquitylate Na<sup>+</sup>/</italic>K<sup>+</sup></p><p> <italic>ATPase α1 in vitro, which raises the question of whether ZNRF2 ubiquitylates a V-ATPase (or Ragulator) subunit, and whether it affects the level of any of these proteins, e.g. does ZNRF2 depletion cause a decrease in lysosomal V-ATPase abundance at steady state? While such studies may be beyond the scope of this paper, at the very least this issue needs to be discussed in the present paper; if data with a ligase-deficient mutant are available, they could be included.</italic> Indeed, we have previously shown that ZNRF2 can ubiquitylate and regulate Na<sup>+</sup>/K<sup>+</sup> ATPase α1 (Hoxhaj et al., 2012). The reviewer makes a valid point, about the possibility of ZNRF2 being able to ubiquitylate V-ATPase and/or p18 component. This is a very interesting area that we most certainly would like to explore in the future but we agree, that this is out of scope for this paper. Nevertheless, we tested whether ZNRF2 depletion was able to alter the abundance of V-ATPase but we did not observe any significant changes in V-ATPase or Ragulator protein levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1B</xref>).</p><p>As the reviewers suggested, we tested the effects of a ligase-deficient mutant of ZNRF2. The enhancement of mTORC1 activation by amino acids upon overexpression of WT or S145A ZNRF2 was decreased 2-fold by ligase dead C199A mutation of WT or S145A ZNRF2 mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1F</xref>). These data suggest that the E3 ubiquitin ligase activity of ZNRF2 is required for its effects on mTORC1 activation by amino acids.</p><p><italic>5) Some other points that could be discussed but do not necessarily need to be addressed experimentally: It is not clear whether ZNRF2 is a conserved component of the mTORC1 pathway, i.e. since activation of TORC1 is a universal eukaryotic response to amino acids, how far down in evolution are ZNRF2 orthologues found, and is there any genetic evidence for a role in mTORC1 signaling in simpler organisms?</italic> </p><p>We have added information about ZNRF2 orthologues to the Discussion section and added <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref> to illustrate the extent of their conservation.</p><p>“Similar to mTOR, ZNRF2 is conserved among eukaryotes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>).

The <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> and <italic>C. elegans</italic> orthologues of ZNRF2 also have a conserved N-myristoylation signal, which is critical for membranal localization of ZNRF2. Notably, the S288C strain of <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> that carries a null allele for ZNRF2 orthologue Pib1p has abnormal vacuolar morphology, increased replicative lifespan and decreased growth in minimal medium, indicative of roles analogous to the V-ATPase- and mTOR-related functions of ZNRF2 that we describe in this study (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.yeastgenome.org">http://www.yeastgenome.org</ext-link>).”</p><p><italic>Does ZNRF2 promote V-ATPase assembly or the translocation of the V-ATPase subunits from ER to the lysosome, or both?</italic> </p><p>ZNRF2 does not promote V-ATPase assembly, according to size-exclusion chromatography analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1A</xref>).

Does ZNFR2 affect Rag activity/GTP loading? Does Ser145 phosphorylation affect the interaction of ZNRF2 with mTOR?</italic> We demonstrate that ZNRF2 knockdown affects the lysosomal recruitment of mTORC1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>), which is mediated by the Rag GTPases, the Ragulator complex and the V-ATPase. Zoncu et al. (2011) proposed an inside-out mechanism for sensing amino acids which requires the V-ATPase, which in turns interacts with the Ragulator complex. It still remains unknown how the V-ATPase regulates the function of Ragulator and Rag GTPases. Our data shows that ZNRF2 binds to V-ATPase and Ragulator subunits and that ZNRF2 knockdown diminishes the association of V-ATPase with the lysosomes and affects lysosomal pH (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figures 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">5F</xref>). We hypothesize that the attenuation of mTORC1 recruitment to the lysosomal membranes could involve the impaired function of V-ATPase and its subsequent effects on the Ragulator and the Rag GTPases. It seems that ZNRF2 regulates mTORC1 recruitment to lysosomes upstream of Rag GTPases, as constitutively active Rag GTPase mutants can rescue decrease in mTORC1 activity due to knock-down of ZNRF2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1D</xref>).
