cues required for innate behaviors. However, whether there is a link between developmental programs and the emergence of inborn behaviors remains unknown. Our previous studies revealed that the telencephalic preoptic area (POA) embryonic niche is a novel source of MeA destined progenitors. Here, we show that the POA is comprised of distinct progenitor pools complementarily marked by the transcription factors Dbx1 and Foxp2. As determined by molecular and electrophysiological criteria this embryonic parcellation predicts postnatal MeA inhibitory neuronal subtype identity. We further find that <italic>Dbx1</italic>-derived and Foxp2+ cells in the MeA are differentially activated in response to innate behavioral cues in a sex-specific manner. Thus, developmental transcription factor expression is predictive of MeA neuronal identity and sex-specific neuronal responses, providing a potential developmental logic for how innate behaviors could be processed by different MeA neuronal subtypes.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.21012.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.21012.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.21012.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Within the brain, a set of interconnected structures called the limbic system is involved in emotion, motivation and memory. This system – and in particular a structure called the medial amygdala – also contributes to behavioral drives that help an animal to survive and reproduce. These include the drive to avoid predators, to defend territory, and to find a mate. Such behaviors are thought to be inborn or innate. This means that animals display them instinctively whenever specific triggers are present, without the need to learn them beforehand.</p><p>However, just as a computer must be programmed to perform specific tasks, these innate behavioral responses must also be programmed into the brain. Given that animals do not learn these behaviors, Lischinsky et al. reasoned that specific events during the development of the brain must provide the animal’s brain with the necessary instructions. To test this idea, they studied how the development of the medial amygdala in mouse embryos may give rise to differences in innate mating behavior seen between male and female mice.</p><p>The medial amygdala contains many subtypes of neurons, which show different responses to sex hormones such as estrogen and androgen. Lischinsky et al. show that two sets of cells give rise to some of the different neurons of the adult medial amygdala. One set of these precursor cells makes a protein called Dbx1 and the other makes a protein called Foxp2. These two sets of precursors generate medial amygdala neurons with different arrays of sex hormone receptors in male and female mice. Moreover, while the two sets of medial amygdala neurons are activated during aggressive encounters, they show different patterns of activation in male and female animals during mating.</p><p>These findings suggest that the development of <italic>Dbx1</italic>-derived and Foxp2+ neurons in the medial amygdala helps program innate reproductive and aggressive behaviors into the brain. The new findings also provide insights into why these behaviors differ in male and female mice. The next challenge is to identify the inputs and outputs of these two distinct subpopulations of medial amygdala neurons. This should make it possible to work out exactly how these populations of cells control innate behaviors in male and female animals.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.21012.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.21012.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>innate behaviors</kwd><kwd>limbic system development</kwd><kwd>medial amygdala</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000026</institution-id><institution>National Institute on Drug Abuse</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>F32 DA035754</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Sokolowski</surname><given-names>Katie</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Goldwin Foundation Grant for Pediatric Epilepsy</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Liu</surname><given-names>Judy</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000026</institution-id><institution>National Institute on Drug Abuse</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01 NIDA020140</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Corbin</surname><given-names>Joshua G</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000055</institution-id><institution>National Institute on Deafness and Other Communication Disorders</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01 DC012050</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Corbin</surname><given-names>Joshua G</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Studying the development of the medial amygdala in the mouse reveals how the brain may potentially process sex differences in innate behaviors such as mating.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>One of the major functions of the limbic system is to integrate conspecific and non-conspecific environmental cues with social and survival salience to generate appropriate behavioral responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Sokolowski and Corbin, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Stowers et al., 2013</xref>). The medial subnucleus of the amygdala (MeA) serves as a hub in this function, residing only two synapses away from sensory neurons in the vomeronasal organ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Dulac and Wagner, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Sokolowski and Corbin, 2012</xref>). The MeA along with the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BNST) and multiple nuclei of the hypothalamus including the ventromedial hypothalamus, form a core limbic circuit largely dedicated to processing innate behaviors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Dulac and Wagner, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Gross and Canteras, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Choi et al., 2005</xref>).

The critical role that the MeA plays in regulating sex-specific behaviors is reflected in the high expression levels of steroid hormone pathway proteins such as aromatase, estrogen receptor and androgen receptor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Wu et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Juntti et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Unger et al., 2015</xref>). MeA neuronal subpopulations expressing different combinations of these proteins have been shown to regulate aggression or mating behaviors in male and female mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Juntti et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Hong et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Unger et al., 2015</xref>). Nonetheless, understanding how developmental programs are linked to behavioral processing in the MeA remains unknown.</p><p>As unlearned behaviors are largely inborn, we reasoned that there must be embryonic developmental programs that guide the formation of sub-circuitry dedicated for different innate behaviors. Previous studies of MeA development revealed that progenitors located at the telencephalic-diencephalic border are a major source of MeA neuronal populations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Zhao et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Hirata et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Soma et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">García-Moreno et al., 2010</xref>). Our previous work revealed that one of these progenitor populations is defined by the transient expression of the developmentally regulated transcription factor, <italic>Dbx1</italic>, which in turn generates a subclass of MeA putative inhibitory projection neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Hirata et al., 2009</xref>). However, the MeA is also comprised of diverse populations of local interneurons and both excitatory and inhibitory output neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bian, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Keshavarzi et al., 2014</xref>). This suggests the contribution of other progenitor subpopulations, perhaps also originating from the POA to MeA neuronal diversity, populations which may in turn play different roles in innate behavioral processing.</p><p>Here, we demonstrate that in addition to Dbx1 expression, a subset of MeA embryonic progenitors are complementarily marked by expression of Foxp2, a forkhead transcription factor implicated in the development and function of neurons and required in the motor coordinating centers of the brain for the appropriate production of speech (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">French and Fisher, 2014</xref>). We find this embryonic parcellation interestingly persists into postnatal stages where <italic>Dbx1</italic>-derived and Foxp2+ MeA neurons are separate, non-overlapping inhibitory output neuronal subpopulations. Strikingly, both subpopulations are activated during specific innate behaviors in a sex-specific manner. Thus, our findings link developmental patterning to innate behavioral processing and further provide an embryonic developmental framework for how these behaviors may emerge.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Dbx1 and Foxp2 expression segregates embryonic and postnatal MeA subpopulations</title><p>Our previous work along with the work of others revealed that the telencephalic-diencephalic border is a major source of neurons that will populate the MeA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Zhao et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Hirata et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Soma et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">García-Moreno et al., 2010</xref>). Our previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Hirata et al., 2009</xref>) revealed that the preoptic area (POA), which lies on the telencephalic side of this border (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Flames et al., 2007</xref>), is a source of <italic>Dbx1</italic>+ progenitors fated to generate a subpopulation of MeA inhibitory output neurons. Our previous studies further revealed that progenitors arising from ventral telencephalic Shh+ and Nkx2.1+ domains also contributed to diverse neuronal subpopulations of the MeA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Carney et al., 2010</xref>). Thus, while a molecular map of MeA embryonic niche diversity is beginning to emerge, the diversity of mature neurons derived from this niche and whether there is a link between embryonic identity, mature identity and function remains unknown. Moreover, as these previously identified subpopulations only generate a subset of MeA neurons, we reasoned that there must be other transcription factor marked progenitor populations within the telencephalic-diencephalic niche.</p><p>Here, in addition to <italic>Dbx1</italic>+ progenitors, we observed a progenitor population comprised of Foxp2+ cells, residing primarily in the putative subventricular zone (SVZ) of the POA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a–f,s</xref>). Interestingly, during embryogenesis, <italic>Dbx1</italic>-derived and Foxp2+ progenitor populations were non-overlapping (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a–l</xref>). Both populations were also generally distinct from OTP+ progenitors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1a–i</xref>), a population previously shown to define a subset of MeA-fated progenitors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">García-Moreno et al., 2010</xref>). We next investigated whether Foxp2+ progenitors overlapped with ventral telencephalic populations derived from <italic>Shh</italic> or <italic>Nkx6.2</italic> lineages, which also encompass the POA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Carney et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Fogarty et al., 2007</xref>).

Here, focusing on the medial amygdala (MeA), a critical brain region for the processing of olfactory-based sensory cues for unlearned behavior in vertebrates, we took a neural developmental approach to shed light on how innate behavioral information may be encoded in the male and female brain. Integrating genetic fate-mapping, patch clamp electrophysiology and animal behavioral assays we uncover a fundamental link between embryonic patterning and brain responses to innate behavioral cues at two levels: (1) differential transcription factor expression within the embryonic MeA progenitor niche predicts mature output neuronal subtype identity and (2) further predicts subpopulation sex-specific responses to mating and predator odor avoidance cues. Our findings further suggest that transcription factor expression at the progenitor stage may be instructive for the establishment of neuronal populations and sub-circuits regulating sex-specific behaviors.</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>Potential transcription factor codes for establishment of MeA neuronal diversity</title><p>The generation of neuronal diversity across amygdala subnuclei has been posited to occur in a compartmentalized manner with amygdala inhibitory neurons generated in the subpallial ganglionic eminences and excitatory neurons arising from the cortical pallial region (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Swanson and Petrovich, 1998</xref>). In this model, the amygdala and cerebral cortex develop by a similar mechanism with neurons in both structures originating in shared progenitor domains. However, more recent studies have revealed that the generation of amygdala neuronal diversity is more complex with large populations of neurons originating in progenitor niches dedicated for limbic structures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Remedios et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Hirata et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Soma et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Waclaw et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">García-Moreno et al., 2010</xref>). One of these major niches encompasses the region at the telencephalic-diencephalic border, an origin of MeA output neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Hirata et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">García-Moreno et al., 2010</xref>). Our previous studies revealed that the homedomain encoding transcription factor, <italic>Dbx1,</italic> marks a subpopulation of progenitors within the POA, which will later generate a subset of MeA inhibitory output neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Hirata et al., 2009</xref>). Here, we significantly extend this work by revealing the presence of a complementary population of progenitors within this niche marked by expression of Foxp2. Thus, our findings, combined with previous work, suggest a model of MeA development in which distinct progenitor populations at the telencephalic-diencephalic border defined by differential transcription factor expression (e.gs. Dbx1, Foxp2, OTP) are a major source for MeA neuronal diversity.</p><p>The function of combinatorial sets of transcription factors in neural progenitors has been shown across the neuraxis as the mechanism for the generation and specification of distinct subclasses of neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Kepecs and Fishell, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Stepien et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Shirasaki and Pfaff, 2002</xref>). In addition to specification of neuronal subtype identity, recent studies in the spinal cord and globus pallidus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Dodson et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bikoff et al., 2016</xref>) have revealed that different combinatorial codes in progenitor pools predict neuronal subtype connectivity patterns, neuronal firing properties and in the case of the globus pallidus, distinct functions in regulating voluntary movements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Dodson et al., 2015</xref>). Thus, transcription factor expression at the earliest stages of neuronal development likely represents the beginning of an instructive continuum for the establishment of not only neuronal identity, but also development of sub-circuitry regulating different components of motor behaviors. Here, we show that in the MeA, complementary transcription factor expression marks subsets of progenitors and predicts neuronal subtype identity as defined by molecular and electrophysiological signatures. At the molecular level, <italic>Dbx1</italic>-derived and Foxp2+ neurons express different combinations of the sex steroid hormone pathway protein aromatase and estrogen receptor alpha (ERα). At the electrophysiological level, these two populations possess distinct intrinsic electrophysiological profiles. Thus, our study generates a novel cell-specific transcription factor-based means to predict postnatal MeA neuronal identity.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Behavioral activation of <italic>Dbx1</italic>-derived and Foxp2+ neurons</title><p>The central importance of the MeA for processing innate behaviors such as aggression, mating and predator avoidance is well-established (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Dulac and Wagner, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Sokolowski and Corbin, 2012</xref>). Despite this knowledge, the question of which MeA neuronal subtypes encode instinctive behavioral information has only recently begun to be addressed. Recent optogenetic manipulation of the MeA revealed that glutamatergic neurons mediate repetitive self-grooming behaviors while in contrast GABA-ergic neurons regulate either aggressive or mating behaviors, depending on the level of neuronal activity driven by light stimulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Hong et al., 2014</xref>). Moreover, MeA neuronal subclasses expressing different components of the stress response system control appropriate behavioral responses to social cues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Shemesh et al., 2016</xref>). Here, we contribute to the understanding of amygdala cell-specific regulation of behavior by generating a transcription factor based map of MeA subtype responsiveness to innate-behavioral cues. Thus, our findings provide a developmental molecular context in which to further dissect neuronal subtype control of MeA-driven behaviors.</p><p>In addition to playing a central role in processing sensory information required for instinctive behaviors, the MeA is one of the known sexually dimorphic structures of the brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Cooke and Woolley, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">McCarthy and Arnold, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Johnson et al., 2008</xref>). Recent studies employing in vivo recording techniques revealed that a significant number of MeA neurons are dedicated to processing olfactory cues from the opposite sex rather than the same-sex, thus providing a direct demonstration of sex-specific differences in sensory processing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bergan et al., 2014</xref>). However, the identity of MeA neurons in males and females that differentially process olfactory-based sensory information has not been delineated. Here, we reveal that while <italic>Dbx1</italic>-derived and Foxp2+ neurons are broadly activated by mating, aggressive and predator cues, we found stark differences in <italic>Dbx1</italic>-derived, Foxp2+ and OTP+ cell-specific responses in the male and female brain to mating and predator odor cues. A similar sex-specific control of innate behavior has been directly demonstrated in the ventromedial hypothalamus (VMH), where progesterone receptor-expressing neurons while required for male aggressive and mating behaviors, are only required for female mating behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Yang et al., 2013</xref>). Collectively, our studies in combination with previous studies point to a larger picture in which there are neuronal subpopulations in the MeA and VMH that are involved in the regulation of different innate behaviors in a sex-specific manner.</p><p>Although our data do not reveal the neuronal and/or circuit mechanisms underlying our observation of sex-specific subpopulation responses to mating behavior and predator odor presentation, some of our findings do provide potential insight as to how this differential processing may occur. The two most straightforward and non-exclusive potential mechanisms are: 1) with regard to mating, intrinsic differences in <italic>Dbx1</italic>-derived and Foxp2+ neurons and/or 2) subpopulation specific patterns of local and/or long-range connectivity.</p><p>Regarding the first potential mechanism, sex steroid hormones and receptors such as aromatase, ERα and AR have been extensively characterized as critical for the output of distinct components of male and female aggressive and mating behaviors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Yang and Shah, 2014</xref>). For example, deletion of AR resulted in alterations in attack duration during territorial aggression and initiation of male mating (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Juntti et al., 2010</xref>), while ablation of aromatase neurons led to impairments in the production of distinct components of aggression in male and female mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Unger et al., 2015</xref>). Consistent with the critical role that these factors play in components of innate behaviors, we found that aromatase is expressed solely in the <italic>Dbx1-</italic>derived lineage. Across species, aromatase has a masculinizing effect (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Wu et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Balthazart et al., 2011</xref>). Thus, it will be interesting to explore how <italic>Dbx1</italic>-derived aromatase expressing neurons may control male behavioral displays such as mounting and territorial aggression.</p><p>Furthermore, both <italic>Dbx1-</italic>derived and Foxp2+ neurons possess distinct electrophysiological profiles, another potential mechanism to control different components of behaviors. Previous work in both vertebrates and invertebrates has revealed that the timing of AP spiking is directly linked to specific behavioral actions. For example, in vertebrates timescale firing differences are associated with dopamine (DA) release for the determination of reward behaviors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Schultz, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Zhang et al., 2009</xref>). It will therefore prove interesting to explore if and how firing patterns of <italic>Dbx1</italic>-derived and Foxp2+ MeA neurons may control different components of innate behaviors across sexes.</p><p>The second potential and perhaps more intriguing mechanism that may account for <italic>Dbx1</italic>-derived and Foxp2+ subtype specific male versus female patterns of neuronal activation during mating are sex specific local and/or long-range patterns of connectivity. Although currently not yet observed in a brain circuit in mammals, such a mechanism has recently been uncovered in <italic>c. elegans</italic> in which shared male and female circuits show differences in connectivity that is established during wiring (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Oren-Suissa et al., 2016</xref>). Consistent with this, there is some suggestion of sex-specific differences in olfactory-MeA projections in rodents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kang et al., 2011</xref>). Although we did not differentiate according to the sex of the animal, we found differences in both the amplitude and frequency of EPSCs between lineages, indicating differences in the strength and/or number of inputs between <italic>Dbx1</italic>-derived and Foxp2+ MeA neurons. Although the source of input cannot be determined from our analysis, there are direct excitatory inputs to the MeA emanating from the mitral/tufted neurons of the accessory olfactory bulb (AOB) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Martel and Baum, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bergan et al., 2014</xref>). Thus, determination of input/output wiring patterns of male and female <italic>Dbx1</italic>-derived and Foxp2+ MeA neurons will be highly informative.</p><p>In summary, although the precise instructive developmental mechanisms programming innate behaviors remain to be elucidated, we reveal that differential transcription factor expression during development is predictive of neuronal identity based on molecular and electrophysiological criteria and sex-specific patterns of neuronal activation during innate behaviors.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Animals</title><p>Mice were housed in the temperature and light-controlled (12 hr light-dark cycle) Children’s National Medical Center animal care facility and given food and water <italic>ad libitum</italic>.

In each case, the initial models included a cross-products term to assess evidence of effect modification or interaction.

Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and a Senior Editor. The following individuals involved in review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Margaret M McCarthy (Reviewer #1); Dayu Lin (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>The reviewers were enthusiastic about your study linking embryonic patterning of the medial amygdala, neuronal identity and amygdala-directed instinctive behaviors, calling it &quot;exciting&quot; and &quot;elegant&quot;. The study nicely charts the lineage of two distinct cell types that originate in the POA and then populate the medial amygdala, and shows that these cell populations do not overlap, have distinct electrophysiological profiles, and respond to varying degrees in males versus females in tests of aggressive, sexual and fear behavior.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>A major concern of reviewers 2 and 3 is that the quantification of the different populations (Dbx1, OTP, Foxp2) and the modes of representation are confusing. For example, 15% overlap of all 3 markers is unclear, especially if, as reviewer 2 says, 85% OTP cells are neither Foxp2+ nor Dbx1 derived, this reviewer asks why this population seems to be ignored in subsequent electrophysiological and behavioral analyses? Please clarify or defend this decision.</p><p>Similarly, reviewer 2 appreciated that during mating behavior, the Dbx1 population showed increased c-fos expression in males and females but Foxp2 cells increased their c-fos in males only. Are you able to address which populations account for the increase in c-fos in predator behavior in males, and whether these cells could be the OTP cells?</p><p>Reviewer 3 believes that it would be helpful to indicate the percentage of OPT+ and Dbx1+ cells, and the expected overlap by random chance, even though Foxp2+ and OPT+ do seem to be largely non-overlapping as they occupy virtually non-overlapping spatial locations.</p><p>Other comments that could be addressed textually:</p><p>Reviewer 1 requests being mindful of the concept of sex differences (in c-fos expression), but not terming these sexual dimorphisms, even though reviewer 2 speaks of &quot;demonstrate sexually dimorphic activation of specific lineage-derived populations in the medial amygdala&quot;.</p><p>This reviewer also called for citing a previous study on the dissonance between estrogen receptor and ligand, along with different expression of aromatase.</p><p>The reviewers thought that <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref> was too speculative and that Figure 8—figure supplement 1 be used instead.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic></p><p>This is an exciting paper. The authors trace the lineage of two distinct cell types that originate in the POA and then populate the medial amygdala. Both cells are inhibitory but one is derived from the cells that originally expressed the brain development gene Dbx1, while the other expresses the transcription factor Foxp2 throughout life. These cells do not overlap, show distinct electrophysiological profiles and respond to varying degrees in males versus females in tests of aggressive, sexual and fear behavior. The anatomy is exquisite and the execution of the behavioral tests and conclusions reached are well grounded in the data. Only modest changes are needed, mostly in terminology, and a few points for pondering are offered.</p><p>1) The authors make the common and frequent mistake of referring to even a modest sex difference as a sexual dimorphism. It may seem like semantics but the term sexual dimorphism should be reserved for those sex differences which involve two (di-) forms (morphs). At this point, what the authors have discovered is a sex difference in c-fos expression, not a sex dimorphism. This is no less interesting. I suggest the authors comb through the manuscript and at each point where they have used the term sexual dimorphism ask if sex difference would serve the same purpose.</p><p>2) The authors also report a fascinating difference in the cellular distribution of aromatase, with about half of Dbx- lineage cells expressing it but Foxp2 cells not at all. There were no cell lineage effects observed for AR or ER. This is consistent with the notion that sexual differentiation of the brain is mediated by a sex difference in ligand, i.e. estradiol, and not by the amount or cellular localization of the receptor. The functional significance of having aromatase in some cells that express ER and others that do not is unknown but the authors might consult work on the Japanese quail brain and the analogous POA (POM) where a similar circumstance is found.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>Lischinsky et al. present an elegant story in which they demonstrate sexually dimorphic activation of specific lineage-derived populations in the medial amygdala. Their data are clear and approach logical, and the results are exciting. A couple of major concerns are detailed below.</p><p>1) The text is difficult to follow in some important places. For example, looking at <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>, and the imprecise text associated with it (&quot;generally distinct,&quot;, subsection “Dbx1 and Foxp2 expression segregates embryonic and postnatal MeA subpopulations”) one does not immediately grasp whether there are three populations (Foxp2, OTP, and Dbx derived) or two. The graph in f is very confusing- the X axis appears to be the fraction of OTP cells that are Dbx1 derived, plotted against% colocalization with Foxp2, which indicates a 15% overlap of all 3 markers but surely there's an easier way to present this.</p><p>This becomes important because if 85% OTP cells are neither Foxp2+ nor Dbx1 derived, then why do the authors ignore this population in their subsequent electrophysiological and behavioural analysis? The study seems incomplete given the presence of this population. If the authors provide an explanation for why they do not examine this population further, that would be sufficient, but it needs to be well justified.</p><p>2) The examination of which population is active in different behaviors is beautifully done and the most interesting part of the paper. During mating behavior, c-fos increased in the Dbx1 derived population in both males and females, but in the Foxp2 population, c-fos increase was seen only in males. This is a key result. In predator avoidance, however, the results are puzzling. On the one hand, both males and females show an increased c-fos expression in the MeA. Yet when the Dbx1 derived and Foxp2+ population was examined, it showed an increase only in females and not in males. The authors do not examine which cells account for the c-fos increase in males. Could this perhaps be the OTP population (point 1).</p><p>3) The schematic in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8A</xref> is highly speculative and goes beyond the data. The schematic seeks to imply that Foxp2+ neurons participate in mounting behaviour, which females do not display, which perhaps explains why this population appears silent during mating in females. This is needlessly speculative- such a hypothesis would need to be examined very carefully and I suggest the schematic be eliminated. In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8B</xref>, the authors suggest a sexually dimorphic connectivity such that Foxp2+ neurons are inhibited only in females but not in males. There is no evidence in support of this either. I suggest instead that the summary schematic in Figure 8—figure supplement 1 should be used as <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>, it helps the reader.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic></p><p>In Lischinsky et.al. study, the authors identified two nearly exclusive populations in the MeA. One is Dbx1 derived as previously described and the other is Foxp2 derived. These two populations are distinctive at both embryonic and adult stage and have differential electrophysiological properties. The authors also investigated the Fos induction pattern after various social behaviors and concluded that the Foxp2 population is involved in only male mating not female mating, while aggression, predator odor induced similar responses in Dbx-1 and Foxp2 derived cells in both males and females.</p><p>The study is overall well performed. The finding is novel and interesting. The developmental origin of diverse MeA cells is poorly understood. This paper represents an important addition to our knowledge. However, the cell counting analysis is incomplete and the images could be improved. As a result, some important information might be missed in the current paper.</p><p>1) When understanding the overlap between two types of cells, the absolute number is not very informative. The percentage of cells of double labeled cells over single labeled cells provides some understanding of the overlap but it does not address the real question – are the two populations under investigation preferentially overlapped or not? For example, imagine that Dxb1 population accounts for 50% of the total number of cells and the Esr1 accounts for 50% of the total number of cells, if the double labeled cell is 25% of Dbx1 cells, then the Esr1+ cells are preferentially not derived from the Dbx1 cells. However, if Esr1 account for 10% of the total population, then the Esr1 is preferentially derived from the Dbx1 cells. Without knowing the percentage of the Esr1 cells, it is unclear what the 25% overlap actually means. Thus, throughout the paper, the authors should include information regarding the percentage of cells labeled by gene1, the percentage of cells labeled by gene 2 and the percentage of double labeled cells. Whether the two genes are preferentially labeled or not could be calculated as double%/(Gene1% xGene2%). A value over 1 means that the two genes are preferentially overlapped and a value below one will mean the opposite. With multiple animals, it can be calculated whether the preferential (or non-preferential) overlap is statistically significant or not.</p><p>2) While the authors analyzed the sexually dimorphic involvement of the Dbx1 and Foxp2 cells in social behaviors, the basic characterization of the Dbx1 and Foxp2 cells in males and females is lacking. Does the percentage or the absolute number of Dbx1 or Foxp2 cells differ between sexes?</p><p>3) Regarding the overlapping of the Dbx1/Foxp2 with behavior induced Fos, there are several questions that could be readily addressed with the data. First, is the Dbx1 or Foxp2 cells preferentially/non-preferentially activated by the behavior (e.g. aggression)? For example, in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5G</xref>, the number of Dbx-1 cells expressing aggression induced Fos appears to be quite low. It is about 5% of the total Fos cells based on the graph. Although the Dbx1% is not reported, based on <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>, it appears to be quite dense, probably over 20% of the total cells. If so, the Dbx1 cells seem to be preferentially not activated during aggression. This should be analyzed and addressed. Second, to address whether the overlap between the Dbx1/Foxp2 and Fos is sexually dimorphic or not, it is better to compare the value of double%/(Gene1% xGene2%) rather than the double%. The double% is less informative as this value will be affected by the Fos% and the Dbx1% or FoxP2%. If Fos% is sexually dimorphic to begin with, it does not mean much if the double% differs between sexes.</p><p>4) Given the different number of Fos cells in Foxp2 and Dbx1 populations (e.g. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5G and K</xref>), it is likely that the distribution of Fos is biased topographically in the MeA. It will be helpful to present large view images of the Fos induction patterns. This will help the readers to understand potential reasons for overlap/non-overlap.</p><p>5) The statistics in the paper should be double checked or the number of animals needs to be increased to provide sufficient statistical power. For example, in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4G</xref>, there is a strong trend (if not yet significant) that the co-labeled% in female Dbx-1 population is higher than the rest of the groups. If one perform a t-test between the male and female Esr1 and Dbx1 double labeled%, it should be significant given that there is no overlap in values and the variability is not huge.</p><p>6) Lastly, the authors should provide the Figure number in each figure file to facilitate the review process.</p><p>Overall, this is a good study with interesting findings. However, the results can be better analyzed to better understand the potential molecular features and behavioral relevance of Dbx1 and FoxP MeA cells.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were requested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for resubmitting your work entitled &quot;Embryonic transcription factor expression in mice predicts medial amygdala neuronal identity and sex-specific responses to innate behavioral cues&quot; for further consideration at <italic>eLife</italic>. Your revised article has been favorably evaluated by a Senior Editor, a Reviewing Editor, and one reviewer. The second reviewer had added comments that were in agreement with the reviewer 1.</p><p>You have done an excellent job of responding to the reviews of your revised manuscript with added additional data and new analyses. The study indeed contributes to an understanding of the developmental logic for processing of innate behaviors by different MeA neuronal subtypes. However, there are some remaining issues that need to be addressed before acceptance, as outlined below:</p><p>1) You changed the statistical tests in new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>:</p><p>You state in response to Reviewer #3 Critique #5, that some groups in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref> looked significantly different, but no such difference was detected by ANOVA, and then you proceeded to conduct 2-tailed t-tests. The reviewers believe that there is no justification for this approach, as one of the recurrent themes of the manuscript is the presence and absence of sex differences. Neither can be concluded when males and females are analyzed separately, only within sex comparisons can be made. In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4G</xref> the bars indicate a significant difference between males and females but this panel alone involves at least 3 t-tests, which is an inappropriate use of multiple comparisons without correction. This is true for most of the data in this figure, and perhaps others. The appropriate analysis is an ANOVA with sex as a factor and only when there is either a main effect of sex or a sex by other factor interaction can post-hoc tests be done.</p><p>Further, for use of one way ANOVA, the data need to be normally distributed and exclude outliers. One outlier can throw off the statistics and provide a false negative. While pairwise comparison should not be done without finding significance in ANOVA, it is essential to check whether ANOVA is correctly used here.</p><p>Given the very small n's in some of these endpoints, which is understandable given the labor intensiveness of the co-localization analyses, it is imperative that correct statistics are conducted. In this instance it is probably better to miss a sex difference or effect than it is to incorrectly claim one based on a small n and inappropriate statistics.

For example, 15% overlap of all 3 markers is unclear, especially if, as reviewer 2 says, 85% OTP cells are neither Foxp2+ nor Dbx1 derived, this reviewer asks why this population seems to be ignored in subsequent electrophysiological and behavioral analyses? Please clarify or defend this decision.</italic></p><p>In previous <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>, we mislabeled the y-axis, which lead to some confusion. The axes are now correctly labeled (revised <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>).</p><p>Our focus was on Dbx1-derived and Foxp2+ subpopulations primarily due to our observations that both populations mark the POA, the telencephalic niche that we were most interested in studying.</p><p>Additionally, the availability of both <italic>Dbx1<sup>cre</sup></italic> and <italic>Foxp2<sup>cre</sup></italic> mice greatly facilitated our technical ability to conduct patch clamp recordings specifically in these two populations. To our knowledge, OTPcre mice have yet to be generated. However, the reviewers raise an interesting and important point that the OTP population may be of interest. To further investigate the identity of these neurons, following the reviewers’ input we conducted a number of new experiments:</p><p>1) To examine in greater detail the potential overlap with the OTP+ population and the Dbx1-derived and Foxp2+ populations we conducted a new series of double and triple immuno-labeling at postnatal stages. We found that Dbx1-derived and Foxp2+ populations were generally not overlapping with the OTP+ cells. This new data is shown in new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>.</p><p>2) We further conducted a series of double immuno-labeling experiments with a series of cell subtype markers to examine the identity of OTP+ cells. Previous published analyses (Garcia-Moreno et al. Nature Neuroscience, 2010) suggested that a subpopulation of OTP neurons may be excitatory. However, this analysis was cursory and done at embryonic stages. Therefore, to assess the identity of this population in more detail, we performed double immuno-staining with OTP and: YFP+ (in <italic>Emx1<sup>cre</sup>;RYFP</italic> mice which mark excitatory neurons), CAMKIIα (excitatory neurons), calbindin (inhibitory neurons) and somatostatin (inhibitory neurons). From these new analyses, we found that the majority of OTP+ neurons are inhibitory. This new data is shown in new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>.</p><p><italic>Similarly, reviewer 2 appreciated that during mating behavior, the Dbx1 population showed increased c-fos expression in males and females but Foxp2 cells increased their c-fos in males only. Are you able to address which populations account for the increase in c-fos in predator behavior in males, and whether these cells could be the OTP cells?</italic></p><p>The reviewers also raised an interesting question as to whether the OTP+ population is the missing population that responds to predator odor in males and whether we could conduct an electrophysiological analyses on these cells.</p><p>1) As to the best of our knowledge, there is no OTPcre or OTP reporter mouse line currently available which would have greatly facilitated our ability to identify and patch clamp these neurons as OTP+ cells in the adult MeA represents a very small population.</p><p>2) To address the behavioral question, we conducted new experiments to evaluate whether the OTP+ population was activated (c-fos+) during male and female predator exposure behavioral assays. We found that while there were significantly more OTP+/c-fos+ cells during male predator odor exposure as compared to control, when comparing the percent of male OTP+ cells that were activated (c-fos+) we did not observe significant differences between benign and predator avoidance conditions. However, when analyzing activation in female brains, we found an increase in the number of OTP+ cells activated as well as an increase in the percent of OTP+ cells activated vs benign. Therefore, OTP+ cells are being activated in the female MeA; nonetheless, the male predator odor activated population remains to be elucidated. This new behavioral data is shown in new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1</xref>.</p><p><italic>Reviewer 3 believes that it would be helpful to indicate the percentage of OPT+ and Dbx1+ cells, and the expected overlap by random chance, even though Foxp2+ and OPT+ do seem to be largely non-overlapping as they occupy virtually non-overlapping spatial locations.</italic></p><p>Embryonically, OTP+ cells are segregated from the Dbx1-derived and Foxp2+ populations. This segregation generally persists into adulthood with overlap of the OTP+ population of approximately 3-5% of Dbx1-derived or Foxp2+ cells (new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>). Therefore, as there was almost no-colocalization, we did not consider that there is any possibility of co-localization by random chance.</p><p><italic>Other comments that could be addressed textually:</italic> </p><p><italic>Reviewer 1 requests being mindful of the concept of sex differences (in c-fos expression), but not terming these sexual dimorphisms, even though reviewer 2 speaks of &quot;demonstrate sexually dimorphic activation of specific lineage-derived populations in the medial amygdala&quot;.</italic></p><p><italic>This reviewer also called for citing a previous study on the dissonance between estrogen receptor and ligand, along with different expression of aromatase.</italic></p><p><italic>The reviewers thought that <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref> was too speculative and that Figure 8—figure supplement 1 be used instead.</italic></p><p>We thank the reviewer for pointing out our misuse of the term sexual dimorphism. As suggested, we have replaced it with the term ‘sex-differences’. In addition, as suggested, we have now included a citation of a review of the studies of the Japanese quail brain (Balthazart et al., Front Endocrinology, 2011) and integrated a brief conceptual understanding of this topic into the Discussion section. Furthermore, as suggested, we have removed the overly speculative <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref> and replaced it with the previous supplementary summary schematic, which is also now updated to include the new OTP predator odor data.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic></p><p><italic>[…]</italic></p><p><italic>1) When understanding the overlap between two types of cells, the absolute number is not very informative. The percentage of cells of double labeled cells over single labeled cells provides some understanding of the overlap but it does not address the real question – are the two populations under investigation preferentially overlapped or not? For example, imagine that Dxb1 population accounts for 50% of the total number of cells and the Esr1 accounts for 50% of the total number of cells, if the double labeled cell is 25% of Dbx1 cells, then the Esr1+ cells are preferentially not derived from the Dbx1 cells. However, if Esr1 account for 10% of the total population, then the Esr1 is preferentially derived from the Dbx1 cells. Without knowing the percentage of the Esr1 cells, it is unclear what the 25% overlap actually means. Thus, throughout the paper, the authors should include information regarding the percentage of cells labeled by gene1, the percentage of cells labeled by gene 2 and the percentage of double labeled cells. Whether the two genes are preferentially labeled or not could be calculated as double%/(Gene1% xGene2%). A value over 1 means that the two genes are preferentially overlapped and a value below one will mean the opposite. With multiple animals, it can be calculated whether the preferential (or non-preferential) overlap is statistically significant or not.</italic></p><p>We now provide new data showing the percent contribution of the Dbx1-derived and Foxp2+ cells to each sex steroid pathway marker (ERα, Aromatase, AR) (new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2</xref>). We have also now conducted the analysis showing the percent contribution of OTP+ population to the percent total of the Dbx1-derived and Foxp2+ populations (revised <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>).</p><p><italic>2) While the authors analyzed the sexually dimorphic involvement of the Dbx1 and Foxp2 cells in social behaviors, the basic characterization of the Dbx1 and Foxp2 cells in males and females is lacking. Does the percentage or the absolute number of Dbx1 or Foxp2 cells differ between sexes?</italic></p><p>We have performed non-stereological analysis of the number of Dbx1-derived and Foxp2+ cells in the MePD and MePV and we did not observe any significant changes in the absolute number of cells between the populations. However, a conclusion as to whether these cells are indeed different between sexes would require a much more rigorous stereological analysis, therefore at this stage we would prefer not to comment in the manuscript on any potential differences, or lack of differences.</p><p><italic>3) Regarding the overlapping of the Dbx1/Foxp2 with behavior induced Fos, there are several questions that could be readily addressed with the data. First, is the Dbx1 or Foxp2 cells preferentially/non-preferentially activated by the behavior (e.g. aggression)? For example, in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5G</xref>, the number of Dbx-1 cells expressing aggression induced Fos appears to be quite low. It is about 5% of the total Fos cells based on the graph. Although the Dbx1% is not reported, based on <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>, it appears to be quite dense, probably over 20% of the total cells. If so, the Dbx1 cells seem to be preferentially not activated during aggression. This should be analyzed and addressed. Second, to address whether the overlap between the Dbx1/Foxp2 and Fos is sexually dimorphic or not, it is better to compare the value of double%/(Gene1% xGene2%) rather than the double%. The double% is less informative as this value will be affected by the Fos% and the Dbx1% or Foxp2%. If Fos% is sexually dimorphic to begin with, it does not mean much if the double% differs between sexes.</italic></p><p>We have now performed additional analysis by assessing the percent of Dbx1-derived or Foxp2+ cells that were activated (c-fos+) during aggressive, mating and predator avoidance behaviors and comparing to their respective controls. This new analyses is shown in revised <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figures 5</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">7</xref>. This data is supportive of and strengthens our original findings with regard to numbers of cells activated in mating and aggression, but suggests a more complex interpretation with regard to predator odor, results of which are discussed in the revised Discussion.</p><p><italic>4) Given the different number of Fos cells in Foxp2 and Dbx1 populations (e.g. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5G and K</xref>), it is likely that the distribution of Fos is biased topographically in the MeA. It will be helpful to present large view images of the Fos induction patterns. This will help the readers to understand potential reasons for overlap/non-overlap.</italic></p><p>Images of the c-fos induction pattern are now present in new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>.</p><p><italic>5) The statistics in the paper should be double checked or the number of animals needs to be increased to provide sufficient statistical power. For example, in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4G</xref>, there is a strong trend (if not yet significant) that the co-labeled% in female Dbx-1 population is higher than the rest of the groups. If one perform a t-test between the male and female Esr1 and Dbx1 double labeled%, it should be significant given that there is no overlap in values and the variability is not huge.</italic></p><p>We previously used ANOVA for the statistical analysis of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref> to account for multiple group comparisons. As per the reviewer’s suggestions, we have performed t-tests instead and changes are now reflected in revised <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref> and changes made to the Materials and methods to reflect this revised analysis.</p><p><italic>6) Lastly, the authors should provide the Figure number in each figure file to facilitate the review process.</italic></p><p>The figure numbers have been included in every figure.</p><p><italic>Overall, this is a good study with interesting findings. However, the results can be better analyzed to better understand the potential molecular features and behavioral relevance of Dbx1 and FoxP MeA cells.</italic></p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were requested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p><italic>You have done an excellent job of responding to the reviews of your revised manuscript with added additional data and new analyses. The study indeed contributes to an understanding of the developmental logic for processing of innate behaviors by different MeA neuronal subtypes. However, there are some remaining issues that need to be addressed before acceptance, as outlined below:</italic></p><p><italic>1) You changed the statistical tests in new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>:</italic></p><p><italic>You state in response to Reviewer #3 Critique #5, that some groups in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref> looked significantly different, but no such difference was detected by ANOVA, and then you proceeded to conduct 2-tailed t-tests. The reviewers believe that there is no justification for this approach, as one of the recurrent themes of the manuscript is the presence and absence of sex differences. Neither can be concluded when males and females are analyzed separately, only within sex comparisons can be made. In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4G</xref> the bars indicate a significant difference between males and females but this panel alone involves at least 3 t-tests, which is an inappropriate use of multiple comparisons without correction. This is true for most of the data in this figure, and perhaps others. The appropriate analysis is an ANOVA with sex as a factor and only when there is either a main effect of sex or a sex by other factor interaction can post-hoc tests be done.</italic></p><p><italic>Further, for use of one way ANOVA, the data need to be normally distributed and exclude outliers. One outlier can throw off the statistics and provide a false negative. While pairwise comparison should not be done without finding significance in ANOVA, it is essential to check whether ANOVA is correctly used here.</italic></p><p><italic>Given the very small n's in some of these endpoints, which is understandable given the labor intensiveness of the co-localization analyses, it is imperative that correct statistics are conducted. In this instance it is probably better to miss a sex difference or effect than it is to incorrectly claim one based on a small n and inappropriate statistics. We thus encourage you to seek advice from someone well-versed in statistical analysis to help you work through this, report back to us, and revise the manuscript accordingly.</italic></p><p>We have consulted with our in-house director of the DC-IDDRC Biostatistics Core. In our reanalysis, we now first determined whether the data was normally distributed by performing the Shapiro-Wilk test for normality and we also excluded outliers (any data points two standard deviations away from the mean). For <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4G, U</xref>, we now performed a two-way ANOVA with interaction for sex and neuronal subpopulation for data that was normally distributed. If there was a main effect or an interaction for sex, then we performed multiple comparisons. If data was not normally distributed, we performed a non-parametric test, in this case a quantile regression analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4N</xref>). For <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2</xref>, we also checked for normal distribution and performed a two-way ANOVA for normally distributed data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2A, B</xref>) or a quantile regression analysis for non-normally distributed data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2C</xref>). A detailed description of the models used for the data analysis of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2</xref> can be found in the Materials and methods section. In addition, for <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figures 5</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">6</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">7</xref> we also performed the Shapiro-Wilk test to determine normality. For data normally distributed we performed an unpaired t-test or a one-way ANOVA followed by Tukey’s post-hoc and for data that was not normally distributed we performed either the Mann-Whitney test (data with two groups) or the Krustal-Wallis analysis followed by Dunn’s corrections (data with 3 groups). Details of the new statistical analyses are described in the respective revised Figure legends and the Materials and methods sections.</p><p>This new analyses revealed the following differences from our previous analyses:</p><p>1) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4G, U</xref>: We now find that there are no sex-specific differences in the total <italic>Dbx1-</italic>derived subpopulation expressing estrogen receptor α. Also, we do now find sex-specific differences in the expression of androgen receptor in the <italic>Dbx1-</italic>derived subpopulation.</p><p>2) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2C</xref>: Related, we now find sex-specific differences in the co-expression of <italic>Dbx1-</italic>derived cells with androgen receptor, over the total androgen receptor subpopulation, consistent with the above finding in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4U</xref>.</p><p>3) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5S, Y</xref>: no statistically significant difference is now found between one of the controls (“no pups” condition) and maternal aggression (in the previous version this was significant). Importantly, statistically significant differences remain between all naïve controls and experimental conditions in both sexes.</p><p>4) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7G</xref>: no statistically significant difference is now found between the number of cfos+;<italic>Dbx1</italic>- derived cells during predator odor exposure compared to benign control. In our previous and current analyses we did not find any significant difference between the percentage of cfos+;<italic>Dbx1</italic>-derived cells/cfos+ cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7M</xref>).
